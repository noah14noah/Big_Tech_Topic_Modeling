(Contrary to popular myth, the law did not restrict providers' ability to moderate content, and former U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-CA), who introduced the provision, intended it to allow moderation of internet materials without fear of incurring other legal exposure.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Other conservatives and arch-progressives, most prominently Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), seek to \"break up\" these companies and harshly regulate them. But a curious item from Warren's campaign finance records should stand as a blaring warning siren to those conservatives who hope that aggressive government action will get them a more favorable footing with social media companies. The Wall Street Journal reports:</p><p>No other candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has been as eager to call for the breakup of Google as Sen. Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>Yet employees at Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., so far have made up the largest source of higher-dollar donations to the Massachusetts senator's campaign.</p><p>This is of a pace with Google and Alphabet's conduct in the legislative swamp: In 2018, Alphabet spent $21.7 million lobbying$21.2 million on behalf of Google, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Facebook threw in another $12.6 million chasing government favors.</p><p>With this backdrop, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's calls for \"a more active role for governments and regulators\" including in \"deciding what counts as terrorist propaganda, hate speech and more\" make complete sense. With teams of lobbyists backed by millions in funding, Facebook (and Google) expect to have an intimate role in writing the very regulations to which the government will hold them accountable.</p><p>Suppose the \"wartime conservatives\" who want Section 230 scrapped get their way. Is the likeliest outcome some legislation holding that \"platform access is a civil right\"? Not at all, regardless of whether Republican or Democratic politicians control Washington. Far more likely is the usual Washington swamp mess, a product of well-paid and well-connected lobbyists for the regulated industry all-but-drafting (or even actually drafting) major legislation that would strengthen their market share.</p><p>Consider the European experience. In 2018, the European Union adopted its major \"big tech\" regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. And what were the consequences, six months into GDPR? Why, Google and Facebookwith their armies of compliance officials and the ability to disperse costs on international operationssaw their control of the European markets strengthen.</p><p>The unlikelihood of successful government intervention (conservatives once assumed government intervention would be unsuccessful, but that is beside the point) does not, of course, mean that the present courses that Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the like are adopting for content moderation are ideal. But Washington cannot make it that way; only user demand can do that. Platforms must be convinced that the financial costs of over-aggressive content moderation are too high in order for them to stop. Winning a cultural argument is difficult, leading many to seek instead a wave of the government's hand. The result of such action would not only be to toss aside principle; Washington's very nature ensures that the consequences would be like following the Sirens onto the rocks.</p><p>Michael Watson</p><p>Michael is Research Director for Capital Research Center and serves as the managing editor for InfluenceWatch.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123046492</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGR-9C31-DYTH-G1KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Gen. Xavier Becerra declined to say why he declined to join the chief law enforcement officers of 48 other states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, in examining the Mountain View-based internet giant's dominance in online advertising. Alabama is the only other state not participating in the probe, announced Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Seeing as Becerra's office has one of the most robust and aggressive antitrust teams in the country and his domain includes many of the largest tech firms, experts say it's perplexing that he elected not to take part.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I just do not understand why California is not a part of this effort,\" said John Simpson, who served as the privacy and technology project director at Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy organization, until he retired earlier this year. \"Google has monopolized the market and really needs to be held accountable for that.\"</p><p>It's surprising, he said, because the state has been a part of so many similar joint efforts in the past. \"I'm completely at a loss to explain why this is happening.\"</p><p>For so many states to act in concert presents a \"fairly powerful gesture,\" said William Kovacic, professor of law at George Washington University and former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission under President George W. Bush.</p><p>\"You can think of a sports team that's witnessed the injury of a significant team member,\" Kovacic said. \"It's still a great team but you'd like one of your stars to be present.\"</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's nearly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services.</p><p>Monday's announcement of the Google probe, led by Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton, trailed an announcement Friday by New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James that the attorneys general of eight states as well as the District of Columbia had begun a bipartisan antitrust investigation of Facebook over the company's control of personal data and privacy lapses.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting its own antitrust inquiry into Big Tech, and the FTC is taking a fresh look at anticompetitive behavior by Facebook and other companies. The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is also holding hearings. But Monday's move by the states suggested those efforts may not be enough to satisfy those who believe the biggest internet companies are abusing their power.</p><p>\"I think the states have sort of lost their patience\" with the federal government, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute. \"They've realized the administration might make some noises, but aren't expecting any meaningful action. They believe they have to act or nobody will act against Facebook or Google.\"</p><p>As states go, California and Alabama have little in common, and the same goes for their attorneys general. Becerra is a Democrat in a blue state with big urban centers; Alabama Atty. Gen. Steve Marshall is a Republican in one of the reddest states.</p><p>A spokeswoman from Marshall's office declined to comment on the decision-making process for Alabama. \"California remains deeply concerned and committed to fighting anticompetitive behavior,\" a spokesperson for Becerra said in declining to comment on the investigation.</p><p>Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham (R-Templeton) called California's non-involvement \"embarrassing,\" in a statement Monday. \"California deserves to be at the table,\" he said.</p><p>Cunningham is one of four California Assembly Republicans who introduced a resolution encouraging Becerra and Congress to take aim at Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon last week.</p><p>As a candidate for the House of Representatives, Becerra was the recipient of considerable largess from Google. From 2010 through 2016, Becerra's campaign received $23,000 from Google's corporate political action committee, Google Inc. NetPAC, according to Federal Election Committee records. Two Google executives donated $2,600 and $5,300, respectively, to Becerra's campaigns over that span.</p><p>But Becerra's office has voiced support for cracking down on Big Tech. As California unrolls its Consumer Privacy Act, a far-reaching law that will put strict rules on how tech companies handle and collect user data when it goes into effect in January, Becerra called on the state Legislature to strengthen it. He and a group of privacy advocates wanted to strengthen it by adding a provision giving consumers the opportunity to sue if, for example, a company ignores a person's demand to opt out of data collection.</p><p>Plus, Becerra's office has not shied away from challenging powerful institutions, suing the Trump administration more than 50 times.</p><p>Kovacic speculated the decision came from even higher in the state's political hierarchy than Becerra's office.</p><p>\"Why would they sit on the sidelines? It's curious to see them take a walk on this one. We have to assume this was a political decision,\" he said.</p><p>Weighing the possible effect of the states' inquiry, Vaheesan pointed to the antitrust charge against Microsoft in 1998. In the early 2000s, the Bush administration wanted to settle for a few tweaks to Microsoft's conduct. The states pushed for more aggressive structural remedies.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs. \"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone -- translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.\"</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned with the company's influence not just on ordinary internet users but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'Well, Google is dominant because they're good,' \" said Jen King, the director of consumer privacy at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to EMarketer estimates, far surpassing second-place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes -- because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>--</p><p>Times staff writer Samantha Masunaga and the Associated Press contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: ATTYS.

Daly, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for that kind introduction, Ravi, and for being the gracious host of this year's symposium.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco have partnered on this event for the past several years. But this is my first time making the trip to Singapore and I'm really excited to be here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, before I begin, I have to give the standard disclaimer: the remarks I'm about to deliver are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Navigating headwinds</p><p>Banking for the common good. It's a natural evolution of the conversations we've been having at this event, and many like it, for the past several years.</p><p>Being more customer-focused using finance to create inclusive growth understanding the role that organizational culture plays in all of it these are hot topics for both the financial services industry and regulatory institutions.1 And progress has been made.2</p><p>Yet consumers remain wary even a little skeptical of financial firms. I've got a front row seat for this in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are a lot of people willing to turn to Big Tech and away from Big Banks when it comes to managing their finances. A study last year found that 58 percent of Americans would be willing to move their banking to non-traditional financial companies like Amazon or Google.3</p><p>And it makes sense. Banks are still repairing the breach of trust caused by the global financial crisis. Repeated scandals showed that banks weren't always good actors. Poor corporate culture and profit-first practices created significant consequences for consumers.4 People lost homes, retirement savings, college funds a sense of security. It left deep scars.</p><p>Since then, much-needed regulations have improved the resiliency of the financial system, making future crises less likely. This has helped boost confidence in the industry.</p><p>But the world didn't stand still while banks worked to recover their credibility with the public. Technology-based competitors emerged with customer-centric approaches to finance.</p><p>They offered targeted products, tailor-made to serve the needs of a diverse customer base. They worked to keep costs low, and efficiency and convenience high. Notably, these firms also talked about the broader good, and how their business models help promote a better future.5</p><p>Putting these things together, traditional financial institutions are facing some pretty strong headwinds. And they're headwinds that can't be addressed through regulatory guardrails alone.</p><p>So what can be done?</p><p>Here's my view: banks large and small need to become owners. Owners who are committed to and accountable for doing right by their customers and their communities.</p><p>You might be thinking that sounds like a lot. Or maybe that it's even too high of a standard. But speaking from experience, I can tell you: it is possible.</p><p>Becoming owners</p><p>The Federal Reserve System faced its own challenges in the wake of the financial crisis. Public trust in our institution plummeted, and it's been slow to come back.6 And like private-sector firms, we face an ever-changing landscape, and a highly competitive environment for the best ideas and talent. This was especially true at our Bank, with its proximity to Silicon Valley.</p><p>So about four years ago, the San Francisco Fed decided to take a hard look at our own organization. What was working? What wasn't? Our culture soon emerged as one of the biggest areas in need of improvement. So we decided to change it.</p><p>We started with the basics. We focused not only on what employees do, but also how they do it. And we emphasized skills and behaviors that would enable our best work things like collaboration, emotional intelligence, influence, and critical thinking.</p><p>This was our starting point our foundation. But something was still missing.</p><p>To really get to the next level, it became clear we needed to do more. We needed to become owners. Ready to hold ourselves accountable to our mission, vision, and values no excuses. Prepared to trust our employees to do the right thing even when no one is watching, and even when there isn't a detailed rulebook to follow.</p><p>This transition to a culture of owners hasn't been easy. And we're far from done. But embracing this mindset has changed us and for the better. So I want to share with you what we've learned.</p><p>Defining your values</p><p>The first step in becoming an owner is defining your values. What do you believe in? How will you go about achieving your mission and vision?</p><p>At the Federal Reserve, we're tasked with a dual mandate promoting full employment and price stability. We also support safe and sound banking and payment systems. That's our mission.</p><p>At the San Francisco Fed, we want to be the best in public service. That's our vision.</p><p>Our values are something different but equally important.</p><p>They're spelled out on a banner that greets every person who walks into our lobby each day. It says: \"Our work touches every American and countless global citizens.\"</p><p>That's our core value service. Service to the people and the communities we represent. That's the reason we show up to work every day. That's our touchstone.</p><p>Building trust</p><p>Defining your values is essential. But it's only the beginning of building a culture of ownership.</p><p>To give values life, and make them real for every individual you work with, you have to take action. And those actions have to be rooted in trust the trust that your people will act in the interest of others and the organization.</p><p>Let me give you an example. This is what the San Francisco Fed's employee handbook used to look like. It was created with the best of intentions: to help people become successful members of our team. But what it turned into is pretty intimidating.</p><p>It's heavy. It has a lot of rules. Worst of all, it sends the message that we need to micro-manage and monitor the very people we're counting on to be our ambassadors our employees.</p><p>This is the opposite of trust.</p><p>So we threw the whole thing out.</p><p>Here's the new one. Big difference. I can carry it around with me, for one thing.</p><p>Gone are the lists of dos and don'ts. In their place is a new mindset one that defaults to the positive. It describes our values, and calls on employees to uphold them using their best judgment. Most importantly, the new handbook moves away from solving for potential bad behavior, and instead emphasizes the expectation of good behavior.</p><p>We followed the new handbook with more radical moves. We told people they could \"dress for their day,\" and \"flex for their day,\" and \"stop doing it\" if certain processes no longer added value.</p><p>Not surprisingly, all these changes caused some heartburn. You might be thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if people take advantage? What if we can no longer get our work done?</p><p>I get it. Conducting business this way requires a lot of trust at every level of the organization. And people are going to bump into each other as they figure things out.</p><p>So it's important to have a plan in place for mitigating those conflicts. Part of this can be achieved by simply acknowledging that growing pains are a natural part of the process.</p><p>But it's equally important for leaders to model how situations should be evaluated when judgment rather than a rule book is the deciding factor. Employees take their cues from the top, especially during times of change.</p><p>So it's essential for all of us to hold ourselves accountable to the values we've defined, even if it's uncomfortable or unpopular in the short term.</p><p>If you're willing to do this, I know you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Living without a detailed rulebook is possible if you've defined the right values, and empowered employees to act in the best interest of your organization and its customers.</p><p>They'll do the right thing even if no one is watching, and even when they face uncharted territory.</p><p>Committing to a growth mindset</p><p>So once you've defined your values, and built an environment of trust, how do you keep growing? How do you stay agile?</p><p>There are two essential ingredients for success: diversity of thought, and inclusion of ideas.</p><p>Now, I'm not talking about optical diversity, where you simply set the table with people who look different. I mean true diversity, where you encourage new ideas and differences of opinion, and include them equally in the discussion.</p><p>Put simply: listening to a wide variety of viewpoints produces better outcomes. It ensures you're considering all angles. And it makes you aware of issues and problems that aren't even on your radar.</p><p>I've found this particularly valuable as a new leader.</p><p>I'm naturally a fast talker. I love nothing more than batting ideas back and forth like a ping pong ball. I'll get excited, interrupt, draw on a whiteboard it's an event, a brainstorming mania.</p><p>But I recently had an epiphany. Not everyone is like me. And in my excitement to jump in first, I was crowding out lots of other good ideas. I was inadvertently pushing people onto the sidelines.</p><p>So I started writing notes to myself, reminding me to slow down. I've worked harder to include more introverted voices, or remote employees who find it difficult to interject on the phone. And I've told others around me to hold me accountable to this goal.</p><p>It's a work in progress. But I'm happy to report that a number of quieter voices have emerged and become valuable contributors at my table. And they're helping to transform our organization.</p><p>Making the business case</p><p>This is what's working for us at the San Francisco Fed.</p><p>But you may be thinking: Sure, this sounds great for a public service organization. Your job is to pursue the common good. How would this work in the private sector, at a profit-making bank?</p><p>And I'd like to answer that question with two stories.</p><p>The CEO of the online retailer Zappos once wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review to explain how his company had earned its reputation for delivering best-in-class customer service.7 And he told a story about a woman who called in after forgetting to mail back a pair of shoes she'd planned to return. There'd been a death in her family. So the Zappos rep sent her flowers.</p><p>That's the kind of thing that's possible when employees are empowered to act as ambassadors for your values. Yes, that phone rep may have spent $50 to do the right thing but as the CEO himself said: \"now she's a customer for life.\"</p><p>This works for shoes. And I can tell you from personal experience that it also works for banks.</p><p>When I was 16 years old, I needed a checking account. I was working full-time and needed to pay rent and utilities and they only took checks.</p><p>So I found myself at a bank in Ballwin, Missouri, where I grew up. And when I talked to the new accounts clerk, I found out that minors couldn't open an account without a parent's signature bank policy.</p><p>But both of my parents were out of the picture. When I explained my situation to the clerk, she decided to take a chance.</p><p>She opened my account. Helped me fill out the deposit form, and select my checks. She even took a few minutes to explain the basics of banking, so I could avoid any overdrafts and fees.</p><p>She wasn't a manager. She didn't have to do this. But she did. She led with her values, and the values of her organization. She put my need for a checking account at the center of her business.</p><p>And that stuck with me. I stayed a customer at her bank for almost 20 years.</p><p>Aligning interests</p><p>We have a phrase in economics incentive compatibility that describes this situation. It's the moment when the planets align, and what's good for me, is good for you, is good for society.</p><p>We're at that moment now for the financial services industry.</p><p>If you're willing to become an owner if you're willing to put your customers and communities at the center of your business banking for the common good will move beyond the title of this conference, and become the new industry norm.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>End Notes</p><p>1.

And yet somewhere in a distant corner of code, a potential hero could be emerging. Here are four reasons why for independent creators on the Internet, the blockchain could be a 'new hope.'<br/><br/>1.  The Tools of the 'Old Web' are Limited<br/><br/>Many existing platforms, for example Patreon, began by asking creators to \"trust them.\" Fast-forward a couple of years, and let's just say there have been issues. To paraphrase one user, \"how do you know there's no spyware, when you can't check the code.\"<br/><br/>The blockchain is 'trustless.' Because it's decentralized, the only person you are dependent on, is yourself.</p><p><br/><br/>2. Set the Financial and Contractual Terms<br/><br/>What if you could set the pricing, commission rates and digital rights management (DRM) settings on any content you produce or publish? That means you can share your creative commons style with the crowd, which is helpful for all those meme's.<br/><br/>Alternatively you can set the financial, contractual and distribution rights for that album you just recorded, to help pay-back some of that studio time.</p><p>3. Own Your Data<br/><br/>You own that photo you just published. Not Facebook. How about that?<br/><br/>4. Interoperable<br/><br/>Right now blockchain is at the \"AOL-install disc\" stage of development.</p><p>The Internet is layered and interoperable. Technologies that are not adaptable and customizable won't be successful or scale. Crypto solutions like 'Lightning network' let you send a 1000th of a penny to a friend from your smartphone. A couple of years ago, that was impossible.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: Al Bawaba is exploring blockchain solutions on the Open Index Protocol.</p><p>Other articles in the series<br/><br/>An Ancient Library in Alexandria Could be the Future of the Blockchain<br/><br/>A Public Index for the Web?

Investors select signals that appear to confirm what they already believe and often anchor decisions on messages whose content they are pre-disposed to approve, even though it is irrelevant.The polls that promised a <person><nameText>Clinton presidency </nameText></person>offer two more reminders of what investors should have known: people don't tell the truth in surveys and be wary of spurious precision in the presentation of analysis based on rubbish underlying data.Investors are now being bombarded with research from Wall Street on what a Trump win means for markets. The short message is that Trump is the great reflation trade.The good news is that stocks will boom: the bad news is that an inflation shock and unsustainable government borrowing might provoke rapidly rising rates and a bond market crash.However, investors should be as wary of most of this as they ought to have been of the pre-election polls. The pointy-heads producing it have precious little to go on, given that there is no clarity yet as to Trump's legislative agenda or priorities.At the most simplistic level, stimulus spending and tax cuts could indeed boost growth and benefit equities, and are therefore what most banks have focused on, but imposing trade tariffs on Chinese and other exporters to the US that invite retaliation could crater growth.How do you build economic and financial market models for a force as unmodellable as <person><nameText>Donald Trump?</nameText></person></p><p>You can't. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\"

a gridlocked Congress \"\" was to shave 50 basis points off US growth forecasts for the first half of 2017 on the basis that businesses might delay investment in an atmosphere of heightened uncertainty.She admits the impact of the promised tax cuts and stimulus spending is hard to work into the bank's existing models that typically incorporate expected fiscal transfers coming due to recipients and apply a standard multiplier to calculate likely impact on growth. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\"

presidency.</nameText></person></p><p>Pharma stocks, whose multiples had been beaten down by the threat of increased regulation under Clinton, have bounced, as have banks on the basis of likely rising rates, a steepening yield curve, volatile and active financial markets, as well as the intriguing prospect of president Trump tearing up Dodd-Frank and a slew of other regulations he says have stopped banks lending.</p><p>Sell-side analysts are focusing on this closely, even though it was hardly one of the key messages Trump thundered at his rallies, perhaps showing a little of their own confirmation bias.Select growth sectors</p><p>If tax cuts boost consumption and stimulus promotes a broad market rally, analysts suggest some of the premium could come out of select growth sectors such as tech stocks with the rally benefiting instead classic cyclical plays such as discretionary consumer stocks.</p><p>Of course, it remains to be seen how Trump will get a budget of across-the-board corporate and personal tax cuts twinned with debt-financed infrastructure spending through a Republican Congress not minded to support such stimulus in the worst years after the financial crisis, when the US suffered much higher rates of unemployment than it does today.</p><p>When during the campaign Trump said he would consider renegotiating US debts with its leading creditors, financial market participants stuck their fingers in the ears and said they were not listening.</p><p>However, now he is president elect, the prospect of unfunded tax cuts and ambitious spending programmes that expand the budget deficit unsustainably partly prompted a big bond market sell-off in the first days after Trump's victory.</p><p>One of his promises to keep an eye on will be the new government's eagerness to pursue international tax reform and enforce a one-off 10% tax on overseas profits of US multinationals, much of that now parked as $2 trillion in cash on the balance sheets of big tech companies.</p><p>\"If Mr Trump's tax plan becomes law, we expect most companies will try to bring their foreign cash balances to the US and use them to fund shareholder distributions or repay debt,\" suggest analysts at Citi's financial strategy and solutions group.</p><p>\"A Trump administration might require that some or all of the funds repatriated under its tax plan be invested in the US rather than distributed directly to investors.\"</p><p>In that case, we might see an increase in domestic capital spending and domestic mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>However, such analysis rather pales in the run up to inauguration of a president who might lead the US into isolationism and protectionism, and provoke trade wars with China, Mexico and much of Asia.</p><p>\"It is impossible to know what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will do as president,\" points out Llewellyn Consulting. \"He has no experience in public office. However, he has spoken \u00e2^' not always consistently \u00e2^' about policies in many areas, and typically past presidents have at least partially enacted around 70% of their campaign pledges.</p><p>\"Many of Mr Trump's statements bear on the fundamental policy frameworks and institutions that have, by and large, served the greater part of the world well since 1945. [The only confident assertion now is simply that] many hitherto-apparent certainties are now no longer so.\"</p><p>Financial and economic forecasts might be entertaining to read and even thought-provoking \"\" but the old models aren't worth much now. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-3601709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N7C-GBY1-F0GS-H4JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1010\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"11\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>November 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001TWF</classCode><className>MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

(GOOGL[1]), one of the world's largest companies with a market value of $890 billion, is mounting an ambitious strategy to become a major force in consumer banking. The company's Google division is working on a plan, codenamed Cache, to offer consumer checking accounts in 2020, according to a detailed exclusive report in The Wall Street Journal[2] summarized below.The service would be offered through the Google Pay app, but the accounts will reside with a growing number of U.S. banks. </p><p>Current partners include Citigroup Inc. (C[3]) and the small Stanford Federal Credit Union[4] affiliated with Stanford University, and accounts will be labeled prominently as being with these institutions. Google already is a large and growing player in digital payments, with its digital wallet[5] called Google Pay projected to have 100 million users worldwide by 2020, versus 39 million in 2018, per Juniper Research. Google Pay would be the key portal through which customers open and manage their checking accounts.\"Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,\" said Caesar Sengupta, general manager of payments solutions at Google, in an interview. \"It may be the slightly longer path, but it's more sustainable,\" he added. He indicated that Google would partner with more banks in the future. Key Takeaways Google is partnering with Citigroup to offer online bank accounts.These accounts would be offered through Google Pay.Expected rollout is in 2020, and Google Pay users are rising rapidly.  Significance For Investors  While Citigroup is among the largest national banks in terms of assets and deposits, it has a much smaller branch network than its top rivals. An alliance with Google is a play to increase its reach in consumer banking significantly without added brick-and-mortar expense. \"We have to be where our customers are,\" says Anand Selva, head of U.S. consumer banking at Citigroup.As of June 30, 2019, Wells Fargo .... (WFC[6]) led with 5,578 branches, JPMorgan Chase .... (JPM[7]) was second with 5,054, and Bank of America Corp. (BAC[8]) was third with 4,323, per USBankLocations.com[9]. Citigroup was way down in 16th place, with just 711 branches.According to a recent survey by consulting firm McKinsey ...., 58% of respondents indicated that they would trust financial products and services offered by Google. By comparison, the rates of positive responses for other big tech firms were approximately 64% for Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[10]), 56% for Apple Inc. (AAPL[11]), and 31% for Facebook Inc. (FB[12]).Google Pay has a number of rivals. Apple Pay, for one, had about 140 million users in 2018, and is projected to reach 225 million in 2020, per Juniper. Samsung Pay, from the South Korean electronics giant, is expected to reach 100 million users in 2020.Facebook has just begun rolling out its own payment service, Facebook Pay. Initially available to users of Facebook and Messenger, it eventually also will be available to users of Instagram and WhatsApp, per the company[13]. Payments will be processed by partners such as PayPal and Stripe[14], and Facebook promises users advanced security and anti-fraud provisions, as well as privacy protections. Looking Ahead  The amount of political and regulatory scrutiny already being focused on big tech players such as Google may be especially intense regarding its foray into banking. There are bound to be serious concerns about the privacy of users' personal financial data, and established competitors in banking who feel threatened are bound to raise them.Parent firm Alphabet already is the target of federal probes[15] into alleged anticompetitive practices, and has been levied a huge fine by European regulators. Google also must be careful to avoid mistakes made by other tech firms. Apple, for example, advertised a credit card offered in partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS[16]) as \"designed by Apple, not a bank,\" a boast that alienated Goldman.

As he has throughout his political career, Trump is amplifying for maximum potency a more nuanced idea already coursing through the conservative ecosystem - just as he's cast the press as an \"enemy of the people\" and dismissed NFL players who kneel during the national anthem in protest of police brutality. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"What President Trump is an expert at is gauging what his supporters care about,\" said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former White House aide. \"This issue has really risen up - on par with issues like immigration, judges and the Second Amendment - in terms of issues that Trump supporters care about.\"</p><p>In public comments and private conversations with his allies, Trump has often brought up the issue, bashing the San Francisco tech elites who he believes worked in 2016 to get his political nemesis, Hillary Clinton, elected president. It's also become an official White House position, after the communications office distributed talking points last week to outside surrogates titled \"Big Tech is Suppressing Conservative Voices.\" </p><p>The talking points, which were obtained by POLITICO, highlight a New York Times story about Facebook employees alleging on an internal message board that the company is \"intolerant\" of perspectives that differ with its left-leaning culture. The talking points also target Twitter for discriminating against Republicans by limiting users' ability to find them in searches, and Google for showing the word \"Nazism\" next to search results for the California Republican Party.</p><p>A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p><p>The tech companies have repeatedly rejected the idea that their platforms are intentionally biased. They argue that in cases where partisan leanings are detected in their algorithms, design choices or enforcement decisions, they are quickly fixed. The supposed record of bias, their defenders argue, is hugely anecdotal.</p><p>But conservatives have in recent years repeatedly pointed to signs that the tech industry's liberal leanings are manifested in the tools it has built, typified by so-called shadow banning, or quiet suppression, of Republican activity on the social-media platforms.</p><p>The president's embrace of anti-Silicon Valley rhetoric has been shaped by advisers who see it as the latest front in the country's long-running culture wars and believe it has the potential to rally conservative voters ahead of the midterms and the president's own reelection campaign in 2020. They include Brad Parscale, the manager of Trump's reelection campaign; Donald Trump Jr., the president's son; Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel; and Fox News personalities Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson. </p><p>In May, Parscale and McDaniel wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey demanding an end to \"bias against conservative content.\" Parscale and McDaniel met with Facebook executives in June alongside House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who conservatives see as another major conduit between the tech companies and the president.</p><p>The California Republican helped popularize the hashtag #StopTheBias, which has been picked up by Trump and top surrogates like Trump Jr. McCarthy has had several conversations with the president about social media bias, using personal anecdotes and examples of the companies' slanted treatment against conservatives to drive home his point, according to a Republican with knowledge of their discussions. </p><p>\"Conservatives invested a lot of money in building up their Facebook presences, and they did really well for a while,\" Zach Graves, head of policy at the San Francisco-based right-of-center tech advocacy group Lincoln Network, told POLITICO. \"Then Facebook changed the algorithm, and engagement dropped off a cliff. Now they're practically worthless.\" </p><p>Conservative allies of the White House have publicly suggested a range of policy remedies, including imposing government oversight of the tech sector by treating companies like public utilities. Another option being discussed informally in conservative circles: a push to eliminate tech companies' protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits firms like Google's liability for the content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Rumors have circulated in Washington in recent days that the White House is workshopping ideas for a Google-targeting executive order. Several people inside the White House denied working on such a project.</p><p>The roots of conservative suspicions about social media can be traced back to a May 2016 report by the tech publication Gizmodo in which an unnamed Facebook source said the site's in-house curators \"routinely suppressed conservative news\" in its trending news section. Coming at the height of the fraught U.S. presidential primaries - Trump was in the final weeks of sewing up the Republican nomination - the debate quickly became highly politically charged. </p><p>The president, who tweets avidly but doesn't use a computer or consume social media himself, has repeatedly tweeted about his frustrations with tech companies, accusing Google of rigging search results to show only stories from the \"Fake News Media\" and Twitter \"shadow banning\" prominent Republicans.</p><p>\"[V]irtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,\" Trump said in a Tuesday interview with the Daily Caller, accusing tech firms of interfering in the 2016 and 2018 elections. </p><p>The Justice Department signaled this week that it is taking the president's concerns seriously. In a Wednesday statement, the department announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is organizing a meeting, slated for Sept. 25, with state attorneys general \"to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\"</p><p>In response to a Trump tweet criticizing Google last week, Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, said the administration is even \"taking a look\" at imposing regulations on the internet giant, sending shock waves through the tech world as it scrambled to figure out what such a move might look like.</p><p>Trump later appeared to walk back Kudlow's comments, saying he wants \"fairness,\" not regulation - and White House officials declined to detail any policy other policy responses that are in the works. Current and former administration officials said they are often unsure whether the president's Twitter pronouncements - from threatening to take away NBC News' license to looking into South Africa's land policies - should be taken seriously and followed up with a suite of policy options. </p><p>\"Many of us operated on the assumption that this kind of stuff is just a PR, messaging ploy,\" one former administration official said. </p><p>During a Wednesday House hearing on the topic, Dorsey testified that while \"we recognize that even a model created without deliberate bias may nevertheless result in biased outcomes,\" as a company, \"we believe strongly in being impartial, and we strive to enforce our rules impartially.\"</p><p>Republicans, though, kept up their criticisms of the social network throughout the course of the hearing. Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana highlighted what he called examples of Twitter practices that seem to have \"selectively adversely affected conservatives\" - including an October 2017 campaign ad from Republican Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn that was temporarily rejected by the company over its mentions of abortion. </p><p>The following day, Twitter moved to permanently suspend provocateur Alex Jones and his far-right InfoWars, citing tweets and videos that violate its abusive behavior policy.</p><p>Some close to Trump have started to worry that the president will undercut efforts to address the problems tech companies have already acknowledged by embracing some of the conspiracy-theory-laden elements of conservatives' allegations against tech companies. One source close to the White House argued that Trump didn't help his cause by tweeting out a video that falsely claimed Google didn't promote his State of the Union addresses the way it promoted former President Barack Obama's.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump's critics see considerable irony in the fact that Twitter's most powerful user is complaining about bias when it has long been his preferred venue to tend to his grievances before an audience of more than 50 million.</p><p>Democrats dismiss Trump's embrace of the attacks on major tech companies as politically motivated. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, accused Trump on Wednesday of peddling \"conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fundraise.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-813662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7H-SRB1-F118-94XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1570\"/><timeReceived>7:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp;

There are lots of opportunities.\"</p><p>Unfortunately for Canada, which, like most countries, will need all the investment it can get to recover from the coronavirus crisis, most of the opportunities that Felesky sees are elsewhere.</p><p>That's because we Canadians - and, by extension, our elected representatives - refuse to get excited about open banking, the industry term for a regulatory regime that grants control of financial information to clients rather than the financial institutions that serve them.</p><p>Without access to data, digital upstarts have little chance of stealing market share from legacy institutions, even if they offer a better service. The United Kingdom, European Union and Australia are among the jurisdictions that have adopted open banking over the past couple of years and will benefit from a first-mover advantage as a result.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, meanwhile, keeps postponing a decision on whether it intends to follow, which probably suits the established banking oligopoly just fine.</p><p>Around the time Portag3 closed its latest round of fundraising, an expert committee appointed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau was finishing up a report that was relatively enthusiastic about open banking. In January, Morneau released the review and announced additional consultations would be held in the spring. Those meetings were postponed until autumn because of the pandemic, meaning regulatory clarity is at least a year away, if not longer.</p><p>As a result, Portag3's money probably will end up in places where governments have decided to embrace the future, rather than serve the interests of legacy interests by dallying. Canada will have exposure to the digital shift in financial services thanks to the ownership stakes Portag3 and others take in various international firms. But the actual champions of global finance will continue to come from elsewhere, and their clients in Europe and Asia will be first to enjoy the benefits of better service.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're spending more time outside of Canada than inside of Canada because of some of these (regulatory) headwinds,\" Felesky said. \"It's difficult to make some of these investments believing something may occur. We just don't have any capital in businesses that are dependent on open banking.\"</p><p>There is a strongly held view among fintech advocates that the big banks are using their influence to delay regulatory changes that would entice new challengers for as long as they can.</p><p>Given the banking oligopoly's outsized role in the federal government's COVID-19 rescue, it's fair to wonder if it will have even greater sway over Ottawa once the emergency is over. The argument that the guarantee of financial stability justifies protecting the largest institutions from competition will be strengthened by Bay Street's ability to keep many mortgage holders and smaller companies afloat during the crisis.</p><p>But a new generation of finance entrepreneurs think decades of coddling have left the big banks too risk-averse to be successful in the digital economy. They have been slow to adapt, leaving themselves vulnerable to tech behemoths such as Amazon. com Inc. and Shopify Inc. that are steadily adding financial services such as small-business lending to their core offerings.</p><p>\"Canada has a history of using its oligopolies, whether it's telecommunications or financial services, for warding off competition,\" Corey Gross, chief executive of Toronto-based Sensibill Inc., which uses artificial intelligence to process receipts, said in an interview. \"The financial institutions here are going to face a reckoning.\"</p><p>Sensibill, backed by Toronto-based Radical Ventures Investments Inc., doesn't necessarily need open banking to be successful. Last month, the company announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase &amp;; Co. to process receipts for the 38 million people who use the Chase banking app.</p><p>Still, Gross said his business would be stronger if the legacy banks felt competitive pressure to offer their clients the latest digital technology.</p><p>\"You can't say they aren't aware of it and they aren't doing anything about it. They are,\" he said. \"But the urgency is not there yet. Bringing more competition to Canada, either from big tech or by an explosion of fintech brought about by open banking, would create more urgency.\"</p><p>There will need to be more urgency in Ottawa, too, and some of that will have to be directed by us, so call your member of Parliament. The opportunity cost of letting the banks and their regulators sort out open banking is too great.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

There are lots of opportunities.\"</p><p>Unfortunately for Canada, which, like most countries, will need all the investment it can get to recover from the coronavirus crisis, most of the opportunities that Felesky sees are elsewhere.</p><p>That's because we Canadians - and, by extension, our elected representatives - refuse to get excited about open banking, the industry term for a regulatory regime that grants control of financial information to clients rather than the financial institutions that serve them.</p><p>Without access to data, digital upstarts have little chance of stealing market share from legacy institutions, even if they offer a better service. The United Kingdom, European Union and Australia are among the jurisdictions that have adopted open banking over the past couple of years and will benefit from a first-mover advantage as a result.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, meanwhile, keeps postponing a decision on whether it intends to follow, which probably suits the established banking oligopoly just fine.</p><p>Around the time Portag3 closed its latest round of fundraising, an expert committee appointed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau was finishing up a report that was relatively enthusiastic about open banking. In January, Morneau released the review and announced additional consultations would be held in the spring. Those meetings were postponed until autumn because of the pandemic, meaning regulatory clarity is at least a year away, if not longer.</p><p>As a result, Portag3's money probably will end up in places where governments have decided to embrace the future, rather than serve the interests of legacy interests by dallying. Canada will have exposure to the digital shift in financial services thanks to the ownership stakes Portag3 and others take in various international firms. But the actual champions of global finance will continue to come from elsewhere, and their clients in Europe and Asia will be first to enjoy the benefits of better service.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're spending more time outside of Canada than inside of Canada because of some of these (regulatory) headwinds,\" Felesky said. \"It's difficult to make some of these investments believing something may occur. We just don't have any capital in businesses that are dependent on open banking.\"</p><p>There is a strongly held view among fintech advocates that the big banks are using their influence to delay regulatory changes that would entice new challengers for as long as they can.</p><p>Given the banking oligopoly's outsized role in the federal government's COVID-19 rescue, it's fair to wonder if it will have even greater sway over Ottawa once the emergency is over. The argument that the guarantee of financial stability justifies protecting the largest institutions from competition will be strengthened by Bay Street's ability to keep many mortgage holders and smaller companies afloat during the crisis.</p><p>But a new generation of finance entrepreneurs think decades of coddling have left the big banks too risk-averse to be successful in the digital economy. They have been slow to adapt, leaving themselves vulnerable to tech behemoths such as Amazon. com Inc. and Shopify Inc. that are steadily adding financial services such as small-business lending to their core offerings.</p><p>\"Canada has a history of using its oligopolies, whether it's telecommunications or financial services, for warding off competition,\" Corey Gross, chief executive of Toronto-based Sensibill Inc., which uses artificial intelligence to process receipts, said in an interview. \"The financial institutions here are going to face a reckoning.\"</p><p>Sensibill, backed by Toronto-based Radical Ventures Investments Inc., doesn't necessarily need open banking to be successful. Last month, the company announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase &amp;; Co. to process receipts for the 38 million people who use the Chase banking app.</p><p>Still, Gross said his business would be stronger if the legacy banks felt competitive pressure to offer their clients the latest digital technology.</p><p>\"You can't say they aren't aware of it and they aren't doing anything about it. They are,\" he said. \"But the urgency is not there yet. Bringing more competition to Canada, either from big tech or by an explosion of fintech brought about by open banking, would create more urgency.\"</p><p>There will need to be more urgency in Ottawa, too, and some of that will have to be directed by us, so call your member of Parliament. The opportunity cost of letting the banks and their regulators sort out open banking is too great.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is FIRST MOVE, and here's your needs to know. China condemns. Beijing weighs in on the recent protests, but says it's Hong Kong's problem to solve. Very generic: Pfizer selling off its generic drugs unit tying up with Epipen maker, Mylan. And a real game changer, a 16-year-old American boy wins the Fortnite World Cup and a $3 million prize. It's Monday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to Monday's FIRST MOVE. I hope you all had a really restful weekend because I tell you, this day could really be the calm before the storm. The calm part of that is what we're seeing right now for U.S. stock futures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let me give you a look at what we're seeing that of course, after that record breaking run last week. We're at record highs for the NASDAQ and for the S&amp;P 500. The storm part and the fate of this recent rally of course hangs on, well, exactly that, FATE.</p><p>Let me explain F for this week's Fed meeting, A for Apple's earnings among many this week, T for the trade talks starting tomorrow, and E, the economic report front and center. Of course, it's U.S. jobs week and payrolls numbers on Friday.</p><p>Of all these fateful events though, the Federal Reserve is front and center. What do we get in terms of rate cuts? But also, what do they say about the guidance here in future rate cuts because that's going to be the driver, I think. A quarter -- I've got my teeth in -- point cut is baked in here. But there's still some debate over whether we see or see more, a half a percentage point cut, how much insurance is needed right now? And do those rate cuts make it less urgent for the U.S. and China to strike a long-term trade deal?</p><p>We've got a guest coming up who says don't overreact to the trade war theater. Well, the latest act, Chinese state media saying over the weekend that Beijing has purchased millions of tons of U.S. soybean since June's trade truce. It is Beijing call it a goodwill step. We will see.</p><p>Very little goodwill right now, though, in Hong Kong where stocks fell some one percent overnight following another weekend of protests and warnings that the city could face a serious longer term economic hit. That is where we're going to kick off the drivers. So, let's get to it.</p><p>That warning coming from China, in fact, Beijing calling the protests horrendous incidents that have caused serious damage to the quote \"rule of law.\" Sherisse Pham is on this story.</p><p>An unprecedented response in the fact that China is even weighing at this stage, but they've backed Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive and they back the police as well here. Talk us through it.</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, this is the first time that we've heard from Beijing, China's top Hong Kong official policy official breaking that silence today saying that Hong Kong protesters have committed, I want to get this right, \"evil and criminal acts\" and as you said seriously damaged the city's economy, its public order and the city's international image.</p><p>And of course, Julia, Hong Kong's image is as a safe and stable place to conduct business and Hong Kong's top financial chief saying over the weekend, that that has seriously been hurt that weeks -- eight straight weekends of protests -- are starting to hurt local shops that are reporting that they are seeing a significant drop in business.</p><p>And you saw that play out well a little bit in the in the markets this morning with the Hang Seng dropping, I think almost two percent, 1.6 percent at one point. They pared back some of those losses, closed down one percent. And of course also, important to note that investors are rattled by other things, including a slowing economy and the U.S.-China trade talks.</p><p>And I do want to point out, too, as well, we have been seeing these images of violent clashes that have happened recently, but I have covered the protests. I have witnessed marches weekend after weekend here in Hong Kong and they have largely been peaceful.</p><p>But of course the big question now, Julia is how much will two months of protests weigh on Hong Kong's economy? We will have a clear answer on Wednesday when GDP numbers come out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you make a great point. Actually, you make a few of them. One in that the pictures look very dramatic, but by and large it is while sizable, a peaceful protest here, it is just a small element that are creating all of the drama and the violence here.</p><p>But you know for international investors watching this, part of the reason why Hong Kong is so strong as this sort of conduit into China here is because of the rule of law as Beijing mentioned here.</p><p>[09:05:07] CHATTERLEY: I mean, how nervous is this making international investors, many American companies? You have thousands of workers there.</p><p>PHAM: It is starting to shake some confidence in the city. The American Chamber of Commerce came out with a statement today, calling on the government for some firm leadership to restore business confidence.</p><p>I know you guys are going to talk to the President, Tara Joseph a little bit later in the show, but businesses are reporting that they are seeing immediate drops in revenue. They're seeing some disruptions to the supply chain, and they are starting to shelve investment plans. So yes, it is having an impact.</p><p>But I've also talked to analysts who have said, \"Look, one month, two months of protests that happened really on one or two days a week. It's not going to change the economic trajectory of this city.\" But you are absolutely right, and as business groups have been saying, it is absolutely shaking investor confidence.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, if it weren't for the trade war, of course, because that's another kicker here. Sherisse Pham, thank you so much for joining us on that. All right, now, we're going to head over to a mega merger between two pharma giants.</p><p>Pfizer tying up with Mylan, the Epipen maker as I mentioned. Mylan shares up a whopping 21 percent right now premarket. Matt Egan is on this story. So, just so that I'm getting this straight, they're combining Pfizer -- their less lucrative generics drug unit here -- with Mylan and Mylan of course, they got at a really low price here. It's lost what? Around three quarters of its value over the last four years. Cheap, perhaps.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Perhaps, Julia, but you have Viagra, Lipitor and Epipen -- some of the best known treatments in the world joining Forces all under one roof in what will be a global generics powerhouse.</p><p>But as you know, this is not really a deal being done from a place of strength. For Pfizer, it's a way to retreat from what has been a slow growth, low margin, off patent drug business. Pfizer really wants to focus on trying to hit the next home run by finding blockbuster drug treatments.</p><p>Now, for Mylan, as you're alluding to, it's a way to get out of what has really been a very difficult situation. The stock is down coming into today, 76 percent from its 2015 high. That's because of all this pressure on generic drugs. That's also because of the backlash against the notorious Epipen price hikes.</p><p>Now as part of this deal, Mylan announced that CEO Heather Bresch, really is one of the most controversial figures in healthcare is retiring. That's after nearly eight years at the helm.</p><p>So, let's go through some of the details of this deal. The new company will be renamed. They haven't announced what the name will be yet, it's going to be based in the United States and what's going to happen here is Pfizer is going to spin off its China based Upjohn division, and it will simultaneously combined an all-stock deal with Mylan.</p><p>And so it's going to create a very large company, it's going to be in 165 markets up to $20 billion in revenue. And the two companies say that by 2023, they will generate about a billion dollars in annual synergies.</p><p>But Julia, at first glance, you know, it looks like Wall Street doesn't really think that this has been a great deal for Pfizer, as we noticed Pfizer stocks moving lower premarket, Mylan is up. And so it's interesting to sort of see the first reaction from Wall Street here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, interesting. I mean, when you're seeing approach, you don't necessarily tend to see a positive reaction in the acquirer here. But to your point, exactly and to my raised eyebrows when I asked cheap or not. But what we are seeing here is that broader consolidation, it is streamlining of many of these big pharmaceutical companies here. They all seem to want to be, at least in the top three of whatever sector or subsector they're operating in.</p><p>It kind of makes sense because this is a severely competitive area, particularly when you've got a sort of pipeline and popular drugs like Viagra rolling off and becoming generic or face the competition from generics.</p><p>EGAN: I think that's right. I mean, it just costs so much money for these companies to develop the next treatment. And then after a certain period of time, they're going to lose the exclusivity to those treatments.</p><p>So there is a lot of pressure on the drug makers. We're seeing so much pressure on generic drugs, in particular, but as you've mentioned, we've seen a number of very big deals, including with Pfizer.</p><p>You know, Pfizer, last year, it announced plans to spin off its Consumer Health Division and other low-growth business with a GlaxoSmithKline. It also announced plans last month to buy a cancer drug treatment company as well.</p><p>And so clearly, Pfizer has focused on this, this pivot to innovation and to growth and in order to finance that, they are spinning off some of their slower growing businesses -- Julia.</p><p>[09:10:08] CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely, Matt Egan. Great context. Thank you so much for that. All right, let's move on to our next driver in delivery app, takeaway.com sinking its teeth into rival Just East in a $6 billion deal. Anna Stewart has been that looking at all the details for us. Anna, set to create one of the world's biggest delivery -- online delivery companies here and taking the fight perhaps to Uber Eats particularly in Europe.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, we're seeing so much consolidation in this space. And if you look at some of the markets, the U.S., the U.K., they are already mature. So growing is really hard and we are just seeing them gobbling each other up at a pretty fast rate.</p><p>We actually already had Takeaway acquiring British deliverer, Hero, last year. Now of course eating up Just Eat. If you look at the share price, investors very pleased with this. I think Just Eat was up well over 20 percent, nearly 30 percent at one stage, and activist shareholder, Cat Rock, they own around two and a half percent of Just Eat.</p><p>They are absolutely thrilled about this and have been campaigning for tie up like this for ages. But it just so happens, Julia, they also have four percent stake in Takeaway.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Aha. I see. So, they've been pushing to something and they benefit on both sides. We like that, don't we. That's called strategic investing. What about the competition here, though? Because, I mean, recently, we saw Amazon backing Deliveroo. I mentioned Uber Eats here, which is a sort of monster company, particularly with financial resources behind it.</p><p>What's the comparison here in terms of scale, number of transactions and sort of how big of a behemoth are we seeing created here?</p><p>STEWART: Well, it's interesting, like many of the sectors we talk about as these Big Tech giants entering the space, as you said, Amazon backing Deliveroo. You always have Softbank there backing DoorDash, Uber has Uber Eats.</p><p>And while Just Eat is a massive dominant player in the U.K., Takeaways a dominant player in Germany, I think you can expect to see lots more consolidation from those big tech giants that can afford to chuck more money into it. It's going to continue to be a threat.</p><p>And some analysts today say they wouldn't be surprised if we see a counter bid for Just Eat. Perhaps that's why share price is up so high today -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, watch this space. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that. All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we're following around the world. A six-year-old boy is among three people who was shot and killed by a gunman at a Food Festival in the U.S. State of California on Sunday. A further 12 people were hurt.</p><p>The gunman was shot dead by police shortly after the suspect began firing. Sara Sidner is in Gilroy, California for us. What more do we know, Sara, about who carried out this attack.</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Very little at this hour. Police though have said that they have shot and killed the suspect that they engaged within one minute of this shooting happening.</p><p>Within that one minute, however, three people had been killed, including a six-year-old boy named Steven Romero. We now know that 12 people were injured. Police had initially counted 11 with gunshot wounds, the 12th person ended up taking themselves to the hospital. So, now that number has gone up by one in the last couple of hours.</p><p>We should mention that this Festival is something that is well-loved here in Northern California. Lots of folks love coming to this, a hundred thousand people, end up usually showing up at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. And you can certainly not mistake where you are because you can smell the garlic as you're coming into town, a place that processes and grows garlic and is famous for its garlic.</p><p>And people just came here on a Sunday to enjoy themselves, to have a good time. Things were starting to wrap up. And then all of a sudden the sounds of gunshots. Something that has happened too many times in this country.</p><p>And we understand from police that there is a second person they're seeking. They're not sure what that person's role might be. But they are saying that there is a second suspect that they would like to be able to contact at this hour.</p><p>They also say that the shooter ended up getting in not through the normal ways of walking through security, but cutting through a fence in order to get in and engage all of those innocent people.</p><p>At this hour, there are people still in the hospital trying to recover from gunshot wounds, including that six-year-old's mother who has been injured, shot at least in the hand and stomach as we understand it.</p><p>But I want to let you hear what witnesses said as this was all happening last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We saw him shooting and running towards our tent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, we saw it. We heard the pop. That's when we walked out the bathroom. We heard the pop. I didn't think nothing of it. We both looked the same -- at the same time and saw him. He was putting the thing in, and then also he just started walking towards our tent and just started shooting like this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And so then we ran the other way and everybody else was running. And then she remembered her granddaughter and people kept telling me, \"Run. Get down.\" And so then she was went back to the tent and I was on the other side.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was pandemonium. It was just chaos, but it was like everything happened so fast. And then it was over with.</p><p>[09:15:07] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We hugged each other and said, you know, \"Thank God, it could have been us.\" You know, just two minutes, but --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's just much. It's too much to handle. Too much to even do all this stuff. I just can't comprehend --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we don't know how her granddaughter is going to process it. She had, you know, stuff in her hair.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She saw the whole thing. She saw --</p><p>QUESTION: She is how old?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ten.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ten. She saw the whole thing.</p><p>QUESTION: Ten years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She saved a three-year-old. She grabbed him and hid him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just 10 years old, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIDNER: This is just the latest place in America where a mass shooting has happened, this time at the Gilroy Garlic Festival here in Northern California -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sara Sidner there in Gilroy, California. Thank you so much for that update, and of course our hearts and prayers with all those impacted.</p><p>Let's move on. A funeral service has been held for an Italian police officer, who authorities allege was stabbed to death by two American tourists. Mario Cerciello Rega was laid to rest in the same Church he was married in less than two months ago.</p><p>Police say he was stabbed 11 times while investigating a drug deal that had gone wrong. Two American teenagers have been arrested and are being held in Rome. A photograph appearing to show one of the suspects blindfolded at a police station has been leaked to Italian media. Officers say they are investigating.</p><p>Donald Trump has nominated a staunch loyalist with less than five years' experience in national politics to be his next Director of National Intelligence.</p><p>John Ratcliffe is seeing here on the right. He would replace Dan Coats as American spy chief after Coats stepped down -- steps down next month.</p><p>The outgoing director said he wasn't resigning over one particular incident; however, he has always had a tense relationship with the President exemplified most famously by the moment he learned last year that the Russian President would be visiting Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I do want to say we have some breaking news. The White House has announced on Twitter that Vladimir Putin is coming to the White House in the fall.</p><p>DAN COATS, OUTGOING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Say that again?</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vladimir Putin coming to --</p><p>COATS: Yes, I heard you. I heard you. Okay.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p>COATS: That's going to be special.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Special. All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up, there's new items on the vegan menu. We've got a company looking to bait investors with plant-based seafood and there's nothing fishy about it.</p><p>And the kids have arrived at the Fortnite World Cup. How this virtual game has made some teenagers into millionaires. That's up next. Stay with FIRST MOVE, you're with CNN.</p><p>[09:20:58] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this Monday. Right now, futures are relatively unchanged. We'll call it a tough time to be optimistic. The question is, will the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ move further into record territory this week?</p><p>We've got a hugely busy week of earnings season to come. Apple and some of the major oil names like Exxon sector report, obviously the Federal Reserve as we've mentioned. In the U.K. as well, let's take a look at what's going on over there. We've got the FTSE up almost two percent, helped by a 15 percent jump in shares of the London Stock Exchange Group. It's in talks to buy a financial data firm Refinitiv. The deal is activated at around $27 billion. Investors clearly are liking that, which is very interesting.</p><p>Also supporting the market of course, a fall in pound versus the U.S. dollar. Down some one percent in light of, I think, Boris Johnson, the new Prime Minister's tone with Europe here and raised fears of a hard Brexit scenario come October 31st.</p><p>Also raised tensions of course over in Hong Kong as we've already discussed. Mass protests and escalating violence over the last few months taking a toll on the city's economy. The Hang Seng suffered its worst drop in a week on Monday with property developers and retailers among the hardest hit.</p><p>The American Chamber of Commerce, AMCHAM in Hong Kong is now calling for a quote, \"firm government leadership response to restore sagging business confidence.\"</p><p>And joining us now is the Tara Joseph, President of AMCHAM. Tara, fantastic to have you on the show. Well, talk about what response you want to see from the Hong Kong authorities. But first, I know you've been surveying businesses that you represent, what are they saying to you about the impact of these protests?</p><p>TARA JOSEPH, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, HONG KONG: Well, as the protests go on and on, Julia, there is sort of a pessimism or a worry developing, that there's no end in sight. And of course, that makes people a little nervous.</p><p>People are used to a Hong Kong that is so well-connected to the world, and generally, a risk free place to do business.</p><p>What our members would really like to see is a sense of what can be done by the Hong Kong government to restore confidence and some real communication as to what the end game could actually be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Be specific, because in the short term, what do you want to see? Is it a case of a removal? A complete removal of the Extradition Bill so that the belief is that it won't come back? Because I know people fear that at some point that risk is going to return.</p><p>An investigation into how the police responded to these protests. But do you also want to see Carrie Lam step down here because as the architect, the Chief Executive of presenting this Bill, unfortunately, the protestors look at her as part of the problem here now, not part of the solution?</p><p>JOSEPH: Well, you mentioned two key things that our members are telling us. The first is, while we were happy to see the Extradition Bill shelved. There is a feeling amongst our membership that if the word \"withdraw\" were used, or if it were withdrawn, that would help to soothe the protesters and help to make things better.</p><p>The other area there is some sort of inquiry or a research into what's been behind the protest that is seen as fair. Hong Kong has rule of law, some sort of fair look into this that doesn't see one sided is also seen as really important.</p><p>I don't want to get into who should be running the government. But we would like to see some statements from the government, some sense of leadership at this point. It's been very quiet as of late.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If we just look at the American businesses, though, that are operating. I mean, you represent what, 1,400 American businesses; a hundred thousand employees working in the area. Are they saying to you, \"Look, there are other options, we could go to Singapore, for example. This is not how we intend to operate going forward if we can't be convinced that the rule of law and some of the benefits of being in Hong Kong with the proximity to China will be adhered to.\" Are they talking about looking at other options here?</p><p>[09:25:06] JOSEPH: Well, certainly there are backup plans being made as people start to survey what could happen in the long term.</p><p>But to be fair, Hong Kong still is a great environment to operate in. People don't want to leave here unless they have to, the gateway city to China, connected to Southeast Asia, great connections to the United States and to Europe.</p><p>But the other aspect of it is there are cities across Asia that are becoming increasingly competitive. Singapore is an obvious one where multinationals increasingly feel comfortable.</p><p>There are other places, Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur that are trying to bring foreign investors in. So, the more Hong Kong loses a sense of comfort, the more other cities will try to compete for that business.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is the worst thing that could happen here that the People's Liberation Army steps in and takes action here. Is that the worst thing that could happen here? And do you think both China and the Hong Kong authorities recognize that that would be a huge problem?</p><p>JOSEPH: I think it's fair to say that that is very much a worst case scenario. And earlier today, when we heard statements from the central government in China, they seem to be putting the effort back to the Hong Kong government overall, even though they were condemning the protest.</p><p>And I think that's important to put it back to Hong Kong to not have Mainland China and the U.S. gets hugely involved in this. So, there's not a tit-for-tat and Hong Kong doesn't get right in the middle.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that independence needs to be preserved. Tara Joseph fantastic to have you on the show with us, the president of AMCHAM there.</p><p>JOSEPH: Thanks, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, stay with us. The market open his next, and there's plenty more to come.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Lots of fist pumping and smiles there. Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the New York Stock Exchange and the opening bell this morning. We've had a cautious start for U.S. stock markets this morning ahead of what's going to be an incredibly busy week for earnings and economic data to more than 150 companies in the S&amp;P 500 reporting this week.</p><p>And don't forget the big Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday, too. Former Fed Chair, Janet Yellen said over the weekend that she supports a quarter point cut. However, she doesn't see this as the start of a major Fed cutting cycle. What we did see though, is the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ closing out last week at record highs.</p><p>The Dow is around half a percent away from records mostly because of the weakness in Boeing. We discussed this last week. Its stock tumbling some eight and a half percent after reporting an almost $3 billion Q2 loss due to the 737 MAX crisis.</p><p>All right, let's talk more broadly about what we're seeing and what we can expect this week. Robert Shiller is Professor of Economics at Yale. He won the Nobel Prize for Economics back in 2013, and he joins us now.</p><p>Professor Shiller, fantastic to have you on the show. I want to talk about the Federal Reserve first, there's debate over whether we see a quarter point, a half a point cut. There are others that look at the markets that look at conditions and say the Fed probably shouldn't be cutting at all. Where do you stand?</p><p>ROBERT SHILLER, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, YALE: This is a close call, I'd have to say. The unemployment rate is near record lows. That would be a time for raising rates to cool the economy. On the other hand, the inflation rate is a little bit below target. So, if you're trying to hit the target, you would cut rates.</p><p>I think it's a close call. I would have to study carefully if I were on the FOMC at this point in time.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Back in March, you were saying that there's a 50 percent probability of a recession in the next 18 months. Do you think that we can head that off and extend the business cycle here, even the bull market perhaps in equities, too, by preemptively cutting rates here, insurance rate cuts as the Federal Reserve has referred to them?</p><p>SHILLER: Right, right. Yes, I think that we just passed the milestone in June. We passed -- we are now in record territory for the longest expansion in U.S. history since the NBER started calculating these in the 1850s -- referring to the 1850.</p><p>So, it looks like a recession might be overdue. But you might say that this time is different. I don't know. It doesn't seem like there's strong recessionary expectations, which might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, maybe we'll go for a while longer before we finally slip into one.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it is interesting, the Fed keeps talking about the international economy and the fact that for most people here, it's less about trying to stimulate the U.S. economy versus prepare and mitigate the risks elsewhere in the world.</p><p>You said investors shouldn't overreact to the trade war theater. Do you think the Federal Reserve is guilty perhaps of overreacting to the trade war theater here, too?</p><p>SHILLER: Yes. Well, that's another important -- it's good that you use the word \"theater,\" because it is a show. It's an emotion laden show of anger being brought up. And I think that anger does have a risk to the markets into the economy, because people might pull back on doing eventually some things.</p><p>They might feel anxious about the outlook, and that would slow down business planning and business investments. We've already seen that in the latest data. It's not that -- I think markets thrive on certainty, not uncertainty.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How important is the ongoing rally in the market though for confidence? To your point, you know, you're a specialist in in behavioral economics. Is the biggest risk perhaps to the bull market here fear of the end of the bull market rather than anything else?</p><p>So again, it's right to perhaps cut rates here and mitigate the drama and the back and forth here over trade, if nothing else?</p><p>SHILLER: You said it exactly right. The question of the drama. So what is the more important thing for the Fed to do to cool this drama down? So, I thought that pushing interest rates back up to a normal level would kind of reassure people that normalcy, you might call it, is here.</p><p>[09:35:03] SHILLER: On the other hand, maybe cutting rates helps assuage our growing fears. It's a difficult call, I have to say. I don't know how people can be sure about how they will affect the drama of the trade war, as you describe it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you worry about the fact that the United States needs to leave some kind of cushion to be able to support the economy in a more material slowdown in the past? Or is the fact that actually, unlike many other Central Banks, the Federal Reserve has managed to raise rates to a far larger extent and therefore has bought itself the ability to provide insurance rate cuts at this moment?</p><p>SHILLER: Right. Yes, this is more of a problem in Europe ECB problem, where they've already pursued quantitative easing at a high level, and their interest -- their basic interest rate is at a negative territory.</p><p>So, they've kind of run out of ammunition. We do have more ammunition in the United States with the Federal fund rate just under two and a half percent. We have a lot of potential, a lot more potential for cutting.</p><p>But even so, it's not as big as it was in past years when the Federal funds rate was in double digits.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Where did you think this ends? We're going to have the Bank of Japan this week, perhaps lowering their inflation target, because despite the fact that they've lowered rates and bought a huge chunk of equities and bonds in Japan, they've not managed to perk inflation up. The United States is struggling. To your point, the European Central Bank is struggling. What's the end game here?</p><p>SHILLER: Well, I think that the invention of inflation targeting, which goes back to the Central Bank of New Zealand at the beginning of the century is actually an important invention. And in the long run, it will serve to stabilize the rate of inflation at a good level.</p><p>We used to target the exchange rate. It's better to target the inflation rate, because that is more on the minds of most people. And I think that ultimately, we're pretty much a success with that.</p><p>And so inflationary expectations aren't such a drama, as they were in past years. So, I expect that this will die. Apparently, the Fed then is right now, making this move in good part because of the Federal funds rate drifting down, it's not dramatically below target. It's about one and a half percent.</p><p>But that's enough, I guess, to make a little adjustment to fine tune this is interest rate, and it keeps people from getting involved in the drama, of worrying about inflation if they see it. You know, what's the difference between two percent and one and one and a half percent? It's not exciting news. That's where we want to keep it, not exciting news.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, de-drama, if we could de-drama the global economy; that will be great. Professor Shiller, thank you so much for joining us. Professor Robert Shiller there, Professor of Economics at Yale. Great to have you on the show.</p><p>All right, the pharmaceutical industry topping our global movers today. Let's take a look at those. Shares of Mylan Labs, rallying some 18 percent right now, just under, as you can see that following the announcement of a major deal with Pfizer. Pfizer separating off its patent drug unit and will merge that then with Mylan, which is already a leading seller of generic medications.</p><p>Mylan CEO will step down as part of the all-stock deal to be replaced by Pfizer's Unit President. The combined company expected to generate annual revenue of around $20 billion. Pfizer shares, as you can see, it's slightly lower here by some one percent.</p><p>Separately today, it announced, too, its second quarter earnings and it came in above expectations, but revenues missed estimates. And in the meantime, shares of cancer research firm Genomic Health are higher, a cancer diagnostics firm. Exact Sciences is buying the company for some $2.8 billion and shares of the French drug-maker, Sanofi, are higher. It posted strong Q2 results today and raised its 2018 earnings guidance.</p><p>Wow. Lots going on in that space. All right. We're going to take a quick break. But up next on FIRST MOVE. You've heard of meatless meat, but what about fishless fish? Are you hooked? Well, we've got an investor who is coming up, the man making waves in the plant-based food industry. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:42:47] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Beyond Meat is releasing its second quarter earnings after the close today. That's after an astonishing early run since its IPO in May. The California based company set its IPO price at $25.00. It opened at $46.00, if you remember and since then, it's been on one meaty climb, currently trading at around $230.00. That is pretty bonkers.</p><p>Joining me now in the \"Chatt Room\" is Chris Kerr. He is the Investment Officer at New Crop Capital, and also an early investor in plant-based food companies. Chris, great to have you with us.</p><p>CHRIS KERR, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NEW CROP CAPITAL: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: An early investor in Beyond Meat, too. That's a whopping rise. Congratulations.</p><p>KERR: Very happy with the outcome, I have to say.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sure, you are.</p><p>KERR: There's no complaints there. All I wanted was a really good tasting burger, and what I got was a nice return on investment. It's very pleasant.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Does it worry you that sort of shift up in price? I mean, this is a small market getting access to these kind of companies that are doing this right now is tough. Do you worry about sort of the meteoric rise? Oh, just saw what I did there.</p><p>KERR: Not so much. I mean, you know, the fact is, there's a lot of different ways of entering into this market. There's a lot more innovation that still has to come. And we're just talking about burger right now. I mean, there's a lot of different ways that this commodity product has turned into a finish good for consumers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so we'll take a step back, you're a vegan. You were looking for decent food options and you were struggling, you were like, \"You know what, I'm going to invest in companies and help them commercialize on a small scale what they're offering.\"</p><p>KERR: Yes, I mean, on my way down here, my wife, Kirsten and I, we were walking past and Dunkin Donuts and a Beyond Meat Sausage came out. My head would have exploded in 2002 if that happened. I would have eaten my sausage sandwich and gone about my business, but instead then that didn't really exist.</p><p>The number one ingredient back in those days was disappointment in our food, and so what we wanted to do was say, \"Look, if we can bring innovation into this space, take a base product and apply it to a demographic, that changes all over the globe.\" You know, you think about the way that meat is put together, it's maybe globally used, but it's locally accepted.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>KERR: And so what we wanted was a based product that could be applied to different demographics and that's what Beyond Meat has been doing. It's been doing -- Good Catch and the other products in our portfolio.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Now, Good Catch is interesting because this is plant based fish alternatives. Like I feel with meat, it's one thing, but with fish, it's something different.</p><p>[09:45:08] KERR: We eat between 200 to 300 different types of sea creatures. We eat about 30 different types of land animals. Right? When you look at the culinary arts, first of all, we always start with taste.</p><p>Like I said, in 2002, I was basically eating cardboard from burgers and unmeltable cheese, if it even existed, all I wanted was a grilled cheese sandwich that melted.</p><p>Those days are kind of gone now. So, we look at the culinary innovation and inside seafood, if you have 200 to 300 different types of applications, think of all the culinary innovation that can happen there. Take that and then apply it to the localized innovation, which is dishes, just preparation, which is form. This is really a global opportunity.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It was Silicon Valley that was a real -- sort of the game changer here, the innovator, because I feel like the interest, the innovation, it's all kicked off over the last four or five years. And now we're all talking about the alternatives out there.</p><p>And it's not just for people who are vegans, it's for people who want to be healthier or worried about overfishing in oceans. I mean, there's many reasons to look at alternatives here.</p><p>KERR: Yes, so it's a mega trend because there's lots of different levers that are being pulled. So, it's not just a hungry vegan like me who's an animal guy. This could be, you know, someone who is lactose intolerant, or allergen or religion or diet or likes climate, you know, those are lots of different levers that are pulling that that's why it's a mega trend and not a fad.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How big is this market now? Because I've seen you use a great example of plant-based milk, and that was one percent of the overall market ten years ago. Now, it's 10 percent of the market and they're everywhere.</p><p>If we go back to meat specifically, or plant-based meats, how big is the industry now and how big do you see it growing perhaps over that time horizon?</p><p>KERR: Well, the industry is small, it's a couple of billion dollars. The opportunity is over a trillion dollars. You're talking about disrupting the cab business with Uber, that's maybe $35 billion to $40 billion industry. We're talking about a trillion dollars that's global.</p><p>That's how I look at the market, because that's the way we're heading. Right now, you look at seafood as an example. Large fish still have to be hunted. It's one of the few foods that we actually still have to hunt. We go to very long distances to get there.</p><p>The market is really big when you look at all the different applications that come with it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I saw an interesting survey, Americans will need to cut their average consumption of beef by around 40 percent, Europeans by 22 percent for the world to continue to feed the 10 billion people expected to live on the planet by 2050.</p><p>So, you can list a whole number of reasons why you have to do this, but that's kind of a necessity, quite frankly.</p><p>KERR: Time is not on our side. We have a lot of things that are in crisis mode. You know, you look at collapsing seafood stocks. You've got land aggregation, climate change, healthcare, diabetes, you're looking at entire nations.</p><p>You look at the correlation between diabetes and the rise of pork in China, it's ridiculously close. Those types of things should be concerning to most consumers. You also have a more educated consumer now. Right? They're catching on to the options, but at the end of the day, we make decisions around food based on price, awareness, convenience, and taste. Taste is the driver. Everything else falls in after that.</p><p>So, we have to solve all four of those things. If you look at what Beyond Meat is doing, we look at what Good Catch is doing, a few others, Impossible -- solving all four of those things, but they have -- it takes time to do it.</p><p>And it's not going to be as fast as milk, it will take a little bit longer because we're not tapping into an infrastructure that milk was able to do. We're dealing with an entirely new supply chain.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I have to get you back to talk more about this because I could keep you talking for half an hour, but very quickly because it is a question that I get, yes or no? Is a meat, a plant-based alternative healthier than a meat version?</p><p>KERR: Well, I think it is. It depends on how you eat. Now, I could eat nothing but Skittles and Mountain Dew every day and still be a vegan. That doesn't solve the problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Burger to burger.</p><p>KERR: That's right. But you can eat everything from a very, very simple quinoa burger all the way up to the most complex, you know, Impossible Beyond burger. There's a whole spectrum in there. Consumers get to decide that. We do that today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Chris, we will get you back.</p><p>KERR: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Chris Kerr, the Chief Investment Officer at New Crop Capital. Great conversation.</p><p>All right, still ahead, after hundreds of hours of training, seeing four million other players, and quite a few arguments with his mother, we will have the details of the latest eSports star millionaire. That's coming up.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And that was the moment a 16-year-old gamer became a multimillionaire, in case you missed it. The Tour de France wasn't the only major international sporting event this weekend. Video Game, Fortnite held its first ever World Cup right here in New York in front of a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium, and an online audience of more than a million fans.</p><p>American teenager, Kyle Giersdorf beat 100 other players to take home a very cool $3 million. Incidentally, and for competitive purposes, the winner of the Tour de France, Egan Bernal took home $550,000.00. Some difference.</p><p>Clare Sebastian is here with more. Clare, you know, when I saw this story, I can hear my mother saying to my brother, \"You will never make your millions playing computer games.\" Oh, how wrong she could have been.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Talk us through.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I think we're all in the wrong job, Julia. You can take $3 million by just basically sitting in a chair and playing a video game.</p><p>But the really shocking thing about this is, is the staggering size of this event itself. $30 million was the total size of the prize pool. You actually got $50,000.00 just for qualifying for the finals. Every player went home with at least $50,000.00, although they did have to qualify over 10 weeks, three million, the first prize, obviously.</p><p>There were 40 million players who took part in the qualification process over those 10 weeks. And all of this contributes, of course, to the valuation of Epic Games, which the latest estimate we've got on that from last year is $15 billion.</p><p>But of course, there are small numbers to take note of as well, Julia, and those were the ages of the players. Many of them younger than 16. The oldest -- among the oldest was the third placing player who was 24, considered elderly in this world.</p><p>So, this is a game that's turning teenagers into millionaires overnight, some of them considering making this a career. And of course, the bottom line of all of this is that Fortnite is free.</p><p>It's become this multibillion dollar Empire by reaching this incredibly wide audience. They're having almost zero dollar barrier to entry.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, there's so many things in there. By the time you're 25, you're completely past it, judging by the rankings here.</p><p>But also the amount of time that goes into preparing for one of these. I mean, they stream -- they stream this game on a weekly basis, in some cases 80 hours a week of playing computer games, in order to get good enough to compete here. Is that right?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: That's right. Certainly, players have told CNN that that does get in the way of the school, if they're young enough to still be at school. But this is something that it's not just Fortnite, but people have begun to turn video games into careers. They are helped obviously, by platforms like YouTube, by Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.</p><p>We know that content creators are already making careers out of YouTube. But this is something that I find really staggering about video games. It's no longer just to play a sport. It's a spectator sport as well. And that's why eSports is becoming such a big deal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, a million viewers. Incredible. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that. Yes, alternative career choice, not me.</p><p>All right. Let me bring up you to speed with today's \"Boardroom Brief.\"</p><p>Ryanair has posted a 21 percent drop in quarterly profits. The Irish airline says it has cut prices to stimulate demand, especially in Germany and the United Kingdom.</p><p>CEO Michael O'Leary has also taken a swipe at Boeing over the grounding of its 737 MAX jets, saying the plane maker has to get it \"beep\" together with regulators. Wow.</p><p>[09:55:10] CHATTERLEY: Shares, Heineken sinking the most in eight years after it missed its profits target. The world's second largest beer maker reported operating profit of $1.97 billion. But analyst expected over $2 billion. It's currently down some five and a half percent.</p><p>The London Stock Exchange Group is trading up more than 15 percent. It comes after the company confirmed it's in talks to by financial data provider, Refinitiv for $27 billion, including debt. Analysts are welcoming the deal while warning it will likely face significant regulatory hurdles.</p><p>And we've got a quick programming note, CNN is hosting the next 2020 Democratic debates. They'll be live on CNN on Tuesday and Wednesday and coverage begins at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time here in the U.S., but you can see encore presentations at 7:00 a.m. London, 2:00 p.m. Hong Kong time the day after, only on CNN.</p><p>And that just about wraps it up for the show. Plenty more to come. I'll be back in a couple of hours' time on \"The Express,\" but for now, you've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. Have a great Monday.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019072901cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP7-PGH1-JB20-G083-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000214H</classCode><className>PFIZER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS325411 MEDICINAL &amp;

In America today the political landscape is shifting. That is the natural result of polarization. The underlying truth is that over the last few decades a billion people worldwide have lifted themselves out of poverty. </p><p>This happened because capitalism was deployed with globalization of markets. The greatest benefits accrued in China and the emerging markets of Asia. This is a good thing. But a lot has changed in a short period of time. In America and many Western countries the incomes of the average person has stagnated or even declined over the same period. Many Americans voted for Trump because the global economy has not been working for them. Their standard of living is being reduced. Pretending that this is a false perception ignores reality. There are clear divisions today between those who can live anywhere, and those who live somewhere; a point made by Stephen Harper, author of 'Right Here, Right Now: Politics and Leadership in the Age of Disruption'.  Are you an anywhere? If you work for Big Tech, an international bank, or a multi-national firm you can wake up in New York, London, or Singapore and feel equally at home. Your work is not threatened by import competition. You are the disruptor unaffected by technological dislocation. You support all international trade agreements. High levels of immigration and worker mobility work to your benefit and seem the norm. You are part of the group who can live anywhere. You are affluent and your standard of living has been going up. Make no mistake; there are a lot of these people.  Are you a somewhere? But there are a lot more of us completely unlike them. We work in a factory, own a small business, or are in retail sales. Outsourcing, cheap imports and technological change have disrupted our work. Our children attend the local schools. Nearby we have aging parents. Our social life is connected to a local church, sports team, or community group. When things go badly at our company we can't just shift our life to somewhere else. If policy choices by politicians turn out to be wrong we cannot just pick up stakes. Like it or not, we depend on the economic policies of our state and national governments. When they don't come through, we're not happy. And when they ignore us, we get angry. A lot of us are feeling pretty angry. Can't we all just get along? It's easy for anywheres to dismiss these concerns. But the anywheres' faith in global solutions and multi-national political bodies is based more on fantasy than fact. What we know is the fact of our daily reality. The critical functions of laws and regulations, monetary and fiscal stability, among other things, are provided by nations, not global institutions. Therein lies the rub. America, with all its flaws, is a concrete reality. The global community is a concept. But it has been the anywheres, with their faith in globalization who have been dominating politics. That is, until now. The somewheres have started to awaken. There's a change coming and it is not limited to the United States. The same dynamic is playing out all across the Western world.  Populists are not the misguided, ignorant 'deplorables' depicted in media. They are us, our family, friends, and neighbors. The populists represent the interests of ordinary people. In a democratic system, the people are supposed to be our customers. We the people are the reason there is an America. We tend to be conservative. So what is conservative? Conservatism is grounding ourselves in tried and true values, things that have been tested and found to work. The issues that concern the somewheres and their families must be addressed. These are the ordinary people. Their issues include market economics, trade, globalization, and immigration because they affect putting bread on the table and a roof over their head.  In addressing these issues, the conservative approach is pro-free market, pro-trade, pro-globalization and pro-immigration, legal immigration. We are for the rule of law and innocent until proven guilty. Due process is necessary not just nice. We are logical and consistent. We love people and life, all life, born and unborn, young and old. Being pro-market does not mean that all regulations should be dismantled. But it does not accept that all regulation is beneficial. Conservative does not mean governments should never intervene to protect workers. Nor does it mean every government subsidy is a necessary expenditure. Being pro-trade does not imply that every trade agreement is a good one.  Conclusion: Abdicating loyalty or responsibility to our country and our local community is not required for being pro-globalization. Being pro-immigration should never mean sanctioning illegal immigration, erasing our borders, or ignoring the interests of our citizens. Conservatism is about seeing the world as it is which tends to be populist because it is about serving the people we know rather than social theories. Are you a closet conservative?

(Wittgenstein, 1998: p 5e)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p>The occasion of the thirtieth anniversary conference of the Society of Existential Analysis presents an opportunity to look back on the history of the Society, but also to look forward. If such a thing is feasible, this paper proposes looking forward thirty years to where we might be and what challenges we may face in the work that we do. To look so far into the future might seem, and probably is, a wholly foolhardy proposition, as Wittgenstein suggests in the epigraph. The wondering of this paper is, in the spirit of Foucault's (2003: pp 1-2) lectures at the College de France, a form of sharing or a report on the direction of reading and research undertaken by me over the past year or so. This comes about because of the strange situation in which I find myself, located in Dubai, a relentlessly modern urban environment rushing toward a future that seems more nakedly visible, as it bursts forth the desert, than it might seem in the more historically cluttered world of London and the United Kingdom.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to open up, tentatively, glimpses of futures. I hope that this might help us, as predominantly existential psychotherapists, consider some of the changes that the horizon of the world may bring into view over the next thirty years. Heidegger uses some powerful language to convey a sense that Being-in-the-world is not just about the becoming of Dasein, but also about the interaction of that becoming with the 'worlding' of the world (e.g. Heidegger, 1977: p 49 and 1971: p 44). In other words, we live our lives and in doing so we are indivisibly changing and evolving as the world around us constantly changes and evolves. At the onset of life, our thrownness (Heidegger, 1962/1927: p 174) in the world is total; we have no choice but to find it as it is. As we move through life, and the totality of thrownness abates, it does so less than we might sense because the world into which we were originally thrown also evolves in ways over which we have little or no control or even discernment. This sense is especially powerful in the writing and thought of existentialists all the way back to Kierkegaard and the early nineteenth century. In retrofitting Heidegger's language back into the world of Kierkegaard and the earlier existential writers, the velocity with which the worlding of the world occurs has the capacity to overwhelm the becoming of Dasein--the single 'one' against the march of history is not a fair fight.</p><p>As we move deeper into the twenty-first century there appears to be no abatement in the influence of science and technology to empower and enrich our lives but also to envelop us with new existential challenges. These challenges have names like Climate Change, Overpopulation, Resource Depletion, Nuclear Terrorism, Biowarfare, the Singularity. At the macro-societal level it is not clear that these issues are being very effectively confronted at present. At the micro-level, at the level of Dasein as individual in the world, there is a well established and evolving set of propositions and practices that can help individuals navigate their experiences in the world and they are collectively called existentialism, phenomenology and, to help those who feel the burden of living more than others, existential-phenomenological psychotherapy. Which is also to say that, in turbulent times, the problems of mental health do not exist solely in a skull-sized ecological niche of behavioural and neuro-scientific explanation, or in the microcosmic niche of the family and its complicated psychodynamics, but in a world-sized niche abundant in confusion and challenge over the matters of history, identity, meaning, dignity and futurity.</p><p>This is an impossibly complex and rapidly changing context that compounds the foolhardiness of such a future-faced venture as this paper. One only has to think back to the year of the founding of the SEA and recall the world of 1988. This was the bipolar world of the USSR and NATO. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were still in power. Who had a mobile phone (a very small number of people)? Or was connected to the World Wide Web (no one, it was not invented, as we know it, until 1992)? However, this was not a stable or predictable world. Great shifts in geo-politics were already becoming evident although, and this is no real surprise, no one could have predicted the colossal instabilities that would be created by the twin events of the collapse of the old Soviet Bloc and the rise of digital technology. These events are the curves and changes in direction that Wittgenstein describes and that should cousel us away from seeing the future as merely the progression from where we are to where we 'should be' thirty years from now.</p><p>To assist in the endeavor of making sense of what might happen over the next thirty years, and how these possible developments might impact on the being of Dasein differently from, say, the clearly existential threat of climate change, I propose to select some technological drivers of change that are already impacting our lives and the world (Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Networks and Advanced Healthcare), and examine how they will influence certain key dimensions of ordinary living (Work, Identity and Urban Living). And, finally, to describe in brief three future scenarios of life in 2048 considering the interaction of technological (r)evolution with Being and becoming. The drivers of future life that I have chosen are those that, as yet, pose something of a mystery in terms of their potential to disclose a linear worlding of the world and thus to pose new dilemmas for Dasein.</p><p>PART I--A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</p><p>I have drawn on a number of sources from the existential literature and from some writers and thinkers who might be described as existential fellow-travellers, sympathizers, contemporary commentators and philosophers, who also draw from the well-springs of continental philosophy and often from specifically existential inspirations.</p><p>Three views of the future</p><p>The French philosopher and anthropologist Michel Auge (2014) proposes two views of how the future evolves and I, inspired by Auge and by Dante (1996), suggest a third view.</p><p>1. Succession</p><p>Auge (2014: p 3) describes a view of the future that is an extrapolation of what we see, experience and understand about the past and present and that we believe will evolve into the future in more or less discernible ways--trends and signs in the present can be seen as reliable way markers to the future. This is a way of looking at the future that Wittgenstein (1998) clearly criticizes when he comments 'it doesn't occur to us...' that the future cannot be so easily predicted (see epigraph). It is also the view of history that psychoanalytic and psychologistically based schools of psychotherapy espouse in their models of childhood development into adulthood. There are aspects of life that we can more or less entertain as predictable in order for us to be able to plan a future at all. There are also significant political dimensions to this view of the future in the form of a proposed human right--a right to a future tense, or futurity as Zuboff (2019: p 329) describes--the right for the world not to be so chaotic and unpredictable that all sense of a future becomes obscured in doubt, fear and precarious living.</p><p>2. Inauguration</p><p>Alternatively, Auge (2014: p 19) describes a future that is a rupture from the past and is therefore essentially unknowable because innovation and change is so rapid, so profound and so disturbing as to make prediction over anything other than a very short term, nonsensical, even as an exercise in constructive misunderstanding (to which I hope that this paper aspires, for example). There is reason to believe that the future, as currently imagined, has strong elements of an inauguration, and extrapolation can take place only over truncated time frames. Within this framework of thinking, the question arises of whether we can speak meaningfully of a future for the existential phenomenological tradition of psychotherapy, except in the starkest of, quite literally, existential terms.</p><p>3. Culmination</p><p>Auge's two views of the future are, I believe, based on the notion that history will continue indefinitely to be a dynamic process of unfolding of the human-focused set of narratives about the past, present and potential futures of humankind. However there is a scenario, which I name a 'culmination', where humanity, as we understand it now, comes to an end point--not necessarily a catastrophic one--but perhaps we might think of it as a stasis, beyond which human level evolution is no longer possible, desirable and/or necessary. The notion is inspired by Dante's visions of Inferno (Hell) and Paradiso (Heaven), as end points beyond which further travel is impossible. As we will see later, there are some ideas for a post-human future that have the flavor of an inauguration and a culmination --one thinks specifically of the Singularity (Kurzweil, 2005) or, a bit less dramatically, the ideology of post-humanism and techno-humanism (e.g. Braidotti, 2013).</p><p>Heidegger and the Concepts of Enframing and Standing Reserve</p><p>Heidegger's ideas expounded in, among other places, The Question Concerning Technology (1977), are important. In particular, the rapid and deeply penetrative deployment of complex, networked, intelligent and self-improving digital systems to modulate, enable, empower (at many levels), assist and resist Dasein, singly and at the levels of whole populations, will markedly alter our ideas of Being. Two concepts stand out as especially important in Heidegger's thinking on technology, that of Enframing and of the Standing Reserve.</p><p>Enframing (Gestell) (1977: p 19) attempts to encapsulate the idea that technology does not merely represent the creative efforts of Dasein to deploy artifice and efficiency to shape, control, explore and exploit its environment, as a means to an end (safety, security, comfort, wealth), but that the ongoing invention of technology and the interaction with technology, as it evolves over time, becomes in itself a mode of Being for Dasein. This occurs on at least three levels:</p><p>1. Technology (one might describe this as the 'how' of 'know-how') is the product of techne, the 'know-how', to enable certain modes of living and in particular enable greater efficiency, safety, sophistication and speed in living.</p><p>2. Techne, and its prosthetic manifestations in technology, becomes a framework for exploring and exploiting the world as it is continuously encountered by Dasein--one need only think of how the world discloses itself differently to those who explore their surroundings only on foot, or then by horse, or by motorized vehicle, or by aeroplane or by spacecraft, to think of how the world opens up to Dasein in different ways, and once experienced, cannot then be unexperienced.</p><p>3. The Being of Dasein interacting with technology and constantly enhancing techne compounds through innovation, the ideology of innovation and the acceleration of innovation. This portends a sense that Being can only be revealed to Dasein through the constant deployment and refinement of technology, and ceases to be Being. Being and Dasein are therefore in danger of estrangement (1977: p 27). Dasein begins to lose sight of the framework for what it is, which is a kind of manifestation of 'falling' (gefallenheit), a drifting through space and time inattentive to the multiplicity of dynamics at play between the world and the frame. I want to be mindful at this point not to be drawn into contentious issues of authenticity and what real 'Being' might consist of, but instead note that, to borrow a phrase from Anthony Trollope (1994), 'The Way We Live Now', in 2018, does not closely resemble the way we lived in 1988, let alone in 1518, 1018 or 18BCE.</p><p>Heidegger's secondary concept of the Standing Reserve (1977: p 17) might be thought of as the view of the world through the window of technology, where the world is regarded as 'stock' (Standing Reserve), ready-to-hand for exploitation and disposal, much as a forester would view the forest as a source of wood for multiple uses. The ideology of technology encourages a view of the World as tractable, useful and composed of mute resources. For the most part this fact is simply how it is--humankind exploits its environments in order to survive and then to thrive. This exploitation becomes problematic when the resources of the environment become over-exploited and the results of exploitation lead to the activation of adverse feedback mechanisms such as conflict, climate change or, more relevant here, when the exploitation of the environment evolves to include, or turn on, Dasein itself.</p><p>Bernard Stiegler and the Economy of Traceology</p><p>Bernard Stiegler (2016: p 101) explores the idea of the modern economy of traceology that increasingly envelops our daily existences and enmeshes us in the frame of technology. Heidegger's ideas of Enframing retain the potential for the preservation of recognition between Being and Dasein, i.e. that estrangement is not total and that some disclosure of Being is still possible, albeit in what a Heideggerian commentator views as a kind of photographic negative (Lovitt in Heidegger, 1977: p xxxvi)--a being that is not Being but still allows a glimpse of how Being can manifest and be experienced. Stiegler explores how this potential for recognition could be eclipsed by exploitation of the economy of traceology leading to the overwhelming of what he describes as noetic faculties (Steigler, 2016: p 42) and the short-circuiting of the process of trans-individuation (ibid: p 200). Stiegler draws upon and extends Husserl's work on the phenomenology of sense perception and memory, and in particular his notions of primary, secondary and tertiary retentions (ibid: p 31).</p><p>Think of the experience of listening to and remembering a piece of music. The primary retention, or primary act, of memory formation is that of listening in the moment to the music, following it and becoming familiar with it as it plays. The secondary retention is the memory that you may have of the music in your mind and body the day after and the day after that. The tertiary retention is a recording of the music, either in audio form, say on a tape or vinyl record, or in sheet music form--the important distinction here is that the music has now become externalized from memory in perfect analogue form, rendered permanent and frozen in its performance for multiple reiterations and faithful prosthetic remembrances. From here, Stielger (ibid: p 17) now extends the classification of retentions to take account of digital technology unknown to Husserl. Tertiary retentions become digital; computer coded into binary data and, therefore, infinitely replicable at no extra cost and capable of highly compressed and efficient storage. Finally, tertiary digital retentions become 'reticulated' (2016: p 14), capable of being networked and therefore capable of almost instant and infinite distribution through networks--the networks, of course, being the dense, widespread, evolving systems of communication, operating 24/7, which connect nearly all of us via smart phones, tablet computers, the internet, World Wide Web, the burgeoning internet of things and the other subsystems of the digitally enabled world.</p><p>Some implications of this phenomenology of technology are becoming clearer. Not only can the digital universe operate as a supremely efficient means of collecting, recording, storing, organizing, replicating and distributing information, whatever it may be--books, music, photographs, film, video, software, conversation, news, events, journalism, friendship networks--but these systems now have the power to record, retain and analyze ongoing information about how we interact with every aspect of the network. All traces of our movement and behavior in the digital universe, whether or not we are aware of it, or have consented to it, are capable of being retained and exploited by computational networks and the organizations that operate and own them. Who has time to read privacy consent forms, let alone negotiate a better deal for the exploitation of our personal user history (see Zuboff, 2019: pp 48-50)? The ceding of this data, which Stiegler calls 'traces' and that others call 'digital exhaust' or 'behavioral surplus' (ibid: p 8), to third parties, creates an economy of traceology (Stiegler, 2016: p 101). The sense of economy here being not only a reference to the (lucrative) business of buying and selling these traces, but also refers to the general environment in which such information can be collected with impunity and used in feed-back loops to nudge our behavior in the digital world. And as we spend increasing amounts of time in the digital world or as the frame through which we increasingly view life becomes ubiquitously screen-shaped, the nudging becomes more or less constant.</p><p>Symbolic Misery</p><p>Within the economy of digital reticulated traces, Stiegler identifies two important processes bearing on Being and a consequent outcome that flows from these processes. The processes are Proletarianization (ibid: p 30 et passim) and Automatization (ibid: p 20) leading to the outcome of symbolic misery (Stiegler, 2014: p 1). The first of these processes, Proletarianization, is a rapid de-skilling of many forms of work. Originally, this process was a mechanical one in which the artisanal skills used in many forms of manual or semi-manual work were translated from humans into machines--the powered looms of the industrial revolution are an example of the proletarianization of hand-weaving (Stiegler, 2016: p 160). In the evolving digital world, this process can now be applied to a great many non-manual/intellectual tasks such as financial management, auditing, large amounts of legal work, teaching, medical diagnostics, traffic management, crime detection; so many fields of work in fact, that over the next thirty years who will not have to ask the question 'Can my job be digitized/automated?'. The implications for the world of work are profound and the implications for work as a central feature of Dasein's experience of the world, as we have hitherto understood it, can and will change considerably.</p><p>Furthermore, the speed with which digital networks can operate, has the potential, according to Stiegler to overwhelm the reflective capabilities or, to use his phrase, the noetic faculties (p 42) of users, not only as workers, but as consumers (2016: p 297n). His thinking here suggests that the migration of so much of the business of living into the online world both proletarianizes the skills of workers but also automatizes the behaviours of individuals in their online existences to an increasingly alarming degree. The speed with which, for example, adverts and recommendations for further purchases can be fed to us on the screen as we go about the daily rituals of our online lives, is faster than we can think about these things in the offline world. The dream of digital corporations is to be able to anticipate our desires and needs and meet them before we have time for reflection (and to some extent they are succeeding). Data travels in the fibre optic network at about half the speed of light, many thousands of times faster than reflective conscious thinking in the human brain or the reflexes of the nervous system. Stiegler contends that the speed of delivery of data to our screens for our central and peripheral attention encourages a kind of digital nihilism, whereby one ceases to reflect on one's desires and requirements and on the balance of needs that must be met, and instead simply act by clicking, because the thinking has been outsourced to the network. In the end, there is no longer any need to do the hard work of paying attention.</p><p>These processes culminate in Symbolic Misery which Stiegler (2014) sees as a de-skilling of creativity completing the process of manual de-skilling accelerated by the industrial revolution. Symbolic Misery is an impoverishment of sensibility, of judgment, of the ability to hold in mind an alternative model of living, other than that of consumer and spectator, as one transacts life in the world of tertiary, digital and reticulated data. Stiegler writes, '[Symbolic Misery]...ultimately leads to the ruin of all economy whatsoever, when,[...], speculative marketing, under direct shareholder control, becomes hegemonic and systematically exploits the drives, which are thereby divested of all attachment' (2016: p 20). These processes eventually stall the work of becoming or, in Stiegler's terminology, of individuation. Not only does the digital environment de-skill us but then becomes so familiar with our, by now, de-skilled individuality, such as it might now be, that it then removes the requirement for us even to contemplate what needs and desires we might wish to pursue as a matter of constructive choice--we are merely reduced to curated menu selection. I acknowledge at this point there is a certain level of exaggeration being performed for the extrapolation of present trends into a dim future.</p><p>Enormous quantities of data about our online behaviour, our contacts, friends, reading habits, search interests, credit ratings, shopping histories, viewing foibles and so forth are now known to governmental and commercial organizations remote from our ordinary, but not daily, experience. What is it now like to know that so much of our daily activity is surveilled, recorded, stored, analyzed and then acted upon by remote and opaque organizations? What is it like for those who were not born into the digital age of ubiquitous computing (I was born in 1964) compared to those, say, born from 2000 onward, and who know little of the world before the internet. What existential issues arise for therapists and clients as users of therapy, to become increasingly enmeshed in the digital world and to become increasingly transparent in our ways of Being to an audience of corporations and governmental organizations? In other words, what is it like to become as 'Standing Reserve' whose online words and deeds are the stock-in-trade for commercial organizations to harvest and governmental organisations to regulate?</p><p>Rosie Braidotti and Post-Humanity</p><p>If Bernard Stiegler provides some useful tools to try and imagine the hyper-technologized and hyper-connected world of a digital future, then Rosie Braidotti, another contemporary philosopher with an eye to the future of the human condition, attempts to provide some tools to think about the evolution of human identity in a more visceral, embodied way. This becomes very interesting when we consider how medical science might evolve over the next thirty years, and in particular, the efforts radically to prolong healthy life, as well as the increasing sophistication which will be brought to bear on the physical and chemical/genetic modification of human bodies and minds in vitro, in infancy and in later stages of life.</p><p>Braidotti reminds us that, at the height of the Cold War and the nuclear armed confrontation between the Soviet Union and NATO, Bertrand Russell posed the question: 'Has Man a Future?' (2013: p 6). The question was articulated in this very specific manner, and Braidotti, while acknowledging its continuing relevance as a question in the post-Cold War era, picks up on some nuances of wording to broaden the saliency of the question. Russell posed the question in the face of potential global nuclear annihilation and the end of the species of humanity. Braidotti poses the question with a number of different variations:</p><p>1. The future of Man qua the ideologies of maleness, Western-ness, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and the Humanistic project, embodied, for her, in da Vinci's idealized image of Vitruvian man;</p><p>2. The existential threat to the future of the human species posed by problems such as climate change;</p><p>3. The future of the integrity of the human subject in a machine age --Becoming-Machine; and</p><p>4. The future of human subjectivity in a digitally hyper-enabled world.</p><p>The latter two of these variants are of especial interest in my proposed creation of scenarios for the future. However, all of these re-framings of the original Russellian question, and others that Braidotti explores, circle around the core issue of the unravelling of dated and rigid notions of identity, previously dependent on only a few ('acceptable') categories, particularly of gender, race and sexuality.</p><p>In rehearsing important propositions and assumptions about Humanism and Anti-Humanism, Braidotti arrives, dialectically, at her departure point for the rest of her thesis on Post-Humanism with the idea that the proper study of Post-Humanity is the Post-Human. In the course of this theoretical set-up, the concept of 'Individualism' as an 'intrinsic part of \"human nature\"...' (ibid: p 24), is questioned as culturally and historically localized to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment. The critique of these ideas is itself controversial, for example in attempting to undermine the notion of the sense that each individual has of being the person who experiences who they are, because no one else can. This is a strand of philosophizing that attempts to hollow out the sense of self, and the integrity of the experience of being an individual as both passive and active participant in living or Being. It has its corollary in the closet ideology of the commercial digital corporations of our age who would want to bypass our personal sense of agency and remove all friction, including our sense of resistance, from the serving of our needs and desires. However, Braidotti's critical stance toward Enlightenment notions of the individual and human nature are not of the same nihilistic order but are meant to signpost the way to new and more creative ways of constructing participative, flexible, ecologically sensitive and multi-layered identities.</p><p>Nevertheless, with the rapidly increasing amount of our lives that is now recorded, stored and analyzed on a daily basis, there is an argument for examining the hypothesis that we are, nearly all of us, creating, curating and having created for us, digital doubles in the realm of cyberspace. There is a case to say that we are no longer just ourselves but also our digital history, which we author, like a book, every day. But also, like a book, once published we authors no longer have full, or even much, control over the history that our digital traces record. Not only governments, but especially commercial entities can now record and store data-fied versions of our behaviour and actions at a quality of granularity in time that is less than second-by-second.</p><p>At another level, the anti-Humanistic project of undermining the sense of the individual as a self is also recognition of the reality of 'unprecedented degrees of intimacy and intrusion' (ibid: p 89) that we now experience in our relationship with technology. For Braidotti, this presents the Post-Human with an aporia that forces a re-examination of 'ontological categories, for instance between the organic and the inorganic, the born and the manufactured, flesh and metal, electronic circuits and organic nervous systems' (ibid: p 89).</p><p>Finally, Braidotti's concept of 'spiritual death' is of interest. This concept accompanies and amplifies the call to re-examine ontological categories. Certain activities and states of being, such as '...addictions, eating disorders, melancholia, burn-out and states of apathy and disaffection...' are described as '...embodied social practices...' using a language that removes these words from the language practices of medical pathology, and re-appropriates them for the language of '...neutral manifestations of interactions with and resistance to the political economy of commodification of all that live' (ibid: p 114). This was written before the scale of the opioid crisis in the United States was fully understood (even if it is now?), but within this earlier context Braidotti is already talking of the blurring of lines between self-destructive and fashionable behaviour presented by choices of legal drugs such as Prozac and Ritalin and illegal drugs. It was also written before the scale of personal data harvesting, to which we are all now subject, became clear.</p><p>These ideas present a contemporary take on the alienation of the individual that is a familiar trope of the existential critiques of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Marcuse and French existentialism. The twenty-first century has magnified both the scale of the problem and the mechanisms by which it is effected and sustained. We are becoming our data, but we do not own or have access, in large part, to that data.</p><p>PART II--DRIVERS OF CHANGE</p><p>Artificial Intelligence</p><p>If we hold the potential global crises of climate change, political instability, population growth, mass migration, resource depletion beyond the scope of this paper and known already as existential risks, then Artificial Intelligence (AI), or machine intelligence has the greatest potential to impact the way of life that we currently experience. It has the potential to threaten the tenure of large sectors of the white-collar workforce over the next thirty years and, combined with robotics, much of the remaining blue-collar work force. Lest we think that the intensely human activity of psychotherapy is immune from the potential for disruption through the application of artificial intelligence, then recall that even in the early 1970s AI had advanced enough to be able to impersonate convincingly the responses of a Rogerian psychotherapist (although convincing to whose satisfaction is another question!) (Bostrom, 2014: p 6). In the present, projects such as BINA48, owned and designed by Martine Rothblatt's Terasem Movement, have already reached a point where a free-standing (i.e. not connected to the internet for the duration of the experiment), AI-enabled unit can deliver a lecture at undergraduate level and conduct a credible Q&amp;A session afterwards without scripting or foreknowledge of questions (Atkinson, 2018). As a vision of a future thirty years distant, imagine a holographic projection of the 'ideal therapist' able to respond to any given situation in a therapy room--assuming, of course, that not all psychotherapeutic interventions have been, by then, reified solely as neurochemical or neurophysical problems for exclusive treatment by pills or neurosurgical intervention.</p><p>This is not to say that mass unemployment is the future. Some estimates of the likely impact of the progressive rollout of AI applications in the workplace put the percentage of workers that will be displaced at levels below 20% (Manyika and Sneader, 2018: p 8). Alarming though this may sound, there are worse scenarios envisaged, partly driven by the fact that, at present, there is very little sense of what alternative meaningful and remunerative work might be created to offset losses. This lack of a future clarity adds to the many other factors that are creating an acute sense of uncertainty in the present age.</p><p>AI and AGI</p><p>At present, but with an eye to the future, it is important understand some basic terminology of AI. AI itself can be defined as follows:</p><p>1. Any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence using logic, if-then rules, decision trees and machine learning, including deep learning, where;</p><p>2. Machine learning is a subset of AI that includes abstruse statistical techniques that enable machines to improve at tasks with experience. This also includes;</p><p>3. Deep Learning, the sub-set of machine learning utilizing algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks like speech and image recognition, by exposing multi-layered neural networks to vast amounts of data; and where</p><p>4. A Neural Network is a framework or grid that allows multiple different machine learning algorithms to work together to perform complex data analysis.</p><p>(Quora.com, 2018)</p><p>It is debatable whether existing AI capabilities have yet passed the famous Turing Test, whereby an artificially created, machine-based intelligence has convincingly mimicked human responsive behavior indistinguishable from those of a real human. Nevertheless, AI is already capable of certain much narrower tasks that far exceed the capabilities of the human mind in both speed, complexity and range of data processing--these capabilities include playing chess and Go, processing and analyzing vast ranges of machine ready data for forecasting, behavioural analysis across populations, financial analysis and stock trading, scientific and engineering modelling, mapping and location analysis, and AI is getting extremely good at language translation, speech recognition and image recognition and will continue to improve.</p><p>Further into the future but believed by some experts to be within the thirty-year time horizon used here (Bostrom, 2014: p 19), AI has the potential to evolve to become AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, which Bostrom describes as having the following features:</p><p>1. A capacity to learn;</p><p>2. An ability to deal effectively with uncertainty and probabilistic information;</p><p>3. An ability to extract useful concepts from sensory data and internal states; and</p><p>4. A capacity to leverage acquired concepts into flexible combinatorial representations for use in logical and intuitive reasoning (ibid: p 23).</p><p>Bostrom describes a number of R&amp;D pathways that might achieve the goal of AGI, with the most likely thought to be via continuing innovation in machine-based computing including the evolution of ever-more sophisticated programming and the creation of powerful algorithms thereby enabled, as well as further increases in the raw speed, power and data holding capacity of future computing. One culmination point for this project is to create the first artificial entity that achieves levels of capability across all dimensions of human intelligence, which allied to the brute force of machine-based computing, then has the capacity to quickly transcend human intelligence through its immensely powerful recursive learning capabilities. Something like this is envisaged as the famous 'Singularity' popularized by the computer guru and futurologist Ray Kurzweil in his book of the same name (2005). This has profound existential implications. However, not all AI practitioners are as certain about the prospects of being able to achieve AGI. Some believe it is going to take much longer and some believe it will never be possible. There are others who believe it will come more quickly as well, hence the balance of probabilities is currently set at around 2047 or someway between 2040-2055 (Bostrom, 2014; Tegmark, 2017).</p><p>One objection might be that AGI and human consciousness, whatever that might be, will never be the same thing. In particular, the argument that consciousness will simply emerge out of complexity, much like the first self-replicating organisms eventually emerged out of the increasingly complex chemistry of the early Earth, or human consciousness eventually emerged through the long march of evolutionary complexity, is a guess, or a hope, rather than a racing certainty. Another objection might be that it is actually the more limited capabilities of the human brain in terms of its powers to render intelligible its environment--and its embodiment in a particular locus at any given moment--that render meaning for a human in a way that an AGI entity cannot achieve. It is the very Being-there-ness, of Being that simply cannot be replicated by an AGI entity. The AGI cannot and will not experience the aspect of randomness in the thrownness of life --why this life rather than any other life? And cannot experience learning, growth and development in the many ways that a human being does, with our generally limited capacities for memory and recall, and which involve effort and pain and failure, as well as success and achievement. When recall is perfect and instantaneous, and can draw on ubiquitous sensory data and memory, where is the pain of doubt or of being found in error, and where is the pleasure of achieving understanding? These aspects of the Being of Dasein are rendered dead or useless by mechanical omniscience. The sentimental renderings of 'intelligent' robots as depicted in films such as Her (2013) or I, Robot (2004) can likely only ever be simulations of emotions that have no grounds in hope, doubt or pain. It may well turn out that pain, that most inconvenient of human sensations, is what is inimitable to a machine.</p><p>Big Data</p><p>In 2008, Chris Anderson, then the Editor of Wired, declared the death of theory. He argued that the integration of increasing amounts of digital data and the evolving sophistication of algorithmic analysis rendered redundant the need for theorizing about reasons and causes. One could simply crunch the numbers, so to speak, and watch as computers churned out the results of correlations in data sets that otherwise might never have been revealed or taken months, even years of researcher time to analyse and uncover. Myer-Schonburg and Cukier (2017: p 52) comment that, 'Knowing why might be pleasant [...] Knowing what, not why, is good enough'.</p><p>The World Wide Web has existed for twenty-five years and has witnessed colossal growth in numbers of users, quantity of usage and usefulness. The quantities of data available to online entities set up for its capture is also rapidly increasing and set to continue to do so as the so-called 'Internet-of-Things' grows and adds data-gathering devices to the network. Our homes and possessions will be increasingly networked. Household items such as fridges, thermostats, vacuum cleaners, cookers, children's toys, doorbells and televisions are already networkable, to say nothing of the growing market for home assistants such as Alexa, Siri or Cortana, as well as driverless cars. All these devices, and many more, are or will be connection-enabled so that some entity, a corporation with busy servers, will be learning something about the usage of those devices every time they are employed, and often when they are not.</p><p>Heidegger's (1977) concept of Enframing becomes particularly useful in this context because it provides a way to appreciate that the internet of Things extends, to a very great extent, the capacity for the 'datafication' of all life. Much daily activity is rendered as digital data into the network of digital life, and life itself is increasingly viewed only through the frame of the data that is captured. Foer (2017: p 76) captures the dangers of this process in his idea of the automation of thinking. We have already encountered this in Stiegler's related concept of automatization and the short-circuiting of noetic processes. High-profile corporations such as Amazon, Netflix or Facebook and their competitors and rivals aim to streamline choice on your behalf by attempting, through data capture and analysis, to understand what you like and do not like, when, where and how much, the better to then make suggestions for further consumption of similar products. So far, we broadly accept this--we give up the data of our online activity in return for convenience, cheapness, availability and a digital conveyor belt of new viewing/reading/listening suggestions. For how long we are prepared to accept this 'bargain' is a matter of debate.</p><p>In Human, All Too Human, Nietzsche writes:</p><p>'The significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it.' (1986: p 16)</p><p>Wittgenstein (2009: p 52e) extends this proposition in his idea of the bewitchment of language, a sense that the separate world of language can so enthral us as that we lose a sense of proportion of the world beyond or outside language. Robotics and advanced computer technology have extended this bewitchment further through the language of software--computer language(s) that aim to go beyond mere representation to replicating fully the real world in the form of algorithms. But once we become bewitched by the algorithms, what of the real world have we ditched in this headlong rush to datify, correlate and streamline living? Is it right that we should be increasingly nudged to act solely on the basis of correlation and not causation? And who, in the future, will be brave enough to offer reasons for why not? Let us also not forget the crucial issues of whether the algorithms themselves do not have 'baked' into them the highly idiosyncratic 'DNA'of early twenety-first century computing industry culture, or that the complexity of algorithms might already have become so opaque that even the most expert human overseers have no real idea of what they are doing and how.</p><p>Future Medicine</p><p>Among the many spheres of life affected by the growth of computing power is medical research. To be sure, it had an effective life before computing enabled it further, but the availability of increasingly powerful mechanisms to capture, store, analyze and act upon data, empower it further. Allied with a particular mindset driven by the highly instrumental, disruptive and problem-solving culture of Silicon Valley, certain paths of medical research are credibly extending into areas of radical longevity of life, bespoke body and brain repair and enhancement. The genetics revolution and nanotechnologies have the potential to repair any damage or abnormality in the body and maybe in the brain as well. Over time, and with the help of AI, we may be moving to a point where radical life extension is possible, or alternatively, the extension of healthy life within a less radically extended time frame. There may even be the possibility of a certain kind of digital immortality. If our bodies cannot be continuously repaired and revived, then some version of our 'souls', our memories, even our consciousness, perhaps, can be captured in some sort of brain scan and preserved indefinitely in 'living' digital form.</p><p>These developments, such as they might be, raise subtly different questions about who we are and what new pressures may be brought to bear on our sense of self and our collective identities, different from questions raised by our enmeshment in the digital world. As our online world increasingly frames our view of whatever is left of our offline world, and the trade-offs that might entail in the views of our freedoms in each of those domains, our physical selves may be increasingly liberated from senescence and decrepitude, and even be enhanced to levels beyond the physical norms of today. Ethical questions abound and are hotly debated.</p><p>It is not the place to rehearse those arguments here. But only to note a few future concerns such as:</p><p>* The ethics of super long life - have these been fully explored? What questions do these possibilities pose for the exploration of being-toward-death and the meaning that can be made of life?</p><p>* What do the possibilities of radical body alteration and body enhancement represent in terms of Dasein's struggle with their thrownness into the world, an aspect of which must include Dasein's genetic inheritance, as well as its expression through the environment in which body and mind grow and age.</p><p>* As the genetic revolution unfolds, perhaps along a certain path where embryos become increasingly carefully selected and modified to maximize health, vigour and mental prowess, do we risk a kind of reversion to an artificial genetic mean that fixes an early twenty-first century aesthetic in order to purchase certainty in the present rather than the flexibility of randomness into the future? Again, this poses questions about the bearing of Dasein toward the future if so much of the future has already been resolved at the genetic level--the nature of historicity and futurity subtly alters when genetic pre-determination becomes significantly alterable.</p><p>* If there is a pill for everything, or an army of nanobots to repair any damage caused by accident, illness or genetic malfunctioning, then what responsibility to ourselves do we continue to owe? Particularly in the field of psychotherapy, a pill to fix any mood tends to obviate, or undercut, the power of the healing struggle. Yet who would deny the opportunity to alleviate pain quickly and easily (and non-addictively) if it were possible? Our whole notions of healing, or helping in the repair and recuperation of others, is open to question, especially in an environment where a narrow idea of efficiency predominates.</p><p>* Finally, such developments as may become possible in these fields over the next thirty years will almost certainly be unequally available to those in need. For the wealthy, money is certainly more likely to buy the best of health and, in the future, will be key to the initial distribution of new body and mind enhancements. In a world where a few can essentially fulfil the fantasy of acquiring enhanced capabilities, what of the rest who cannot and may never be able to?</p><p>Richard Swann MA (Oxon.), MBA (Lond.), MA (UoW), ADEP, UKCP(reg) is a writer and thinker, currently living in Dubai, where the future seems to be very present.</p><p>Contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:richardmswann1@btinternet.com\">richardmswann1@btinternet.com</email></p><p>References</p><p>Anderson, C.

Welcome to the next edition of Insider Today. Please sign up here[1]. If you're enjoying this newsletter, please forward it on (What's \"Insider Today\"? Please see bottom for more detail.)SUMMARY: Be kind!</p><p> People are doing the best they can. Trump's Postal Service attack on Amazon is so wrong. Beware of \"pre-print\" studies that confirm your biases. Virus droplets can hang in the air for 14 minutes in a stagnant room. Wisconsinites flock to bars \u2014 yikes. News, business, life, and The Big 3. BLODGET &amp;#38; PLOTZBe kind. We're all doing the best we can. John Lamparski/Getty Images It's Friday. Here's good news.Life in a long pandemic will require titrating risk \u2014 not eliminating it and not ignoring it, but understanding it and taking it into account. We're getting better at that.As Aylin Woodward reports at Insider,[2] it's becoming clear how to stamp out superspreader events. Superspreading tends to occur when an infected person has significant close contact with a group of people from a variety of households \u2014 usually in a midsize or large gathering, almost always indoors, usually in a place with limited air circulation. Superspreader events have included parties, religious services, choir practices, and sporting events.We're starting to see how we can take measures to make ourselves safer \u2014 not safe! Americans in vast numbers are doing the right things, even without government orders.We've all but eliminated large gatherings. Many people are wearing masks, especially indoors. We're washing hands. Businesses are figuring out how to improve air circulation, distance employees, and space out customers.We're clearly anticipating \u2014 and accepting \u2014 moderate changes that will alter life until there's a vaccine: less travel, less mass entertainment, less gathering. And we're recognizing that these changes will savage some parts of the economy, like air travel, and cause massive adaptation in other parts, like dining out.The fundamental conflicts in society \u2014 economic, political, racial \u2014 haven't been healed by the pandemic, and probably have been exaggerated. Americans are anxious. Their jobs and livelihoods are in danger. So it's not surprising that we're seeing brawls over masking[3] and armed protests[4] about lockdowns.But the vast majority of us seek the same goal. We want to keep our loved ones safe from illness and be able to work and play. Except for a few people on the edges, there are no lockdown zealots who want to keep the country in cold storage forever and no reopen crazies who want to murder your grandmother.We're all in the murky middle, and now that we've been through the initial panic and know what we need to do to prevent death on a vast scale, we're ready for an ambiguous next stage.Our federal government has not really done its part to prepare and equip us, and that's tragic. But as citizens, we are all in the same boat. We're aware of the small and medium measures that will reduce risk \u2014 and the overwhelming majority of us are taking them.Michael Brendan Dougherty[5] puts this all beautifully in the National Review. We're not in a culture war, he says. Most of us are just trying to do what's right. So let's thank each other, and be generous:\"We are all muddling through, trying to live the best we can while this threat is out there. We are tempted to take out the frustration, anxiety, and anger these months have generated on each other. But what most of us need now is the mercy of basic kindness.\"\u2014DP Trump's Postal Service attack on Amazon is wrong Postal agencies globally are carrying more packages than letters. But, it's companies like UPS, FedEx, and Amazon who have truly seen a boon from e-commerce and the explosion of parcel volumes.  Justin Sullivan/Getty Images President Trump, who has never hidden his rage at The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, who is also the CEO of Amazon, now appears to have taken his campaign to harm Bezos to another, more disturbing level. The US Postal Service, now stacked with Trump-appointed officials, will review what it charges huge package shippers \u2014 notably Amazon[6] \u2014 perhaps as a prelude to hiking those rates and raising Amazon's costs.The USPS's last-mile contracts with Amazon and others may well be mediocre contracts \u2014 there are lots of smart arguments on both sides of the issue \u2014 but the salient fact here is that the president has shown zero interest in the US Postal Service except insofar as it's a club to bash Amazon. You may remember that two years ago Trump personally tried to strong-arm[7] the then postmaster general into doubling rates on Amazon.And of course that's not the only example of Trump's malice toward Bezos and Amazon. The Defense Department and Amazon are still fighting over a $10 billion cloud-computing contract that was seemingly yanked from Amazon after Trump made it clear he didn't want Amazon to get it.It's ridiculous to even have to say this, but it's wrong for a president to be picking winners and losers in any market. And it's monumentally wrong for the president to unleash the government against a private citizen because he owns a newspaper that sometimes criticizes him.So far Bezos hasn't reined in the Post. He has stood up to attacks that have cost him and his shareholders billions of dollars. Not every media owner has the deep pockets and the courage to do that.In the depths of Watergate, President Richard Nixon threatened the broadcasting licenses[8] owned by then Washington Post owner Katharine Graham. What Trump is doing to Bezos and Amazon is worse. \u2014DP Beware 'pre-print' studies, especially when they appear to confirm your political biases The world is studying and learning about the coronavirus in real time. Perhaps never before in history have so many researchers been so focused on the same topic at the same time. And perhaps never before have so many \"pre-print\" studies been released and mined for information.What's a \"pre-print\"? It's an early draft of a study that will be revised as it gets analyzed by other experts, the \"peer review\" process that acts as a quality-control mechanism in science and academia.In normal times, preliminary studies are often shared only with peers. But now, given the extreme time sensitivity, many coronavirus pre-print studies are being published everywhere, and their initial findings widely discussed and distributed.This is especially true when the initial findings appear to confirm the beliefs or hopes of a particular political team, with a built-in base of fans and amplifiers.For example, The New York Times dives into what happened last month when a Stanford pre-print study was published that appeared to confirm the beliefs and hopes of some conservatives.The study concluded that coronavirus infections were much more widespread than everyone believed \u2014 85 times as widespread actually. If this finding had held up under scrutiny, it would have been excellent news. It would have meant that many more people had already been exposed to the coronavirus than everyone thought, and, therefore, that we as a society were much closer to \"herd immunity.\" It might also have meant that the coronavirus was much less dangerous than everyone thought.These initial findings also happened to fit the narrative that was popular with right-leaners \u2014 namely, that the coronavirus panic was, at best, \"dumb,\" and, at worst, a liberal hoax. Lockdowns weren't necessary, this story went. They were a gigantic overkill regulation pushed by members of a hyperactive Democratic nanny state. They were a cure that was worse than the disease.As Aleszu Bajak and Jeff Howe of The New York Times explain[9], the initial findings of the study were seized on and shared by conservative commentators.But, at the same time, peers of the scientists who published the study argued that the Stanford team had made some questionable assumptions that did not hold up under scrutiny. Within a day or two, in fact, it became clear that the study had overestimated the likely infection rate.Experts still believe the number of actual coronavirus infections vastly outnumbers the number of confirmed infections. But the difference is likely far less extreme than the Stanford study initially suggested.The same thing has happened with pre-print studies that confirm the \"prior\" or desired beliefs of left-wing commentators.The rapid publication of pre-print studies are critical and helpful right now. The faster scientists can learn from each other and fact-check each other's work, the faster we will collectively learn about the coronavirus and how to best protect ourselves from it.But everyone should keep in mind that pre-print means \"preliminary and subject to change.\" \u2014HB How speaking transmits the coronavirus: Some of the droplets you emit when you talk hang in the air for 8 to 14 minutes A new study \u2014 an edited study in a journal, not a pre-print[10] \u2014 measured how long \"respiratory droplets\" hang in the air after people talk in an enclosed space with no ventilation.The answer? As long as 14 minutes.The experimenters had someone repeat the phrase \"stay healthy\" for 25 seconds in an enclosed room with stagnant air. They then measured how long it took the tiny speech droplets to evaporate or fall to a surface. Stadnytskyi, Bax, Bax, Anfinrud, 2020 [11] The researchers conclude: \"There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments.\" \u2014HB Speaking of speaking ... some Wisconsin residents celebrated the ending of coronavirus restrictions by heading for places that fit the description for 'superspreader' environments described above \u2014 bars Owner Michael Mattson toasts the re-opening of the Friends and Neighbors bar following the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to strike down Governor Tony Evers' safer-at-home order against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Appleton, Wisconsin, U.S. May 13, 2020.  William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS One effective way to transmit the coronavirus is to get close to someone in an enclosed indoor space with poor ventilation and speak loudly close to their face for a while.In Seoul, South Korea, for example, the country's reopening was put on hold after a single \"spreader\" visited three nightclubs on a single night. South Korea has already traced 153 new infections,[12] primary and secondary, to this one night on the town.So for the sake of Wisconsinites, let's hope that no asymptomatic residents were among those who decided to celebrate by hitting the bars[13]. \u2014HB NEWS French firm Sanofi reverses pledge to provide vaccine to the US first.[14] The US is paying for most of its vaccine research and wanted top priority.

YOUR LETTERS On Wisconsin making the right decision to rein in its governor's emergency powers:[24]Booo to your promoting the notion of \"creeping executive overreach\" by governors.Polls continue to show the American people mostly think their states are not moving too quickly. People are generally not in a hurry to go back \"out\" \u2014 they are afraid of getting sick, getting their family members sick, etc. A governor's job is to keep the people in the state safe. I cannot think of a single state where the governor has over-reached. My own state (North Carolina) has been very cautious and as a result we are nearing a decent plateau while remaining mostly closed. My point is there is little evidence of governors trying to \"grab\" power \u2014 most of them are making anguished decisions every day and their poll numbers are extremely high.There do not have to be \"two sides\" to this. There is truth, there is science. Decisions are not easy since nobody knows everything about this novel virus, but the experts are amazingly consistent in their public health advice. Suggestions such as the one you made only serve to bolster the concept of there being two sides. I found it disappointing \u2014 I could hear that on Fox News any day of the week.\u2014 Kathy Underhill, NC THE BIG 3* Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican John Cornyn of Texas are working on a bill that would shield employers from coronavirus-tied lawsuits.

The aim is to maximise the benefits of AI while minimizing intrusion into privacy, she pointed out.</p><p>Effy Vayena, Professor and Chair of Bioethics, Health Ethics and Policy Lab in the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, gave an overview of research in this area, and her assessment of how well it was being applied, notably in the emergency situation of COVID-19.</p><p>We need a more coherent system of governance that begins with the collection of data, but continues consistently through the whole process of developing and deploying AI, said Ms Vayena. I would call for a comprehensive system of governance that can cover the whole process from beginning to end.</p><p>Her team had assessed at least 84 sets of ethics guidelines for AI, she said, and most seemed to converge around a few basic principles, including transparency, fairness and safety. ?A lot of good work has been done on the principles to apply, the foundations. But the problem is how to move from theory - serious and solid theory - to practice.?</p><p>She gave the example of health-related wellness apps, where her research showed ?a very messy space? in terms of the regulatory environment. Developers would create the apps, and only later others would assess them against existing guidelines: ?Despite our long discussions and much scholarship, the practical application is lacking.?</p><p>Turning to the new contact-tracing apps being developed for COVID-19, she said a small handful of big-tech companies ?hold the keys to the house?. ?Governments can?t do it without them, but there is an incredible concentration of power in the hands of only a few players,? she pointed out. She called for clearer conditions to enable public and private to work together in the domain of AI so as to protect human rights, ensure accountability and optimise benefits for all users.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-176491472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603C-6PJ1-F11P-X4V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

Established business models are upended, driving consolidation and restructuring. Regulators rush to respond, radically reshaping the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These trends show no sign of slowing down.</p><p>In recent years, another unquestioned trend in the sector has been globalization. A shift in the balance of power from local to global has been seemingly inevitable - whether in the rise of \"Big Tech\", the complexity of supply chains or the explosion of global content production budgets.</p><p>That inevitability is now in question as regulators and tax authorities seek to claw back ground, trade policies take a protectionist turn and national security and cultural identity emerge as increasingly important political themes.</p><p>This year's TMT Horizons reflects the fact that the intersection between the inherent dynamism of the sector and the increasing challenges to unchecked globalization will dominate the next chapter for TMT.</p><p>The view from Silicon Valley</p><p>By Jane Ross</p><p>Increased competition for technology assets from non-traditional buyers, IPO market volatility, and high levels of available cash held by potential buyers mean we expect tech M&amp;A to continue to grow its share of the overall deal market.</p><p>The majority of potential acquirers of a tech company are no longer other tech companies. \"Old economy\" businesses - companies in the industrial, automotive and consumer industries - increasingly look to drive growth and maintain relevance and competitiveness through tech acquisitions. So consumer companies are acquiring e-commerce capabilities and auto manufacturers are acquiring autonomous vehicle technologies.</p><p>This doesn't mean the tech industry itself has lost the acquisition habit. As large tech companies mature, they expand into products and services beyond their core business or via vertical acquisitions. So Facebook and Google acquire Oculus and Waymo respectively; and hardware and social media companies are buying software and digital advertising businesses.</p><p>Finally, attracted by high growth and increasing numbers of later-stage technology companies, private equity funds have ramped up their tech acquisition strategies. A number have raised technology-focused funds which are among the most active tech acquirers today.</p><p>This increasing number of well-funded potential buyers, coupled with the relative uncertainty and cost associated with the public markets, is likely to continue to drive a seller's M&amp;A market characterized by strong valuations and seller-friendly deal terms.</p><p>The view from Europe</p><p>By Don McGown</p><p>Telecoms is likely to see continuing decline in the market share of traditional European operators with their roots in fixed line. However, antitrust concerns continue to hinder consolidation of network operators elsewhere meaning traditional telcos increasingly turn their attention to head on competition with the likes of Sky and Liberty Global in providing content.</p><p>Media is transformed by the breakup of the Murdoch Empire, ushering in a new era with Disney and Comcast looking to stamp their mark on the Fox and Sky brands in Europe.</p><p>Tech remains a significant disruptor across all business sectors. This is accompanied by a dynamic legal environment as regulators struggle with the challenges of maintaining a workable regulatory framework with an increased emphasis on data and cybersecurity.</p><p>With content, advertising, and convenience continuing to be key revenue drivers, we see the likes of Google and Amazon competing not only with even newer entrants, like Netflix, but also traditional content companies, the continuing challenge of tech based models to the traditional major players in the advertising market and an increasingly crowded market for tech driven mobility and delivery solutions.</p><p>Looking forward, these trends show little sign of weakening at either a global or a regional level. However, taking a European perspective, linguistic, cultural, and political barriers are sometimes more complex than might at first appear from the outside - meaning that the market is often more fragmented, and complex, than might at first appear.</p><p>Click  here to read TMT Horizons 2019.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The obvious questions are: Why? And: is it too good to be true? There are two drivers of the rebound - Big Tech and the Mighty Fed. Central bank the Federal Reserve has been providing trillions of dollars of support for the US economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With interest rates at rock bottom, money is looking for a home and is flooding into the market. The surge is uneven, though. It's concentrated in Big Tech, with traditional sectors such as energy and financials, still well down.</p><p>And the animal spirits on Wall Street are not shared on Main Street, where around 30m Americans - some 20pc of workers - have been in receipt of unemployment benefits in the pandemic.</p><p>Yet Apple's market value has now soared to an incredible $2trillion.</p><p>Or take electric car manufacturer Tesla, whose share price has been described as 'insane' in a 'market gone mad.' Even its chief executive, Elon Musk, tweeted in May that the price is too high.</p><p>Yet its rise, nearly 340pc since January, has continued, at least so far. Tesla has tapped into the long-term theme of greener transport.</p><p>Other tech companies have come into their own due to the virus, such as Zoom, which is up almost 300pc since the start of the year. Many of us who had never heard of the video communications outfit pre-Covid became daily users, though if we all go back to work as before, then eventually it could tail off.</p><p>The upshot is that the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has risen by 23pc since the start of the year and by 65pc since the bottom on March 23.</p><p>Of course it may be riding for a fall. Among the risks for tech stocks are that they are overtaken by rivals, or attacked and broken up by regulators.</p><p>For UK investors in US tech, there is also a currency risk. But if you believe we will be using more technology a decade from now, then in the long term you can't afford to ignore them.</p><p>The pandemic has accelerated the shift from traditional business to tech.</p><p>Companies such as Apple, Amazon and Netflix could be among the lasting winners in a post-Covid world, particularly if social distancing and targeted lockdowns remain a feature of our lives for some time.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the US. Optimism about beating the virus and an economic revival are built in to the market's rise, but may be ill-founded.</p><p>Volatility is likely to increase ahead of the election in the autumn.</p><p>Normally a Republican president would be seen as positive for markets, but given Donald Trump's behaviour - and the likelihood, if he is re-elected, of more trade tensions with China - the usual rules are out. Joe Biden, if he is installed in the White House, may not last a full term and no-one is sure which Kamala Harris would take over.</p><p>Still, the bombastic mood on Wall Street is a big contrast with the FTSE 100, which is a desert for Big Tech, and is lower than it was 20 years ago.</p><p>As legendary investor Warren Buffett suggested recently, in the long run, it pays to believe in 'American magic'.</p><p>RPI mess THE row over rail fares has highlighted the urgent need to sort out the Retail Prices Index (RPI).</p><p>This might sound obscure, but it has a big impact on people's lives.</p><p>RPI is a widely discredited measure of inflation that is almost always significantly higher than the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). This is because the CPI, very sensibly, takes account of the fact that, when prices go up, consumers switch to cheaper goods and services, whereas RPI does not.</p><p>Due to this flaw, RPI lost its status as an official statistic seven years ago.</p><p>But it is still used in a number of areas, such as rail fares and the interest rate on student loans.</p><p>Sajid Javid, the previous Chancellor, launched a consultation on it which was due to close in April but has been delayed until tomorrow.</p><p>He showed no inclination to move quickly and, in fairness, it would be disruptive to scrap RPI suddenly across the board. Banning it on index-linked gilts, for instance, would cause havoc for pension funds.</p><p>But that's no excuse for the Government to carry on using a flawed index to punish commuters and students with higher costs. The sooner Rishi Sunak sorts it out, the better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-162506871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MR-9881-DYTY-C0D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

Central bank the Federal Reserve has been providing trillions of dollars of support for the US economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With interest rates at rock bottom, money is looking for a home and is flooding into the market. The surge is uneven, though. It's concentrated in Big Tech, with traditional sectors such as energy and financials, still well down.</p><p>And the animal spirits on Wall Street are not shared on Main Street, where around 30m Americans - some 20pc of workers - have been in receipt of unemployment benefits in the pandemic.</p><p>Yet Apple's market value has now soared to an incredible $2trillion.</p><p>Or take electric car manufacturer Tesla, whose share price has been described as insane' in a market gone mad.'</p><p>Even its chief executive, Elon Musk, tweeted in May that the price is too high.</p><p>Yet its rise, nearly 340pc since January, has continued, at least so far. Tesla has tapped into the long-term theme of greener transport.</p><p>Other tech companies have come into their own due to the virus, such as Zoom, which is up almost 300pc since the start of the year. Many of us who had never heard of the video communications outfit pre-Covid became daily users, though if we all go back to work as before, then eventually it could tail off.</p><p>The upshot is that the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has risen by 23pc since the start of the year and by 65pc since the bottom on March 23.</p><p>Of course it may be riding for a fall. Among the risks for tech stocks are that they are overtaken by rivals, or attacked and broken up by regulators.</p><p>For UK investors in US tech, there is also a currency risk. But if you believe we will be using more technology a decade from now, then in the long term you can't afford to ignore them.</p><p>The pandemic has accelerated the shift from traditional business to tech.</p><p>Companies such as Apple, Amazon and Netflix could be among the lasting winners in a post-Covid world, particularly if social distancing and targeted lockdowns remain a feature of our lives for some time.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the US. Optimism about beating the virus and an economic revival are built in to the market's rise, but may be ill-founded.</p><p>Volatility is likely to increase ahead of the election in the autumn.</p><p>Normally a Republican president would be seen as positive for markets, but given Donald Trump's behaviour - and the likelihood, if he is re-elected, of more trade tensions with China - the usual rules are out.</p><p>Joe Biden, if he is installed in the White House, may not last a full term and no-one is sure which Kamala Harris would take over.</p><p>Still, the bombastic mood on Wall Street is a big contrast with the FTSE 100, which is a desert for Big Tech, and is lower than it was 20 years ago.</p><p>As legendary investor Warren Buffett suggested recently, in the long run, it pays to believe in American magic'.</p><p>RPI mess</p><p>THE row over rail fares has highlighted the urgent need to sort out the Retail Prices Index (RPI).</p><p>This might sound obscure, but it has a big impact on people's lives.</p><p>RPI is a widely discredited measure of inflation that is almost always significantly higher than the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). This is because the CPI, very sensibly, takes account of the fact that, when prices go up, consumers switch to cheaper goods and services, whereas RPI does not.</p><p>Due to this flaw, RPI lost its status as an official statistic seven years ago.</p><p>But it is still used in a number of areas, such as rail fares and the interest rate on student loans.</p><p>Sajid Javid, the previous Chancellor, launched a consultation on it which was due to close in April but has been delayed until tomorrow.</p><p>He showed no inclination to move quickly and, in fairness, it would be disruptive to scrap RPI suddenly across the board. Banning it on index-linked gilts, for instance, would cause havoc for pension funds.</p><p>But that's no excuse for the Government to carry on using a flawed index to punish commuters and students with higher costs. The sooner Rishi Sunak sorts it out, the better.</p><p>\u00a9 Daily Mail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MP-9241-DYTG-40M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138794</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The obvious questions are: Why? And: is it too good to be true?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are two drivers of the rebound - Big Tech and the Mighty Fed. Central bank the Federal Reserve has been providing trillions of dollars of support for the US economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With interest rates at rock bottom, money is looking for a home and is flooding into the market. The surge is uneven, though. It's concentrated in Big Tech, with traditional sectors such as energy and financials, still well down.</p><p>And the animal spirits on Wall Street are not shared on Main Street, where around 30m Americans - some 20 per cent of workers - have been in receipt of unemployment benefits in the pandemic.</p><p>Yet Apple's market value has now soared to an incredible $2trillion.</p><p>Or take electric car manufacturer Tesla, whose share price has been described as 'insane' in a 'market gone mad.'</p><p>Even its chief executive, Elon Musk, tweeted in May that the price is too high.</p><p>Yet its rise, nearly 340 per cent since January, has continued, at least so far. Tesla has tapped into the long-term theme of greener transport.</p><p>Other tech companies have come into their own due to the virus, such as Zoom, which is up almost 300 per cent since the start of the year. </p><p>Many of us who had never heard of the video communications outfit pre-Covid became daily users, though if we all go back to work as before, then eventually it could tail off.</p><p>The upshot is that the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has risen by 23 per cent since the start of the year and by 65 per cent since the bottom on March 23.</p><p>Of course it may be riding for a fall. Among the risks for tech stocks are that they are overtaken by rivals, or attacked and broken up by regulators.</p><p>For UK investors in US tech, there is also a currency risk. But if you believe we will be using more technology a decade from now, then in the long term you can't afford to ignore them.</p><p>The pandemic has accelerated the shift from traditional business to tech.</p><p>Companies such as Apple, Amazon and Netflix could be among the lasting winners in a post-Covid world, particularly if social distancing and targeted lockdowns remain a feature of our lives for some time.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the US. Optimism about beating the virus and an economic revival are built in to the market's rise, but may be ill-founded.</p><p>Volatility is likely to increase ahead of the election in the autumn.</p><p>Normally a Republican president would be seen as positive for markets, but given Donald Trump's behaviour - and the likelihood, if he is re-elected, of more trade tensions with China - the usual rules are out.</p><p>Joe Biden, if he is installed in the White House, may not last a full term and no-one is sure which Kamala Harris would take over.</p><p>Still, the bombastic mood on Wall Street is a big contrast with the FTSE 100, which is a desert for Big Tech, and is lower than it was 20 years ago.</p><p>As legendary investor Warren Buffett suggested recently, in the long run, it pays to believe in 'American magic'.</p><p>RPI mess</p><p>THE row over rail fares has highlighted the urgent need to sort out the Retail Prices Index (RPI).</p><p>This might sound obscure, but it has a big impact on people's lives.</p><p>RPI is a widely discredited measure of inflation that is almost always significantly higher than the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). </p><p>This is because the CPI, very sensibly, takes account of the fact that, when prices go up, consumers switch to cheaper goods and services, whereas RPI does not.</p><p>Due to this flaw, RPI lost its status as an official statistic seven years ago.</p><p>But it is still used in a number of areas, such as rail fares and the interest rate on student loans.</p><p>Sajid Javid, the previous Chancellor, launched a consultation on it which was due to close in April but has been delayed until tomorrow.</p><p>He showed no inclination to move quickly and, in fairness, it would be disruptive to scrap RPI suddenly across the board. Banning it on index-linked gilts, for instance, would cause havoc for pension funds.</p><p>But that's no excuse for the Government to carry on using a flawed index to punish commuters and students with higher costs. The sooner Rishi Sunak sorts it out, the better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-65333866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MM-07M1-JCJY-G4SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><timeReceived>6:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The Australian government has taken note that while local media companies are struggling to stay afloat, Google and Facebook have raked in the moolah. Operating as monopolies, and behaving as if they do favours to news producers for displaying their content while incurring zero cost for news gathering, multinational tech giants can only be reined in with firm government regulations.</p><p>The Australian code envisages a time-bound process of bargaining/ negotiation between digital platforms and news producers (individually or collectively) \u2013 followed by mediation and arbitration, if necessary. When matters reach arbitration, the arbitrator will have to gauge direct (revenues) and indirect (customer acquisition/ loyalty) benefits accruing to digital platforms from displaying local news, costs borne by news producers for journalistic operations, and whether the final award places \u201cundue\u201d burden on a digital platform's commercial interests.</p><p>This is an even-handed approach. It looks as if Australia has succeeded in belling the cat, when other governments don't regulate US tech companies for fear of incurring the wrath of the US government. Other countries, including India, should follow in Australia's footsteps. The tide is turning even in the US, evident from US Congress \u2013 which has been largely forbearing despite mounting anti-trust evidence \u2013 grilling big tech CEOs last week. Their questions, ranging from anti-competitive misuse of data to stifling of competitors, echo many Indian concerns. A committee of experts on non-personal data governance headed by Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan has flagged the rise of data monopolies with tech giants on one side ranged against Indian businesses, citizens, startups and even the government.</p><p>This phenomenon is already dogging the crisis-stricken media industry. Opaque algorithms and absence of regulations mandating data sharing with news partners leaves local media outlets, who are domestic job and wealth generators unlike digital platforms with their disproportionately poor local hiring, at a distinct disadvantage. Journalism also performs the critical task of strengthening democracy. If newspapers turn unviable and close down, governance and information dissemination will suffer. The corrupt will be emboldened as journalists will not be around to report on crumbling infrastructure, civic issues, law and order and political or bureaucratic malpractices. It is in India's interest to closely examine the Australian model.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H9-5871-JB3N-T28M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Markets started the session on pessimistic note as sentiments remained downbeat with report that Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections slid for the second straight month to Rs 851.74 billion in February as only 69% of the assessees filed returns. Around 5.951 million GSTR 3B returns were filed for the month of February till March 25. This is 69 per cent of total taxpayers who are required to file monthly returns. Sentiments also remained dampened with a private report stating that weak macroeconomic indicators like current account deficit and inflation have exposed India to adverse global macro developments such as US monetary policy trajectory and trade war risks.  </p><p><br/>Factors like expiry of futures and options contracts for the month of March and profit booking on the last trading day for the current financial year 2017-18 before the long term capital gains tax (LTCG) kicks in from April 2, 2018,  also weighed on the sentiments. Meanwhile, government\u2019s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian has said that he wanted a simpler GST structure. He also said that once the GST Council is confident that the revenue through indirect tax is stabilising, it will do more simplification future. Traders failed to get any sense of relief with the commerce ministry\u2019s statement that India and China have agreed to draw-up a medium and long term roadmap with action points and timelines in order to increase bilateral trade in a balanced and sustainable manner. It also pointed out that two neighbouring nations in Asia are the largest emerging economies of the world with 35% of the world's population and about 20% of the world\u2019s GDP, but bilateral trade between the two nations is less than 1% of global trade.  <br/>Weak opening in European markets too dampened sentiments, as persistent concerns over a regulatory crackdown on big tech and a string of negative headlines overnight hit sentiment towards the sector that drove a long bull market. All the Asian markets ended in red as tech stocks extended losses following sell-offs of their US peers overnight.  <br/>Back home, stocks related to IT space edged lower after the Income Tax Department freezed bank accounts and deposits of Nasdaq listed IT firm, Cognizant in Chennai and Mumbai for allegedly evading dividend distribution tax. Telecom stocks declined with ICRA\u2019s latest report stating that the revival India\u2019s telecom sector is likely to be prolonged and the pressure on the cash flows of service providers might continue for few more quarters. Moreover, telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan said that the much-awaited merger of Idea Cellular and Vodafone is in final stages of approval.  <br/>Finally, the BSE Sensex declined 205.71 points or 0.62% to 32,968.68, while the CNX Nifty was down by 70.45 points or 0.69% to 10,113.70.  <br/>The BSE Sensex touched a high and a low of 33,104.11 and 32,917.66, respectively and there were 12 stocks on gaining side as against 19 stocks on losing side on the index.  <br/>The broader indices ended in red; the BSE Mid cap index declined 0.53%, while Small cap index was down by 0.92%.  <br/>The few gaining sectoral indices on the BSE were Consumer Durables up by 0.24% and Oil &amp; Gas was up by 0.06%, while Telecom down by 2.58%, Metal down by 2.04%, Basic Materials down by 1.66%, Healthcare down by 1.14% and Realty was down by 1.07% were the top losing indices on BSE.  <br/>The top gainers on the Sensex were Wipro up by 3.27%, Coal India up by 2.94%, Hero MotoCorp up by 2.30%, Kotak Mahindra Bank up by 0.55% and Yes Bank up by 0.49%. On the flip side, Tata Steel down by 3.25%, Bharti Airtel down by 3.05%, Adani Ports down by 2.93%, Sun Pharma down by 1.95% and ICICI Bank down by 1.94% were the top losers.  <br/>Meanwhile, the industry chamber Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) in its latest report has stated that the 'crisis' facing by India\u2019s banking system, mainly public sector banks (PSBs), should be used as an opportunity to privatise the banks. As per the report, privatisation of the banks should not be done in a harsh manner and be done in a way that is acceptable to the political leadership.  <br/>The report noted that for starters, the government equity which is as high as 80 percent in some PSBs, should be brought down to below 50 percent. It also expects that the moment the government equity is below 50 percent, the banks would be out of the clutches of the CVC, CBI and CAG, giving more autonomy and confidence to the top management to lend freely without fear of being haunted. Besides, it said that the boards would then be much more professional and the independent directors would be truly independent.  <br/>ASSOCHAM also pointed out that the boards would then be empowered to take strategic decisions without going to the Finance Ministry, although the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should and would continue to play the role of a regulator, but in a much more effective manner. It added that the narrative must be built to the effect that the government can use both PSBs and private sector banks as the agents of change, without hurting the interest of the lenders.  <br/>The CNX Nifty traded in a range of 10,158.35 and 10,096.90. There were 20 stocks in green as against 30 stocks in red on the index.  <br/>The top gainers on Nifty were Wipro up by 3.41%, Bosch up by 2.90%, GAIL India up by 2.82%, Tech Mahindra up by 2.49% and Hero MotoCorp up by 2.00%. On the flip side, Bharti Airtel down by 3.71%, Tata Steel down by 3.28%, Vedanta down by 2.77%, Adani Ports down by 2.60% and Reliance Industries down by 2.02% were the top losers.  <br/>European markets were trading in red; Germany\u2019s DAX decreased 111 points or 0.93% to 11,859.83, France\u2019s CAC declined 50.52 points or 0.99% to 5,065.22 and UK\u2019s FTSE 100 was down by 24.48 points or 0.35% to 6,975.66.  <br/>Asian stocks closed in red on Wednesday after US technology shares came under heavy selling pressure overnight on concerns about tighter industry regulations. Trade-related tensions also kept investors nervous. Japanese stocks fell, led by a sell-off in tech firms after their US counterparts skidded on concerns about government regulation, while ex-dividend trades added to the broader losses. Further, Chinese stocks closed lower, led by declines in the foreign trade sector. Stocks related to foreign trade dropped following the US government's latest tariff plan on imports from China.  <br/>Asian Indices<br/><br/>Last Trade           <br/><br/>Change in Points<br/><br/>Change in %  <br/>Shanghai Composite<br/><br/>3,122.29<br/><br/>-44.36<br/><br/>-1.40  <br/>Hang Seng<br/><br/>30,022.53<br/><br/>-768.30<br/><br/>-2.50  <br/>Jakarta Composite<br/><br/>6,140.84<br/><br/>-68.51<br/><br/>-1.10  <br/>KLSE Composite<br/><br/>1,857.87<br/><br/>-4.58<br/><br/>-0.25  <br/>Nikkei 225<br/><br/>21,031.31<br/><br/>-286.01<br/><br/>-1.34  <br/>Straits Times<br/><br/> 3,382.78<br/><br/>-56.57<br/><br/>-1.64  <br/>KOSPI Composite<br/><br/>2,419.29<br/><br/>-32.77<br/><br/>-1.34  <br/>Taiwan Weighted<br/><br/>10,865.66<br/><br/>-121.13<br/><br/>-1.10 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN705167020180330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0K-4XB1-DXCW-D19D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1200\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Moreover, telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan said that the much-awaited merger of Idea Cellular and Vodafone is in final stages of approval.</p><p>Finally, the BSE Sensex declined 205.71 points or 0.62% to 32,968.68, while the CNX Nifty was down by 70.45 points or 0.69% to 10,113.70.</p><p>The BSE Sensex touched a high and a low of 33,104.11 and 32,917.66, respectively and there were 12 stocks on gaining side as against 19 stocks on losing side on the index.</p><p>The broader indices ended in red; the BSE Mid cap index declined 0.53%, while Small cap index was down by 0.92%.</p><p>The few gaining sectoral indices on the BSE were Consumer Durables up by 0.24% and Oil &amp; Gas was up by 0.06%, while Telecom down by 2.58%, Metal down by 2.04%, Basic Materials down by 1.66%, Healthcare down by 1.14% and Realty was down by 1.07% were the top losing indices on BSE.</p><p>The top gainers on the Sensex were Wipro up by 3.27%, Coal India up by 2.94%, Hero MotoCorp up by 2.30%, Kotak Mahindra Bank up by 0.55% and Yes Bank up by 0.49%. On the flip side, Tata Steel down by 3.25%, Bharti Airtel down by 3.05%, Adani Ports down by 2.93%, Sun Pharma down by 1.95% and ICICI Bank down by 1.94% were the top losers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the industry chamber Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) in its latest report has stated that the 'crisis' facing by India's banking system, mainly public sector banks (PSBs), should be used as an opportunity to privatise the banks. As per the report, privatisation of the banks should not be done in a harsh manner and be done in a way that is acceptable to the political leadership.</p><p>The report noted that for starters, the government equity which is as high as 80 percent in some PSBs, should be brought down to below 50 percent. It also expects that the moment the government equity is below 50 percent, the banks would be out of the clutches of the CVC, CBI and CAG, giving more autonomy and confidence to the top management to lend freely without fear of being haunted. Besides, it said that the boards would then be much more professional and the independent directors would be truly independent.</p><p>ASSOCHAM also pointed out that the boards would then be empowered to take strategic decisions without going to the Finance Ministry, although the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should and would continue to play the role of a regulator, but in a much more effective manner. It added that the narrative must be built to the effect that the government can use both PSBs and private sector banks as the agents of change, without hurting the interest of the lenders.</p><p>The CNX Nifty traded in a range of 10,158.35 and 10,096.90. There were 20 stocks in green as against 30 stocks in red on the index.</p><p>The top gainers on Nifty were Wipro up by 3.41%, Bosch up by 2.90%, GAIL India up by 2.82%, Tech Mahindra up by 2.49% and Hero MotoCorp up by 2.00%. On the flip side, Bharti Airtel down by 3.71%, Tata Steel down by 3.28%, Vedanta down by 2.77%, Adani Ports down by 2.60% and Reliance Industries down by 2.02% were the top losers.</p><p>European markets were trading in red; Germany's DAX decreased 111 points or 0.93% to 11,859.83, France's CAC declined 50.52 points or 0.99% to 5,065.22 and UK's FTSE 100 was down by 24.48 points or 0.35% to 6,975.66.<br/><br/></p><p>Asian stocks closed in red on Wednesday after US technology shares came under heavy selling pressure overnight on concerns about tighter industry regulations. Trade-related tensions also kept investors nervous. Japanese stocks fell, led by a sell-off in tech firms after their US counterparts skidded on concerns about government regulation, while ex-dividend trades added to the broader losses. Further, Chinese stocks closed lower, led by declines in the foreign trade sector. Stocks related to foreign trade dropped following the US government's latest tariff plan on imports from China.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">AsianIndices</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Last Trade            </entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Change in Points</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Change in %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Shanghai Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3,122.29</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-44.36</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.40</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hang Seng</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30,022.53</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-768.30</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-2.50</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jakarta Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6,140.84</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-68.51</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.10</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">KLSE Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,857.87</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-4.58</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-0.25</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Nikkei 225</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">21,031.31</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-286.01</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.34</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Straits Times</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3,382.78</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-56.57</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.64</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">KOSPI Composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,419.29</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-32.77</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.34</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Taiwan Weighted</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10,865.66</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-121.13</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.10</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>DISCLAIMER: Accord Fintech provides the Content on \"AS IS\" basis without any express or implied warranties.

Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, each sat on a web call this week to face an antitrust panel in Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The already less-than-ideal format, in which politicians often grandstand more than ask probing questions, was only made more strange by the COVID-induced situation of having everyone phone in to the panel. The whole thing would have felt a bit sci-fi if the stakes weren't so very real.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because the fact that these four men, who collectively run companies worth about $5 trillion and reach around half the world's population, were hauled in front of a congressional panel at all signifies the deep worry about tech's growing power. And while this specific hearing was to focus on questions of competition and antitrust, inevitably the panel strayed into issues of speech, censorship and influence.</p><p>Yet, watching the whole affair, it was hard not to get the sense that governments are working with a set of outdated rules. For one, a group of American politicians could only ever defer to the idea of fostering competition. But what the hearings may have inadvertently revealed is that what separates big tech from other kinds of companies is that they are platforms - historically unique entities that need their own set of rules.</p><p>Despite the strangeness, there was some real tension. Under the glare were a series of troubling patterns from the big tech companies. Amazon's Bezos came under fire for his company's practice of being a platform for smaller third-party sellers to hawk wares but also using the data from those sales to compete with them. Similarly, Rep. Pramila Jayapal brought receipts of early emails when Facebook was considering acquiring Instagram, showing that Facebook essentially threatened the then much smaller photo-sharing app.</p><p>It was indicative of just how much big tech has gotten away with as we were lost in its haze over the past decade or so. But Jayapal, who represents part of Seattle, also took the time to thank Bezos for his contributions to the city and suggested that all she wanted was more Amazons, rather than one behemoth. It pointed to the bind we are in: worried about tech companies but also beholden to them and how essential they have become to both our lives and the economy at large.</p><p>Can you actually have more than one Amazon, though? The trouble is, large technology companies don't just offer a service or product to consumers in the way that Ford or Sony might. Rather, they offer a platform - that is, a thing on which other services and businesses are built. Facebook is not just a way to connect with friends, it is also full of neighbourhood groups, buy and sell clubs, news, videos, messaging, digital payments and more. Something similar might be said of all big tech companies. Apple has its app store, from which it takes a 30 per cent cut of sales, and is why you cannot buy a book from Amazon or Kobo from your iPad (those companies refuse to let Apple take a cut). They aren't merely companies as much as a kind of infrastructure for both themselves and other companies.</p><p>Making matters more complicated is that platform companies only really work when they have scale. What would be the point of joining Facebook or setting up a business on Amazon if there weren't hundreds of millions of people also on those sites? It's a phenomenon called network effects: the value of a platform to someone goes up the more people are on it. The trouble is obviously that such scale helps to prevent competition. If a network is only good when it has hundreds of millions of people on it, then how can you set up a competing one?</p><p>That's why these companies can't be reined in using traditional rules about antitrust, or even rules for traditional media or utilities. They are new and, as such, need to be treated with new rules. Even breaking up companies wouldn't have the desired effect: separate out Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook, and the latter would still reach 2.5 billion people.</p><p>The closest analogy we have to platform companies are utility companies: organizations that in places like Canada are tightly regulated in no small part because they form the backbone for so many other things.</p><p>That is how platform companies like Facebook or Google should be regulated: as if they are infrastructure, because that's what they are. But, because of network effects, we will need new rules: limitations on what platform companies can do in regards to competition, their users' data, and the availability of that data to potential competitors and governments, too. Yes it will be awkward and it will be hard. But we can't tackle one of the biggest problems of this century if we are stuck using tools from the last.</p><p>Navneet Alang is a Toronto-based freelance contributing technology columnist for the Star.

A few of the children with musical talent performed throughout the show. <br/> Taking on Extra Significance Amid Tech vs. City Conflicts<br/>The event, however, carried with it the potential for healing around a different raging issue.<br/> In the current version of the ongoing saga that is San Francisco, the technology industry has been playing a villain. Their well-paid workers have helped drive up housing costs. Tech ventures have enjoyed the city's resources but ignored the community's issues and needs, some of which the latest tech boom has exacerbated, and many of which pre-existed the advent of $8,000 per month rents for a luxury two-bedroom in the Mission.<br/> Many feel that the tech industry vs. the city conflict is endemic of an even larger problem --wealth and income disparity in America. It is showing up strongly in San Francisco because of the city's small size and because the tech jobs that pay well are plentiful here and therefore exert a greater impact on the local economy than they might in a larger metropolis.<br/> Benioff is leading the charge to recast the image of technology from villain to protagonist. Just days before the benefit event, he announced the formation of SF Gives, which intends to raise $10 million in two months for various San Francisco anti-poverty programs. The organization has already enlisted $5 million in donations from big tech such as LinkedIn, Zynga, PopSugar, Jawbone, Box and, of course, Google. <br/> I say \"of course\" because its \"Google buses,\" which use municipal bus stops to pick up employees and transport them to work in Mountain View, have become, fairly or unfairly, the symbol of tech's separation -- income and otherwise -- from the rest of the city. To offset some of the tensions, Google donated $6.8 million[1] to San Francisco's Free Muni for Youth program less than one month ago.<br/> Real Estate Speculation and Lack of Government Oversight<br/>The crux of the crisis, however, is affordable housing. Real estate speculation, resulting in evictions and dislocations not seen since the last tech boom 14 years ago, bears a sizable share of the culpability here. Such speculation is running rampant in part because the government laws that should be providing check and balances have proven insufficient. <br/>California State Senator Mark Leno's proposed legislation that would force new owners to wait five years before forcing evictions could slow the housing turnover in San Francisco. Some city housing advocates insist that funds from SF Gives should only address the affordable housing crisis.<br/> More to be Done by All Parties<br/>San Francisco has no shortage of needy people and critical social issues that tech leaders can address. In the past, Benioff has donated $100 million[2] to the hospital, which will open a new facility in Mission Bay in early 2015, $1.5 million to the homeless, and $2.7 million to the schools.<br/> Benioff was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has a sense of belonging and home in the city. <br/> Most technology leaders did not grow up enjoying the advantages of San Francisco -- but their companies did. The city's environment and culture no doubt attract and retain talent. The tech industry needs to develop a feeling of responsibility that matches the opportunity that they have found in San Francisco, especially those tech companies that are well-established. <br/> At the same time, the current blanket vilification of tech workers that has taken hold in the city needs to calm down. It only adds to the polarization. A city wants and needs people with good paying jobs in its midst. The problem is that other professions and occupations have not kept pace. <br/> Finally, real estate speculation of existing housing needs to be offset with proper and enforced government regulation. Classically, it is government's role to step into a loggerhead such as one that San Francisco is experiencing and devise a solution that will not only plug the hole in the housing and resources dike but also lead the way to a workable future for the city. Perhaps a regional approach is necessary.<br/> In the meantime, the benefit last week served as a brief but welcome respite from all the anger and served as an example of a tech CEO stepping up to the plate. <br/> At one point in the show, Bonnie Raitt mentioned that she hoped the event -- which raised more than $1 million -- would increase \"the oxytocin levels\" at Davies Symphony Hall. It did.<br/> Let's hope it spreads to the rest of the city.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Google-says-6-8-million-for-youth-Muni-passes-5273937.php\">http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Google-says-6-8-million-for-youth-Muni-passes-5273937.php</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Benioff-donates-100-million-for-UCSF-hospital-3184884.php\">http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Benioff-donates-100-million-for-UCSF-hospital-3184884.php</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB12472114073187025050570736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-124721</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CVH-F7M1-F03R-N1TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"992\"/><timeReceived>9:51 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Huffington Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>August 6, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A few of the children with musical talent performed throughout the show. <br/> Taking on Extra Significance Amid Tech vs. City Conflicts<br/>The event, however, carried with it the potential for healing around a different raging issue.<br/> In the current version of the ongoing saga that is San Francisco, the technology industry has been playing a villain. Their well-paid workers have helped drive up housing costs. Tech ventures have enjoyed the city's resources but ignored the community's issues and needs, some of which the latest tech boom has exacerbated, and many of which pre-existed the advent of $8,000 per month rents for a luxury two-bedroom in the Mission.<br/> Many feel that the tech industry vs. the city conflict is endemic of an even larger problem --wealth and income disparity in America. It is showing up strongly in San Francisco because of the city's small size and because the tech jobs that pay well are plentiful here and therefore exert a greater impact on the local economy than they might in a larger metropolis.<br/> Benioff is leading the charge to recast the image of technology from villain to protagonist. Just days before the benefit event, he announced the formation of SF Gives, which intends to raise $10 million in two months for various San Francisco anti-poverty programs. The organization has already enlisted $5 million in donations from big tech such as LinkedIn, Zynga, PopSugar, Jawbone, Box and, of course, Google. <br/> I say \"of course\" because its \"Google buses,\" which use municipal bus stops to pick up employees and transport them to work in Mountain View, have become, fairly or unfairly, the symbol of tech's separation -- income and otherwise -- from the rest of the city. To offset some of the tensions, Google donated $6.8 million[1] to San Francisco's Free Muni for Youth program less than one month ago.<br/> Real Estate Speculation and Lack of Government Oversight<br/>The crux of the crisis, however, is affordable housing. Real estate speculation, resulting in evictions and dislocations not seen since the last tech boom 14 years ago, bears a sizable share of the culpability here. Such speculation is running rampant in part because the government laws that should be providing check and balances have proven insufficient. <br/>California State Senator Mark Leno's proposed legislation that would force new owners to wait five years before forcing evictions could slow the housing turnover in San Francisco. Some city housing advocates insist that funds from SF Gives should only address the affordable housing crisis.<br/> More to be Done by All Parties<br/>San Francisco has no shortage of needy people and critical social issues that tech leaders can address. In the past, Benioff has donated $100 million[2] to the hospital, which will open a new facility in Mission Bay in early 2015, $1.5 million to the homeless, and $2.7 million to the schools.<br/> Benioff was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has a sense of belonging and home in the city. <br/> Most technology leaders did not grow up enjoying the advantages of San Francisco -- but their companies did. The city's environment and culture no doubt attract and retain talent. The tech industry needs to develop a feeling of responsibility that matches the opportunity that they have found in San Francisco, especially those tech companies that are well-established. <br/> At the same time, the current blanket vilification of tech workers that has taken hold in the city needs to calm down. It only adds to the polarization. A city wants and needs people with good paying jobs in its midst. The problem is that other professions and occupations have not kept pace. <br/> Finally, real estate speculation of existing housing needs to be offset with proper and enforced government regulation. Classically, it is government's role to step into a loggerhead such as one that San Francisco is experiencing and devise a solution that will not only plug the hole in the housing and resources dike but also lead the way to a workable future for the city. Perhaps a regional approach is necessary.<br/> In the meantime, the benefit last week served as a brief but welcome respite from all the anger and served as an example of a tech CEO stepping up to the plate. <br/> At one point in the show, Bonnie Raitt mentioned that she hoped the event -- which raised more than $1 million -- would increase \"the oxytocin levels\" at Davies Symphony Hall. It did.<br/> Let's hope it spreads to the rest of the city.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Google-says-6-8-million-for-youth-Muni-passes-5273937.php\">http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Google-says-6-8-million-for-youth-Muni-passes-5273937.php</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Benioff-donates-100-million-for-UCSF-hospital-3184884.php\">http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Benioff-donates-100-million-for-UCSF-hospital-3184884.php</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB12472113951050307103582700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-124721</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BS7-2RK1-JCMN-Y0X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"992\"/><timeReceived>1:10 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Huffington Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 18, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

New developments tonight in the Benghazi scandal. At center of these developments, an incriminating e-mail written by White House staffer Ben Rhodes, the White House today hastily constructed what was an awkward, some might say clumsy defense of their words and actions in the days following the Benghazi attack.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House now claims there were two -- two -- sets of talking points given to <person><nameText>Susan Rice </nameText></person>before she went on five Sunday talk shows and famously and repeatedly lied to the nation about what happened in Benghazi. The new White House explanation comes one day after a Freedom of Information request by Judicial Watch produced the incriminating e-mail from Rhodes to 12 members of the president's senior staff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The e-mail dated September 14th, with the subject line reading, \"Prep call with Susan,\" states the goal for her national TV appearances was, quote, \"to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video and not a broader failure of policy.\"</p><p>Press secretary Jay Carney today struggled to attempt to persuade the White House press core this e-mail, dated three days after the terrorist attack, was not even about Benghazi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This was not -- it was explicitly not about Benghazi. It was about the overall situation in the region, the Muslim world, where you saw protests at -- outside of embassy facilities across the region. The so-called talking points around Benghazi, as you know, because it's been substantially reported on, were prepared by the CIA. And in this case, the overall issue of unrest in the Muslim world...</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: So then why did the White House hold back this e-mail, a document that was originally classified before being released to Congress, but in redacted, form to protect the author and recipients, if there were always two sets of talking points? And why was it released at all if it did not pertain to Benghazi because that was the specific request by the Freedom of Information asserted by Judicial Watch.</p><p>Jay Carney then was asked the question directly, and simply would not answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS: Why were you holding back this information? Why was this e-mail not turned over to the Congress? Why was it not released when you released all the other e-mails? This is directly relevant. Why did you hold it back?</p><p>CARNEY: Jon, again...</p><p>KARL: Why did it take a court case for you to release this e-mail?</p><p>CARNEY: Jon, I can say it again and again, I know you can keep asking again and again, this document was not about Benghazi.</p><p>KARL: It was a prep for the Sunday shows!</p><p>CARNEY: It wasn't her only prep, Jon. She relied on for her answers on Benghazi on a document prepared by the CIA, as did members of Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: But the former deputy director of the CIA testified exactly four weeks ago in front of the House Intelligence Committee, and in that testimony, he stated unequivocally that his analysts and operatives at the CIA did not at any time link that video to the Benghazi attack!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE MORRELL, FORMER CIA DEPUTY DIRECTOR: When she talked about the video, my reaction was that's not something that the analysts have attributed this attack to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Morell, however, for his part has also not always been consistent in telling his story. You remember in November 2012, he blamed the FBI for key changes in those talking points that blamed the nonexistent protests for the attack on the consulate. And Morell, for the record, now works for CBS as a national security analyst, where that news division president is the brother of White House staffer Ben Rhodes! The crony conflicts begin to add up, don't they?</p><p>The Obama administration's troubles don't end there. A new State Department report warning that a surge in al Qaeda affiliates in the Middle East and North Africa now pose a serious threat to the United States. The report finds there's been a 40 percent increase and terrorist attacks worldwide between 2012 and 2013. The State Department singled out Iran, reiterating it's a major state sponsor of terrorism that continues to defy demands to prove its nuclear ambitions are entirely peaceful.</p><p>All this as an increasing number of Americans say they don't want America to be the world's police or nation builders. This according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 47 percent say we should reduce our level of international engagement, 19 percent say we should be more active, while 30 percent say our involvement should remain the same.</p><p>For more now on the Obama administration's foreign policy failures, the latest developments in the Benghazi scandal, we're joined by former U.S. ambassador to United Nations, FOX News contributor John Bolton. Ambassador, good to have you with us.</p><p>This is quite a development. I'm going to, if I may, start in process with this White House. They now claim there were two sets of talking points! Your reaction?</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FMR. U.S. AMB. TO U.N., FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Look, these people can't keep their story straight! And this e-mail from Ben Rhodes is a significant piece of evidence that demonstrates something we've known from the get-go, they were either engaged in a systematic cover-up of falsehoods to prevent anybody from arguing that their policy had failed, and that's is what Rhodes' memo says expressly, or they were so blinded by ideology that they couldn't tell the difference.</p><p>You know, this is a something that people at the White House like Rhodes are lucky they haven't had to testify because they're right on the edge of perjury here, as is Mike Morell.</p><p>DOBBS: I was going to ask you about the CIA deputy director, and acting director of the CIA for a while. His testimony controverts what the White House is defending itself with. This is almost -- this borders on the preposterous, does it not, the -- the awkward explanations, the fact that this thing is unredacted now, after the Freedom of Information request by Judicial Watch, but was redacted when it was sent to Congress. And it's preposterous that the White House would say it has nothing to do with Benghazi, when that is precisely what it is responding to, the issue of Benghazi!</p><p>BOLTON: Of course. And the e-mail from Ben Rhodes itself says, \"these demonstrations.\" Obviously, by their own admission that includes Benghazi. And they attributed it to the Mohammed video.</p><p>Look, I think the administration and the CIA have gravely wounded the agency here. And what they're guilty of is what Bush administration was often accused of but actually didn't do, and that's politicizing intelligence. The CIA shouldn't have been involved in the business of writing talking points at all. This is inevitably a political judgment. Let the administration make its case and hold them politically accountable. But trying to hide behind the CIA is a big mistake from the top of the agency on down.</p><p>DOBBS: And how significant do you think this development is? Is this perhaps a pivotal point at which we will begin to see a -- one would hope, an opening in the stone wall and the real -- the reality, the truth comes spilling out?</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I certainly hope so, and let's start with <person><nameText>Susan Rice </nameText></person>and the five Sunday talk shows. I really think she's a sideshow, an irrelevancy. The real question is, where was Hillary Clinton? Where was Hillary Clinton? <person><nameText>Susan Rice </nameText></person>wrote an op-ed some time back saying that Mrs. Clinton was kind of overwhelmed by events of that week, and so that's why she was picked to go on the Sunday talk shows.</p><p>Is that the reason? She was emotionally disturbed? She was overwhelmed? I want an answer to that, especially want an answer if Secretary Clinton decides to run for president.</p><p>DOBBS: And it is of more than mild curiosity that one would ask where was the president.</p><p>BOLTON: Right. Well, and what has the president done in the last 18 months? That is the biggest failure of all, that an American ambassador and three others can be killed by terrorists and they get away with it scot-free. That's a terrible lesson for the terrorists, for the state sponsors of terrorism and for American adversaries all over the world to learn. You can kill the president's personal representative under Barack Obama and get away with it.</p><p>DOBBS: And the latest report on al Qaeda, a 43 percent increase in terrorist attacks 2012 to 2013. This as the administration itself was saying that al Qaeda was on the run and basically a done deal. Your thoughts.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, this is the ideology of the administration being rebutted by the facts. And the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testified a few months ago that the threat from al Qaeda was essentially the same as it was just before 9/11.</p><p>So the entire political narrative, in fact, is revealed as a policy failure, and yet we don't have enough discussion of it in the overall national debate. That's what our friends in the mainstream media ought to be asking themselves, how they can look at these facts and not bring it into the discussion. Forget what happened at Benghazi. What about the continuing global war on terrorism that the administration doesn't want to talk about?</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, I concur with you entirely except for the part about forget about Benghazi. I know what you meant with the figure of speech...</p><p>BOLTON: Just leave it aside for these purposes. It's very much a part of it. It shows the war on terror is very much with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Ambassador, as always, great to have you with us -- Ambassador John Bolton.</p><p>BOLTON: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: The story of the night, e-commerce giant eBay has announced it's repatriating almost $9 billion of its money now held overseas and return that money to the United States, eBay taking a $3 billion tax hit to make that move, which will net it about $6 billion after taxes to use for any potential acquisitions, or any other use, in this country.</p><p>By comparison, other big tech companies like Apple are working hard to avoid such taxes, and companies like Google. Apple this week, by the way, raised $12 billion through a bond sale rather than bring back some of the $150 billion that it has in banks all around the world, including the United States, of course.</p><p>Again, to eBay, we salute you. I think that is an extraordinary act of leadership, and if I may say so, patriotism.</p><p>We're coming right back.</p><p>House Speaker Boehner denies he was mocking his fellow Republicans and denies there's a secret conspiracy to jam through immigration legislation. Senator <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>with us tonight to tell the truth about a worsening divide in the GOP.</p><p>DOBBS: Our next guest today voted to block the federal minimum wage bill from proceeding. Joining us is Senator <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions, </nameText></person>a member of a number of very important committees, including Budget, Armed Services and the Judiciary. Senator, great to have you with us.</p><p>The minimum wage -- the president has pivoted to the economy and to jobs and wages, income inequality. Your thoughts about the pivot and the minimum wage, in which -- I guess there are, what, 39 states that already have a higher minimum wage. Give us your perspective, if you would, Senator.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JEFF SESSIONS </nameText></person>(R), ALABAMA: Well, the Congressional Budget Office told us this would cost another half million, 500,000 jobs if it were to pass. Fundamentally, the American workers is hurting and we need to understand that. We need to create in this country and desperately need to create a growth pattern that takes us from this stagnation to rising wages and better employment data. And it's just not happening under the president's policies, each one of which are hurting growth, pulling down prosperity, such as regulation, taxes and energy rules and \"Obama care.\" All of those are hurting the economy.</p><p>DOBBS: I want should shift to immigration legislation. The House of Representatives, particularly the House Judiciary Committee, has taken the lead on immigration legislation, and I think -- and fully support -- the four bills that they have moved out of committee, and now the GOP seems to be intent on destroying that leadership advantage. The four bills amount to me, at least, to a very important legislative initiative, and Speaker Boehner has just thrown it all away, reversing himself nine times on immigration legislation, immigration reform, whatever you want to call it, and now mocks his colleagues and then denies he was mocking them. What is going on?</p><p>SESSIONS: Look, there does seem to be some confusion, but we have to recognize that -- and give the credit to the House that they have blocked the Senate bill, thank goodness, which would have been a disaster. But if you care about workers, you want to see their wages increase, you want to see them and their children have a chance to have good jobs, you've got to have a reasonable flow into America, not an excess flow, as experts tell us now.</p><p>One of the big factors in decline of wages is this extraordinary flow of legal and illegal immigration into America. So we need a lawful system that people can be proud of, that serves our national interests and protects American workers. That's a legitimate interest of public officials, and I wish -- I think Speaker Boehner needs to be really focused on that and all of the issues that relate to it and less just looking to pass a bill.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, you know, has been at the forefront on aggressively seeking comprehensive immigration reform. What is your assessment about how what amounts to a amnesty would affect minorities in Silicon Valley and the labor market there?</p><p>SESSIONS: You know, they talk like they -- they are asking for comprehensive reform, not just reform that would help Silicon Valley, with higher educated workers. That's not what they're supporting. They're supporting the whole thing, which would bring in millions of low-skilled workers, doubling the number of guest workers who would come to the country not just to work on farms but take all kinds of jobs at a time when African-Americans, Hispanics are hurting. Wages are falling.</p><p>And -- and Lou, I believe in a free market. I think most businesses do.</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>SESSIONS: If we don't have a surplus of workers, why are wages falling? If we have a shortage of workers, why aren't wages going up?</p><p>DOBBS: As we wrap up here, Senator, this divide in the GOP, particularly over immigration, but other issues, as well -- is this a point at which -- is this -- has this reached a point at which the Republican Party is jeopardizing what looks to be a November of victory for the party?</p><p>SESSIONS: Lou, I truly believe that we need to make crystal clear that we represent the average American worker and their interests, and we're going to fight for them. It's not about big business. They're doing fine. It's not about entrepreneurs. They take their risk, and they -- some make it and some don't.</p><p>It's about the millions of people every day that try to do the right thing that are not doing well. And our principles will work for them. We need to articulate that, and we need to address ourselves as their bulwark, their protector and their defender. And if we do it effectively, I think this could be a good year for Republicans. If Republicans simply use classical pro-business rhetoric, it won't be so good.</p><p>DOBBS: Senator, as always, good to talk with you -- Senator <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions.</nameText></person></p><p>SESSIONS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's take a look at last night's on-line poll results. We asked you who you believe is the least trustworthy among a group of luminaries, including John Boehner, Harry Reid and the president himself. Well, President Obama received a whopping 72 percent of your vote, Senator Reid 20 percent and Congressman Boehner 8 percent.</p><p>Be sure to vote in our poll tonight.

Leading psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig joins us to tell us what's going on here, next.</p><p>DOBBS: The NAACP says Clippers owner Donald Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA isn't harsh enough. The Civil Rights organization also want to meet with NBA commissioner Adam Silver to talk about diversity in the executive ranks of the league, or perhaps -- just perhaps -- the NAACP thinks the NBA should have emulated the NAACP and given Sterling the Lifetime Achievement Award! Maybe, just maybe, they're trying to play a little catch-up with the commissioner, who, by all accounts, including the players' organization, has done a, if you'll forgive the expression, sterling job.</p><p>Here now to psychoanalyze Mr. Sterling, the Obama administration, congressional leaders, the NAACP, and indeed, the entire society that is now once again talking race, leading psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig. Doctor, great to have you here.</p><p>ROBI LUDWIG, PSYCHOTHERAPIST: Nice to be here. No small job, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: I thought we'd just -- it is -- you know, I -- first of all, I'm going to start with this. I mean, you're talking about one -- one old fool, who's -- you know, I don't know what his mental condition is. I don't care. He was -- I mean, that's crazy talk.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LUDWIG: It's disturbing. But there are people who feel this way. They just may be smart enough not to say it...</p><p>DOBBS: How many are there?</p><p>LUDWIG: ... so that they get...</p><p>DOBBS: How many are there?</p><p>LUDWIG: You know, I don't know, but whenever you hear...</p><p>DOBBS: But that's my point.</p><p>LUDWIG: I don't know, but whenever you hear one person say something in a group...</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>LUDWIG: ... you know that they're not the only one. And I think that's what's so disturbing is to think this kind of vintage racism still exists.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, it does exist, and...</p><p>LUDWIG: It does.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, there are serial killers out there. There are all sorts of aberrant personalities that you work with every day.</p><p>LUDWIG: Yes. Right.</p><p>DOBBS: My question is, looking at Sterling there, making these comments is crazy. And -- but there are a lot of other questions going around it. What are we doing as a society? What are we -- as a culture? How is it that a man who is -- and this is a question I had from the beginning -- 33 years! He's the longest tenured owner, and they didn't know that he was an outright racist?</p><p>LUDWIG: Well, they probably knew it, but there's something very different when everyone in the world hears someone talking and having a conversation and being so blatantly racist to their mixed girlfriend, who is half Mexican, half black, and saying, Why don't you be a nice white girl? I mean, he's basically saying he's in denial about who he's dating and he's basically telling his girlfriend, You should pass as somebody who's white. So you know, it really doesn't make a lot of sense. But when you hear it...</p><p>DOBBS: He's a crazy...</p><p>LUDWIG: ... it's very different.</p><p>DOBBS: He is a crazy old man talking about, as you say, passing -- I mean, she is of a mixed race...</p><p>LUDWIG: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: ... and he's telling her not to associate with people who look like her.</p><p>LUDWIG: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: It is mind-boggling. So...</p><p>LUDWIG: It is mid-boggling. But the truth of matter is we all stereotype. Doesn't mean that we're all prejudiced, but we all stereotype and tend to feel more comfortable with people in our own group. We lend more psychological positive qualities to people who are in our own group versus outside groups.</p><p>But most people who are intelligent and educated and exposed don't hold onto these false ideas about other people in other groups in this gross way.</p><p>DOBBS: The reaction here -- the NAACP saying that the NBA should have been stronger in its response to Sterling, and this after they are about to give him a lifetime achievement award, presumably because he'd donated a bunch of money.</p><p>LUDWIG: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: I mean, this is setting off all sorts of bizarre responses.</p><p>LUDWIG: From what I hear, people liked the way the NBA handled it, the way the commissioner handled it, saying that he should be banned for lifetime. You know, listen, I don't think that this guy should be able to own the team anymore. And I know that there are legalities, but somebody who, you know, owns a team with black players -- first of all, why are these black players playing for this guy?</p><p>DOBBS: And why -- and why would the -- some players -- they're ex-players -- say, you know, this is a black league? What difference should that make? It'd be no less offensive if there were fewer blacks.</p><p>LUDWIG: Right. Now, listen, immunity, one would hope that the players would say, Listen, this is just unacceptable. But again, they also have a dream that they want to achieve, and perhaps you go into denial. They're living out their dream, and you can say, Well, he's offering a certain...</p><p>DOBBS: Do you think this is a pretty -- we're going to have to wrap this up...</p><p>LUDWIG: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: ... but it looks to me like we're a pretty healthy society, and what I'm hearing a lot of talk about race -- you know, and there's no question it's out there. But this was handled, I think, terrifically by...</p><p>LUDWIG: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: ... the commissioner, by the players association. And this is...</p><p>LUDWIG: And how wonderful that we're shocked -- we're shocked to hear this kind of perspective in that we think it's ill, and unacceptable. That is a positive.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes I think there are lot of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LUDWIG: You know, race has been always a subtle -- there are subtleties but we don't accept it anymore and that's a positive.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes I think this thing is an absolutely positive story across just across our entire society. And I think that there is no surprise that frankly the commissioner handled it so well.</p><p>LUDWIG: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: And the players handled it so well.</p><p>LUDWIG: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: I think these are all delightful new realities.</p><p>LUDWIG: Absolutely we have a long way to go but we're moving in the right direction. That is all anyone can ask right.</p><p>DOBBS: See I don't even buy the long way to go, I think we're getting closer every day.</p><p>LUDWIG: Ok. All right.</p><p>DOBBS: Dr. Robi Ludwig always good to see you.</p><p>LUDWIG: Likewise.</p><p>DOBBS: The Donald Sterling scandal giving late night host plenty of fodder. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONAN O'BRIEN, TALK SHOW HOST: The NBA has banned Donald Sterling for life for his racist comments. It occurred to me if Sterling has a problem with black people maybe he should think about owning a hockey team. I think that's the way --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well the jokes on Conan, Philadelphia Flyers winger Wayne Simmons one of the few black players in the NHL scored his first career playoff hat trick yesterday, helping the Flyers force a game seven in their first round series. Catch up. Conan catch up.</p><p>Now the quotation of the evening as we begin to understand more about the White House's efforts over the past year and a half, the stonewall, the investigations of the Benghazi scandal.</p><p>The quotation, \"The world is not fair. And often fools, cowards, liars and the selfish hide in high places.\" Words of Bryant H. McGill.</p><p>We're coming right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The Benghazi stonewall is collapsing. As latest report from the State Department reveals al Qaeda is definitely not on the run. Talk show hosts Chris Plante, Tammy Bruce and John Gibson with us next.</p><p>DOBBS: The issue of capital punishment back on the spotlight after a lethal injection in Oklahoma didn't go quite as planned. Death row inmate Clayton Lockett had an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after the start of what was supposed to be his execution in that state that means using a new drug combination for the first time. Lockett awakened during the execution called out, rived in pain prompting the White House to weigh in saying it wasn't done humanely.</p><p>We would like to remind everyone that Lockett was convicted of shooting a 19 year-old and watching two accomplices bury her alive in 1999. I think the protest might be extended beyond simply that 43 minutes of pain and agony for the executed.</p><p>Joining us now, the \"A-Team\" some of our favorite radio talk-show hosts: in Washington D.C., WMAL, radio talk show host, Chris Plante; in Los Angeles, Tammy Bruce a talk stream live radio host and good to have you with us; and from Dallas Fox News radio talk show host, John Gibson. John good to see you.</p><p>And Chris Plante, let's start with you. Let's talk about the White House protests of the inhumane execution of a murderer.</p><p>CHRIS PLANTE, WMAL RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well I am not surprised that they are jumping on that one too something else to change the subject with. You sort of glossed over the crime, the crime was more hideous than I would even want to describe here but the gentleman that was put to death last night and I don't think he was in pain for 43 minutes he just woke up in the first few minutes and then he went back down and much too much is being made of it if you ask me. He was a four-time convicted felon.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: Well let me be clear. What I'm making -- I'm making much of and that is our society's reaction to this event.</p><p>PLANTE: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: And the muted, often muted reaction to those victims who are -- who are murdered by folks like him.</p><p>PLANTE: Right and I don't see the -- I don't see the news media going to the family of the 19-year-old girl that was shot twice with a 12-gauge shotgun that was kidnapped, her friend was duct taped and raped. These guys were you know collecting on the debt. They are gangsters. They are murders. They were laughing it up while they killed the girl.</p><p>Forgive me if I have trouble feeling too much sympathy for someone because he sat up for a minute and came out of the anesthetic. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it myself.</p><p>DOBBS: Tammy?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, TALK STREAM LIVE RADIO HOST: Well look I mean this is a -- it's fascinating all the levels of interest here. You know there is a lot of outpouring on Twitter by liberals you know wringing their hands over what happened to this guy. But those very same people have nothing to say about four decent innocent men who were killed in Benghazi. You can see the strange kind of death of right and wrong when it comes to whom --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PLANTE: Yes.</p><p>BRUCE: -- the left is worried about and truly you've got a dynamic of people saying it was inhumane. Inhumane is doing anything short to him than shooting him and burying him alive. I think that we also have to challenge the premise of what is humane. I mean we are executing someone. He's got a pillow to lay his head on, he gets to say his last words to people. And I think that that's a pretty big gift that we give somebody like this. But remember this is -- the left wants to use any dynamic they can to reinforce the message to America that they think America is bad. My -- my suggestion is we just go right back to the firing squad. It's quick, it is painless and it's cheap.</p><p>DOBBS: John?</p><p>JOHN GIBSON, FOX NEWS RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Guillotine, firing squad, hanging -- you know. I mean look theoretically the executioner was in charge of making sure the guy died. He wears a gun.</p><p>BRUCE: Right.</p><p>GIBSON: And he could pull out a gun and shoot him in the head. I mean what are we -- what are we really talking about here. The point was to get him dead and eventually they accomplished it. Look I don't want to see anybody in unnecessary pain. Hey hanging it worked for a very long time. Firing squad has worked for a very long time. The guillotine was pretty efficient. You know, I know what's going to happen here. This is all about not the method of the death penalty but the death penalty itself.</p><p>DOBBS: Of course.</p><p>GIBSON: And it's going to start all that all over again.</p><p>BRUCE: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes and -- and much of it you know is the same blather that we've all heard for decades in some cases.</p><p>GIBSON: Fifty years.</p><p>DOBBS: Chris let's go to, speaking of blather, that stonewall that has at least got a crack in it now around the White House and on the Benghazi scandal. Your thoughts about the Ben Rhodes e-mail and what it does clearly imply.</p><p>PLANTE: Well it -- what it clearly implies at a bare minimum is that the White House has been lying to us all along when they said that the intelligence community, the CIA talking points provided with the information that this was all in response to a videotape. That's been the crux of the cover-up all along. And this is a vital node in that cover up and I think that it -- it ought to certainly if we've got any interest from the mainstream news media and perhaps we will now it ought to lead to the collapse of this cover-up and Jay Carney today I almost felt sorry for him when he was getting --</p><p>GIBSON: No, no don't do that.</p><p>DOBBS: I could not get there Chris.</p><p>PLANTE: Yes almost, yes almost.</p><p>GIBSON: Don't feel sorry.</p><p>DOBBS: Tammy?</p><p>PLANTE: He was going around the yard chasing him.</p><p>GIBSON: Yes this is -- this is a guy who stands before the country and lies to your face.</p><p>PLANTE: Yes.</p><p>GIBSON: And says, yes come on believe it. And you know look he's counting on the media just going along with them and not pursuing it. But we did hear a \"New York Times\" guy go after a little bit of course, John Carl did. Maybe some ice was broken today and some people would say are we really going to sit here and let this guy lie to us without fighting back?</p><p>DOBBS: Tammy Bruce you get the last 15 seconds.</p><p>BRUCE: Well let me tell you this is a perfect example of what the Obama administration is they've gotten away with lying. It is what they do. It's what they do turn to first. It is something the Americans have had enough of and we're going to be making that point I think in November.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: But this goes much higher than Ben Rhodes he is not the initiator of this and you know it appears that Obama and Hillary --</p><p>DOBBS: We'll be following -- we'll be following that -- I'm sorry, we've got to go.</p><p>BRUCE: No I think Obama and Hillary are going to be in this at some point.</p><p>PLANTE: Hillary.</p><p>DOBBS: A reminder to vote in our poll. Thank you guys.</p><p>PLANTE: Hillary.</p><p>DOBBS: I think I got it. A reminder to vote on our poll tonight the question is would you be more likely or less likely to vote for a member of former President's family? Vote at LouDobbs.com tweet your response at Lou Dobbs News.</p><p>Up next the DOW closes at an all-time record high despite well some downdraft and Citigroup global economist Ben Mandel's outlook next.</p><p>DOBBS: Our word of the evening, tonight a bonus edition. It's really a phrase of the evening relevant to the scene at the White House press briefing when Jay Carney tried to explain away the new Benghazi e-mails; this one out of the Watergate era -- not the e-mail -- the phrase. \"Modified limited hangout\" defined as a public-relations or propaganda technique that involves a release previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important truths.</p><p>On Wall Street today stocks moved higher after the Fed announced it will continue to taper. The Dow gaining 45 points closing at a new record high. The S&amp;P up six, the Nasdaq up 11. For the month, the Dow and S&amp;P less than one percent higher, the Nasdaq losing two percent in April. Crude oil down more than a dollar settling below $100; gold down a fraction closing just below $1,296 an once; the yield on the 10-year dropping to 2.65 percent. The economy, the Commerce Department faithfully reported actually up one- tenth of a percent in the first quarter. That feels like down to me.</p><p>Twitter shares down weighing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing 8 percent today. Pepco up 17 percent, Exelon agreeing to buy the company in a $6.8 billion deal. Taxpayers losing more than $11 billion in the GM bailout it turns out -- a billion more than previously both estimated and reported.</p><p>Joining us now Ben Mandel, who's an economist for City Research, great to have you here.</p><p>BEN MANDEL, ECONOMIST: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: 0.1 percent -- what is that?</p><p>MANDEL: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: That is not even worth the time to calculate it, is it?</p><p>MANDEL: Normally when you set expectations low it is easy to hurdle right over them -- right; but not so today. So in the first quarter, the economy underperformed. Our expectations which are already low but the good news is that they did so in such a way that suggests or at least it's consistent with the idea of accelerating growth through the middle year. Sort of a bounce back from adverse weather considered and kind of some underlying strength in the economy showing through.</p><p>DOBBS: You know the thing that I love about all of these Commerce Department reports is they are always getting smaller in my rearview mirror as they post them. It is so much yesterday, you know, the last quarter. I think most people are so focused on the future they (inaudible) to look to what we can expect in terms of employment. We had an ADP number that was very strong. What are your expectations for Friday when we get the Labor Department report on employment?</p><p>MANDEL: Right. So two things on that. First you are correct that the labor number is a more real-time measure of economic performance and that we're going to get the April number whereas GDP, you know, they wait until the whole quarter is over and then it takes three months to get the full picture of what happened essentially six months ago.</p><p>DOBBS: And then they give us -- they give us a bonus weather report to remind us how tough it was back then.</p><p>MANDEL: Yes. But the thing about the jobs number that labor indicators in general are lagging indictors of economic activity, that is to say usually where the economy goes labor follows. So in a sense, you know, what we're seeing in the labor market is some latent recovery in the underlying engine of growth.</p><p>DOBBS: So you're expecting a stronger number? How strong?</p><p>MANDEL: We have penciled in 220,000. So --</p><p>DOBBS: You are being modest. Put that thing in ink.</p><p>MANDEL: Yes, pencils and erasers for a reason but the idea that we are looking for something that's higher than trend. The trend growth over the past six months has been just under 200,000 so now we're finally looking to, to break upwards of that trend.</p><p>DOBBS: So moving above 200,000 the unemployment rate you expect it then to be significantly lower?</p><p>MANDEL: The unemployment is a much slower moving object as you know. It could tick down to 6.6 from 6.7. I guess maybe the specific number is not important but the contour of the date indicates a gradual improvement in the unemployment rate.</p><p>DOBBS: And your outlook for these markets and through the remainder of the year? Are we going to start seeing some job creation models? Are we going to start singing a market settled down a bit and gain a lot of ground?</p><p>MANDEL: Well, I should certainly hopes so in the sense that we have an economic forecast of above 3.5 percent GDP growth in the middle of this year.</p><p>DOBBS: Ben thanks so much. It's great to have you here.</p><p>MANDEL: My pleasure -- thanks again.</p><p>Dobbs: Ben Mandel.</p><p>Be sure to listen to my financial reports three times a day coast-to-coast on the Salem Radio Network for all the days biggest and best market and business news.</p><p>Up next my commentary on the American public's disapproval of the political dynasties and how that correlates to the votes and the candidates they support -- next.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: And now a few quick thoughts about American political dynasties and American voters. And really the word \"dynasty\" and America don't go well together. The \"Wall Street Journal\" and NBC in their latest poll asked Americans whether they agree with first lady Barbara Bush that presidents should not come from political dynasties. Nearly seven in ten Americans agreed with Mrs. Bush who also said there have been enough Bushes in the White House. She also said later that her son Jeb is the best qualified person to run for president -- a good mother indeed.</p><p>That poll however gave me a glimmer of hope about 2016 but then I saw two new polls asking Americans about specific 2016 contenders. And I saw that if the Republican nomination for president were up for election today Jeb Bush would win or tie with Rand Paul.

I'm John Vause, live from Studio 7 at CNN World Headquarters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming up on CNN NEWSROOM: with looming criminal indictments and after failing to form a government twice, Israel's longest serving prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now facing his first serious challenge for the leadership of his Likud Party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Christmas misery for the Philippines after a deadly typhoon pummeled once small island after another, destroying homes and buildings, uprooting trees and flooding cars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Boeing's PR blitz to regain public trust in the wake of two crashes just months apart involving their 737 MAX airliner.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: And we begin with a security scare for the Israeli prime minister, rushed from the stage of a campaign rally and surrounded by bodyguards was taken a nearby bomb shelter with Israel about to vote in its third national election in 12 months. Benjamin Netanyahu was on the stump in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon when air raid sirens warned of an incoming rocket fire coming from Gaza.</p><p>Netanyahu returned to the stage, saying the rocket had been intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system. The prime minister is staring down the first serious challenge to his leadership of his political party. His opponent has openly challenged Netanyahu and in the coming hours, thousands of party members are expected to vote. CNN's Oren Liebermann reports from Jerusalem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a serious challenge for the leadership of the Likud, the political party he has led for more than a decade. His challenger, hardline right wing hardcore politician Gideon Sa'ar, a former minister of education. Whoever wins this race becomes the leader of the Likud Party and will be Likud's candidate for prime minister in the election in March. If Netanyahu win, the political map doesn't really change that much.</p><p>But if Sa'ar wins, it could effectively be the end of Netanyahu. He remains prime minister until someone else forms a government after the next elections. The 70-year-old Israeli leader has pretty much ignored Sa'ar during the short campaign, instead focusing on his own accomplishments as prime minister.</p><p>Meanwhile Sa'ar promises to succeed where Netanyahu has failed and break Israel's political deadlock. Political analysts expect Netanyahu to win, he's won all the last leadership races for the Likud in a big way. No other challenger has gotten even 30 percent of the vote in more than a decade.</p><p>What about this time?</p><p>Netanyahu faces a much more difficult situation. After the two last national elections, he failed to form a government. Now he faces criminal indictment on charges of bribery and fraud and breach of trust in separate corruption investigations. He says he's innocent but it's one more bump in the road for him and his race.</p><p>Netanyahu wants to win and win big. If he takes this leadership race, something like 80-20, it cements his control of the Likud Party and shows the strong loyalty that the party has to its longtime leader.</p><p>But if this is a close race, for example 55- 45 or something along those lines, it will be seen as a major blow to Netanyahu. He may have won but if he doesn't win big, it's a sign that the party might be shifting away from him and in a different direction.</p><p>That could do a damage to Netanyahu in the upcoming election in March. We expect results of the leadership race sometime in the early hours of Friday morning local time -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, Jerusalem.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Democrats and Republicans dig in over procedural matters for the upcoming impeachment trial of Donald Trump. One Republican senator has appeared to side with Democrats, overtly criticizing Senate leader Mitch McConnell who said the trial would be in total coordination with the White House defense team.</p><p>Senator Lisa Murkowski says those remarks are disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK): To me it means that we have to take that step back from being hand in glove with the defense. And so, I heard what leader McConnell had said, I happen to think that that has further confused the process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate until leader Mitch McConnell announces the rules for the upcoming president's trial.</p><p>[00:05:00]</p><p>VAUSE: A powerful typhoon has claimed at least five lives in the Philippines. Phanfone made fall on Tuesday, bringing strong, gusting winds, heavy rain and storm surges. Early reports indicate that some areas have received as much as 20 centimeters of rain.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>VAUSE: Authorities in central Chile believe that arson is responsible for wildfires which have spread to the outskirts of the coastal city of Valparaiso about 120 kilometers from the capital. At least 200 houses have been destroyed and families have been left homeless. Thousands of residents have been hit with power outages. But so far no lives have been lost and no one has been seriously hurt.</p><p>During her annual Christmas message, Queen Elizabeth reflected on a turbulent 2019. But for the royal family, the year ended with some good news. The queen's husband, Prince Philip, was discharged from the hospital in time to spend Christmas with family. But he was unable to attend church services on Wednesday at Sandringham.</p><p>Instead, the queen was joined by Prince Charles and wife, Camilla, as well as William and Kate and two of their three children. But Prince Harry and wife, Meghan, were on vacation in Canada.</p><p>Later, during a televised message, Her Majesty talked about the need for reconciliation and urged everyone to follow the example of Jesus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH II, QUEEN OF ENGLAND: Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps. The path, of course, is not always smooth and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy.</p><p>But small steps can make a world of difference. And as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Like most families, the royals had their highs and lows in 2019. They celebrated the birth of baby Archie to Harry and Meghan. They agonized over the very public sex scandal involving Prince Andrew. Last month he announced that he was stepping back from public duties and on Wednesday he quietly slipped into Sandringham for that private church service with the family. Max Foster has more about the royal year in review.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's been a tumultuous and unsettling year for the British royal family with three senior members stepping back from public life. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex did so voluntarily but only temporarily after a series of run-ins with the media.</p><p>In March, CNN revealed that palace staff had to beef up their social media operation amid a rise in racist abuse targeting the Duchess.</p><p>Then in October, the couple revealed in a documentary with ITV how difficult they were finding life in the spotlight.</p><p>\"I never thought that this would be easy but I thought that it would be fair,\" the duchess said.</p><p>They also went on the offensive over what Harry described as a \"tabloid campaign\" against Meghan that mirrored the treatment meted out to his mother, Princess Diana. The Duchess sued \"The Mail\" on Sunday alleging that it illegally published a private letter to her father.</p><p>The Duke launched his own legal proceedings against the \"Daily Mirror\" and \"The Sun\" over alleged phone hacking.</p><p>[00:10:00]</p><p>FOSTER (voice-over): All the publications deny all the charges and have vowed to fight them vigorously.</p><p>The queen's second son, Prince Andrew, also retreated from public life at the end of the year. But this may be longer term. It followed an interview he did with the BBC and the media backlash that followed it in which he talked about his association with the convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Epstein had allegedly trafficked Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 years old and forced her to have sex with the Duke of York and others. He said he had no recollection of ever meeting her but failed to express sympathy for Epstein's victims in the interview or any regret for his relationship with the disgraced financier.</p><p>He only did so in a follow-up statement, in which he said, \"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims and I deeply sympathize with everyone who's been affected and wants some form of closure.\"</p><p>CNN understands that Andrew decided to step back from his public roles after a meeting with his mother. The queen remains firmly in charge of the family, we're told, and has no intention of stepping back from public life herself, despite heading into her 94th year -- Max Foster, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) VAUSE: Still to come, it's a simple message; there's nothing to fear, Boeing's PR blitz, working overtime to convince the flying public the 737 MAX will be safe.</p><p>Also ahead, remember way back, when they couldn't get over the plant based substitute for a cow?</p><p>And they said it wouldn't last?</p><p>They were right. After the break, a big serving of the year's top business stories right here on CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: Last week, Boeing fired its CEO and now the company has reportedly launched a frantic PR blitz to try to regain the trust of airlines around the world and the flying public. After the 737 MAX was involved in two fatal crashes just months apart. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Boeing has been doing damage control behind the scenes after these two horrific crashes involving their 737 MAX jets.</p><p>Now according to documents obtained by \"The New York Times,\" Boeing has been serving thousands of customers around the world since May about what they would feel safe flying on the MAX once it is back in service.</p><p>Earlier this month 40 percent of passengers told the company they would not be flying on the MAX and that is unchanged from October. Boeing is also reaching out to the airlines, according to \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>Last week they held 30-minute conference calls with major airlines outlining how they can respond to passengers who may have concerns about flying on the MAX 737.</p><p>[00:15:00]</p><p>YURKEVICH: For example, if a passenger realizes they're on a MAX at the gate, Boeing is suggesting to agents they should rebook them on a different flight or even have the pilot speak to them in person to reassure them.</p><p>Or if a passenger starts to panic in air, Boeing suggests treating it like a medical emergency and try and de-escalate that passenger.</p><p>We reached out to Boeing on all of this and here's what they had to say, quote, \"We routinely engage with our airline customers, communications teams, to seek their feedback and brief them on our latest plans. Each airline is different in their needs so we provide a wide range of documents and assistance that they can choose to use or tailor as they see fit.\"</p><p>Now this is all coming after earlier this week when Boeing fired their CEO but what these documents, obtained by \"The New York Times,\" reveal is that Boeing is very conscious of the uphill battle it has with passengers and regaining their trust after the loss of 346 lives in those two horrific crashes -- back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: The biggest crisis at Boeing in a generation was just one of the big business stories which dominated the headlines in 2019.

We take regular astronomy images that you'd show to the public to get them excited about astronomy but we make them tactile.</p><p>And the way we do this is we 3D print our models and we have a nice software one of my colleagues wrote that basically takes the brightness of any part of the image and turned into a tactile height.</p><p>So by running your fingertips on top of this you will feel the image in exactly the same way that your eyes will be seeing the image. So you're feeling there a bright feeling amidst the dim and you can get an overall picture of the shape.</p><p>And, of course, on the backs of these, we have the images that these were made from so people can look at one side and feel the other side if they have a little bit of usable vision. Some people will be much more comfortable using their ears than their fingertips so we are eventually going to introduce audio components to all of this as well.</p><p>What we're hearing is what it would sound like if we would listen to all of the stars that you can see just using the naked eye. The louder noises are the brighter stars, the lighter noises are the fainter stars, which appear louder on as the sun gets lower and lower below the horizon.</p><p>The high pitched stars are blue and the low pitched stars are red.

That's about to change</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It reads like a coroner's report on the news business, 623 pages filled with charts and graphs detailing the devastating decline in local news and public policy reporting of the past decade. It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Jerry Dias: Why hasn't Canada taken on Facebook and Google to save journalism?( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jerry-dias-why-hasnt-canada-taken-on-facebook-and-google-to-save-journalism\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jerry-dias-why-hasnt-canada-taken-on-facebook-and-google-to-save-journalism</url> )</p><p>John Ivison: Liberals should follow the French lead and force tech giants to pay for news content( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-liberals-should-follow-the-french-lead-and-force-tech-giants-to-pay-for-news-content\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-liberals-should-follow-the-french-lead-and-force-tech-giants-to-pay-for-news-content</url> )</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favor of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>Isabelle de Silva, the head of France's Competition Authority.</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bare-knuckled News Corp. - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News' airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the U.S. media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers' business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing checks in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp. CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as if the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp. earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Richard Gingras, Google's VP of News, at the Toronto offices, Thursday May 3, 2018.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators' demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneuver in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the U.S., and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the U.S. and France to pay directly for \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favor of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp., said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the U.S.</p><p>Ben Smith is the media columnist.

That's about to change</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>It reads like a coroner's report on the news business, 623 pages filled with charts and graphs detailing the devastating decline in local news and public policy reporting of the past decade. It landed on the Australian prime minister's desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p>But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism's demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p>\"Global tech companies are not beyond national laws, especially when there is so much at stake,\" Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and author of the report, texted me this weekend on WhatsApp.</p><p>Jerry Dias: Why hasn't Canada taken on Facebook and Google to save journalism?( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jerry-dias-why-hasnt-canada-taken-on-facebook-and-google-to-save-journalism\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jerry-dias-why-hasnt-canada-taken-on-facebook-and-google-to-save-journalism</url> )</p><p>John Ivison: Liberals should follow the French lead and force tech giants to pay for news content( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-liberals-should-follow-the-french-lead-and-force-tech-giants-to-pay-for-news-content\">https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-liberals-should-follow-the-french-lead-and-force-tech-giants-to-pay-for-news-content</url> )</p><p>Sims and a like-minded regulator in France, Isabelle de Silva, are challenging a universally accepted fact of the internet: that Google and Facebook can carry content created by news organizations without directly paying the organizations for creating it. Last month, as the coronavirus put hundreds of publishers out of business around the world, the Australian government instructed Sims to force the platforms to negotiate payments with newspaper publishers - making it the first country to do so.</p><p>Sims, a pugnacious 69-year-old who has spent much of his career tangling with railroads, ports and phone companies, sees echoes of those classic monopolies in this battle: \"The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favor of the platforms. This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.\"</p><p>Isabelle de Silva, the head of France's Competition Authority.</p><p>In France, where regulators are demanding that Google cut a deal to pay publishers, the pandemic crisis has added \"all the more urgency,\" said de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, which is enforcing a European Commission change to copyright law that will soon take effect across the continent.</p><p>Players on all sides predict the Australian and French decisions will set global precedents. Leaders from Ireland to Malaysia have indicated they're paying attention. And in the United States, where antitrust laws are weaker and regulators have been more laissez-faire, starving publishers are licking their chops.</p><p>\"It's kind of neat watching the dominoes fall,\" said Danielle Coffey, the general counsel for the News Media Alliance, which largely represents U.S. newspapers.</p><p>The battle between platforms and publishers is at once a matter of economic principle and an old-fashioned political brawl between powerful industries. For a decade, tech's transformative power, glamour and enormous lobbying spending allowed it to dominate, resulting in a system in which the platforms could feature and profit off the content news publishers create without paying them directly for it.</p><p>But the power of the press, even nowadays, makes it a formidable political force. Rupert Murdoch's bare-knuckled News Corp. - born in Australia and broadly loathed by its more genteel and progressive global peers - has long led the fight to claw back revenue from the tech giants, and hostility to Google bleeds through the pages of The Times of London and Fox News' airwaves. (Sims said he had never talked to Murdoch, though a spokeswoman confirmed that News Corp submitted recommendations to the inquiry.)</p><p>While much of the U.S. media rejects the idea that it is crusading in its pages to support its publishers' business agenda, most news executives in this country share a viewpoint on the platforms, having seen them pull advertising dollars from the news business and spread misinformation at the expense of professional journalism. And even as the platforms employ armies of powerful lobbyists, politicians remain eager to please the press that covers them.</p><p>\"All governments are responsive to media in some way or another, because in all countries media is the filter through which things are seen,\" Sims said.</p><p>Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Facebook and Google have approached new regulatory aggressiveness differently. Facebook, after taking a huge public beating for its role amplifying misinformation and disseminating user data in the 2016 election, has moved to give publishers what they want: money, mostly. The company began its news tab last October writing checks in the seven figures to publishers in exchange for three-year licensing deals. Facebook's attempts to make amends culminated with Mark Zuckerberg submitting to an onstage interview with a triumphant News Corp. CEO, Robert Thomson, who began by asking drolly, \"What took you so long?\" And publishers believed that Facebook had legitimately begun to address an important issue by compensating news organizations for their work.</p><p>Google has played the politics differently and, so far, much less deftly. The company has taken a patronizing approach to publishers, fronted by a gray-bearded former Salon executive, Richard Gingras, who has for years delivered the same set of talking points to increasingly irate news executives about the nature of truth and the true value of the internet - as if the year was still 2003. And while Facebook is paying publishers directly, Google has mainly handed out grants for experimental journalism projects built around Google's technology.</p><p>Thomson, in a veiled shot at Google during a News Corp. earnings call last week, accused it of trying to create \"a system of petty patronage, through faux philanthropic handouts and sententious sops, seemingly designed to institutionalize a mendicant media.\" (Gingras did not respond to an email inquiry.) And Google's temporary grant-giving to news organizations appears to follow a pattern: The company is most generous when it feels most threatened by regulation.</p><p>Richard Gingras, Google's VP of News, at the Toronto offices, Thursday May 3, 2018.</p><p>Google maintains that it delivers value to publishers by driving them traffic.</p><p>\"I do want to debunk a meme that I've heard that we don't pay or provide real value,\" the company's vice president of news product, Brad Bender, told me in a phone interview, adding that \"topical news\" of the sort Google often aggregates \"isn't a significant source of revenue for news publishers\" because they sell advertising against things like cars and fashion.</p><p>But the politics have changed drastically in the last few years, and Google's proud defiance and lectures about technology now come across as a blend of arrogance and na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9. And, perhaps showing the virtues of Facebook's more conciliatory approach, the social media giant has also succeeded in France, for now: Facebook is arguing that voluntary posts by its users to social media are intrinsically different from the way a search engine scrapes the web, and negotiating to pay publishers, so far avoiding de Silva's heavy hand.</p><p>\"We found the argument by Google that they would never pay any form of payment for any content inconsistent with the law,\" de Silva told me in a telephone interview about her efforts.</p><p>Google executives thought they'd found a way to dodge European regulation when, in Spain in 2014, they simply removed Google News from search results there rather than respond to regulators' demands for compensation. But, in a sign of how things are shifting, when they tried a similar maneuver in response to France's new regulation requiring payment for copyrighted \"snippets\" of news, de Silva pounced, ruling that the company's take-it-or-leave-it approach was itself an abuse of market power.</p><p>\"We looked at what happened in Spain,\" she said. \"This is not really an avenue that is open to them because in our decision we asked them to maintain the content is as it is today.\"</p><p>Now Facebook is negotiating with French publishers to introduce a version of the program it rolled out in the U.S., and Facebook executives told me they would expand that approach in other markets as well. The company hopes to \"work with governments to help news publishers build sustainable business models,\" its head of news, Campbell Brown, said in an email.</p><p>There are some signs that Google's strategy is shifting. The company is in discussions with some publishers in the U.S. and France to pay directly for \"feature full articles\" on Google itself, without having to click a link, according to a Google employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because negotiations are in progress. (The talks were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.) But French publishers are cool to the notion of a new product in favor of a demand they be paid for use of their content on Google's main search results pages. Thomson, of News Corp., said on the earnings call that he had seen \"harbingers\" of \"a more enlightened, socially empathetic attitude to journalism\" from Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google and its parent, Alphabet.</p><p>The European copyright negotiations were a long time coming, and are proceeding reliably through the continent's legal systems. De Silva says Google has until August \"to negotiate in good faith\" with publishers to pay for content, and Germany is expected to move in a similar direction at the end of this year. The situation in Australia appears to be moving faster, and less predictably. Sims is expected to deliver a draft code, including a system for valuing content, by July.</p><p>Sims and de Silva can't, alone, save a news industry that is still struggling to meet consumers where they are on the internet. Some publications have an enduring reliance on print, and others have styles of telling and thinking about news and revenue alike that hark back to the newspaper era. At worst, forced payments from platforms could merely prop up fading newspapers at the expense of new ways of telling stories and doing business.</p><p>But in this dire moment, the news business is starting to win some political battles. The platforms have begun to realize that while news isn't as popular as baby pictures or celebrities, it's the industry politicians care about most. The politicians who matter, at least, who are less and less to be found here in the U.S.</p><p>Ben Smith is the media columnist.

Germany, Australia and other industrialized nations are also acting to protect their democracies from Facebook's parasitic business model.</p><p>What is the Canadian government doing to protect our democracy from these nefarious platforms? Sadly, not much.</p><p>In fact, the federal government's tax policy subsidizes these information behemoths to the tune of $1.3 billion every year.</p><p>Since the 1960s, the Income Tax Act has provided incentives for Canadian companies to place ads with Canadian media outlets. These incentives protect our media from unfair foreign competition, while preserving Canadian jobs and voices.</p><p>But there's a loophole: these incentives don't apply to internet-delivered media. For example, companies trying to reach Canadians are rewarded for placing ads in a Canadian newspaper instead of the New York Times. But these rewards don't apply when ads aimed at Canadians are placed on the Times' website. Our rules are designed to reward advertisers for keeping their money in Canada, but when the advertising is digital, we don't enforce the rules.</p><p>This internet advertising loophole allows $5.5 billion to leave Canada each year. Most of that money travels down a tax-free express lane to Google, Facebook, YouTube and others south of the border.</p><p>In effect, the government is giving up $1.3 billion in tax revenue each year to make Facebookand Googleads cheaper. The rest of the world is pushing back against these anti-competitive, tax-avoiding, democracy-flouting, privacy-invading corporations, but Ottawa is sitting back, taking little meaningful action.</p><p>Ottawa has actually partnered with Facebookto combat fake news, even though this platform is the primary vehicles by which fake news is spread.</p><p>The advantages Ottawa has bestowed on these American media giants are massive, and they're sending Canadian media companies into a nose-dive toward oblivion.</p><p>Already, more than 10,000 Canadian journalists have been laid off and hundreds of media outlets have gone dark.</p><p>Google, Facebookand the other tech giants constitute the biggest threat to Canada's independence and cultural sovereignty since Hollywood. Their stranglehold on information threatens our democracy and undermines our ability to tell our own stories. They are muzzling Canada's voice.</p><p>Canadian media are vital to democracy and the sustenance of Canadian culture. Ever wonder why we don't have mass shootings, perpetual war, Trump, or privatized health care? Because we have our own culture that keeps us safe from America's shortfalls. Yet our culture is only as strong as its voice, and that voice can't survive Ottawa's inaction.</p><p>Once our media is gone, who will report our stories and produce programs about our country? CBS? Google? Facebook? Not likely.</p><p>Ottawa can stop the bleeding by ending its preferential tax treatment of the American web giants that are smothering the strong, independent journalism on which our democracy depends, and killing jobs in the print and broadcast media industries throughout Canada. Quebec took a first baby step to level the playing field in its budget this week, mandating Netflix to collect provincial sales tax.</p><p>The time has come for the Liberal government to ensure these foreign companies protect our privacy and respect our democratic values. They should be subject to effective competition laws and privacy regulation, and they should be held responsible when they publish blatant falsehoods.</p><p>But first and foremost, Ottawa must stop privileging American monopolists with tax-free status and other unfair advantages that silence Canada's voice. A country without a voice cannot long survive. It's time for Canadians to speak up, while we still can.</p><p>Daniel Bernhard is executive director and spokesperson of the watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Meanwhile, she's been acting as Bernie's loyal wing-man in debates and out on the campaign trail. Or haven't you noticed?</p><p> And she concentrates on issues that have helped broaden the joint platform. Last April, Ken Rogoff, writing for The Guardian, reported on how Elizabeth has been going after Big Tech[1], the way progressive reformers once went after, for example, railroad monopolies.'Displaying a degree of courage and clarity that is difficult to overstate,' wrote Rogoff, a former chief economist for the IMF and now a professor of economics and public policy at Harvard, 'U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has taken on big tech, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Warren's proposals amount to a total rethink of the United States' exceptionally permissive merger and acquisition policy over the past four decades. Indeed, big tech is only the poster child for a significant increase in monopoly and oligopoly power across a broad swath of the American economy. Although the best approach is still far from clear, I could not agree more that something needs to done, especially when it comes to big tech's ability to buy out potential competitors and use their platform dominance to move into other lines of business.' Warren is courageous because big tech is big money for most leading Democratic candidates, particularly progressives, for whom California is a veritable campaign-financing ATM.Although the causal relationships are difficult to untangle, there are solid grounds for believing that the rise in monopoly power has played a role in exacerbating income inequality, weakening workers' bargaining power, and slowing the rate of innovation. And, perhaps outside of China, it is a global problem, because U.S. tech monopolies have often achieved market dominance before local regulators and politicians know what has happened. The EU, in particular, has been trying to steer its own course on technology regulation. Recently, the UK commissioned an expert group, chaired by Barack Obama's former chief economist (and now my colleague) Jason Furman, that produced a very useful report on approaches to the tech sector.The debate about how to regulate the sector is eerily reminiscent of the debate over financial regulation in the early 2000s. Proponents of a light regulatory touch argued that finance was too complicated for regulators to keep up with innovation, and that derivatives trading allows banks to make wholesale changes to their risk profile in the blink of an eye. And the financial industry put its money where its mouth was, paying salaries so much higher than those in the public sector that any research assistant the Federal Reserve System trained to work on financial issues would be enticed with offers exceeding what their boss's boss was earning.There will be similar problems staffing tech regulatory offices and antitrust legal divisions if the push for tighter regulation gains traction. To succeed, political leaders need to be focused and determined, and not easily bought. One only has to recall the 2008 financial crisis and its painful aftermath to comprehend what can happen when a sector becomes too politically influential. And the U.S. and world economy are, if anything, even more vulnerable to big tech than to the financial sector, owing both to cyber aggression and vulnerabilities in social media that can pervert political debate.Another parallel with the financial sector is the outsize role of U.S. regulators. As with US foreign policy, when they sneeze, the entire world can catch a cold. The 2008 financial crisis was sparked by vulnerabilities in the U.S. and the UK, but quickly went global. A U.S.-based cyber-crisis could easily do the same. This creates an 'externality,' or global commons problem, because U.S. regulators allow risks to build up in the system without adequately considering international implications.It is a problem that cannot be overcome without addressing fundamental questions about the role of the state, privacy, and how U.S. firms can compete globally against China, where the government is using domestic tech companies to collect data on its citizens at an exponential pace. And yet many would prefer to avoid them.<url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Riifqm2cGYs/XgwuDPW1HVI/AAAAAAABtVE/dOnXu2fVG504cbTJYsUP8UXDY4sM6phLACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-12-31%2Bat%2B9.28.13%2BPM.pngThat's\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Riifqm2cGYs/XgwuDPW1HVI/AAAAAAABtVE/dOnXu2fVG504cbTJYsUP8UXDY4sM6phLACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-12-31%2Bat%2B9.28.13%2BPM.pngThat's</url> why there has been fierce pushback against Warren for daring to suggest that even if many services seem to be provided for free, there might still be something wrong. There was the same kind of pushback from the financial sector fifteen years ago, and from the railroads back in the late 1800s. Writing in the March 1881 issue of The Atlantic, the progressive activist Henry Demarest Lloyd warned that: Our treatment of 'the railroad problem' will show the quality and caliber of our political sense. It will go far in foreshadowing the future lines of our social and political growth. It may indicate whether the American democracy, like all the democratic experiments which have preceded it, is to become extinct because the people had not wit enough or virtue enough to make the common good supreme. Lloyd's words still ring true today. At this point, ideas for regulating big tech are just sketches, and of course more serious analysis is warranted. An open, informed discussion that is not squelched by lobbying dollars is a national imperative. The debate that Warren has joined is not about whether to establish socialism. It is about making capitalist competition fairer and, ultimately, stronger.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bluecalifornia?refcode=thermometer...dembox=showI\">https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bluecalifornia?refcode=thermometer...dembox=showI</url> knew just who to turn to for a solid perspective on this-- Riverside County historian and congressional candidate, Liam O'Mara. O'Mara is running on a cutting edge progressive platform against one of the most insidiously corrupt Republicans in Congress, Ken Calvert. The idea of Calvert ever taking on the establishment is... just unthinkable. He is the embodiment of congressional and personal corruption. O'Mara is the polar opposite. He told us last night that \"Years before I got into college to become a history professor, I worked in IT as a network administrator and consultant. I spent the '90s fixing and installing systems for health insurance providers and aerospace companies. During those years, the free-software/open-source movement was starting to gain ground against the old titans of the industry. I saw first-hand the desperate efforts of Sun, Novell, and IBM to keep their software competitive against a fast-changing rival that could run circles around them. I also watched in helpless horror as another titan, Microsoft, managed to beat back that challenge by getting away with monopolistic practices and bribing Congress to achieve lighter regulation. In the decades since, I have often wondered how much better things might have been if government had, for example, been more willing to enforce fair competition in the marketplace. Many more people may have joined us in using things like Linux and OpenOffice, making our computers faster, easier to maintain, and vastly cheaper. That the tech. industry is complex does not make it different from all other big industries-- it needs to be regulated in order to prevent corruption and abuse of power by virtual monopolies. The right-wing dogma that business regulates itself is wrong on all the evidence, but large corporations do one thing very well-- they bribe thought-leaders and policy-makers into accepting whatever reality they sees fit. Those in politics need to stop taking their money and pay better attention to the facts instead.

Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[5] 'The rapid spread of facial recognition surveillance is one of the most urgent threats to our basic freedom and human rights today. Every single 2020 candidate should be calling for a ban on this invasive, biased, and dangerous technology,' said Evan Greer, deputy director of non-partisan digital rights group Fight for the Future (pronouns, she/her).'Banning facial recognition is not a radical idea. It's common sense. Allowing government agencies to build a face scanning panopticon with no oversight or accountability is reckless and puts people in danger. There's growing bipartisan support to rein in biometric surveillance. Any 2020 candidate that wants to be taken seriously on tech and civil liberties[6] issues needs to be calling for a ban.' The Sanders announcement comes amid growing backlash to facial recognition surveillance that has been spreading across the country. Last month Fight for the Future launched ourBanFacialRecognition.com[7]campaign, along with an interactive map[8]showing where in the US facial recognition surveillance is being used, and also where there are local and state efforts to ban it.San Francisco[9],Somerville, MA,[10]andOakland, CA[11], recently became the first cities in the country to ban the technology. Berkeley, CA and Cambridge, MA are also considering bans, and bills to halt current use of the tech are moving in theMassachusetts[12]and Michigan[13]legislatures. In Congress, there isgrowing[14]bipartisan agreement to address the issue, but it could easily stall under pressure from law enforcement and big tech. Fight for the Future, which is a non-profit that does not endorse candidates for office, opposes attempts by the tech industry[15] (including Amazon) and law enforcement to pressure Congress to pass an industry-friendly 'regulatory framework' for facial recognition that would allow this dangerous technology to spread quickly with minimal restrictions intended to assuage public opposition. But we support narrower efforts to ban or restrict specifically egregious uses of this surveillance, such as a bill introduced recently to ban the use of facial recognition in public housing.

With the remaining centrist candidates dropping out in quick succession just before Super Tuesday, a blitz of support recharged the lagging Biden campaign as Sanders struggled to build a winning coalition. After Super Tuesday, it became clear that the Sanders campaign was not driving record turnout among young voters, a critical metric for the campaign's success.<br/>More than any candidate, Sanders reshaped the Democratic race - and often the entire political conversation - pushing the party left with a tireless message of fair wages, universal healthcare and financial reform. It's not a stretch to argue that the policies core to the Sanders campaign could have provided some protection for the U.S. against the existential threat it's facing now, with record unemployment, dangerous working conditions for hourly and gig workers and uninsured Americans left out in the cold.<br/>With Elizabeth Warren out of the race, Sanders appeared to pose the last major Democratic threat of sweeping reform to the tech industry, though some comments from Biden in January suggest otherwise. Biden hasn't suggested that regulating tech would be a central priority for his presidency, but he has stated that breaking up big tech is \"something we should take a really hard look at,\" without making any firm commitment to do so. Biden also said that he believed tech platforms should no longer be shielded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a deeply controversial policy stance that could upend some of tech's biggest businesses while causing a cascade of side-effects that could prove extremely consequential for a broad swath of the internet and its users.<br/>Over the last few years, the tech industry has faced intense scrutiny for its monopolistic tendencies, questionable labor practices and the failure of social media platforms to prevent Russia from interfering in the 2016 U.S. election. While Republicans and Democrats largely agree that tech needs to be held responsible for its failings, their motivations and proposed reforms don't always overlap. With Sanders out, Biden will likely be building out his policies with more clarity, and we'll be following those developments closely.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Sanders' exit from the 2020 race marks the end of an era, even if his ideals live on in future candidacies. From 2016 to 2020, no Democratic political figure exerted as much influence from the outside, completely transforming the national political conversation. And even out of the race, the leftmost wing of the party Sanders championed continues to wield influence as the 2020 race marches on - influence Biden would be smart to court to expand his support beyond the moderate coalition that paved his way to the nomination.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-812936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNG-CS41-JBYT-H2WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Communications Decency Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZFRThGRDIyOERDNDRBNzlCRUMzNkNBMDIzRDU5NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkEyQUE3Q0ZGNTBBNDZBQkI4Qjg5MjlFREFGQjZENDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Listen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But what we have to say about China, in fairness to China and its leadership, if I am not mistaken, they have made more progress in addressing extreme poverty than any country in the history of civilization. They have done a lot of things for their people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: He is right. According to the World Bank, the number of poor in China went from 880 million in 1981 to less than 10 million. But I wonder how they did that. Well, the Chinese socialists killed millions of poor people so there is that. Dead people are not poor, just dead.</p><p>They called that the great leap forward. And after that, they used a tool that Bernie Sanders despises, capitalism. I wish there was a visual metaphor for Bernie's argument.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: I just have to keep watching that. I don't know why. Anyway, it was only after China rigorously adopted free market principles, private ownership, decentralization that they transformed their economy from a house of horrors to something much more humane. The stuff that saved a billion lives in China maybe the things Bernie thinks has harmed our country.</p><p>The less that those who scream about inequality embrace ideas that create only more inequality by replacing equal opportunity with equal outcome. You end up with two classes, the poor and the powerful, which happened in China, and seems to be happening in San Fran, L.A. and Baltimore too.</p><p>Of course, China went cold communist resulting in mass murder, religious persecution, forced abortion of female babies and famine. The number of dead in China under Mao has to be counted in the tens of millions. So yes, praise is in order for China finally coming around to abandoning bad ideas. Maybe Bernie should do the same.</p><p>Dana, you are very, very excited about this topic today because it bothered you what he said. It probably --</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: It did and then I listened to your monologue and I look at the things I wrote down and I think, I might have been sitting next to you for many years because I don't feel like I have too much other things to add.</p><p>When Bernie Sanders says China has done a lot for his people, I thought, no it's to its people. And the idea that they put in -- that the sort of quasi-capitalism, what's happened is that they have created this middle class --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And it's a huge middle-class. And we should want to sell them a lot of things because they have money to buy. But one of the things that's upsetting to them is that there is no rule of law and they don't have private property rights. So then what do you have happen?</p><p>They would like to take their capital and move it some place else? Where do you think they want to put it?</p><p>PERINO: Right, United --</p><p>PERINO: They want to put it in the United States --</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: -- because it's safe and you have rule of law. And, I mean, would love to have somebody in the United States actually stand up for the human rights problems, like, Bernie Sanders doesn't talk about that at all in the interview.</p><p>And I think that he agrees with President Trump on being tough on China regarding trade.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: But other than that, I don't see how the Democrats are actually differentiating themselves from President Trump at all on China. The president, however, has started -- remember at the state of the union, what did he say? The United States will never be a socialist country. And that was his opening salvo to differentiate himself against the Democrats and the Democrats don't seem to be doing anything to stop that.</p><p>GUTFELD: It seems that they are just moving leftward, Juan. Leftward and leftward and left ward. That's not even a question, I admit it.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I'm glad you admit it, because otherwise it would be very Chinese and authoritarian of you. But I must say that I think Bernie is speaking against the heavy handed use of tariffs which is driving the whole economy to the verge of recession and damaging the Chinese economy.</p><p>So what he is saying is, there should be -- there is an opportunity I think he is saying, for closer ties between the U.S. and China that we don't have to somehow demonize them as all evil and terrible. And if it's not J. Powell at the Federal Reserve, then it's, you know, the Chinese president as our enemy.</p><p>I think he is trying to get out of that mind set. But I thought you are exactly right when you talked about how China has made progress. I mean, to my mind, maybe you're even giving too much credit to the Chinese government.</p><p>Because I think it's after Mao, after the revolution, after the re- education camps and the torture and the murder, that then we see the Chinese people start to rise up with the opportunity to employ free market ideas like property, like investments and bringing in American companies.</p><p>But to me, it's still the case and you can see it from, you know, the news we have today about Hong Kong and about the protests. You can see it in terms of no free press. You can see it and understand it in terms of repression of how they treat the Muslim minority there in China, that the Chinese government is still, to me, heavy handed and authoritarian.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, I would give them credit for, you know, I think what is a three-quarters of the reduction for global poverty over the last 20 years has been in China.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's tremendous. But I think Bernie is speaking less about that actually than he is about, hey, why can't we work with China instead of, and this just speaks to Dana's point, instead of using these tariffs in a way that is not to our advantage because it's hurting our economy, it's hurting Germany economy, it's hurting China's economy.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right, Jason.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I would love to see Bernie Sanders get on an airplane and make that speech in Hong Kong because --</p><p>PERINO: That would be powerful.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- come on. They continue to praise these communist countries. If he wasn't praising China, he was praising Venezuela. If he wasn't praising Venezuela, he was praising Russia. He is not -- he is a leader of the Democratic Party. He's not even in the Democratic Party. He is a Democratic socialist.</p><p>And what he has got to understand and the difference between what he is doing and Donald Trump and everybody else is doing, is showing the positive things of capitalism. Yes, it can be better, but it has lifted more people up out of poverty, provided more wealth in the history of the world than anything else. And yet, he can't bring himself to actually giving capitalism the credit it deserves.</p><p>GUTFELD: What do you think, Emily? You hate capitalism?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I just think Bernie is such a farce, you guys. At a time when Hong Kong is being squashed, and he comes on in the interview and he says you to make a very strong statement for democracy and for human rights and of course, this administration isn't.</p><p>And then of course, though, we've heard nothing about the Uighur concentration camps. I wonder under Bernie's administration, would he recognize Taiwan as a country? Would he -- there is so much that he has failed to address that China represents.</p><p>He ignored or kind of shot down the existential threat question as well. I mean, why aren't we hearing from him his position on China's stated purpose of nuclear and trade power on their random presence on the Arctic Circle Council?</p><p>You know, every five years the president of China gives a political report, right. And in 2017, President Jinping did. And 30 times he said China will be a global power. He stressed that he -- they wanted to improve their combat capability or whatever.</p><p>And he also said we will never swallow the bitter fruit of downgrading our interests for a purpose of someone else's benefit. So for Bernie to go out there publicly and say they are not a threat to us or that they won't put themselves first and ignore all of the other human rights violation is again, it's such a joke to me.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I think we pounded that segment into the ground.</p><p>PERINO: Well done.</p><p>GUTFELD: Thank you. Thank you. All right, another Russia bombshell blows up in the media's face. MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell now backtracking after his latest claims about President Trump.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Who picks the music? I don't know who picks the music. I did not pick that --</p><p>PERINO: You did. I know you picked it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's a nice song, but I did not. I would have gone with the cards, but next time. Another Russia bombshell exploding in the media's face. Here's what MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell said about President Trump's finances on his show last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: This is a single source --</p><p>RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: OK.</p><p>O'DONNELL: -- who has told me that the Deutsch Bank obtained tax returns which they do have of Donald Trump -- show that the president pays very little income tax. This single source close to the Deutsch Bank told me that the Trump -- Donald Trump's loan documents there show that he has co- signers. That's how he was able to obtain those loans. And that the co- signers are Russian oligarchs.</p><p>MADDOW: Really?</p><p>O'DONNELL: That would explain it seems to me every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin if true. I stress the \"if true.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Wow. Rachael Maddow's face I think said it all. But after being ridiculed about his flimsy reporting including by his own co-workers at MSNBC, O'Donnell tweeting \"Last night I made an error in judgment by reporting an item about the president's finances that didn't go through our rigorous verification and standards process. I shouldn't have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air. I will address the issue on my show tonight.\"</p><p>So, Dana, where does this go?</p><p>PERINO: Well, first of all, I don't think people need to watch his show tonight, OK, because one, he has already shown tha he doesn't care about giving accurate information. I always say this on twitter too, if you have to write big if true on something you are re-tweeting, like don't tweet it. Just wait and see if it is actually true.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's boring.</p><p>PERINO: It is boring! And that is why you watch THE FIVE where we have accurate information. No, I understand that mistakes could happen. You could go to air with something that isn't quite -- but he walks all the way up to the line and he has Rachael Maddow just waiting like, what, really.</p><p>It reminded me when she said she had the president's tax returns and you sat there for 20 minutes like waiting for her to get to the point and then you realize --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, we did that for like two years, we did that, yes.</p><p>PERINO: Right. And now -- and also because the Russian story is one that fizzled in April and they are trying to figure a way -- figure out a way to bring it back, but if you're going to do that, you better be ready because now what happens?</p><p>Now, President Trump can turn out and say, here they go again. I told you. And he's proving -- they are proving his point over and over again.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Is it really a mistake? I mean, when you say further and you meant to say farther? Is this like a --</p><p>GUTFELD: It's hard for me to judge because I have never made a mistake on this show. I think I'm batting 1,000 and --</p><p>PERINO: Is that good?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, you know, it's really good and it's football.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Am I the umpire?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Yes. But you would think that MSNBC would be a little leery of any Russian bombshell story. They just bet everything -- they put everything on red for three years and they lost the house. So, maybe -- maybe -- here's the theory. Maybe he got pranked by, you know, he said a single source. That could have been Trump on the phone with his hand over the mic and goes, yes, it was Russian oligarchs -- Russian oligarchs, trust me on this, Larry. Trust me!</p><p>It could be that. But I mean, you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of that thing on twitter that used to drive me crazy, the tick, tick, tick.</p><p>PERINO: I hate that.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like, everybody promising a bombshell. Oh, it's coming up today. Better watch the news, it's all going to come apart. And it's just, people -- viewers must get exhausted being promised bombshell after bombshell. We don't promise bombshells here. We just promise good, healthy, clean fun.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: What is your take, Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I'm listening and I'm thinking to myself, it's so interesting. It seems to me we've gone away from gate keepers in journalism, you know, because social media is like who has it first and who can just make an outrageous statement that gets lots of clicks.</p><p>PERINO: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And this was an outrageous statement, I mean, by his own admission, he really didn't have the story. There is no journalist in America would say a single source and that you have not gone to your editors and nobody has vetted this story to say well, you know, what do we have from other people?</p><p>Nothing like that. He just makes the statement. So, he got it wrong. Now, it's interesting, him saying that he made an error in reporting this. He is not saying that the story is wrong. He is saying he was wrong. And I -- so again, to me it comes back to social media where people have what I call confirmation bias.</p><p>In other words, they take stories that they want to be true and then they say, oh, you know what, I'm going to believe this story and I'm not going to check it out because that might get in the way of my good feelings so I'm just going to report it. And to me, that ends up with egg on your face.</p><p>It's just bad journalism. It's not the way he's doing it, but I say in this era with the internet dominating everything, this is the way we're going and people don't seem to understand, this is a mistake. It's not good.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, and that's the point that Trump's attorney made, right, which is basically that when you go off a single source, it's reckless and it's verifiable. Those records were publicly online. Trump is the only guarantor.</p><p>So he basically said, look, because it was so reckless and because you ignored any type of verification that was out there in subsequent sources, and this rises to that level of actual malice. And this has other repercussions too, right.</p><p>Look, we know the House Service Financial Committee is investigating Trump, is investigating Deutsch Bank. They are laying off 18,000 workers in the next couple of years. They are being federally investigated for other reasons too.</p><p>So when we start bringing in other entities from these reckless comments and assertions, it's a ripple effect. And so yes, journalists have to be much more aware and in ownership of what they put out there. It's not just, oh, my bad. I retract. There are real consequences here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And even if he were to say to us, Emily, you know, he's not a journalist, because I think sometimes opinion people say I'm not a journalist. I just -- it's my opinion. But he didn't present it as his opinion.</p><p>COMPAGNO: No. Right.</p><p>PERINO: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: As a journalist I am disgusted about what happened.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, listen, how many times have you read a story and there is nobody who sided in the story --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All anonymous sources, a single -- and it's like you make a mistake --</p><p>GUTFELD: The worst thing though, the worst thing is that stories that every -- both sides are doing this by the way. So and so as outrage -- sparks outrage and what they use is tweets, like they find three tweets and that's the story.</p><p>PERINO: And that's all the outrage.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's all the outrage. And it's like -- and then that generates another story and then that generates another story and it's a spiral and it's like -- and you get down to it and there is nothing there and what a waste of time and anger and --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I must say it's so interesting to me, though, that Donald Trump has his lawyers threaten Lawrence O'Donnell with defamation over this. I mean, how often have you seen a story from Donald Trump and you think, what's the source on that? Where is the evidence of that? And he just --</p><p>GUTFELD: He's never lied, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Never?</p><p>GUTFELD: Never.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Not once. Not once?</p><p>GUTFELD: He is directionally true.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, because you have a 1,000 batting average.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: However, what's his batting average?</p><p>GUTFELD: 1,020.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, really?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. It's like, you know, when you get A++.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, like when those kids in high school, you know, the kids in high school, they get extra points for --</p><p>GUTFELD: I'd get a 5.0.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You get a 5.0 now.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's it. There you go.</p><p>GUTFELD: It makes no sense. I'm sure Emily got a 5.0.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right, door bell camera company Ring -- you're familiar with them -- raising serious privacy concerns and fears of big brother, thanks to a new partnership. Details when THE FIVE returns.</p><p>WILLIAMS: New big tech privacy concerns, and these are big. Amazon's ring service reportedly teaming up with more than 400 police departments across the nation. The company calling it America's new neighborhood watch.</p><p>The partnerships let police automatically access video from homeowner's door bell cameras. Now, while some people credit the deal with helping to solve or even prevent crimes, others worry it's going to violate your privacy rights. Emily, let me go to you as the lawyer here and ask you, is it good or bad to give police access to your door bell camera?</p><p>COMPAGNO: To answer like an attorney, it depends. And I think, you know, what all of the questions that this raises are -- OK, so first of all, user consent is required, right? So the government, the police can request records and then the person can decline or accept.</p><p>And that raises one question, which is well, do we want there to be a warrant because warrants requires specificity obviously of what you are asking for, or what you're seizing. And there is no such thing here, right? So does that matter?</p><p>I think there is a fine line many feel between private surveillance and government surveillance. And does it matter here that the Ring, the company is the intermediary between the police and the users? Does that change everything? To me, I feel like this is -- an analogy is all of the DNA databases where essentially does someone else's consent apply to you if it's the same data.</p><p>And also, that technology has outgrown the legal field so we're kind of trying to put it into that structure and it's based on our gut feelings and the law hasn't quite caught up.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Jason, let me come to you as a conservative and say that the founding fathers were very worried about giving the government too much power in this area -- that means too much information, constant surveillance. This literally is a threat to our 4th Amendment rights.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Oh, I think so. I had hearings on this when I was the chairman of the oversight committee. I think Americans have a reasonable expectation to privacy and you fear a suspicion-less American, you should not have to think if you are going to be embedded into these databases and that there will be surveillance on every corner, whether it's public or private.</p><p>The Supreme Court in the Jones case ruled nine to nothing that you cannot go and just place a public surveillance in -- this little thing that you put on the bottom of your car and go on to private property. So, I think it crosses that line.</p><p>And what we should all be worried about is the FBI has been building a database. More than half of our country is already in it, of facial recognition.</p><p>So, you know, if you think you should be able to walk down the street and then if you're in Boston and suddenly the police or the feds can be able to pull up and say, oh, you were at that Planned Parenthood rally or you were at that conservative rally for Donald Trump, that's what is happening folks.</p><p>And you got to understand that when you get these pictures, they are building that database, the feds. And I don't trust the federal government. I don't trust -- I want it to be vigorous law enforcement, but as a suspicion-less American, I should have a right to privacy.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dana?</p><p>PERINO: It's interesting to hear that because I feel -- it depends. I think in a way that it's good for police departments because they are stretched thin and they don't have enough resources and so they are asking communities for help. We've had neighborhood watch programs in the past. I don't know how effective that is if you don't actually have a camera.</p><p>The other thing is, compare this to what a company like Apple had done to law enforcement for a long time. Not allowing the government and the FBI to be able to access encrypted technology in order to see what was going on in order to prevent terrorist attacks. That happened after the -- was it Riverside, I think, that shooting out there.</p><p>And I also like technology for convenience reasons. I do -- I kind of like the idea of being able going to the airport and a facial recognition, walk through, no problem. No taking out the shoes and all that stuff. But to hear you describe it the way you did, Jason, it gives me a little pause.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Greg, you live in London for a while, right?</p><p>GUTFELD: That is true, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, in London, much as in -- by the way, much as in you live in midtown Manhattan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: The minute I step on the street I know I am under surveillance in this part of the world.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'll come into this building, I'm under surveillance. And in London, they have no --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- they have no reservations about this because they have no 4th Amendment.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. It's -- I'm actually OK with this. The great thing about progress is as one type of crime disappears another one appears. For example, we don't have great train robberies anymore. Have you heard of a train robbery recently? I haven't.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Do you remember in the '70s, everybody --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's because they put dogs.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you -- thank you! That's my point -- not really -- but you put dogs there, no more train -- and also, the 1970s were nothing but 8 track tapes being taken out of capris. I know that because I had a capri.</p><p>So, we lost -- now, what do we have? We have porch pirates, right. So we have people who -- it's a very easy theft. Just follow UPS truck around the neighborhood because they leave stuff on porches.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You should be more concerned that the federal government and those who would have nefarious intent would follow you 24/7 -- know what bar you go to, know what --</p><p>GUTFELD: But I'm talking about -- I'm talking about the fact that I like the fact that like I can catch somebody who is on my porch stealing stuff. I think that's in my immediate life. I'm not into this --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, but that's you. That's you doing that.</p><p>CHAFETZ: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What we're talking about is the police now having access and the police aren't interested in your porch pirate. They are looking for --</p><p>GUTFELD: I thought that Emily said -- I thought Emily said that you have to OK it?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Noyou know.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. So, to be clear, the police have partnerships with Ring by -- now, over 400 departments. For them to obtain the content, they have to have user consent. The police before requesting it do not know who that user is.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But here's the problem, but Amazon is going to know when you come, when you leave, who you go with, who you don't come with, what your face looks like, what hat you wear, what jeans you're wearing, what kind of shirt do you like, does he like shirt sleeves, does he like long sleeve. That's going to--</p><p>GUTFELD: That's already happening. Do you ever - you're telling me you sit online, and you don't get these ads directed at you?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Doesn't that scare the living daylights out of you.</p><p>PERINO: No, it's really convenient. I actually really wanted that new backpack. I have been thinking about it all day.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's creepy.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, the only reason it's creepy is when they're selling you health things. It's like how do they know I have that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. What did you say?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I said eew.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Eew. Well, I don't know. To me it's kind of yucky the idea that you know you have no privacy anymore.</p><p>GUTFELD: Get used to it. Privacy is dead.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. Up next, Emily takes us back on the ground to Los Angeles skid row for a brand new look, very incisive look at the homeless crisis in California. That's next right here on THE FIVE.</p><p>COMPAGNO: We recently showed you the appalling conditions on the streets of Skid Row in LA. The homeless crisis drug problem and rat infestation are spiraling out of control. The situation is so bad, the city's mayor pledging this week to deploy more outreach teams and services to help turn things around. But many are wondering if his ideas are just more of the same.</p><p>Here's part two of my tour with Dr. Drew Pinsky focusing on how the failures of local officials have made the situation in LA even worse. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REVEREND ANDY BALES, UNION RESCUE MISSION CEO: Why do we throw away these people. Nobody throws away people like Los Angeles.</p><p>DREW PINKSY, DOCTOR: How many must die before you willing to change direction. What you're doing is killing people, blood on your hands. City officials have blood on their hands. UCLU has blood on their hands. And they should be held accountable for them, unfortunately we cannot. They're killing people.</p><p>DEON JOSEPH, LAW ENFORCEMENT CONSULTANT: Since 2014 and even beyond that they've taken a softer approach to fighting crime. They consider drug dealing. A non-serious crime. The message sent to the gangsters now is there is nothing we can do. So, now they've taken complete control. They didn't know it was going to change certain serious crimes into non-serious crimes. They didn't know. 50 Cent was going to turn certain violent crimes into non-violent crimes.</p><p>PINKSY: Especially drugs.</p><p>JOSEPH: Especially drugs.</p><p>PINKSY: So now you can use and traffic pretty much at your way. My patients give them an opportunity--</p><p>JOSEPH: Yes.</p><p>PINKSY: They're coming to the states.</p><p>JOSEPH: On one side you create this kind of asylum without walls. OK, where people get in, but they can't get out even if they wanted to. And on the other side you put these people, very people you say you care about in extreme danger.</p><p>PINKSY: You have to do unpopular things. I understand, you have to let law enforcement do their job, you have to put people who don't want to be put somewhere, where they can get well and get services. It's unpopular, but it's lifesaving.</p><p>Left to their own devices, they deteriorate. It's not their fault. It's an illness. And if we don't do - if you're not actively treating it, I'm personally I believe it's a passive manslaughter.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes.</p><p>PINKSY: I believe that our representatives are engaged in reckless negligence and manslaughter.</p><p>BALES: People don't come here to live a good life. People come here and die. You can see people dying.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: It's so heartbreaking. And you know today another example, a shining example of the continued incompetence and waste of money by these officials. There was a big audit released today of the Los Angeles Housing Authority and despite doubling the staff and the efforts, they failed to reach seven of nine of their goals. Nothing is changing there. Greg, your thoughts.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well. I mean, the one thing that I always stuck with me when we had Dr. Drew on here, our lower third says homeless crisis. It isn't a homeless crisis because it's a mental health and it's a drug abuse crisis. Dr. Drew made this amazing point, he said that a million or so illegal immigrants have come to California and they have a place to live. They aren't homeless, but these people haven't. So, what is the difference.</p><p>It's the fact that they do not want to leave the streets because of the drug abuse and the mental illness because you'd have to have mental illness or a drug problem to be living on the streets. So, we need a system. We need to put a system in place where we can institutionalize people who really need help. It's not a homeless thing.</p><p>PERINO: The addiction piece. There in fact I've read - where was it, I think it was maybe Manhattan Institute but that the average homeless person here in New York would have an $1800 a month drug habit. So, let's just say - let's say they get clean. Right. $1800 a month, can you live on that in New York. Possibly, but probably not.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: Right around here. You think San Francisco, you think Los Angeles and one of the things that officials are doing are really focused on the housing rules and regulations and trying to change those which might need to happen, but I still think even if they were to do that, if that was one of the goals, you still aren't dealing with the addiction crisis and that is really the root of it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Exactly.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Hats off to you and Dr. Drew for taking this on. We need more of this. This is public policy that actually makes a difference. I've got to tell you though I would like to take that Donald Trump Make America Great Again and let's do it and make Baltimore great again. Let's make Los Angeles great again. And let's just try some different things than the Democrats have done for the last pick how many decades it is and come in with a conservative set of principles and try it.</p><p>What have they got to lose? Let's try that and let's just say, we're going to get tough on law enforcement. We are going to get people the treatment. We are going to get people the education. We are going to deal with the mental health things and do so, and try it, see what happens, because I think there would be dramatic results that would change things.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, hold on, I mean in fact I mean deinstitutionalization did take place under Republicans and I think--</p><p>GUTFELD: And Democrats--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Part of this is you see people on the street. I was taken by in Emily's piece, you hear the man say these are asylums without walls. And so, the people are there and there is no getting out.</p><p>But so to me part of this is the political agenda which is that Republicans love to beat up on Democrats, these are Democratic controlled cities, but in fact I think when you look at Mayor Garcetti in Los Angeles, he's saying here are some ideas, we're putting in clean teams, by the way, he says a lot of the trash, a lot of this infestation comes from businesses who throw trash.</p><p>PERINO: Illegally.</p><p>WILLIAMS: More so than the homeless. Secondly, he says, let's do something about rents and about evictions. Let's see if that can have an impact. So, to me you could say Garcetti's ideas not working that great. But I say, hey, I applaud you Mayor, if you're trying something. I don't hear anything from the Republicans.</p><p>PERINO: We have a little bit of breaking news. Can I share it with everybody here? OK. So apparently while we've been talking about homelessness, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has just dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primary, she apparently did this by Twitter. She is not going to - she was not going to make that debate. She had signaled I think last week. Jason, she said that she would be open to being somebody's Vice President which I think that was a signal. She was going to drop out.</p><p>GUTFELD: So right, but the way.</p><p>PERINO: No, that's good to know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Marianne.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was thinking. Because Marianne is not going to make the debates.</p><p>GUTFELD: I talked to her today about it and I think she's got a strategy, a little breaking news later Dana that we will get into it. A little strategy because she's not going to make the debate, but she's got a plan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, maybe for October.</p><p>PERINO: Listen to you podcast.</p><p>WILLIAMS: The October debate.</p><p>GUTFELD: She's going to--</p><p>PERINO: Any thoughts about her deciding to drop out?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's a realistic viewpoint, she never caught on, didn't have a message that resonated, and she can blame a lot of things, but it just did not work. And I think it's better for her and New York and everybody else that she--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Don't say that to Greg, it resonated for Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, he's talking about Gillibrand.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Gillibrand.</p><p>GUTFELD: He is not talking about Marianne Williamson, who is going to be the nominee.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Williamson is not making it.</p><p>PERINO: There were people in New York starting to say, excuse me like you know you're not going to become president. Why don't you focus on being here at home?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Trimming the fat is always good. I think others should take note definitely. And even like with the CNN climate change thing--</p><p>GUTFELD: Making a comment about her weight, Emily, how dare you.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I am not, proverbially.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's OK. He's upset. You've got to learn how to deal with it.</p><p>GUTFELD: You invented a word. Proverbially.</p><p>PERINO: Emily is the new Dana, which is - an amazing package on homelessness. And we'll continue to cover that here.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Thank you.</p><p>PERINO: And thank you for going out there and doing that, the news is Kirsten Gillibrand, the senator from New York will no longer be a part of the 2020 Democratic race. So, I think now there are 20, just 20 more to go. All right, Pete Davidson unloads on millennials where kids have to take their own trash from school and how a judge is shaming two men for lying about being veterans all in the Fastest 7. Up next.</p><p>PERINO: Welcome back. Time for the Fastest 7. First up, comedian Pete Davidson under fire after losing his cool on college students, the Saturday Night Live star launching into this profane rant after the audience broke his no cell phone rule.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETE DAVIDSON: Don't ruin the show for people who actually want to be here. That's the problem. No, don't clap. It's because like half of you did it. You know how embarrassing it is to be our age and walk out and know everybody thinks you're an idiot? Group up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Oh Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, you know at first, he was right to be angry because when somebody is filming you, it changes what you do because it makes you less willing to take a risk because you know you could get burned and canceled. But on the other hand, he came off as a whiny superior jackass crapping all over the audience when he said he didn't have to - he didn't need their money.</p><p>Like he could just refund it and he doesn't need to go in the middle of nowhere. So, he just - that - he just undercut his whole thing.</p><p>PERINO: Could he have just let the audience like deal with them.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: You know what I mean like the audience be the bad guy.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I think it's interesting that Greg thinks that when cameras are rolling, you restrain.</p><p>PERINO: Oh! Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, that's really - the best I can tell.</p><p>PERINO: Juan, you've never had this happen to you. You never had your phone on when you go to the theater?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't do that. But I must say to me it's like Louis C.K. said, if you're a comedian, you're trying to do edgy material that's forward facing and you're not sure if it might be offensive. You know you don't want people recording you. So, you say to them please don't record me, I'm going to try material here and they break it. And you said, self- policing, it was half the audience according to what he said that was doing it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I don't like that. Emily.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, I've been to a few comedy shows where we have to put our cell phones in those lockboxes.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I think it's more ludicrous to assume you're not being recorded even if you say, no, thank you.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly. All right. Up next, what looks like an extreme effort to go green, one school in Australia is getting rid of basically all the garbage cans, they're telling students to take their trash home with them instead. That does not sound very sanitary.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I don't know how that's going green because you think those kids are going to carry it all the way home. They're going to get about half a block away from that school and they're going to kick it in the gutter.</p><p>PERINO: Yes. They're just like stuff it in.</p><p>GUTFELD: How many times have I taken trash home. Anyway, this happened at Fox News just so you know, we moved to a floor 21st floor right. We show up at our offices and the cubicles. No trash cans, no trash cans. Where are the trash bins? Oh, you know, we don't have those--</p><p>PERINO: They're right behind you.</p><p>GUTFELD: We don't have those trash cans. Like this idea was our intrusion. So, I had to go and get a trash can and put it in my office which was then taken away and then I had to go--</p><p>PERINO: So, then there was a theft.</p><p>GUTFELD: There was a theft. So, this is like the broken windows theory in reverse.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What?</p><p>PERINO: I don't know, I mean there are trash cans, you can put your stuff in, they're just like not right by your desk.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're the worst ever.</p><p>PERINO: Anybody care about this over here?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, you know what was interesting to me is that this is the rule in Australian national parks. If you go camping in a park--</p><p>PERINO: Taking all their stuff out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Everything you take, and you take out--</p><p>PERINO: But that's not unusual at a national park.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. But guess what, so we're here criticizing it. I was thinking you know it's a little much, but it turns out, Australian parents very supportive, they say you know what use packaging like wax paper. Give it to the kids. The kids will bring it home.</p><p>GUTFELD: Or just hire a kangaroo.</p><p>PERINO: That's too, you could do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, stick it in his pocket.</p><p>PERINO: All right. And finally, a Montana judge coming down hard on two men with a list of punishments for lying about serving in the military. Among them, they have to wear a sign every Memorial and Veterans Day for eight hours saying I am a liar, I am not a veteran. And they've been ordered to hand write the names of every American killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I loved this.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: And more. They have to do 441 hours of community service for every Montana that has died in combat since the Korean War. They have to write letters of apologies to veteran's organizations saying exactly what they did. I'm normally not for public shaming, but here I absolutely love it and both of them had long rap sheets too, these are - this was no accident, these guys are ridiculous, and I loved it.</p><p>PERINO: You don't always get punished for lying for these kinds of things.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: No, but they should. I love it. I love judges who take it in their hands and say, yes.</p><p>PERINO: Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, there is a law, the Carl Stolen Valor law. But now it doesn't apply in this case because it wasn't - these guys were claiming that they won an award. It's they're simply claiming that they served. And the reason they were doing this is you get a special court for people who had military service. So, they lie to try to lessen their penalty.</p><p>PERINO: Got punished.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I mean as a SEAL, I found this offensive in Nam. I spent a lot of time in Nam and--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Was that at the zoo, as a seal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. I was dressed up as a seal at the Nam zoo.</p><p>PERINO: And he had a kangaroo in his pocket.</p><p>GUTFELD: This is good. Shame can be a big motivator.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: All right, One More Thing up next.</p><p>GUTFELD: I should know.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right, time for One More Thing. I started off. It finally happened. My dream came true. My interview one-on-one with Marianne Williamson is now out on foxnewspodcast.com. We broke a little news on that about what she plans to do since she's not on the debate next week. Can we roll that please?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Somebody said to me today, we should have a hashtag #BoringWithoutHer.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>WILLIAMSON: So, it's going to be interesting to watch it without me, without being there.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMSON: I am considering doing something where I will do kind of like when they have the State of the Union and they have the rebuttal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMSON: I'm thinking of doing something where I would do something right afterwards along the lines of here's what I would have said.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: I hope she does it, because I'm not watching the debates without her.</p><p>PERINO: That's clever.</p><p>GUTFELD: Very, very clever. All right, Dana. You know what I think it's your turn.</p><p>PERINO: Did you use the Fox News Alert, when you broke news on your pocket.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, I don't break a lot of news.</p><p>PERINO: All right. Break other things.</p><p>GUTFELD: I break other things.</p><p>PERINO: All right, I've got one in a hilarious display of sibling love. You like it when like an older brother makes fun of the younger brother. This is 17-year-old Noah Tingle from Louisiana and he's got a way to really give his brother the business every day when he comes home from school. He dresses up as in some sort of outfit to try to give him a hug and he really loves his little brother; he's going off to college next year. And he thought that this would be a way to you know bond, neighbors and the community members love it. Very sweet.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I'll dress up as Dana. All right. Let's go paddle boarding folks, oops. Second thoughts. I don't think you're going to agree to do this. How about 76 days, five hours, 22 minutes to cross from San Francisco to Honolulu. Look at this guy. That's what he did. Antonio De La Rosa paddled away on a stand up paddle board. His voyage began June 4th. He completed 2900 miles this week, he even celebrated his 50th birthday on the water.</p><p>De La Rosa said it was quite lonely except for when he saw whales and other sea life. He's the first person to cross the Pacific on a paddle board quite the achievement it could be like Roger Bannister breaking the four minute mile. Lots of people decide, hey, I can do it too, go for it.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow.</p><p>PERINO: Good for him.</p><p>GUTFELD: I get bored. Jason.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Another inspiring story out of Utah, a retired Marine Sergeant John Nelson was caught on video carrying his friend and fellow Marine Staff Sergeant Jonathan Blank to the summit of Utah's Mount Timpanogos.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Blank lost his legs in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2010, but it hasn't kept him down. Look at that.

On Monday, he tweeted that Amazon needs to improve working conditions for its warehouse employees following a report from the Daily Beast detailing 911 calls. Sanders previously demanded that Amazon raise its minimum wage, which it did in November last year. </p><p>He's not the only Democratic 2020 candidate to take aim at the tech giant. Bernie Sanders has stepped back into the ring with Amazon. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has been a vocal critic of the company and its CEO Jeff Bezos in the past. Previously he called for a $15 minimum wage, which Amazon introduced in November last year[1]. Sanders praised the decision at the time, saying: \"Mr Bezos and Amazon are now leading the way.\" Read more: Amazon warehouse employees speak out about the 'brutal' reality of working during the holidays, when 60-hour weeks are mandatory and ambulance calls are common[2] On Monday, however, Sanders turned up the heat on the company once more following a report from the Daily Beast[3] detailing 911 calls from Amazon warehouses and workers experiencing serious mental health crises[4]. Sanders tweeted that Amazon \"must recognize that workers' rights don't stop at the minimum wage.\" He added that the company must \"significantly improve working conditions\" and allow staff to unionize.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1105195436661342208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Amazon must recognize that workers' rights don't stop at the minimum wage. Amazon must significantly improve working conditions at its warehouses and respect the constitutional right of its employees to form a union and bargain collectively for a better life. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/Mds9hfbwU3\">https://t.co/Mds9hfbwU3</url>[5]It follows a Business Insider investigation into warehouse working conditions last month[6], which uncovered the \"brutal\" reality of long hours, physical labor, fears about taking time off, workplace injuries, and the pressure to keep the wheels turning, even when the weather is treacherous. Sanders isn't the only Democratic candidate to be upping the pressure on Amazon. Elizabeth Warren last week said that if made president, a keystone policy would be breaking up tech giants Amazon, Facebook, and Google's parent company Alphabet[7].NOW WATCH: Nintendo Switch is the

When you're Bernie Sanders and your only tool is socialism, every problem looks like a capitalist to be bashed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The septuagenarian senator from Vermont is an unabashed lifelong socialist, whose solutions to most problems involve more government, less freedom, and higher taxes. Last week, in a 1,700-word essay published in the Columbia Journalism Review, he proposed a \"plan for journalism\" involving \u2014 can you guess? \u2014 more government, less freedom, and higher taxes. The capitalist-bashing begins in the second sentence: \"Today's assault on journalism by Wall Street, billionaire businessmen, Silicon Valley, and Donald Trump presents a crisis \u2014 and [is] why we must take concrete action.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Sanders, like Trump, is quick to impugn journalists' motives. And much of the \"action\" he proposes would interfere with media companies that try to save themselves.</p><p>If elected, Sanders says, he would use the power of the federal government to crack down on media mergers that would lead to layoffs, consolidate news outlets under fewer owners, or \"adversely affect\" women and minorities. He would \"reinstate and strengthen\" the old cross-ownership rule that blocked TV and radio stations from owning newspapers in the same market. And he would require the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to \"more stringently\" pursue antitrust litigation against Facebook and Google, whose success has come in part at the expense of traditional media outlets.</p><p>Sanders also raises the prospect of taxing online ads and using the revenue to fund \"nonprofit civic-minded media\" and to \"substantially increase\" government subsidies for public journalism. That won't do anything for struggling private newspapers and magazines, but it will certainly boost the power of PBS and NPR and their decidedly left-wing worldview.</p><p>Nothing in Sanders' plan is fresh or novel. How and whether to rein in Big Tech, to expand racial and gender diversity in the media, to tax advertising and Internet services, to underwrite nonprofit media \u2014 all of these have been perennial topics of debate when the agenda turns to the ailments of the news business. In his essay, the senator vowed to impose an \"immediate moratorium\" on corporate media mergers like the proposed combination of Viacom and CBS. But media consolidation has been a left-wing bugbear forever. \"Remember back in 2000 when the merger of AOL and Time Warner spelled the absolute doom of an independent press?\" asks Reason magazine's Nick Gillespie. \"Better yet, can you even remember AOL or Time magazine, once massive presences in media that are now desiccated ruins of their former selves?\"</p><p>Sanders acknowledges the ravaging of the news industry in recent decades. \"Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 communities across the country have lost newspapers, which are the outlets local television, radio, and digital news sites rely on for reporting,\" he writes. \"Since 2008, we have seen newsrooms lose 28,000 employees \u2014 and in the past year alone, 3,200 people in the media industry have been laid off.\" But Sanders seems far less interested in the plight of journalists than in exploiting their excruciations to score ideological points.</p><p>Like so much of what America's best-known socialist says and writes, his media plan drips with hostility for capitalists and capitalism. He repeatedly decries the lack of \"real journalism\" in America, and blames it on his standard villains: the \"forces of greed that are pillaging our economy,\" the \"corporate conglomerates and hedge fund vultures,\" the \"oligarchic business models,\" the \"billionaires who .\u00a0.\u00a0. use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny.\" Sanders is particularly hostile to Jeff Bezos, the billionaire who owns The Washington Post. He suggested recently that his criticism of Bezos is the reason the Post \"doesn't write particularly good articles about me.\" At times, his attacks on the integrity of publishers and the motives of reporters have been almost indistinguishable from President Trump's.</p><p>Lord knows the news business is in dire straits these days, but socialist nostrums aren't going to stop the cataclysmic changes unleashed by the digital revolution. As someone who has worked in newsrooms for more than three decades, I mourn the lost era when nearly every home subscribed to a newspaper. I wince at every newspaper shutdown or round of layoffs. But the media aren't in extremis because they weren't regulated enough. If anything, some daily papers might yet be alive if, for example, the cross-ownership rule hadn't deprived them of a potential lifeline.</p><p>Trashing the entrepreneurs and investors who are keeping some of the nation's legacy news organizations alive may suit Sanders' anti-capitalist shtick, but it will do nothing to save the business of journalism. \"We cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate,\" says Sanders. That's the way he always talks \u2014 the tiresome rhetoric of a one-tool politician with the same scapegoat for everything.</p><p>Jeff Jacoby can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jacoby@globe.com\">jacoby@globe.com</email> Follow him on Twitter @jeff_jacoby.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-dc9ddcc0-ca82-11e9-983e-6c0542953cd7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WY8-KN11-JC2G-C01B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 1, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001VM7</classCode><className>VIACOM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

(Best Buy) announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire GreatCall Inc. ('GreatCall') for $800 million as part of its growing business selling health and wellness products specifically focused on the aging population. </p><p>(Investor Relations, Best Buy[1]). GreatCall is the maker of the senior focused Jitterbug cell phones along with other devices designed to allow elderly consumers to connect with caregivers and to facilitate communication with emergency services. (Barba, Wall Street Journal[2]). The acquisition is projected to be neutral to Best Buy's adjusted earnings in 2019 and 2020 as well as to increase its adjusted earnings by 2021. (Investor Relations, Best Buy[3]). The acquisition is part of Best Buy's 2020 strategy to use technology to address key human needs among the aging U.S. population. (Barba, Wall Street Journal[4]). GreatCall headquarters will remain in San Diego and David Inns will remain as the company's CEO. (Press Release, Market Watch[5]). Chairman and CEO of Best Buy, Hubert Joly, discussed the importance of using technology to improve the quality of life of the aging population and those who care for them. Joly stated that Best Buy is excited about pursuing new opportunities in the health space by using its experience with technology and serving customers in their home. (Investor Relations, Best Buy[6]). With more than 900,000 paying subscribers participating in GreatCall's services, Innes, CEO of GreatCall hopes to add to the company's current annual revenue of over $300 million with Best Buy's customer focus and larger scale. Id. The acquisition of GreatCall is a continuation of Best Buy's long-term strategy to make new acquisitions, fund the new operations and make investments in their growth in order to return excess cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Id. The transaction is expected to close at the end of the fiscal 2019 third quarter but is still subject to regulatory approvals and additional closing conditions. For instance, after a company reports a proposed deal and makes a filing under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Department of Justice (DOJ) can choose to review on a case-by-case basis. (Merger Review, Federal Trade Commission[7]). Either agency can 1) terminate the obligatory waiting period and allow the parties to complete the transaction, 2) let the waiting period expire, allowing the parties to then complete the transaction or 3) extend the review and ask the parties to submit additional information if it appears there are competition issues. Id. In most cases, the parties are allowed to complete the transaction after the first review. Id. The appointment of Chairman Joseph Simons to the FTC on May 1, 2018 could have an impact on Best Buy's future acquisition plans, especially in the world of health technology, as the FTC is putting Big Tech[8] under scrutiny due to the concern that big tech companies are limiting competition in the markets. Acquisitions such as Best Buy's purchase of GreatCall have led to what FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter refers to as 'Pac-Man acquisitions' where big companies swallow up little ones. (Alexis, Bloomberg Law[9]). While the acquisition of GreatCall does not rise to value of larger acquisitions such as that of Amazon's $1 billion acquisition of Pillpack, Inc., Best Buy may be exposed to increased challenges from the FTC if it continues to pursue the acquisition technology companies in the health space.

The world is becoming more and more mobile without compromising accessibility. Luckily, technology has quickly advanced to accommodate our newfound lifestyles.</p><p><br/> Cloud storage providers enable individuals and businesses to easily transfer files to secure networks in order to free up device space while allowing for seamless collaboration between multiple parties.<br/> This article is part of a series in which The Simple Dollar is doing some deep dive research into money saving tools that can help your business thrive.<br/> In this article, I'll discuss the what, why, and how of cloud storage for businesses. The 'when' is clear: If you're not utilizing the cloud, the time is now. We'll also explore the best of the best cloud storage providers for business in specific arenas, as well as The Simple Dollar's Top Picks based on overall performance.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Overall Top Picks<br/>The overall ranking to determine the top three best cloud storage providers for business was based on the above categories, as well as a scoring system that considered their ranking as either the #1 or #2 pick within each category (SugarSync and Carbonite tied for first, so they were listed alphabetically):<br/> Carbonite[1] SugarSync[2] Adrive[3] Box<br/> Make sure you visit the above sections that describe the key components of cloud storage for business. Cloud storage, like many business solutions, is not a one-size-fits-all product.<br/>What Is the Cloud?<br/>Many, if not all of you, are cloud computing on a regular basis. If you've ever uploaded a photo to a social network, are using a smartphone with data backed up, or accessed Google Drive or Dropbox, you've been an active participant.<br/> Think of the cloud as a virtual flash drive. You contract a designated amount of space (for some paid services, that means unlimited space), upload files that are storing your data, and they're seamlessly transferred to the cloud. <br/> The cloud itself is not in the sky, but rather in physical locations throughout the world stored on multiple, secure servers. Clouds are typically managed and owned by hosting companies referred to here as providers. Some providers use a trusted third-party hosting company like Google. We'll discuss the benefits of server-owned solutions later in this post.<br/>Cloud Storage for Business<br/>If you have a business and aren't using cloud storage, it's time to start! Cloud storage can make your workforce more efficient and productive, while backing up and securing your valuable data. Making sure you choose the right storage provider for you and your company is key to your success. <br/> With the shift to virtual and accessible storage, businesses now have the ability to pay for the amount of storage they need at a competitive rate without overinvesting in device memory, or worse, having to arm their employees with easily misplaced flash drives. <br/> The sharing and editing capabilities within the cloud allow for collaboration without the administrative burden and likelihood of outdated file updating that comes with emailing. More importantly, this collaboration can be done in real time, which greatly expedites the process. If time isn't a resource you could benefit from having more of, then please share your secrets with the rest of us!<br/> The truth is, storing large amounts of data outside of the cloud is no longer cost effective, efficient, nor safe for your business. Let's explore the main features the best online storage providers are offering today so you can get a better idea of which solution is the right fit for you and your soon-to-be growing business.<br/>Compatibility<br/>As businesses move toward a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) market to cut overhead costs and allow their employees freedom to choose the device that works best for them, you'll be surprised by the variety that ends up on the table. If you're going to have flexibility in the devices your employees will utilize, it's important to mirror that flexibility in your cloud storage. <br/> So, as you consider a new cloud storage provider, ask yourself: Are you primarily a Windows or Mac user? Does your sales force use iPhones, Androids, BlackBerry phones, or a mix? <br/> The big tech players have all created platforms of their own cloud storage: Windows with their new OneDrive and Mac's iCloud. However, that doesn't mean you should discredit or even hesitate to lean toward others like SugarSync and Bitcasa. <br/> Oftentimes, it's best to go with the provider whose main focus is the solution you're seeking. You'll have a lot more concentrated resources and development around the topic at hand.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Cloud Storage Picks for Compatibility:<br/>SugarSync[4]: compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone Bitcasa: compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone<br/> These providers are among the few that have committed to an expansive portfolio of compatible platforms. Unless if you already do, or plan, to have company provided devices for both laptops or cellphones make sure to go with a diverse compatibility provider.<br/>Storage Amounts<br/>You no longer have to be married to a finite amount of storage. Most cloud storage plans can be increased, decreased, even cancelled if needed. However, don't lose sight of the fact that if (when!) your business grows exponentially, you may want the capability of unlimited storage, something that's not available with all providers' plans.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Cloud Storage Amounts:<br/>Adrive[5] Carbonite[6]<br/> Both Adrive and Carbonite offer competitive pricing, especially at the annual rate, and have the option for unlimited storage. If you sign up for Adrive's 200TB 3-year contract you'll be paying less than $50/month. To put in perspective, that's over 3 million hours of music, 800 days of video, and 62 million photos.<br/>File Upload Limitations<br/>As simple as transferring data to the cloud can be, it does come with some restrictions depending on the provider and the level of service you've chosen.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Cloud Storage File Uploads:<br/>Carbonite[7] OpenDrive<br/> Both of these providers come without file upload size restrictions, and were specifically chosen as the best because they also offer unlimited storage. Make sure you check the maximum storage with your provider before you get excited about the size of file you can upload.<br/> If you move forward with Carbonite, keep in mind that while they will allow you to upload a file of any size, those that are more than 4GB need to be uploaded manually.<br/>Sharing Capabilities<br/>Sharing is a key component in the success of your business. Unless you're a business of one, plan to never expand, and don't want to have easy, seamless communication with colleagues, the ability to share files should always be included in your cloud storage decision-making process.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Cloud Storage Sharing:<br/>SugarSync[8] Box<br/> With SugarSync, you can share individual files or entire folders with any other team member or across entire teams with just a few clicks. You also have the ability to limit permissions on specific files or folders, controlling access so it's either 'read-only' or 'can edit.' On top of that, you can create a public link and share it with anyone without the need for them to register for the service. This feature alone can save you an infinite amount of email space since you no longer have to attach all those pesky files.<br/> Box also allows you to share links accompanied by passwords, expiration dates, and restricted download access. You can create folders for group projects and quickly assign access limitations to each collaborator with co-ownership, editing, or view-only rights.<br/>Collaboration<br/>Just like sharing, collaboration is necessary for your business to thrive. You no longer have to wonder if you have your hands on the latest version of a document since, with cloud storage, multiple people can access a file simultaneously and everyone will always get the latest version. If you've ever accidentally worked on an older document, you probably felt that it compromised your time and valuable resources!<br/> As workforces become more and more mobile, the ability to collaborate within a virtual space is critical.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Cloud Storage for Collaboration:<br/>ZipCloud[9] JustCloud[10]<br/> Both ZipCloud and JustCloud Business Plans allow for unlimited users, unlimited devices, easy file-sharing, and synced, real-time file updates. With ZipCloud, you can also allocate the amount of storage space available to each user, keeping your entire program flexible. With JustCloud, you can create admin control panels and file-sharing access permissions.<br/>Accessibility<br/>One of the biggest benefits of cloud storage is the infinite accessibility when you and your employees are online. You can retrieve, share, and edit files from anywhere in the world. <br/> But will you always have Internet access? Many cloud storage providers offer syncing capabilities that grant you access to specific files or folders from your cloud even when you're offline. This is especially helpful if your workforce is not always in a dedicated office, as Wi-Fi-only tablets, spotty mobile reception, and means of transportation are not guaranteed to connect you to the World Wide Web.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Cloud Storage Accessibility:<br/>SugarSync[11] Box<br/> Both of these providers allow you to sync entire folders to be available offline rather than individual files. When you reconnect with the cloud, any files that were edited will be automatically updated. If you're adding files to one of the synced folders in Box, you will need to click 'Update All' to ensure you have offline access to the new ones as well. <br/>Security<br/>Security is a hot topic for cloud-based storage. You need to trust your provider, so make sure to conduct some research and understand the functions of specific features, like syncing and archiving, before handing your files over. <br/> For example, Dropbox's sync feature allows for multiple parties to sync to the same folder, if one of the parties removes that file from the folder it will be removed on everyone's computer. This is an intentional feature to keep everyone's files/folders as up-to-date as possible; however, can cause quite a scare if the delete was done on accident. Have no fear though, Dropbox, as well as many other providers, keep backups of all files for 30 days.<br/> As a measure of security, the most common providers like Google Drive and previously mentioned Dropbox use two-step authentication, which is great. What's even better are the additional security features offered by our top-pick providers.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Cloud Storage Security:<br/>Carbonite[12] Box<br/> These features include, but are not limited to, the following:<br/> Servers are owned and maintained by the provider rather than a third party, limiting the potential for hacking or surveillance. The ability to delete files from your computer remotely in the event it is lost or stolen. All files are encrypted directly by the provider rather than a third party. The user has the ability to limit specific folder permissions when sharing. All files are geo-redundantly stored, meaning they are housed in multiple physical locations in the event that there is damage at one of the storage centers.<br/> HIPAA Compliance Security<br/>Depending on the level of complexity and regulations in your industry, you may need to go with a more tightly compliant provider. If your company requires compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), make sure you research your options before moving forward with any provider.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Cloud Storage With HIPAA Compliance:<br/>Carbonite[13] Egnyte<br/> Both platforms are entirely built to be compliant with HIPAA regulations and both have up-to-date HIPAA Business Associate Agreements.<br/>Free Cloud Storage<br/>Few things in life are more appealing than the term 'free.' Don't forget that free services come with limitations and, when it comes to your business, you want anything but to be limited. However, if you're a startup and are looking for ways to cut those initial overhead fees, a free service and the ability to increase storage is likely your best bet.<br/>The Simple Dollar's Top Picks for Free Cloud Storage:<br/>Adrive[14] GoogleDrive<br/> Adrive offers an impressive 50GB of free storage within their cloud. The only cost you'll pay is having to deal with ads. Google Drive provides 15GB of free cloud storage.<br/> One thing I do not recommend is using multiple free services in order to expand your cloud storage. While there are emerging providers like Odrive, a consumer-based application that can link your free storage solutions like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive, you run the risk of mitigating any cost benefits with the administrative burden of organizing and accessing multiple accounts on a regular basis.<br/> Rather than linking these multiple solutions, you should upgrade your service with the same provider or find one that aligns with your business more closely in order to maintain consistency.<br/>Methodology<br/>Based on primary purpose of this article being money saving tips for your business we have focused solely on SaaS (Software as a Service) providers rather than IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) or PaaS (Platform as a Service) providers, which can come with a heftier price tag due to the amount of initial resources. <br/> SaaS providers typically eliminate the need for technical staff and reduce the cost of licensing. The providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run on the application and charge a subscription fee for its use. This allows pricing to be scalable depending on the number of users and amount of storage needed.<br/> I narrowed down the most reputable, based on a combination of longevity of service existence, BBB ratings, features and customer reviews, SaaS providers and then further filtered those that did not have a business plan out of the mix. From the remaining twenty providers I created a chart ranking them on specifics within the categories listed above (i.e. compatibility, storage amounts, file upload limitations, etc.) to determine the best of the best.<br/>Conclusion<br/>The cloud storage realm is rapidly growing and ever changing. Many providers offer competitor comparisons on their websites, but make sure you take these with a grain of salt as there are many different components to take into consideration before moving forward with this decision for your company.<br/> During my research I found the history of the development of cloud storage to be fascinating. I was pleasantly surprised how smaller companies, like SugarSync[15], have pivoted to remain competitive with powerhouses like Dropbox by targeting and improving their business sector services over individual, free services.<br/> The comparison within this article, based on the selected criteria, should give you a solid place to start your journey in selecting the best cloud storage. If you have experience with other providers that have been successful for your business please share below! We will continue to revisit these suggestions and update as new features and potential players emerge.<br/> The post Best Cloud Storage Providers for 2014[16] appeared first on The Simple Dollar[17].<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Adrive/1236/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Adrive/1236/</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Adrive/1236/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Adrive/1236/</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/</url> [7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/</url> [8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/</url> [9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/ZipCloud/1238/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/ZipCloud/1238/</url> [10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/JustCloud/1239/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/JustCloud/1239/</url> [11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/</url> [12]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/</url> [13]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Carbonite/1237/</url> [14]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Adrive/1236/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/Adrive/1236/</url> [15]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/go/SugarSynch/1235/</url> [16]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/best-cloud-storage-provider\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com/best-cloud-storage-provider</url>/ [17]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com\">http://www.thesimpledollar.com</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-SIMP10221114151448990025306696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SIMP-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DHP-YHK1-F03R-N0KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2754\"/><timeReceived>11:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Simple Dollar</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 4, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Herber De Ruijter, head of digital strategy at Intellect Global Transaction Banking (iGTB), says \"simplexity\"-making highly complex systems usable with simple interfaces-is a key trend as banks and corporations embrace digital disruption to serve retail customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As a consumer you won't even notice a lot of these innovations,\" he explains. \"However, a couple of great ones are changing the way we do business with our banks: [services providing] easy-to-understand and actionable advice on retirement; crowdfunding and lending fintechs, such as Kabbage, allowing instant access to capital; mobile payment wallets, as a first step to an almost cashless world; and Uber-where you just don't pay at all [payment happens seamlessly in the background].\"</p><p>It's not just better products or rates that make such companies popular: They make business transactions smooth and easy. \"What all these disrupters have in common is that they leverage technology, machine learning and artificial intelligence to create frictionless origination and a self-service experience,\" continues De Ruijter. \"Technology combined with very refined user experiences is the answer when it comes to simplicity, which drives adoption.\"</p><p>Banks are still in the diagnostic phase as they try to understand the way big tech companies operate so that, over time, they can mirror them. \"The biggest threats don't come from the biggest banks but from the biggest tech companies,\" continues Ruijter. \"They have the best cards. Banks either will [transform] or already are transforming themselves into tech companies. Look at Goldman Sachs, which actively contributes to open-source projects, shares its assets based on current technologies-like Web component libraries-with the world, and currently employs 10,000 engineers spread out over 44 offices in 15 countries.\"</p><p>New business models include aggregator bank initiatives, such as Starling, Simple and Atom, which develop financial products by bundling the banking services of others. \"These initiatives today compete on superior user experience and premium customer service-which people love,\" states De Ruijter.</p><p>Another option for banks is to partner to co-create, co-design or buy innovations. \"At iGTB, we do quite a lot of projects where customers outsource parts of their digital innovation to us, intending to let that innovation come back into the bank. You see a lot of interest in our lean engineering and user-centric design principles, and their success encourages banks to familiarize themselves with such approaches.\"</p><p>Although this is clearly great for those who are late in the game or have time-to-market problems, De Ruijter believes many smaller banks will survive only by bundling white-label solutions designed by others and combining these with premium products they carry themselves.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIG DATA, BIG REWARDS</emphasis></h><p>Jeremy Taylor, strategy owner for capital markets at GFT, a fintech firm, sees opportunities for both challenger banks and smaller banks. \"If you are a Tier 2 regional bank, you've got an opportunity to leapfrog some of the big boys, because top-tier banks are encumbered with balance sheets that are stodgy and they've got capital costs now with Basel III, so they are all trying to figure out complex tech and data issues-and many are divesting themselves of products, clients and countries because of the high cost of regulations and capital.\"</p><p>In July, GFT's International Survey of Experts on Digital Banking revealed that banks were unhappy with skills shortfalls when dealing with data. Reliable data offers substantial upside potential, by helping banks personalize marketing, analyzing patterns with increasing detail and sophistication. Taylor advises banks to have a roadmap to manage resources sensibly rather than in spikes, as banks are constantly going in and out of the contract market. \"The problem has been 30 years in the making,\" he says. \"It's part of a wider strategy of simplification that they need to develop. In the last two to five years there has been a wake-up call that this is actually a brake on their businesses and could cause them data compliance problems because half of the data compliance requirements are shoved down the priority list.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THIRD-PARTY OPPORTUNITIES</emphasis></h><p>Bundled products developed by banks and combined with those of third parties, distributed through digital channels and attached to their brand, is, according to De Ruijter, still a strong proposition: \"Those products will constantly be refined through analytics, testing and other similar developments mirroring those we have seen in retail.\" He adds, \"The technologies have already existed for many years; the challenge for banks now is ascertaining how to extract useful information from the tons of data they hold.\"</p><p>De Ruijter says banks at the forefront will personalize these products, tailoring them to segments they are targeting, or will develop products specifically for underserved markets, such as small and medium-size enterprises. \"The application programming interface (API) economy will drive more mass-customized offerings that align with the needs of various customer segments, particularly those that are currently underserved,\" he says. \"Out of the strategic leveraging of data will come more-advanced products-for example, ones that are in-context [interaction customers have with the bank], or consumption-based, or dynamically priced.\"</p><p>Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC Bank), for example, recently opened up its API's to third-party developers to create a \"data social network\" that facilitates free flow of certain non-customer data in a secure manner for the benefit of third parties and the community as a whole.</p><p>In Europe, the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) will allow a more level playing field for third-party payment processors. Some banks have been running scared at the thought of further disintermediation, but many see it, Taylor says, as an opportunity to work with Internet companies to develop apps and e-service bundles that give them an edge.</p><p>Some fintechs focused on payments are helping banks build bridges between social media and traditional banking payment networks. \"The crossover between banking payment networks and social media networks is a huge opportunity,\" explains Taylor. \"We all use social media, and it just makes sense to combine that with paying bills, sending money to relatives for birthday presents, etc.\" Websites offer buttons for various easy, one-click payments methods-Paypal, credit card. \"If you are a bank, you want your bank's button to be on all these online retail outlets,\" Taylor adds. \"Although PSD2 opens up banks' networks to new entrants, if they do it right, they can have their button on every single website.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CREATING NEW MARKETS</emphasis></h><p>Repackaging and creating new experiences on smartphones gives banks international opportunities to find new customers. In Africa and Asia, technology is enabling banks to acquire and serve consumers in markets formerly unassailable.</p><p>Chris de Bruin, global head of retail products and digital at Standard Chartered, says the digital agenda is a response to growing demand for convenience and choice. \"People are looking to conduct more activities digitally, where they do not have to spend time traveling to a branch and queueing for services,\" he says. \"We offer secure banking services through digital channels so our customers can do their banking anytime and anywhere they like, and this helps us reach more clients, regardless of where they are.\"</p><p>Standard Chartered has rolled out a new mobile and online banking platform in eight African countries-Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe-reaching one million retail clients, according to De Bruin. Using a smartphone, tablet or laptop, clients can check balances, transfer money and pay bills securely. \"Their mobile device is, in effect, a bank at their fingertips,\" he says.</p><p>Another example is Retail Workbench, which Standard Chartered rolled out in nine countries-Korea, Singapore, India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, the UAE, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan. \"The digital 'bank in an iPad' sales-and-service tool is seamlessly integrated with the bank's back-end infrastructure, so our staff can meet clients in a location of their choice, be it their office or favorite coffee house,\" De Bruin explains. \"Our staff can then help them open an account, or approve loans or issue credit cards, making banking services fast, simple and completely paperless.\"</p><p>Standard Chartered's network across more than 30 markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East provides the bank rich veins of feedback from various markets. \"As a result, we build once for many,\" says De Bruin, \"focusing on building capability in the most global and standardized way as possible-so it is very portable, yet allows for localization.\"</p><p>Although valuable innovations come from both developing and developed markets, the regulatory environments in India and China, De Bruin says, have enabled multiple innovative digital-banking solutions that could potentially be exported to other markets.</p><p>\"Highly digital Korea has been a test bed for innovation, such as the Retail Workbench,\" De Bruin says. \"We introduced the new technology there in 2014, and we will roll it out in 18 markets by end of 2017. Touch-login biometric technology-which we first introduced in Singapore this year-will be rolled out to nearly 5.5 million clients in 16 markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East by end of the year.\"</p><p>This ability to behave like agile technology firms has meant banks are adopting an Amazon-like mind-set to drive up-sell and cross-sell options. \"Instead of being 'places where people go to bank,' banks will evolve into 'brands that clients prefer to use for financial transactions,'\" states De Bruin.</p><p>\"Even given various privacy restrictions, banks have access to a profusion of real-time and quite actionable data, which will allow them to give their customers a 'Best Next Action' or 'Best Next Offer' (tailored to their needs and preferences). The more complex the type of financial product, the higher my expectation is that my bank is my trusted adviser, and the higher the adoption rate,\" concludes De Ruijter. \"Customers' trust in banks is still very strong.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, no caption</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">De Ruijter, iGTB:</emphasis> The biggest threats don't come from the biggest banks but from the biggest tech companies.

Leveraged ETFs sure deserve a mention here given how copiously they give returns to investors (read: Trump Slump to Oil Slide: Top ETF Stories of First-Half 2017[1]).The period took dramatic turns from the Trump rally on hopes of fiscal reflation to uncertainty over his policy uncertainty, oil price relief to oil price slump and finally the emergence of international economies.On a year-to-date basis (as of June 29, 2017), the S...00-based ETF SPY[2] has gained about 9%, the Dow Jones-based ETF DIA[3] has advanced 8.9% while the Nasdaq 100-based QQQ[4] has rallied around 16.7%. Needless to say, such stellar gains have had a significant impact on the leveraged ETFs.These ETFs provide multiple times exposure to the performance of the underlying index.

The Chinese fintech company controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma should remain one of the stocks best able to keep returns positive even in the case of a market backlash. </p><p>Other Chinese tech companies, including social media group Tencent, have proved resilient. President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order against Tencent\u2019s popular social network service WeChat has not been able to dent a 44 per cent rally this year. Limiting US company access to WeChat could cause <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c1bd210-7dee-4b5a-9219-8e139bcd5d5a\"> more disruption</url> to US companies than Tencent\u2019s earnings. </p><p>Within the tech sector, ecommerce has been an investor favourite as the pandemic drives shoppers online. In the UK, the listing of Manchester-based The Hut Group has benefited from the trend. Boss Matt Moulding expects the IPO to create more millionaires than any listing in British corporate history. He may be right. Lex expects there to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88c9bc6b-92f5-4570-bd59-96f6ba7f29c9\"> more than enough demand</url> to ensure a successful float.</p><p>Online shopping is getting a boost in Dubai too. Sales on InstaShop, a local ecommerce site, is growing rapidly. Gross merchandise value \u2014 the total paid for goods bought over the app \u2014 rose 330 per cent in the second quarter.</p><p>Shareholders are not the only ones interested in buying growth. Germany\u2019s food delivery company Delivery Hero has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be6e74fb-0f84-4947-bad3-a3a1edd92edd\"> snapped up InstaShop</url> for $360m. Its valuation at just over one times GMV compares favourably with peers. But Lex warns GMV is a slippery metric. The risks of paying up for a cut-throat business with often punitive customer acquisition costs are high.</p><p>Even in frenzied times, not all listings are sure hits. Founders of US data mining software company Palantir Technologies claim it is different from the rest of Big Tech. But its business resembles most other software companies that go public these days, complete with big losses driven by sales and marketing expenses. Annual revenues are still below $1bn, after nearly two decades in business. The hype may exceed its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c8ac7b2-5c3b-4782-8c97-424c958efd3c\"> real breadth and scale</url>.</p><p>For conservative investors who want to steer clear of volatile tech stocks, stable high dividend stocks have been the preferred choice. That once-reliable flow of payouts may <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd3a5f6b-e539-4cb2-9dab-c7f574858a82\"> not stick around for long</url>. Most European companies have cut or cancelled their dividends. They are down about 40 per cent overall.\u00a0 </p><p>As overstretched companies seize the opportunity provided by the pandemic to reset expectations, Lex suggests investors readjust their own: an \u201cattractive\u201d yield, once 5 per cent, is now more like 3 per cent. </p><p>Long term, returns from US and UK companies could be held back by measures taken to address the crisis. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3afb13c5-99d1-418f-ad51-33f3d6db81ca\"> Lex\u2019s deep dive</url> explains why the wave of bankruptcies some people expected has not occurred. But a host of zombie companies whose operating profits do not cover interest costs have appeared. Returns are likely to remain depressed. US and UK-listed companies raised unprecedented amounts to stay afloat. But there is a cost to pay. </p><p>Still, the global retail investing frenzy shows no signs of abating. In China, regulators are encouraging it. ChiNext, Shenzhen\u2019s Nasdaq rival, has doubled its daily trading limits to 20 per cent each way. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission wants more investors to have broader investment access. Plenty of chances for you to make your fortunes. </p><p>Enjoy your weekend,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">June Yoon</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lex writer</emphasis></p><p>Best\u00a0of\u00a0Lex\u00a0articles</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cf5eee2-2d87-4380-9a94-4ad6b2876156\"> Ant Group: Jack the giant-maker</url>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88c9bc6b-92f5-4570-bd59-96f6ba7f29c9\"> The Hut Group: an unusual structure</url>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be6e74fb-0f84-4947-bad3-a3a1edd92edd\">Delivery Hero/InstaShop: meal deal</url>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c8ac7b2-5c3b-4782-8c97-424c958efd3c\">Palantir: on a mission</url>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd3a5f6b-e539-4cb2-9dab-c7f574858a82\"> Dividends: weighed down</url>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c1bd210-7dee-4b5a-9219-8e139bcd5d5a\"> Tencent: backfire backtrack</url>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3afb13c5-99d1-418f-ad51-33f3d6db81ca\"> Lex in-depth: why rescue finance will slow recovery for businesses</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-aa0bc3c47e014c51aef9b901131c3370</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PG-XVG1-DXP9-911F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 28, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Administration &amp;

The first was to check into an alarming motel of a kind that would later feature in movies such as\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pulp Fiction</emphasis>\u00a0and\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">No Country for Old Men</emphasis>. The second was not to stick around, become a venture capitalist and wait for the start-ups to mushroom.</p><p>Back then, Silicon Valley was still more about microprocessors than their sophisticated use. Biotech had a glamour computing lacked. Businesses such as Google and Facebook were not even glints in their founders\u2019 eyes. Now they are large, maturing businesses and therefore the subject of angry public debate.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is guilty of a failure of foresight of its own here. It has demanded information from five tech giants about smaller acquisitions over the past 10 years. It is worried some of these takeovers squashed competition. Well, thank you for finally noticing, FTC.</p><p>When disrupters become incumbents, they have an obvious motive to forestall disruption of their own business models. Selling out to a tech giant has therefore been the easiest exit route for founders of small start-ups since the early noughties.</p><p>Why has the FTC suddenly got religion? It must be rattled by growing calls in the US to break up companies such as Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon. A local conspiracy theory also holds that tougher regulation of tech groups under President Donald Trump is intended to deny political capital to Democratic rivals in an election year.</p><p>The broader issue is that competition policy is dysfunctional on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly when confronted by big tech. The historic mission of regulators is to keep prices down for customers. That blinds them to rents extracted in personal data rather than money. Large takeovers are the main trigger for antitrust scrutiny. They have few powers to resist dominance that depends on network effects.</p><p>Competition policy is only one arena where hostility to big tech has been unleashed. Another is employment regulation.</p><p>Here in California, a district judge has just denied businesses dependent on gig workers a temporary reprieve from a new law. The legislation broadens the classification of employees, who get many benefits contractors forfeit.</p><p>Uber is pursuing a multipronged defensive strategy. Legal appeals aside, it has been trialling a rejigged version of its app intended to circumvent the crackdown. Alongside rival\u00a0 Lyft, the ride-hailing company may also seek a ballot of Californians that would give gig employers an exemption.</p><p>About 450,000 residents of California are\u00a0 gig workers. Tech groups such as Uber say they benefit from the flexibility denied to such wage slaves as Silicon Valley executives. Set against that is low pay and a lack of job security.</p><p>Buzzing round San Francisco in Uber and Lyft vehicles, Lex was left pondering the financial advantages to customers. Many new economy services are provided at below cost price. What kind of subsidy are investors giving customers? There is a certain satisfaction in free riding, even if only one part of your trip merits that description.</p><p>The reporting standards of tech groups are patchy. Moreover, Uber now boasts that it makes an adjusted ebitda profit on its worldwide rides business. This works out to about 75 cents per trip. Apply similar metrics to Lyft, which is losing money, and you get to a subsidy of about $1 per journey.</p><p>Uber Eats, the food delivery arm of Uber, is also in the red. The implicit subsidy for a meal for two costing about $25 would be a couple of dollars, judging from recently published accounts.</p><p>Similar calculations suggest backers are paying subscribers an estimated 10 cents a day to watch Netflix\u2019s curious mix of dramas featuring royals, drug dealers and supernatural entities.</p><p>Naturally, businesses such as these imagine they are building valuable franchises. Some doubtless are. Others are just burning piles of cash. The skill of investors\u00a0lies in working out which is which. \u201cBeing too early is just another way of going bankrupt,\u201d remarks one local venture capitalist. Perhaps I should not beat myself up for failing to spot a tech revolution was brewing on that first trip to the West Coast.</p><p>Enjoy the rest of your week.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathan Guthrie</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Head of Lex</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-25d808644d7a11ea95a043d18ec715f5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y68-W941-DXP9-922S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the past he has pointed to differences in data privacy too.\u00a0</p><p>This is only partly true. Snapchat did mark itself as a different\u00a0kind of social media company by encouraging users to send messages that disappeared. However the\u00a0other, less noble,\u00a0reason\u00a0it has not been hauled up in front of lawmakers in Washington is because it is a much smaller company. With daily active users\u00a0hovering\u00a0at about 210m it has\u00a0a fraction of the clout\u00a0Facebook wields \u00a0via its\u00a01.6bn users.\u00a0</p><p>But Snap is not alone in seeing an opportunity in\u00a0anti-tech sentiment. Apple has paid for billboards crowing about its privacy policies. Sonos is suing Google, accusing it of copying\u00a0speaker technology, and was invited to Washington to talk about its experiences.\u00a0</p><p>All three are capitalising on the growing public unease felt towards companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon and the impact that they have on democracy, privacy and society in general.\u00a0</p><p>Criticising\u00a0tech has gone mainstream. Both major political parties in the US berate the industry \u2014 albeit for different reasons. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last year, George Soros queried its power. Regulators round the world have launched investigations and fines. Multiple journalists have published articles in which they try to \u2018break up\u2019 with their smartphone or Amazon account or Google search engine dependency. Earlier this month, online magazine Slate published a list of the 30 \u2018 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/slate.com/technology/2020/01/evil-list-tech-companies-dangerous-amazon-facebook-google-palantir.amp\"> most evil</url>\u2019 tech companies in which it claimed that the era of enchantment with Silicon Valley was over. Every major tech company was included. Amazon was number one.\u00a0</p><p>Pinpointing the start date of the techlash is tricky. Some suggest February 2017, when former Uber employee Susan Fowler wrote a widely shared blog post about her troubling\u00a0experiences\u00a0at the company. Or March 2018, when it was revealed that\u00a0Cambridge Analytica tried to\u00a0influence elections via Facebook user data.</p><p>Both seemed to spur\u00a0political willingness to pick a fight with the industry. But the failure of the Arab spring had\u00a0already silenced those who claimed social media would connect the world and\u00a0spread democracy.\u00a0Sean Parker\u2019s much mocked 2013 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lord of the Rings</emphasis>-ish wedding in Big Sur was used as\u00a0proof that Silicon Valley\u2019s elite could be as obnoxious as any other industry.\u00a0</p><p>Either way it now feels firmly rooted. So the\u00a0most jarring aspect of\u00a0the techlash is that it\u00a0has not yet\u00a0been terrible for business. Facebook shares rose when it received a record\u00a0$5bn fine for privacy violations as investors registered relief that it had not been worse. Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in 2018 and has made no discernible impact to Google or Facebook. Uber has vowed to battle against a new California law that gives gig economy workers more benefits.\u00a0</p><p>Action has been piecemeal and investigations take years. Even if decisions are taken,\u00a0Microsoft has proved that a\u00a0company need not break up just because it is told to.\u00a0The industry\u2019s reputation may have\u00a0undergone irreparable damage but its businesses\u00a0are doing just fine.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Enjoy the rest of your week.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elaine\u00a0Moore</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Deputy editor of Lex</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-4dc4dc983d0411eaa01abae547046735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-GH61-JB77-K3WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><timeReceived>12:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Time to curl up in your cubicle, pop open one of these in-depth, entertaining reads, and catch up on some of what you missed during a busy week.This week we're taking a look at all the political stories that are coming out of the tech world. And given the current political environment, there's a cornucopia from which to choose. Enjoy.How to Combat China's Rise in Tech: Federal Spending, Not Tariffs[1] \u2014The New York Times Make love, not tariffs. </p><p>(Did I just repeat the NYT's headline joke? Hm.) A thoughtful column on why more government planning and investment in technology, like China has been doing, might actually be a better course of action for the U.S. than starting a trade war.On a Big Story Like the Helsinki Trump/Putin Summit, Google News' Algorithm Isn't Up to the Task[2] \u2014NiemanLab Let's say you wanted to get up to speed on what actually went down with Trump and Putin. If you looked on Google for the top articles, like they did at Nieman, you got one primary source: Fox News.E.U. Slaps $5B Antitrust Fine on Google; Trump Blasts Back With Tweet[3] \u2014Xconomy President Trump doesn't take the big antitrust[4] fine against Google kindly, and sends the E.U. a message\u2014via his favorite communication platformZuckerberg: The Recode Interview[5] and Congratulations, Mr. President: Zuckerberg Secretly Called Trump After The Election[6] \u2014Recode \u2014BuzzFeed News First, it's a sprawling, must-read interview with Mark Zuckerberg on how he views Facebook's handling (or mishandling) of its content, including Holocaust deniers and information said to inciteviolence[7], and basically everything else\u2014that is, except diversity[8]. (His comments about the Holocaust caused him to later clarify[9] his intent, too.) Following that is a report by BuzzFeed News that Zuckerberg called Trump after winning the election and praised the campaign's use of the social media network.The Biggest Spender of Political Ads on Facebook? President Trump[10] \u2014The New York Times Speaking of the 2016 election, President Trump has been the biggest Facebook ad spender since May of this year, spending $274,000 on digital campaigns. Advertisements purchased by Trump and his poitical action committee have reportedly gotten 37 million views during that stretch.New York City Looks to Crack Down on Airbnb Amid Housing Crisis[11] \u2014The New York Times The New York City Council passes legislation that would require Airbnb and HomeAway hosts share additional information with a city enforcement agency, in hopes of better regulating the costly temporary rental economy there.Uber Faces Federal Investigation Over Alleged Gender Discrimination[12] \u2014The Wall Street Journal 'Uber Technologies Inc. is being investigated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after a complaint about gender inequity,' The Journal reports.New Ethics Code Urges Tech Firms and Coders To Avoid Harming Society[13] \u2014Xconomy Do no harm, and other gems, now finally apply to tech firms!Health Insurers Are Vacuuming Up Details About You \u2014 And It Could Raise Your Rates[14] \u2014ProPublica and NPR Got a great rate on your health insurance? No? Well, insurers are gathering data about consumers, and that's probably not going to be great news for you. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/health-insurers-are-vacuuming-up-details-about-you-and-it-could-raise-your-rates\">https://www.propublica.org/article/health-insurers-are-vacuuming-up-details-about-you-and-it-could-raise-your-rates</url> States slow to prepare for hacking threatSocial Media Companies Defend Filtering Practices Before Congress[15] \u2014ReutersTop Voting Machine Vendor Admits It Installed Remote-Access Software on Systems Sold to States[16] \u2014MotherboardCommunist-Run Cuba Starts Rolling Out Internet on Mobile Phones[17] \u2014ReutersLeaked Documents Show Facebook's 'Threshold' for Deleting Pages and Groups[18] \u2014MotherboardAnd a few other unrelated good ones:$800 Million Says a Self-Driving Car Looks Like This[19] \u2014BloombergScoop: Inside Google's Venture Capital 'Machine'[20] \u2014AxiosHow Google's Safe Browsing Helped Build a More Secure Web[21] \u2014WiredThe False Tale of Amazon's Industry-Conquering Juggernaut[22] \u2014Wired Don't be afraid of the big bad Amazon\u2014the company probably won't disrupt anything else, like it did the publishing market, anytime soon, Wired's Felix Salmon says.

More than 80% of the individual names in the S&amp;P 500 are up over the course of that six-month stretch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But don't mistake this environment for a market where you can just buy stocks blindly and still make money. Stock picking still matters a lot in 2017.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Delve a little deeper into the stats, and the gap between outperformers and underperformers becomes a little clearer. For instance, of the stocks that are up in the past six months, nearly half are up 20% or more during that timeframe--in other words, owning leaders means a huge margin of outperformance versus owning the typical stock in the S&amp;P.</p><p>So, to find the next set of stocks likely to lead, we're turning to a fresh set of \"Rocket Stocks\" worth buying for gains ...</p><p>In case you're not familiar, Rocket Stocks are our list of companies with short-term gain catalysts and longer-term growth potential. To find them, I run a weekly quantitative screen that seeks out stocks with a combination of analyst upgrades and positive earnings surprises to identify rising analyst expectations, a bullish signal for stocks in any market. After all, where analysts' expectations are increasing, institutional cash often follows. In the past 391 weeks, our weekly list of plays has outperformed the S&amp;P 500's record-breaking run by 77.06%.</p><p>So, without further ado, here's a look at this week's Rocket Stocks.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Home Depot</emphasis><br/></p><p>2017 is panning out to be a strong year for shares of home improvement retailer <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Home Depot Inc.  </emphasis>. Just year-to-date, this retailer has handed investors total returns of 12.25%--zoom out to the past six months, and that rally expands to nearly 20% returns. The good news for investors is that Home Depot's price momentum isn't showing any signs of slowing here. Shares hit new all-time highs during this past Friday's trading session.</p><p>Home Depot is the biggest home improvement store chain in the world, with 2,278 big box store locations spread across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Rising home prices have been a major tailwind for Home Depot--as homeowners feel the wealth effect from their rising equity values, they're becoming increasingly willing to spend more money on home upgrades.</p><p>The firm has shifted its attention away from solely DIY customers in the past few years, including pro customers in its target market to take advantage of the growth in the commercial construction market. At the same time, those deeper relationships with contractors are giving it an edge in its service offerings--Home Depot can pair consumers off with service providers who use only Home Depot-supplied products, and collect a markup in the process. Tailwinds in services and an increasing focus on the private label should provide fatter margins for Home Depot in 2017.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualcomm Inc.</emphasis><br/></p><p>Despite a shaky start in 2017, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualcomm Inc.  </emphasis>is finding its footing. Since bottoming at the start of February, Qualcomm has been in \"rebound mode,\" charging more than 8% higher, versus a 3.7% upside move in the rest of the S&amp;P 500 over that same timeframe. Clearing black clouds could fuel more upside in Qualcomm as we dig deeper into the calendar year ...</p><p>Qualcomm makes chips used in mobile devices. The firm's processors can be found in a number of high-end smartphones, and its components are ubiquitous in the industry (Qualcomm provides the radio modems used in many of the new iPhone 7, for instance). Simply put, if you own a smartphone, there's a very good chance that Qualcomm got paid somewhere along the way. That's not just true if your phone has Qualcomm hardware in it--the firm also owns a massive intellectual property portfolio, licensing its patents and collecting royalties for pretty much every 3G and 4G LTE device that's sold worldwide today.</p><p>While anti-competitive concerns surrounding that valuable IP have gotten Qualcomm in hot water with South Korean and Chinese regulators, and patent drama with corporate \"frenemies\" like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple Inc.  </emphasis> have added to this stock's headline risk, it doesn't change the big picture here. As those black clouds clear, this stock is well-positioned to make up for lost time in 2017. Analyst sentiment is ticking higher in Qualcomm, so we're betting on shares this week ...</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.</emphasis><br/></p><p>IT services consultancy <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.  </emphasis> is benefiting from overall growth in the IT services industry. That positioning has translated into a growth rate deep into the double-digits over the past five years, and as more companies look to push more of their IT infrastructure to \"the cloud,\" consulting organizations like Cognizant are well-positioned to see engagements rise.</p><p>Cognizant originally made its mark on the business world by acting like a major cost-cutter. The firm was one of the first major IT outsourcers that found success moving technical tasks to India, where a large population of skilled tech workers is able to service accounts at much lower costs than a company could expect to find here at home. Now, the trend toward cost savings as a function of physical infrastructure gives Cognizant the opportunity to leverage its substantial footprint in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>Even though many of Cognizant's professional services providers are based in India, the firm's management and sales team are U.S.-based, giving it a model that continues to sell well here. While the outsourcing model may have lost some of its political appeal, Cognizant actually stands as a possible net winner as companies look to Cognizant to replace H-1B visa positions they have to give up.</p><p>Historically, Cognizant's customer base has been incredibly sticky. In other words, switching costs are high and Cognizant's ability to quantify the benefits it offers clients keep retention levels extremely high. Buyers are clearly in control of the price action in this big tech services stock right now ...</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paychex Inc. </emphasis><br/></p><p>Rounding out our list of Rocket Stocks for this week is $22.6 billion payroll company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paychex Inc.  </emphasis>. With all of the focus on rising interest rates in the last week, Paychex is a smart way to play the moves from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fed</emphasis>. More on that in a moment ...</p><p>First, Paychex's core business: Paychex provides payroll services for more than 590,000 customers, primarily small and medium-sized businesses. The firm helps those smaller firms navigate the maze of tax and compliance issues involved in paying employees, earning profits in the process. The firm also offers other outsourced HR functions, including 401(k) administration and worker's comp insurance.</p><p>Improvements in jobs numbers are a good thing for Paychex--the firm's pricing is generally based on a flat fee plus an addition charge for every employee processed through the platform on payday. More jobs in the economy directly mean more profits at Paychex.</p><p>As I mentioned a moment ago, deep down, Paychex is really an interest rate play. That's because the company has historically earned a substantial income from float interest (the interest money it earns on massive payroll accounts between the time that employers deposit funds and employees cash their checks). With rates held near zero for the better part of the last decade, that revenue stream has dried up. A trend back in the direction of higher rates could return an important source of revenue that heads straight to PAYX's bottom line. Investors get their next update on Paychex's business when the firm reports third quarter earnings at the end of this month.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-14050405</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N4K-B2N1-F00X-J4WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1273\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc.
