I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Director Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting today\u2019s event.  I\u2019d also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso.  Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging.  Thank you for accommodating us.  I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today.            It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century \u2014 that is, the United States\u2019 response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party.  The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world.  It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship.  How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.     Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien spoke about the CCP\u2019s ideology and global ambitions.  He declared, and I agree, that \u201c[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China are over.\u201d [1]  Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. [2]   In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world.  I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.              It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum.  Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America\u2019s reengagement with the People\u2019s Republic of China, which began with President Nixon\u2019s historic visit in 1972.  Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.        At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States.  Yet even then, there were signs of China\u2019s immense latent power.  In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote:  \u201cIf she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people \u2026. This last impression\u2014of the reality of China\u2019s colossal potential\u2014is perhaps the most vivid of our journey.  As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\u201d [3]   It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.     Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China\u2019s remarkable rise, had a famous motto: \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201d [4]   That is precisely what China has done.  China\u2019s economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world\u2019s GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today.  By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours.  The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving \u201ccloser to center stage,\u201d \u201cbuilding a socialism that is superior to capitalism,\u201d and replacing the American Dream with the \u201cChinese solution.\u201d [5]   China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time.  From the perspective of its communist rulers, China\u2019s time has arrived.    The People\u2019s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent superpower.  A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles.  Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership.  Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications.  It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.     \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d is the latest iteration of the PRC\u2019s state-led, mercantilist economic model.  For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy.  To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\u2019s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage.  About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.     The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific.  In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors\u2019 ships and fishing boats.     Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative.  Although billed as \u201cforeign aid,\u201d in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\u2019s strategic interests and domestic economic needs.  For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017.  This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.         Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\u2019s plans to dominate the world\u2019s digital infrastructure through its \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d initiative.  I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\u2019s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G.  Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\u2019s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence.  Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go.  AI long ago outmatched the world\u2019s chess grandmasters.  But the PRC\u2019s interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea.  The following year, Beijing unveiled its \u201cNext Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\u201d a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030.  Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.    The PRC\u2019s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware.  According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. [6]   \u201cSince then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\u201d in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation. [7]      The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials.  Overall, China is America\u2019s top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports.  The risks of dependence are real.  In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea.  The PRC could do the same to us.    As China\u2019s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\u2019s predatory economic policies are succeeding.  For a hundred years, America was the world\u2019s largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of democracy.\u201d  China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010.  The PRC is now the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of dictatorship.\u201d    How did China accomplish all this?  No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people.  At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China\u2019s meteoric rise possible.  China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade.  In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status.  In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations.  Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.     Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \u201cHow America\u2019s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\u201d [8]  The article details how China\u2019s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile.  The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies.  Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits.  Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.    Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services.  The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency.  For example, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns.  In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to countries in need.  It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.    China\u2019s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns.  It has become the United States\u2019 largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China.  China\u2019s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft.  As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \u201ccreating their own competitors.\u201d [9]      America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals.  America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\u2019s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \u201cAPIs.\u201d  As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \u201c[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\u201d it \u201ccould result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\u201d [10]      To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\u2019s rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries.  In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \u201chigh-value-added-industry\u201d and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. [11]   Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies.  American firms face well-known obstacles in China\u2019s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China.  And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.     In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers.  Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.    As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States.  It is to raid the United States.  If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards.  But in the end, the PRC\u2019s goal is to replace you.  As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \u201c[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\u201d [12]    Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China\u2019s political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed.  As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.  It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary.  The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.      If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough.  But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America.  As this Administration\u2019s China Strategy recognizes, \u201cthe CCP\u2019s campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China\u2019s borders.\u201d [13]   Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.    All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence\u2014even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States.  Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.     Take Hollywood.  Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit.  And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s ideals of social justice.  But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world\u2019s most powerful violator of human rights.  This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.    For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus.  The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China.  (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.)  But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal.  The deal never materialized.    In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange , filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \u201cAncient One,\u201d a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic.  When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \u201cif you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\u2019s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\u201d [14]  Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say \u201c[w]e\u2019re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\u201d [15]    These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda.  National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien offered even more examples in his remarks.  But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits.  Chinese government censors don\u2019t need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them.  This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.        The story of the film industry\u2019s submission to the CCP is a familiar one.  In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world\u2019s largest box office.  The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market\u2014both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China\u2019s WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime.  Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing.  In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.     But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood\u2014and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions.  To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi.  By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how.  As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \u201c[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\u201d [16]   Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.    Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC.  America\u2019s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.     In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \u201cliberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\u201d [17]   Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China\u2014the world\u2019s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.    Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.  For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests.  Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store.  Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.     The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence.  More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.     As China\u2019s government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party.  Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\u2019s request.  Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a \u201cfriendly face\u201d on pro-regime policies.  The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner.  And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.     America\u2019s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists.  You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \u201cguanxi\u201d \u2014 or system of influential social networks\u2014necessary to do business with the PRC.  But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct.  But it does require those who are acting as the \u201cagents\u201d of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility. [18]      These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.    By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations.  The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions.  For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \u201cConfucius Institutes,\u201d which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing.  Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\u2019s demands.       In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions.  But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America\u2019s economic, technological, and military strength.     Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom.  A world marching to the beat of Communist China\u2019s drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.      There was a time American companies understood that.  They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.    In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics.  During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films.  To boost the morale of America\u2019s troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.    I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.  When Disney produced Kundun , the 1997 film about the PRC\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.  Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn\u2019t let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.       But that moment of courage wouldn\u2019t last long.  After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access.  The CEO apologized for Kundun , calling it a \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d [19]   Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai.  As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management.  Of the park\u2019s 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party.  They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.    Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles.  Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.     American companies must understand the stakes.  The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report.  But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.    During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it.  \u201c[T]he time has come,\u201d he said, \u201cindeed, it is long overdue\u2014for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\u201d [20]    So too today.  The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods.  And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.     If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers.  As Justice Powell wrote: \u201cStrength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\u201d [21]   Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action.  Following the recent imposition of the PRC\u2019s draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data.  True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees.  We will see if these companies hold firm.  I hope they do.  If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s corrupt and dictatorial rule.          The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them.  To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy.  America has done that before.  If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we\u2014the American people, American government, and American business together\u2014can do it again.  Our freedom depends on it.       [1] Robert C.

We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you\u2019ll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting this event.  I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso.  Even under normal circumstances, it\u2019s hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it\u2019s especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who\u2019ve come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.    I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S. Attorney here in the Western District, so John it\u2019s great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it\u2019s appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn\u2019t a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration.     I\u2019m privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States\u2019 response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party.  The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world.  It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship.  How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890\u2019s, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It\u2019s because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What\u2019s at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?    Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien spoke about the CCP\u2019s ideology and global ambitions.  He declared, and I agree, that \u201cthe days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China are over.\u201d  And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.  In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world.  Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I\u2019ll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America\u2019s reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.    At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China\u2019s immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: \u201cIf she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people\u2026 this last impression \u2013 of the reality of China\u2019s colossal potential \u2013 is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\u201d It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.    Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China\u2019s remarkable rise had a famous motto: \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201d That is precisely what China has done. China\u2019s economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world\u2019s GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China\u2019s time has arrived.    The People\u2019s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent technological superpower.  A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies.  Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership.  Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications.  It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.     \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d is the latest iteration of the PRC\u2019s state-led, mercantilist economic model.  For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy.  To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\u2019s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage.  About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.     The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific.  In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors\u2019 ships and fishing boats.     Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative.  Although billed as \u201cforeign aid,\u201d in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\u2019s strategic interests and domestic economic needs.  For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017.  This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.         Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\u2019s plans to dominate the world\u2019s digital infrastructure through its \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d initiative.  I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\u2019s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G.  Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\u2019s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence.  Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go.  In 2017, Beijing unveiled its \u201cNext Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\u201d a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030.  Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.    The PRC\u2019s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware.  According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.  \u201cSince then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\u201d in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.    The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials.  Overall, China is America\u2019s top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports.  The risks of dependence are real.  In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea.  The PRC could do the same to us.  As China\u2019s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\u2019s predatory economic policies are succeeding.  For a hundred years, America was the world\u2019s largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of democracy.\u201d  China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010.  The PRC is now the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of dictatorship.\u201d    How did China accomplish all this?  No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people.  At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China\u2019s meteoric rise possible.  China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade.  In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status.  In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations.  Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.     Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \u201cHow America\u2019s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\u201d  The article details how China\u2019s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile.  The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies.  Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits.  Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.    Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services.  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency.  For example, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns.  In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to other countries that needed them.  It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.    China\u2019s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns.  It has become the United States\u2019 largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China.  China\u2019s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft.  As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \u201ccreating their own competitors.\u201d    America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals.  America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\u2019s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \u201cAPIs.\u201d  As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \u201c[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\u201d it \u201ccould result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\u201d    To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\u2019s rulers went to the same playbook they\u2019ve used to gut other American industries.  In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \u201chigh-value-added-industry\u201d and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.  Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies.  American firms face well-known obstacles in China\u2019s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China.  And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.     In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers.  Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.    As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States.  It is to raid the United States.  If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards.  But in the end, the PRC\u2019s goal is to replace you.  As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \u201c[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\u201d    Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China\u2019s political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed.  As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.  It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary.  The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.      If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough.  But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America.  As this Administration\u2019s China Strategy recognizes, \u201cthe CCP\u2019s campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China\u2019s borders.\u201d  Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.    All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence \u2014 even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States.  Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.     Take Hollywood.  Hollywood\u2019s actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit.  And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s ideals of social justice.  But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world\u2019s most powerful violator of human rights.  This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.    For example, the hit movie  World War Z  depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus.  The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China.  But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal.  The deal never materialized.    In the Marvel Studios blockbuster  Dr. Strange , filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \u201cAncient One,\u201d a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic.  When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \u201cif you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\u2019s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\u201d  Or, as the Chinese government might say, \u201c[w]e\u2019re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\u201d    These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP.  National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien offered even more examples in his remarks.  But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits.  Chinese government censors don\u2019t need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them.  This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.        The story of the film industry\u2019s submission to the CCP is a familiar one.  In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world\u2019s largest box office.  The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market \u2014 both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China\u2019s WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime.  Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing.  In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier.     But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood \u2014 and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions.  To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi.  By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S. technology and know-how.  As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \u201c[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\u201d  Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.    Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC.  America\u2019s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.  In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \u201cliberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\u201d  Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China \u2014 the world\u2019s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.    Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.  For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests.  Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store.  Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.     Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.   During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones.  And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple.  Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones.  We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack.  Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities?  They wouldn\u2019t be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities.  And what we\u2019ve asked for is a warrant \u2013 when we have a warrant from a court \u2013 that we should be able to get into because cellphones.  That\u2019s the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.    The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence.  More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.     As China\u2019s government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party.  Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\u2019s request.  Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S. politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a \u201cfriendly face\u201d on pro-regime policies.  The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner.  And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.     America\u2019s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists.  You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \u201cguanxi\u201d \u2014 or system of influential social networking \u2014 necessary to do business with the PRC.  But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct.  But it does require those who are acting as the \u201cagents\u201d of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.    By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States.  The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions.  For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \u201cConfucius Institutes,\u201d which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing.  Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\u2019s demands.       In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions.  But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America\u2019s economic, technological, and military strength.     Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom.  A world marching to the beat of Communist China\u2019s drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.  There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.    In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics.  During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films.  To boost the morale of America\u2019s troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.    I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.  When Disney produced  Kundun , the 1997 film about the PRC\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.  Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn\u2019t let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.  But that moment of courage wouldn\u2019t last long.  After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access.  The CEO apologized for  Kundun , calling it a \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d  Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai.  As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management.  Of the park\u2019s full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party.  They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.    Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles.  Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.     American companies must understand the stakes.  The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter\u2019s earnings report.  But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.    During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it.  \u201c[T]he time has come,\u201d he said, \u201cindeed, it is long overdue \u2014 for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\u201d  So too today.  The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods.  And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.     If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers.  As Justice Powell wrote: \u201cStrength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\u201d  Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action.  Following the recent imposition of the PRC\u2019s draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data.  True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees.  We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm.  I hope they do.  If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s corrupt and dictatorial rule.          The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them.  To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy.  America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we \u2014 the American people, the American government, and American business together \u2014 can do it again.  Our freedom depends on it.      \u2013</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42622493094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CN-C251-JCSC-J03N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Foreign Affairs.co.nz</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Consumer Credit Scores</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0I5NUVFOTY5RTRCNDNGMkFEMTE0NjZEN0YxN0UzQjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This weekend, inaction by Twitter to remove grime star Wiley\u2019s account after he posted a slew of anti-Semitic messages demonstrates exactly why legislation is needed.    It comes after:    Racist abuse faced by Wilfried Zaha and David McGoldrick on social media led the Professional Footballers Association to urge the Government to fast-track the bill.  Analysis has shown that Labour MP Diane Abbott received more than half of all the abuse on social media aimed at female MPs. Women MPs are far more likely to receive abuse than their male counterparts.  The anti-vaxx movement has been allowed to grow to dangerous levels, spreading misinformation that is putting lives at risk.    But attempts to take action have been hampered by the government\u2019s delays. In June Lord Puttnam, Chair of the Lords Democracy and Digital Committee, called the delay on the Online Harms Bill \u2013 which may not come into force until 2023 or 2024 \u2013 \u201cunacceptable\u201d.    Just last week the Commons DCMS select committee warned that the lack of effective regulation had allowed misinformation about coronavirus to spread \u201cvirulently\u201d.

This weekend, inaction by Twitter to remove grime star Wiley\u2019s account after he posted a slew of anti-Semitic messages demonstrates exactly why legislation is needed.    It comes after:    Racist abuse faced by Wilfried Zaha and David McGoldrick on social media led the Professional Footballers Association to urge the Government to fast-track the bill.  Analysis has shown that Labour MP Diane Abbott received more than half of all the abuse on social media aimed at female MPs. Women MPs are far more likely to receive abuse than their male counterparts.  The anti-vaxx movement has been allowed to grow to dangerous levels, spreading misinformation that is putting lives at risk.    But attempts to take action have been hampered by the government\u2019s delays. In June Lord Puttnam, Chair of the Lords Democracy and Digital Committee, called the delay on the Online Harms Bill \u2013 which may not come into force until 2023 or 2024 \u2013 \u201cunacceptable\u201d.    Just last week the Commons DCMS select committee warned that the lack of effective regulation had allowed misinformation about coronavirus to spread \u201cvirulently\u201d. Tory chair of the select committee Julian Knight said the pandemic had demonstrated that \u201cwithout due weight of the law, social media companies have no incentive to consider a duty of care to those who use their services\u201d and urged the government to act and name a regulator now.    Jo Stevens MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport  said:    \u201cThe failure to tackle these high-profile examples of hate speech shows why we so desperately need proper legislation to force the social media companies to keep people safe online.    \u201cSocial media companies have had repeated opportunities to show they can police their sites effectively.

Mr Russell says the party\u2019s consultation \u201chas the scope and ambition to inform our understanding of our new digital world and guide our future decision making about how to make it a better place\u201d.    After Molly\u2019s death the Russell family found graphic self-harm content and suicide-encouraging memes on her social media.    Mr Russell, who has established the Molly Rose Foundation in her memory, said: \u201cToday\u2019s current big tech platforms were born at about the same time as my youngest daughter, Molly. The powerful tech corporations live on, sadly Molly ended her own life in 2017 and I am convinced what she found online helped kill her.    \u201cLabour\u2019s consultation will help the UK become a world leader for the effective regulation required to make the internet a safer place. Only when we have identified, understood and tamed online harms will modern connected technology fully flourish and bring us all the widespread benefits it promises.\u201d    Labour has called on the government to prioritise the Online Harms Bill which was first promised more than a year ago. Since then, high profile examples have shown why the lack of regulation is letting down users. These include Twitter\u2019s sluggish reaction to antisemitic tweets from Grime artist Wiley, allowing the spread of dangerous anti-vaxx and other conspiracies, and the failure to address racist abuse targeting MPs such as Diane Abbott.    Labour is working with Jamie Susskind, author of Future Politics: Living Together in a World Transformed by Tech, on the wide-ranging consultation that will look at:    Online harms addressing children\u2019s safety, hate speech and disinformation  Digital innovation and how the tech sector can help economic growth  Data protection and user rights  The digital divide showing how poverty and lack of skills shut people out from opportunity    Jo Stevens MP, Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said:    \u201cLabour believes that technology has already changed lives for the better, but it also provides a space where disinformation, hate speech and other online harms have been allowed to flourish.    \u201cThis is something that should worry all of us. The corrosive effect of this harm does not stop when we put down our phones, it has a significant impact on our everyday lives.    \u201cThere are also growing signs that too much power is being concentrated in the hands of unaccountable tech companies whose decisions increasingly affect our rights, freedoms, and the political system itself.    \u201cWe can and must demand more from the tech we use and build a digital future that is safer, fairer and more inclusive. We are asking people to take part in our consultation and help us make that happen.\u201d    \u2013</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42810747360</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JW-40J1-JCSC-J3X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Foreign Affairs.co.nz</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Curtis (R-UT)    Washington, DC  \u2013 Today, Representative Curtis (R-UT) introduced bipartisan legislation to put American consumers in the driver\u2019s seat by giving them clearer knowledge about the technology they are purchasing. The  Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act , introduced by Reps. Curtis, Moulton (D-MA), and Bilirakis (R-FL), requires the creation of reasonable disclosure guidelines for products that have audio or visual recording components  that are not clearly obvious to a reasonable person, such as a kitchen or another household appliance.     \u201cThis legislation balances protecting American consumers with continuing to foster innovation, and I am extremely pleased with this final bipartisan product we introduced today,\u201d  said Curtis.  \u201cBy working with a broad range of stakeholders, this legislation will allow regulatory flexibility without hamstringing the technological pioneers who are developing smart technologies, while ensuring consumers are aware of the capabilities of items they are putting in their homes.\u201d    \u201cWe should be allowed to make informed decisions about the electronic eavesdroppers we invite into our homes. But we can\u2019t do it if big tech hides microphones and cameras that are always listening in refrigerators, toasters, and other household gadgets,\u201d  said Moulton.  \u201cLet\u2019s pass this bill so consumers know when big tech is listening in.\u201d    Background:    The legislation is in response to reports about household devices listening to individuals\u2019 conversations without their knowledge. While some manufacturers have taken steps to more clearly label their products with listening devices, this legislation would make this information more obvious to consumers without overly burdensome requirements on producers of these devices.     Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to work alongside industry leaders to establish guidelines for properly disclosing the potential for their products to contain audio or visual recording capabilities. To ensure this does not become an overly burdensome labeling requirement, the legislation provides manufacturers the option of requesting customized guidance from the FTC that fits within their existing marketing or branding practices in addition to permitting these disclosures pre or post-sale of their products.    Text of the bill available [ HERE ].    ###    \u2013</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42588888833</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BT-FFG1-F07F-814N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Foreign Affairs.co.nz</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

For a week, they were my constant companions wherever I went around Sydney. But this wasn't a sightseeing tour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chuck and Diane are not people, but two Android smartphones. They came loaded with special software, which fed me exactly the information the phones are sending to Google throughout the day and night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was snooping on Google snooping on me. Payback. And very relevant too, given the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's expose of the inadequacy of our privacy laws, released last Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But we don't even begin to understand just how much personal data is being taken. We can't even keep track of it. We need a privacy reset button.</p><p>I'm not just talking about Google and Facebook working out what I intend buying, and serving me ads about them. I'm not just talking about information gleaned by cookies monitoring websites. It's a deeper analysis of my whereabouts than simply a record of location on Google Maps.</p><p>Data fire hose It's a relentless collection of data gleaned from your Android phone: where you are, the identification of cellular towers and the identification by ID (Mac address) of every wi-fi access point you encounter, constant recordings of barometric pressure - Google seems to want to know which floor of a building you are on - and your state: whether you are still on a bicycle, or in a car; your longitude, latitude and speed, and an estimate of data accuracy.</p><p>Wi-fi access point records include frequency and strength. This is something more than commerce, activity and health data. It's surveillance on a scale few users are aware of.</p><p>Google says it uses location information to deliver better results and recommendations on Google products, with a user's permission. Location history is opt-in, and you can edit, delete or turn it off any time, Google says in a statement. The company says it offers users control over their data through the My Account site.</p><p>Over the one week of testing, Chuck and Diane sent a fire hose of data to Google, which the phone software intercepted and sent to our analysis program.</p><p>I kept a diary of my activity for that period to match it against Google's data stream. Here are some examples.</p><p>Between 2.02pm and 2.33pm on June 23 - 31 minutes - one of the phones conducted 39 wi-fi scans, 15 locations scans, 15 barometric readings, and 24 activity scans - whether I was still or on foot. More than 20 of the wi-fi scans each identified more than 20 wi-fi access points.</p><p>On June 27 I commuted by train and tram to a conference, then stayed in the city for dinner. The phone sent 529 readings of data to Google. Of that, 158 were activity-related, 222 were barometric readings, 121 were locations, 29 were about changes in rates of data accumulation and 151 were scans of wi-fi sources.</p><p>Wi-fi window The data included the Mac addresses of wi-fi access points within buildings I visited that day, including the conference centre and my work, the frequency of the wi-fi device and signal strength. This offers a more accurate determination of where you are indoors than can be gleaned from GPS and cellular data.</p><p>Knowing your indoor location may not bother you when shopping, but triangulating the proximity of employees to different wi-fi access points at work and using signal strengths could help work out who is in contact with whom. Google may not do this, but the data is there.</p><p>Google does ask permission to collect wi-fi data when you set up your phone. It's one of the first permission requests on a new device. But Google doesn't ask your workplace if it is OK that your phone records their wi-fi router details. It asks you for permission for your phone to snoop on Google's behalf. Just one visitor to an office location is enough for Google to glean details of wi-fi devices within it. Chuck and Diane collected such data from offices I visited during the test.</p><p>Data collection doesn't stop at night when you relax at home and go to bed. On the night of June 24, between 10pm and 6am, when I was asleep at home, the phones sent Google 164 pieces of information about my environment. There were barometer readings, wi-fi listings of my neighbours, and observations such as \"still with confidence\". Being \"observed\" overnight made me feel like I had been monitored by a night nurse. The data was grossly disproportionate to any Android support I needed as a user.</p><p>There were \"check-in records\" that tied together details of phones such as the model, user email address, device identifier, the phone's wi-fi Mac address and Android ID. No anonymity. I could view a comprehensive history of my connection to mobile phone towers and wi-fi access points throughout the day.</p><p>Location data was collected even though I hadn't activated location history from within Google Maps.</p><p>Overriding airplane mode There's evidence that phones accumulate statistics even when in airplane mode. On June 27, Diana, in airplane mode, recorded my location and transmitted it the next day when it reconnected. The location was correct.</p><p>Each day the phones were assessing my movements, whether I was \"still\", \"inVehicle\", \"onBicycle\" or \"unknown\". The data shows whether the phones are charging and their battery level. Each snippet includes a confidence level of whether the movement assessment is correct. Not all of them are correct, however.</p><p>If you consider the enormous data collected by just one phone, it's unfathomable to imagine how Google meaningfully handles data it receives each day from 2.5 billion Android devices globally. The flow of information into the tech giant is astronomical.</p><p>But Google would have the data needed to piece together the location of people who are indoors and outside based on its knowledge of every wi-fi device on the planet. That's before we add in GPS and cellular tracking.</p><p>This data collection is symptomatic of what's happening across the world. The UN Economic Commission for Europe estimates that by next year the total data generated globally will be 40 zettabytes (40 billion terabytes, or 40,000 billion gigabytes). According to IBM, 90 per cent of the world's data was generated in the past two years and we generate the equivalent of all the data captured in 2002 every two days.</p><p>Much of the data in future will be from Internet of Things sensors, but there's lots of personal data too. The ACCC report includes a 130-page chapter that focuses on whether consumers can make informed choices on how digital platforms collect, use and disclose their personal information and user data.</p><p>The chapter lists 30 categories of data Google collects about people, as at January this year. They include not only name, birthday, phone number and email address, but also search history, messages, phone calls, comments you post, and mobile network information. That's the data that's declared.</p><p>Gagging Google It is paramount that we address whether these other types of data can be even generated let alone retained in identifiable or unidentifiable form. Could 21st-century life go on, if Google wasn't constantly collecting data from your phone every instant of the day? Can this data fire hose be turned off?</p><p>The ACCC report is an incredibly comprehensive take on this out-of-control collection of data, but there's a danger the issue will degenerate into a talk fest rather than action.</p><p>This data fire hose has been highlighted before, but we decided to conduct our own test of it here in Australia. We used phones and a data analysis package supplied by US firm Oracle, which is in long-term litigation with Google over the ownership and use of the Java programming language. But the analysis was our own.</p><p>The ACCC last year began an investigation into data collection including this Google data fire hose, but the report says the investigations are continuing. The ACCC is yet to form a view it but plans to conclude the investigations later this year.</p><p>So what happens next? There's a suggestion that we regulate the big tech giants, but the easier path could be to regulate the types of personal data that can be collected, how data is used, the right to veto the use of your data for purposes other than originally intended, and the right to demand its deletion. The giants would be obliged to comprehensively reveal the data they glean from you, your phone and other devices.</p><p>The US Federal Trade Commission's $US5 billion ($7.24bn) fine of Facebook this month shows that the tech giants can be held to account on how they control the use of consumers' personal information. It's not a hopeless task.</p><p>Deleting data The better path is genuine co-operation to make managing personal privacy easier. For example, Google recently implemented auto-delete controls where you can opt to have your data deleted after three months or 18 months.</p><p>This auto-delete feature is a good idea and it exists on Android phones I use. However, it is buried. You choose Settings, Google Services, Google Account, Privacy and Personalisation, and Activity Controls to even find it. You then go into web &amp; app activity, or location history, to access auto-delete controls. I'd bet less than 1 per cent of users know about it, let alone how to access it.</p><p>Auto-delete controls allow you to share some information for a period of time without spending your life managing that data thereafter. But Google should include a dedicated privacy app so that accessing privacy controls including auto-delete is simple. You shouldn't have to go through a labyrinth of menu choices in the Settings app to find them.</p><p>Apple has got its act together on this with prompts that let users give permission for use of their location for a single session. The application has to request your location afresh the next time around. Data permissions are transient. Apple is offering periodic alerts that show the kind of locations being shared with an app, so you can decide whether to allow the app continued access.</p><p>But you should not have to share data in the first place. The policy should be opt-in, rather than requiring users to opt out.</p><p>Tech companies also should address the issue of users feeling bullied into agreeing to share data, and a barrage of menu obstacles and warnings that dissuade them from saying no. In the end, lots of practical software adjustments may assist consumers more than months of longwinded theoretical discussion that end up as hot air.We need to turn off the unbelievable continuous streaming of data from our phones as revealed by Chuck and Diane. I'd say leave fire hoses to fire trucks. This is a form of madness that should end today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-ca8f3ce6b2a311e988ccf90fcceed6a644eafb931ab0486030c7d701fe393674</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPG-GXY1-F0JP-W0VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 1, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Culture Secretary Matt Hancock is considering an online cap for under-18s.</p><p>The cap could also cover popular online games, such as Fortnite, concerns about which were discussed at cabinet last week. Sources said yesterday that the length of any limit would be decided following a public consultation this month. But it is likely to be no more than three hours a day, and could be as little as two.</p><p>Imposing it would be fraught with difficulty, however, ministers believe technology firms have the ability to limit access.</p><p>One alternative would be to simply offer guidance to parents on daily usage. But Mr Hancock appears to favour a tougher line, saying: 'My instinct is that parental controls don't work unless they have a strong backstop behind them.' He said ministers were also looking at ways to enforce the age limits that firms such as Facebook and Twitter claim to use. This could include requiring a parent to verify a child's age before they may open an account.</p><p>Mr Hancock said existing age restrictions had 'no credibility whatsoever'. A new code of conduct for social media firms, covering issues such as bullying and online abuse, is also going to be put into law. Firms including Facebook and YouTube will be required to take down offensive material immediately. The proposals will be backed by the threat of fines of up to \u00a31billion.</p><p>Mr Hancock said yesterday that ministers were determined to tackle the 'Wild West' aspect of the internet, adding: 'People increasingly live their lives through online platforms, so it's more important than ever that people are safe and parents have confidence they can keep children from harm.' His deputy, Margot James, said big tech firms were failing to deal with abusive material online. She added: 'It shouldn't be up to the taxpayer to fund the mechanisms by which this content is removed, which is currently the case. It should be up to the platforms. There is sufficient artificial intelligence for them to make a huge impression, and the fact that most of them don't is highly irresponsible, which is why we intend to bring in legislation to control it.' Mr Hancock also attacked social media firms, revealing that just four in 14 invited companies attended his recent summit on the issue.</p><p>He said sites such as Musical.ly have more than one million British users but failed to take part in the conference, adding: 'The fact that only four companies turned up when I invited the 14 biggest gave me a big impetus to drive this proposal to legislate through.' He said he prevented his three young children from using social media, and was struck by how many technology bosses do the same. \u00f7 Children's charities have joined forces to urge the Government to regulate social media to protect young people from abuse.</p><p>The Children's Charities Coalition of Internet Safety is demanding a mandatory safety code backed by an independent regulator.

But it is likely to be no more than three hours a day, and could be as little as two.</p><p>Imposing it would be fraught with difficulty, however, ministers believe technology firms have the ability to limit access.</p><p>One alternative would be to simply offer guidance to parents on daily usage. But Mr Hancock appears to favour a tougher line, saying: My instinct is that parental controls don't work unless they have a strong backstop behind them.'</p><p>He said ministers were also looking at ways to enforce the age limits that firms such as Facebook and Twitter claim to use. This could include requiring a parent to verify a child's age before they may open an account.</p><p>Mr Hancock said existing age restrictions had no credibility whatsoever'.</p><p>A new code of conduct for social media firms, covering issues such as bullying and online abuse, is also going to be put into law. Firms including Facebook and YouTube will be required to take down offensive material immediately. The proposals will be backed by the threat of fines of up to \u00a31billion.</p><p>Mr Hancock said yesterday that ministers were determined to tackle the Wild West' aspect of the internet, adding: People increasingly live their lives through online platforms, so it's more important than ever that people are safe and parents have confidence they can keep children from harm.'</p><p>His deputy, Margot James, said big tech firms were failing to deal with abusive material online. She added: It shouldn't be up to the taxpayer to fund the mechanisms by which this content is removed, which is currently the case. It should be up to the platforms. There is sufficient artificial intelligence for them to make a huge impression, and the fact that most of them don't is highly irresponsible, which is why we intend to bring in legislation to control it.'</p><p>Mr Hancock also attacked social media firms, revealing that just four in 14 invited companies attended his recent summit on the issue.</p><p>He said sites such as Musical.ly have more than one million British users but failed to take part in the conference, adding: The fact that only four companies turned up when I invited the 14 biggest gave me a big impetus to drive this proposal to legislate through.'</p><p>He said he prevented his three young children from using social media, and was struck by how many technology bosses do the same.</p><p>\u00f7 Children's charities have joined forces to urge the Government to regulate social media to protect young people from abuse.</p><p>The Children's Charities Coalition of Internet Safety is demanding a mandatory safety code backed by an independent regulator. The coalition said: Self regulation has failed. Safeguarding children online should never be an optional extra.'</p><p>\u00a9 Daily Mail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCD-82Y1-DYTG-420J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138794</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

facing up to\" the problem of harm caused by social media. </p><p>\"One particularly startling finding was that the percentage of children experiencing mental health issues more than doubles among youngsters who spend three or more hours per day on social media compared to those who aren't signed up to these sites,\" he said. </p><p>\"Add to this the prevalence of body-shaming online, a deeply worrying 46% of girls who responded found that social media had a negative impact on their self-esteem.\" </p><p>The call for tougher action on social media giants follows an outcry over the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017. </p><p>After her death, her Instagram account was found to contain self-harm related material, and her parents have suggested new laws may be needed to combat exposure to suicide and depression-focused content. </p><p>Pointing to her case, Mr Elmore warned: \"I fear that this experience online is not atypical and highlights the very real dangers out there to young and impressionable people. </p><p>\"For me, tragedies like Molly's underline exactly why it's vital the government takes real and meaningful action to get to grips with the crisis unfolding online, but away from the eyes of parents and politicians - it is a scandal hiding in plain site.\" </p><p>The group has also urged ministers to set up a new 'Social Media Health Alliance' to carry out detailed research and establish \"clear new guidance\" on social media use. </p><p>They want the new initiative to be funded with a 0.5% levy on the profits of social media companies. </p><p>\"It's essential that we urgently commission robust research into the impact social media is having on our young people and review whether it warrants being classified as an official disease,\" Mr Elmore said. </p><p>\"Just as with other addictions - cigarettes, alcohol, gambling or drugs - we need to realise that while a scroll through Facebook might not have any apparent physical effects, the damage it can do to someone's mental health must not be underestimated.\" </p><p>A government spokesperson said: \"The Government will soon publish a white paper which will set out the responsibilities of online platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not. </p><p>\"An internet regulator, statutory 'duty of care' on platforms, and a levy on social media companies are all measures we are considering as part of our work.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

President Trump calling that activism of social media firms one of the greatest threats to free speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly.</p><p>A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States.</p><p>Unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide or alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences. There is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction, and that includes individual people controlling vast amounts of territory and we can't allow that to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: There has never been a more powerful and successful user of social media than President Donald Trump, and it is no small irony that he has been forced by Twitter to take on social media's extraordinary power to constrain, to intervene, and even the actions and words of a Chief Executive of this country.</p><p>We'll have more on the President's Executive Order in just a few moments. We'll be joined shortly by F.C.C. Commissioner Brendan Carr, as we take up the issue of freedom of speech and particularly, the President's freedom of speech.</p><p>President Trump just moments ago also weighing in on the unrest in Minneapolis -- the unrest, the rioting -- and city leaders today, making emotional pleas for peace in the streets, as the city is bracing for a third straight night of protest, demonstrations, and yes, violence.</p><p>The City's Mayor went so far as to ask Governor Tim Walz to deploy the National Guard, after those protests became violent last night.</p><p>Buildings set on fire, demonstrators ransacking businesses, a full-on riot and looting. The unrest in the city sparked by the videotaped killing of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed Monday by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck for several minutes, and he died.</p><p>Allegedly, he used a fake $20.00 bill at the grocery store and the police were trying to apprehend him.</p><p>Four officers involved in Floyd's arrest have been fired. None of them have been arrested or charged with his death.</p><p>President Trump has asked the F.B.I. and the Justice Department to speed up their investigation into Floyd's death, and he says justice will be served.</p><p>For the latest developments, we turn now to Fox News senior correspondent, Mike Tobin, in Minneapolis -- Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Lou. Behind me, you can see a lot of the aftermath of this violent night in Minneapolis. This is area around the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct which has become a flashpoint because that was the precinct from which the officers were dispatched involved in this incident.</p><p>You're looking at the aftermath of the AutoZone store. We watched as his store was torched last night. The witnesses say the demonstrators put in a box of fireworks and set that off. Of course, there's all sorts of flammable things inside the AutoZone and as people tried to put it out, the protesters pelted them with bottles and other things to dissuade them.</p><p>What you're looking at right now is the Third Precinct itself, and this standoff issue, if you will, has been mounting now for hours and growing in number.</p><p>What you see is the crowd of protesters out on Lake and Minnehaha in the intersection there and their numbers are growing, what is often, the distance a little harder to see is a row of police officers in their riot gear, truncheons and non-lethal weaponry at the ready and what they're doing is preventing the demonstrators from getting up into the Third Precinct.</p><p>And that's where they draw the line and that's where the conflict is. That's where it all went down last night.</p><p>The numbers are growing. You mentioned that police are bracing for another night of demonstrations, which if you see, as you have seen have turned up pretty destructive ultimately, and tonight seems like it will be no exception -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Mike, the violence that we witnessed. We've even heard some news organizations being cautioned by their editorial management not to use the word rioting. Those were people rioting on the video that I saw. They were people who were looting and committing arson.</p><p>Are they prepared for a repeat of that? And will they, as they did last night, the law enforcement officers, will they be withdrawing and simply allowing the rioting to continue without constraint?</p><p>TOBIN: Well, the police have not tipped their hand as far as what they want to do. But it seems pretty clear that they don't want to repeat the mistakes that we saw in Ferguson, with police coming out with a heavy hand trying to beat down the crowd and getting very much the opposite reaction of what they saw.</p><p>Because what you have here, by and large, what we've heard from the demonstrators on the street, is that they want justice, but the justice isn't coming fast enough, and they don't trust the people in charge.</p><p>But the overall theme is simply that they are angry. They're frustrated with the system and what we see is that they're lashing out.</p><p>That being said, when you say -- when you hear these terms like a mostly peaceful riot. Well, John Gotti was mostly peaceful. It's a bit of an oxymoron. If it was violent at all, it was violent. If there was destruction at all, there was destruction.</p><p>And that's what we saw out here. But also when you see the police come out, you always see a push back. So, I think the police have drawn the line as far as what they will do. In fact, the Police Chief has made it very clear, there are certain lines that they are not going to allow people to cross.</p><p>They're not going to allow them to get at the vehicles because there's weaponry inside of the vehicles. They're not going to allow them to get inside the Third Precinct because that would be giving up some very, very important ground.</p><p>But beyond that, you don't really see a police presence out here on the street because where there's police presence, you get friction --Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Mike, thank you very much. It is extraordinary and there are no charges at this point. It is a difficult and troubled time obviously in Minneapolis. Thank you very much. Mike Tobin is always doing his usual great job of reporting.</p><p>Protests over George Floyd's death, his killing, taking place in Southern California as well let by Black Lives Matter activists.</p><p>Several hundred demonstrators blocked the 101 Freeway. They vandalized California Highway Patrol vehicles. The protest then moved downtown, an American flag there was set on fire.</p><p>Well, the top story tonight, President Trump's Executive Order that has just been issued on social media.</p><p>The President's order empowers the F.C.C. to review Section 230 as it's called of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that gives social media platforms protection, allowing them to post content on their forums as they see fit.</p><p>This order also will forward complaints of bias filed with the White House over to the F.T.C. and the order will pull taxpayer dollars from social media platforms that engage in censorship.</p><p>Well, joining us now to assess this in its early moments, the order having just been signed by the President, Brendan Carr, Commissioner of the F.C.C. He previously served as the F.C.C.'s General Counsel.</p><p>Brendan, let me start with this order. Your reaction to the President's understandable frustration and his response in the form of this Executive Order?</p><p>BRENDAN CARR, COMMISSIONER, F.C.C.: Thanks, Lou. This is really welcome news. Look, since the 2016 election, the far left has hopped from hoax to hoax to hoax to explain how it lost to President Trump at the ballot box.</p><p>One thing they've done is look to social media platforms. They put pressure on them for the crime in their view of staying neutral in the 2016 election, and they're committed to not letting these platforms stay neutral in the run up to 2020.</p><p>So, this step by President Trump shines a light on some of that activity and tees up some steps that can be taken.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you use the word neutral with quotes of facetiousness around it because those social media platforms are anything but neutral as we know.</p><p>Google, for example, in its platforms, decidedly are making a choice in the election to be as about as anti-Trump as one could imagine.</p><p>And this nonsense coming from Jack Dorsey, the founder and CEO of Twitter to say that some of the comments that have been made, saying his approach does not make Twitter an arbiter of truth.</p><p>Facebook's Zuckerberg saying that he doesn't want his platform to pretend to be such, accusing, effectively Twitter of doing so.</p><p>It's ridiculous that some of the comments that have resulted from the Twitter folks trying to explain their idiotic attempts to limit this free speech of the President of the United States. It cannot be condoned rational, can it?</p><p>CARR: Look, Twitter made the decision to take on the President of the United States in a partisan political debate. It did so in really a disingenuous way. It got its facts wrong. It tried to challenge the President's assertion that when you have massive mail-in ballots, there's going to naturally be voter fraud.</p><p>There's no authority higher than Jerry Nadler who made that exact same point.</p><p>We also see it with Facebook, they stood up this new oversight board, and they stacked it with really people that are emotionally viscerally against the President, Pam Carlin is on that board. You may remember that she was famous for testifying in favor of impeachment of the President and had that infamous Trump -- Barron Trump -- Barron line.</p><p>Look, if you were to hand pick a group to tilt an election against the incumbent President, I don't think it would look much different than the oversight board that Facebook has put together.</p><p>So, I think this Executive Order is welcome news including calling the Federal Trade Commission. Look, if you're any other type of business, and you represent to Congress and the public that you're a neutral platform and you engage in some of the conduct that we're seeing, you'd be held liable for an unfair business practice at that point.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the President served notice, more than sufficient notice that he was not going to be trifled with by Big Tech pencil neck geeks, in the form of one particular, Jack Dorsey who has tried to become his nemesis in Silicon Valley and as of yesterday, had succeeded.</p><p>I don't think he probably likes the position he now finds himself in. Your thoughts about how this will unwind? How it will move from here.</p><p>CARR: Here's what's really important about the President's Executive Order. Everybody has free speech, First Amendment rights. What's different about these platforms that Congress in the 1990s afforded them a very special and unique legal liability in protection that all other political actors don't enjoy.</p><p>And that maybe made sense when you had the Prodigy Messaging Board that was in Congress's mind. But flash forward 20 years, these are now the largest, most powerful corporations when it comes to speech.</p><p>So, I think it's entirely appropriate for the President to say, is it time to take another look at Section 230, and whether that makes sense given where we are today.</p><p>DOBBS: And it clearly does not make sense given the awesome power of these social media platforms and these Big Tech corporations.</p><p>I assume that we will see that redress. There will be countervailing influences at work over the next months.</p><p>We appreciate it. Brendan Carr, F.C.C. Commissioner, thanks so much.</p><p>Breaking news now, 38 RINOs in the House of Representatives today, apparently would prefer President Trump not be elected. They sent him a letter urging him not to restrict temporary work visas.</p><p>The group is led by Maryland Congressman, Andy Harris. It also includes Congressman Lee Zeldin, Elise Stefanik, Chris Stewart, Peter King, of course. They join nine RINO senators who sent a similar letter to the President yesterday.</p><p>Their letter coming the same day we learned of another 2.1 million Americans filing for unemployment benefit. The total number now 41 million Americans since mid-March applying for unemployment benefits.</p><p>These are not only economically ignorant people, but they are in point of fact, know nothing about economics.</p><p>When the unemployment rate is near at least 15 percent, 40 million Americans out of work, for these RINOs in the Senate and the House to have the temerity to tell the President to abandon all hope of reelection and bring in more foreign workers in the face of 40 million unemployed Americans is absolutely obscene.</p><p>I would invite every one of their constituents to reject them at the polls. They are ignorant. They are indifferent to the national security, and yes, the fate of 40 million unemployed Americans. This is outrageous.</p><p>Up next, Communist China moving to end Hong Kong's independence, its freedoms. How will President Trump respond?</p><p>We take up that very question right after this break. Former State Department's Senior Adviser Christian Whiton with us. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news. The Chinese Communist Party has officially voted to impose new legislation on Hong Kong. It makes it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority.</p><p>The effect of that legislation is to remove Hong Kong's last vestiges of independence and eliminate individual freedoms for Hong Kong residents.</p><p>President Trump today in the Oval Office didn't comment on that vote, but he did have harsh words for China's handling of the Wuhan virus and he suggested there will be a major announcement tomorrow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It's a really sad situation. It should have never happened. China should have stopped it at the source. But they didn't do that.</p><p>And tomorrow we're going to be having a press conference on China. So, we'll be making certain decisions and we'll be discussing them tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The White House plans to cancel visas for thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers who are in the United States who are directly affiliated with the People's Liberation Army.</p><p>This move, part of a new effort to curtail the number of Chinese students who can receive visas to study in this country.</p><p>Since 2013, China has spent nearly a billion dollars' worth of gifts and contracts to U.S. universities, and during the 2018-2019 school year, there were more than 369,000 Chinese nationals studying in U.S. universities and colleges.</p><p>Well, joining us tonight to take up China, the policy future of the relationship between the two countries, Christian Whiton, Senior Fellow at the Center for the National Interest, former State Department Senior Adviser in the Trump and George W. Bush administrations.</p><p>First, Christian, good to have you with us. Hong Kong is a fait accompli. It is no longer -- there is no -- not even a pretense of independence and individual freedoms are a thing of the past. What will be the impact?</p><p>CHRISTIAN WHITON, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST: The impact as you point, I mean, I think the impact is that it reinforces that the Chinese Communist Party just doesn't keep its agreement. This was part of a solemn agreement with the United Kingdom that was part of the deal to get Hong Kong back.</p><p>The Brits only had to give back part of the territory. They didn't have to give it all back. To get it all back, they agreed to a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years, and that was enrolled at the United Nations. This is an international agreement.</p><p>So, it's just the next one in a long list of agreements the Chinese government has welched on, which, frankly, is something we ought to keep in mind. They certainly have already broken a number of the agreements we have, but they're also probably, in fact, they're definitely breaking the Phase 1 Trade Deal that the ink is still barely dry on. This is something they signed in January.</p><p>It's just an important reminder that going forward for anyone who still needs to learn this lesson that you cannot trust the Chinese government.</p><p>DOBBS: You cannot, and there is -- I'm trying to think of one example in which they have honored an agreement, a treaty with a Western nation. None comes to mind.</p><p>And this President is not likely to put up with this kind of conduct on the part of the Chinese. Can he change their conduct? No, but he can certainly change ours in the way in which we interact with the Chinese.</p><p>Do you believe that decoupling, ending the commercial relationship between the two nations is at hand?</p><p>WHITON: I do. I'm not sure if the President is there yet. As you point out, they're thinking of some strong measures. The one you mentioned about stopping and giving all these visas to Chinese.</p><p>You know, the theory used to be okay, they would come here, they would breathe the sweet air of freedom. They would love America and they would go back to China and spread democracy.</p><p>That hasn't been the case. That just doesn't work out possibly, because our universities which are happy to take all of this foreign money, happy to give these spots to Chinese rather than to Americans.</p><p>DOBBS: Exactly.</p><p>WHITON: And, you know, they do this. They basically export all of the knowledge that we give them rather than contributing it to the American economy. You know, so I think you'll see steps like that, but I don't think the President is quite ready to decouple.</p><p>I think he will start with the pharmaceutical supply chain, medical protective equipment so we are never reliant on China again, and other manufacturing high tech stuff. You've seen export controls on semiconductor companies and now --</p><p>DOBBS: Christian, I think about all the ways in which we are dependent on China and frankly, they are just obscenely, obscenely stupid leadership of this country over the course of the previous three Presidents to put us in a dependent position.</p><p>The world's only superpower -- it is criminal what Presidents in both political parties have done over that time that leaves us vulnerable to Communist Chinese authoritarians, who right now have a very strong grip on this country's pharmaceuticals.</p><p>We're dependent for rare earths. Our production facilities. It's in large measure because we've given Wall Street, corporate America and the Chamber of (horrors) or Commerce if you prefer such leverage over the legislation and public policy of this country for so long.</p><p>WHITON: Yes. And that, unfortunately still continues. You are seeing a change on Capitol Hill where some not all, but some of Congress is following President Trump's lead. And you have people in both parties thinking about ways to get tough on China.</p><p>But the number of institutions you just listed, Wall Street, I mean, you have people like Bob Zoellick still out there spinning the same tale they have been spinning since 2000, when we made the mistake of letting China into the World Trade Organization saying, oh, we need, we can't isolate China. We can't decouple. All of these things we can't do.</p><p>All of these myths that have been exposed over the last two decades that still lives on in Hollywood and Wall Street, and in particular academia, which you just talked about, where again, they're happy to educate Chinese students, and they're less interested in educating Americans, which is the reason they have tax exempt status in all of this money in the first place.</p><p>So, you know, there's still some work to do, but thankfully, this is the closest thing you'll get to a bipartisan issue in Washington.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it'll be interesting to see the President's statements tomorrow on the U.S.-China relationship.</p><p>Christian, we thank you very much. Christian Whiton, good to see you.</p><p>We'll have more on the President's reaction to China in this evening's broadcast. We'll be talking with the Hudson Institute's Michael Pillsbury here, next, stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Senator Ron Johnson is asking for the power to issue subpoenas on Obamagate. Senator Johnson has scheduled a June 4th vote for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that he chairs that is the same day after former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Chair Lindsey Graham.</p><p>Well, Attorney General Bill Barr is now tapping Texas based U.S. Attorney John Bash. He has been assigned to take a deeper look at the unmasking of former National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn.</p><p>Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec discussed the boundaries of that investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KERRI KUPEC, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN: We know that unmasking inherently isn't wrong, but certainly, the frequency, the motivation and the reasoning behind unmasking can be problematic.</p><p>And when you're looking at unmasking as part of a broader investigation, like John Durham's investigation, looking specifically at who was unmasking whom can add a lot to our understanding about motivation and big picture events.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us now is Lee Smith. Lee is the author of \"The Plot against the President.\" He joins us to take up what is the ever expanding revelations of the biggest political scandal in our country's history.</p><p>Let's start with the Attorney General Barr assigning Bash to go after the unmasking. Does this portend good things or bad for those who would like to see justice done?</p><p>LEE SMITH, AUTHOR: No, I think it's a very good thing, Lou. I think what it means is that, look, one of the things that the unmasking has shown us is that this was administration wide.</p><p>We've been looking at the FISA abuse scandal for so long, which focuses mostly on the F.B.I., but what we saw when acting, who is right not now Acting Director D.N.I., Richard Grenell declassified this list of people who unmasked General Flynn, this went across the administration, including the White House.</p><p>What it shows is, is that the Obama administration promoted a culture of espionage, and that's what the unmasking shows, so thank goodness that the Attorney General has appointed someone to focus on this because again, the scandal -- it's not just the investigation. You know, we have the larger of the scandal gats.</p><p>DOBBS: Now, Lee, I could put up with a culture of espionage at the Justice Department and the F.B.I., what I can't put up with is a corrupt culture of political activism and a President who presided over an administration that spied on a presidential candidate, tried to block -- tried to block his election, and then when he was elected, tried to overthrow him. That's what I can't put up with.</p><p>I'm not sure I call that a culture, I call that a bunch of damn politically corrupt creeps.</p><p>SMITH: Right. It's absolutely disgusting, and again, the important thing I think as well, Attorney General Barr said about a week and a half ago, he said that he believes the investigation is not going to be pointing at President Obama and Vice President Biden.</p><p>However, again, the unmasking list shows this is what's going on inside the White House. The President's Chief of staff, Denis McDonough was doing.</p><p>Also very importantly, the guy, the Intelligence official who gave Obama his presidential daily briefing asked for the unmasking, so I, 100 percent agree and again, once we see this went to the Treasury Department, Obama's Ambassador to Italy and San Marino was unmasking General Flynn's name.</p><p>This is a terrible thing.</p><p>DOBBS: He sent over his Chief of Staff to become Treasury Secretary, sent over Jack Lew to run it, to manage the I.R.S. for crying out loud amongst other agencies. There's not much subtlety in what they did or why.</p><p>Let's turn if we may to Ron Johnson seeking subpoena power. Why in the world doesn't he have it already? Why in the world isn't the investigation moving at a breakneck speed? I'm not suggesting in any way that I'm not delighted that Senator Johnson has had that guts to stand up and go after these issues.</p><p>SMITH: Senator Johnson has done a fantastic job. He is one of the one, unfortunately, very few Republicans in the Senate who has done a good job.</p><p>Remember that Senator Johnson was the one who put out the Strzok-Page text messages, and so that really -- that gave a lot of important information to the American public, and I assume that they will get subpoena power, and thank goodness that Senator Johnson is moving forward in the Senate to provide more necessary information to the American public, especially while we're waiting as Mr. Durham's investigation unfolds.</p><p>DOBBS: Lee Smith, as always, good to have you with us. Thanks so much. I look forward to seeing you again soon.</p><p>Up next, the medical establishment in Washington refuses to find the truth about the origins of the deadly Wuhan virus. They do have a lot of nonsense dispute, and the way, aren't these guys supposed to believe in science?</p><p>Michael Pillsbury, one of the country's leading authorities on China. He joins us to take up what happens next with China. What should we do? We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: \"The New York Times\" has issued a correction, but no apology for a complete and total fabrication, perhaps a lie.</p><p>A medical team in a New York City Hospital telling the paper about a 26- year-old emergency room doctor who died of the Wuhan virus, except that's not true. The doctor didn't die.</p><p>The paper blamed the medical team saying it was a case of mistaken identity. How about that? Fake news? Perhaps.</p><p>Well, breaking news, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins says there's no way of knowing if the Wuhan virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. By the way, Australian researchers were quoted just a week ago, saying point blank, that there is every evidence of man-made manipulation of the virus. So, that really is quite a curious contradiction, isn't it?</p><p>So, the Wuhan Virology Lab still is the epicenter of the deadly contagion.</p><p>Joining us now is Dr. Michael Pillsbury and Dr. Michael Pillsbury is the foremost in the minds of most leading experts on China in the country. He is also the Director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, author of \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\"</p><p>Mike, great to have you with us. I think it is really interesting that we have a the N.I.H. Director Collins, who says has to say that it wasn't a man-made virus with absolutely no science to support it, while virologists and researchers in Australia says there's every evidence of it being a man- made manipulated virus.</p><p>What do you make of this unseemly effort to go beyond science in fact, to offer the public conclusions? It looks suspicious to those of us who are skeptics.</p><p>DR. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY, THE HUDSON INSTITUTE: Yes, it looks more like politics than science. I think the larger picture, Lou, is that a lot of our Federal government departments, almost all of them, including N.I.H. and C.D.C. have programs to help China. They're deeply embedded with the assistance to China Program that was set up by Jimmy Carter. That was awfully a long time ago.</p><p>So, N.I.H. in particular has very close contact and friendships with the Chinese, so they naturally tend to be defensive. As soon as this horrible story about the possible escape from the lab, or worse, was taking place, a lot of scientists including Dr. Fauci, they immediately jumped to the defense of China long before they knew the facts.</p><p>So today's revelation seems to be we really don't know what happened in Wuhan. I would have thought Dr. Fauci had said that back in January, don't you?</p><p>DOBBS: Indeed, he, at that time was not even acknowledging that the Chinese were refusing to admit American doctors and researchers into Wuhan to study both the virus and the contagion that had been unleashed.</p><p>I want to turn to Hong Kong now, assured half century of independence and autonomy that turned out to be a very short century and the legislation today from Beijing, if you can call it legislation, it's really an order -- removing Hong Kong's independence and individual freedoms are no more. Your thoughts?</p><p>PILLSBURY: I wouldn't go so far as to say their freedoms are no more or that independence was promised. They were promised a high degree of autonomy, their own judicial system, a whole set -- there is a very specific list of majors, list of what was being protected in Hong Kong until at least 2047. That was agreed to the British with our support, filed this as a treaty with the U.N.</p><p>So, what we're looking at, Lou, if this law is going to be as bad as it I'm afraid it's going to be. We're looking at a treaty violation by China, of a treaty with the British on top of the violation of the International Health Regulations Treaty back in January.</p><p>So, we're looking at major treaty violations and usually with international law that requires sanction by other countries.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, sanctions are no longer considered particularly effective. We've had sanctions against Russia for years. There's been very little deterioration in their ability to be expansive and aggressive on the world stage.</p><p>We have had sanctions against Iran as they proceed toward becoming a nuclear power, unchecked; constrained but unchecked. The sanctions are seemingly, to me, the stuff of very, very cautious, careful people who really don't know what else to do.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I'm not talking about that kind of sanctions. I'm talking about not about pinpricks or slap on the wrist, I'm talking about going after the sources of Chinese power, and the misconduct by China.</p><p>You'll find this laid out in President Trump's book in 2015. He has a section of, actually quite profound, even speaking as a China expert myself, I was very impressed.</p><p>He said, there's a bad China. He listed all the features of the bad China. And then they said there's a good China. Our goal as Americans is to move them from bad China to good China. That they're both in there.</p><p>So, going after the sources of Chinese power, that's much bigger than sanctions, Lou. That means going after the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. It means going after the capital markets and --</p><p>DOBBS: So you're talking --</p><p>PILLSBURY: These are more far more serious --</p><p>DOBBS: So you're talking about -- you're talking about soft power. You're talking about going after their Communist Party, you're talking about going after their leadership, sowing discord and hopefully unrest and the overthrow of their government, all of that?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes. It's Reagan's approach to the Soviet Union in the early 80s that he laid out the kind of Soviet Union we want or a Russia that we want.</p><p>President Trump already foreshadowed that four or five years ago. I think the Chinese -- I get a lot of these comments from the Chinese media and speaking to Chinese by phone, Lou, they are afraid President Trump is going to do just that, go after the sources of their power.</p><p>This is not some idea that Americans in Congress necessarily have. This is the Chinese fear of what President Trump might do to them.</p><p>So, they would be watching very carefully tomorrow. We might just start with a small step tomorrow, but I think there's more to come.</p><p>DOBBS: Dr. Pillsbury, wait just a moment. We're going to have to take a quick break. We'll come back with you as we talk about in specifics, what are their two top fears? And how can we realize -- how can we make their nightmares come true? We'll be back with Michael Pillsbury in just a moment. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The European Union has launched an internal review into a leak they exposed about how they bowed to pressure from the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>An April report from the European Union about China's handling of the Wuhan virus left out a reference to China's global disinformation campaign. That reference, however, had been included in an earlier internal report leaked to \"The New York Times.\" This is the sort of thing that they fascinate itself about.</p><p>We're back with Dr. Michael Pillsbury, this business of the European Union, the U.K., basically bowing to China. We are seeing more and more. This looks like the disinformation campaign launched by the Chinese aggressively with the onset of this Wuhan has paid dividends for them.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I think that's right, Lou. I think it's time the Europeans fought back. One of the things President Trump has done is initiate a unit inside the State Department called the Global Engagement Operation.</p><p>They not only collect Chinese lies and disinformation, they counteract it with the media. The Europeans are talking about that and doing that right now. But we're way behind in the European response.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, that condition normal, I think is what we would have to say to that. Thank goodness the United States is responding aggressively.</p><p>In that respect, how aggressively can we respond the two greatest fears of China? What are our two strongest responses to those fears? What can we do to most hurt the Chinese?</p><p>PILLSBURY: It's a very important question and you find that in Donald Trump's \"Art of the Deal,\" you'll find he discusses there is a lot in his real estate deals.</p><p>You want to know what the other side wants the most and what they fear the most, and that sets the basis of your negotiations.</p><p>The Chinese fear the most two things. They fear that the Communist Party of China will be targeted and will go the way of the Soviet Communist Party. They write a lot about this. They sometimes fantasize that Hong Kong is the beachhead of this operation, that is why they are cracking down on Hong Kong.</p><p>Their second fear is in --</p><p>DOBBS: What can we do to speed there -- what can we do to speed that reality up? The Communist Party's dissolution from Beijing?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, we've got to take -- it's got to become a goal of official U.S. policy toward China. Right now, it was not in the 16-page document last week.</p><p>It's kind of become a goal the way it was with President Reagan. The Communist Party of China is not good for the Chinese people. They've got internal factions, and frankly, they could break up into two parties, the hardliners against the reformers. I think that would be a good thing.</p><p>DOBBS: But what is this -- what is the second?</p><p>PILLSBURY: ... China right now has a $50 million program. They can greatly expand that program.</p><p>DOBBS: And what is the second thing that we could do?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Oh, they fear encirclement. They believe that their neighbors together have far greater military power and economic power than China. Right now, there is no coalition against China.</p><p>There's a talk about coordinating measures, but basically, the structure we have to create, an Indo-Pacific sort of Secretariat and coalition agreements that hasn't been started yet.</p><p>I think the President is thinking about this as something he can do if Joe Biden is not put in by the Chinese. The Chinese fear right now, the third fear really, is that there'll be a real election of Donald J. Trump and their dream that Biden takes over the White House will go up in smoke.</p><p>DOBBS: And as we wrap up here, Mike. India and China, a border dispute long running, but both sides sending more military to that border. Give us your assessment of the possibility of a serious flare up.</p><p>PILLSBURY: It's getting dangerous, Lou. I'm glad the President offered to mediate between India and China last week. It's getting quite dangerous. The Indians wanted to build a road on their territory, or what's called Eastern Ladakh. The Chinese are blocking that.</p><p>They have not actually crossed deep into India, but they're close to it. In fact, they've crossed it in some points. So, this is the cause of war sometimes.</p><p>They're both nuclear armed powers. They both have major Navies. So, we're talking about something in which President Trump has offered to mediate, it may have been a very good idea.</p><p>DOBBS: All right. Dr. Michael Pillsbury, as always, instructive. Thanks so much. We appreciate it. I look forward to talking with you soon. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: On Wall Street today, stocks finishing lower. The Dow Jones Industrials fell 148 points. The S&amp;P lost six. The NASDAQ fell 43 points. Volume on the big board, 5.4 billion shares.</p><p>Crude oil up more than two percent, $33.62 a barrel.</p><p>2.1 million Americans filing for jobless claim benefits last week. That brings the total to more than 41 million since the Wuhan virus was declared a global pandemic.</p><p>The Treasury Department also setting aside $10 billion to help disadvantaged communities during the pandemic.</p><p>A reminder to listen to my reports three times a day, coast-to-coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>President Trump today signed a new Executive Order. It calls for new regulations on social media platforms. The President says the political bias of those platforms is a threat to the freedom of speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: What they choose to fact check and what they choose to ignore or even promote is nothing more than a political activism group or political activism, and it's inappropriate. You look at what's happened, if you look at where they're going, where they're coming from, I think you all see it yourselves.</p><p>This censorship and bias is a threat to freedom itself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And that's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us. Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton and Pete Hegseth with a new book joins us tomorrow, as does Pastor Robert Jeffress among our guests. We hope you'll join us.</p><p>A reminder to follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, Facebook and Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.

A sea of jeans, untucked shirts and the occasional blazer made the 2017 event feel very \"tech\" - mainly because it was. And therein lay the problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech events that just attract swathes of tech types are echo chambers. It's a shame, really, because there is something brilliant and borderline utopian about a sector where doing business can be casual, relaxed and laid back.</p><p>But when it comes to real estate, that's just not realistic. Not yet, anyway. Maybe not ever. And that is why the army of suits at this year's event was one of the most encouraging sights I have seen to date at any proptech event. Not because I am a huge advocate of such overt formality, but because it marked a massive sea change and one many have been waiting years to see. The real estate sector was there - loud and proud.</p><p>I am not talking about a few forward-thinkers sprinkled here and there, as has been the case at these events for a while now. I mean really there, out in force. And they weren't just talking about tech; they were talking about investing in tech.</p><p>From Brookfield to Blackstone and from PGIM to RXR, the venue was bursting at the seams with real estate's biggest players. Those suits changed the whole atmosphere - and not in the way many might assume. Far from bringing proceedings down, conversations, debates and meetings took on a new and powerful momentum. For the tech companies, bumping into Brookfield's head of innovation, PGIM's global investment director or the chairman of Lennar International at the coffee station is in a different league from an (albeit pleasant) catch-up with the posse of fellow start-ups they already know. It works both ways, of course, and the tech attendees were just as impressive: Edge Technologies, Zillow, the executive director of Tech NYC, to name a few.</p><p>Events such as this are the first steps towards the stuff of proptech dreams. A real meeting of two sectors trying to understand each other and work together. So congratulations to MIPIM, Aaron Block and Metaprop for one of the most successful gap-bridging exercises I have seen to date. It is a step that needs to be taken to move forward, and one I am sure many in the tech world would agree is worth an influx of traditional business attire. But it does raise other questions that can't be ignored.</p><p>Too uniform?</p><p>Social media following this year's Expo conference was awash with comments on the blue suit, white shirt and tie \"property uniform\". Traditional real estate is still criticised for being exclusive, elitist and rigid in its outlook and (rightly or wrongly) there is no escaping the fact that certain sartorial choices have a part to play in fuelling that image. So, there is a flip side to the encouraging ocean of suits at this week's New York tech event. As we work so hard to move away from real estate's male, pale and stale reputation, is there a danger that as property starts to fully embrace tech - a sector known for being more alternative and inclusive than many - it could become overly formalised and watered down?</p><p>Metaprop's Aaron Block addressed this issue head on in his opening keynote. \"We still have an inclusivity issue,\" he said. \"We need to act now. If we wait three or four years to address problems that look like me, it will be too late. Set goals around diversity and inclusion. Even if you don't meet them, you should have them.\"</p><p>But even more powerful was a keynote speech by Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech NYC. A former lawyer, she is now firmly entrenched in the tech world - jeans and all - but she was quick to give the conference a reality check. Tech is already being formalised. This doesn't mean stamping on creativity and forcing every tech founder into a shirt and tie; but the time has come to get serious.</p><p>\"The last generation of really big tech companies was built in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Regulators weren't paying attention. Competitors weren't paying attention. Those days are gone. You can't build a tech company now without people noticing very quickly and you need to know how to navigate thorny situations like handling competitors and regulators. It's serious stuff now.</p><p>\"Those days of being in a vacuum were good for what they were.

Not yet, anyway. Maybe not ever. And that is why the army of suits at this year's event was one of the most encouraging sights I have seen to date at any proptech event. Not because I am a huge advocate of such overt formality, but because it marked a massive sea change and one many have been waiting years to see. The real estate sector was there - loud and proud.</p><p>I am not talking about a few forward-thinkers sprinkled here and there, as has been the case at these events for a while now.

Those suits changed the whole atmosphere - and not in the way many might assume. Far from bringing proceedings down, conversations, debates and meetings took on a new and powerful momentum. For the tech companies, bumping into Brookfield's head of innovation, PGIM's global investment director or the chairman of Lennar International at the coffee station is in a different league from an (albeit pleasant) catch-up with the posse of fellow start-ups they already know. It works both ways, of course, and the tech attendees were just as impressive: Edge Technologies, Zillow, the executive director of Tech NYC, to name a few.</p><p>Events such as this are the first steps towards the stuff of proptech dreams. A real meeting of two sectors trying to understand each other and work together. So congratulations to MIPIM, Aaron Block and Metaprop for one of the most successful gap-bridging exercises I have seen to date. It is a step that needs to be taken to move forward, and one I am sure many in the tech world would agree is worth an influx of traditional business attire. But it does raise other questions that can't be ignored.</p><p>Too uniform?</p><p>Social media following this year's Expo conference was awash with comments on the blue suit, white shirt and tie \"property uniform\". Traditional real estate is still criticised for being exclusive, elitist and rigid in its outlook and (rightly or wrongly) there is no escaping the fact that certain sartorial choices have a part to play in fuelling that image. So, there is a flip side to the encouraging ocean of suits at this week's New York tech event. As we work so hard to move away from real estate's male, pale and stale reputation, is there a danger that as property starts to fully embrace tech - a sector known for being more alternative and inclusive than many - it could become overly formalised and watered down?</p><p>Metaprop's Aaron Block addressed this issue head on in his opening keynote. \"We still have an inclusivity issue,\" he said. \"We need to act now. If we wait three or four years to address problems that look like me, it will be too late. Set goals around diversity and inclusion. Even if you don't meet them, you should have them.\"</p><p>But even more powerful was a keynote speech by Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech NYC. A former lawyer, she is now firmly entrenched in the tech world - jeans and all - but she was quick to give the conference a reality check. Tech is already being formalised. This doesn't mean stamping on creativity and forcing every tech founder into a shirt and tie; but the time has come to get serious.</p><p>\"The last generation of really big tech companies was built in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Regulators weren't paying attention.

But as regulation and competition cranks up, for these more laissez-faire start-ups there has never been a better time to have the experience of a seasoned real estate firm in their corner.</p><p>If a dedicated drive towards true inclusivity and diversity across the board becomes the umbrella principle that holds these two sectors together, then that brilliant, borderline utopia might be closer than we think.</p><p>To send feedback, e-mail <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:emily.wright@egi.co.uk\">emily.wright@egi.co.uk</email> or tweet @EmilyW_9 or @estatesgazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TPH-KBN1-JCF2-H00G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Reed Business Information Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Estates Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33631\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 10, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Law Reviews &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>MIPIM Proptech New York: The army of suits is a good thing</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000749</classCode><className>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001743</classCode><className>TRADE SHOWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001455</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A2W7</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

David Kris[2] unpacks a new Executive Order[3] restricting purchases of foreign equipment for the grid. As with all these measures, China is the unspoken target.Nick Weaver[4], meanwhile, explains the remarkable extent of surveillance built into Xiaomi phones[5] and questions the company's claim[6] that it was merely acquiring pseudonymous ad-related data like others in the industry.It wouldn't be the Cyberlaw Podcast if we didn't wrangle over using mobile phones to combat the coronavirus. Mark MacCarthy[7] says that several countries- Australia[8], the UK[9], and perhaps France - are deviating from the Gapple model for contact tracing. </p><p>Several others, though, have bought in. India[10], meanwhile, is planning a much more government-driven approach[11] to using phone apps to deal with the pandemic.Mark ventures into even more contested territory in response to an article in The Atlantic by Jack Goldsmith and Andrew Woods[12], who argue that China has won the debate with John Perry Barlow over whether the Internet will be a force for free speech. Mark and I more or less agree, which sends me off on a rant about the growing self-confidence and ham-handedness of Big Tech as they get comfortable in their role[13] as Guardians of What You Can't Say on the Internet. Things you can't say include plausible arguments about the still highly unsettled question of how best to deal with COVID-19 and descriptions of treatment options[14] that have been entertained by President Trump without establishment approval, not to mention \"unverified\" statements[15] (not, notably, false ones) that could cause \"social unrest.\" Just reading such things, it turns out, will lead at least Facebook to track you down and tell you[16] that it knows what you did and wants to correct your flirtation with thoughtcrime - a practice that earned it praise from Rep. Adam Schiff.Nick and I note the difficulty Facebook is having getting out of FOSTA cases in Texas[17], and I ask why FOSTA hasn't already spelled doom for end-to-end encryption since it basically does what the EARN IT Act does, and all right-thinking Americans have been told that that act Spells Doom For End-to-End Encryption.David explains why Amazon is facing tough new scrutiny from both parties: A Wall Street Journal article that questioned the accuracy of Amazon testimony before Congress has generated claims of perjury[18], a demand that Jeff Bezos testify[19], and suggestions that the administration open a criminal antitrust probe[20].\"You can't decouple from me! I'm decoupling from you!\" That's the sentiment from Chinese officials, anyway, as they push forward with their own remarkably familiar supply chain security regulations[21]. David explains that while the rules are similar to those in the United States, they're tougher and more likely to be implemented in a slow, inexorable way. And, of course, the United States is the unspoken target of them all.Download the 314th Episode (mp3).[22]You can subscribe to The Cyberlaw Podcast using iTunes[23], Google Play[24], Spotify[25], Pocket Casts[26], or our RSS feed.[27] As always, The Cyberlaw Podcast is open to feedback.

Smart finally comes homeSmart home devices have threatened to hit the mainstream for a couple of years now. But a series of developments towards the end of 2019 have set things up nicely for everything from cameras and door bells to lights and thermostats to get not only smarter, but also more compatible with each other. The smart home industry had been held back by the many different standards being introduced by each of the major players, which meant that devices from different brands didn't play nice with each other. </p><p>Now, industry biggies (and rivals) like Apple, Google and Amazon, along with the Zigbee Alliance, which counts Samsung, Ikea, Philips and others as its members, have partnered to develop an open-source platform - called Connected Home over IP - on which all future smart home devices will be built. So consumers will be free to buy the products that appeal to them the most, safe in the knowledge that inter-compatibility won't be an issue. From an Indian perspective, the country's leading smartphone brand, Xiaomi, and the fastest growing brand in 2019, Realme, have both highlighted smart home as a key focus category in 2020, meaning that India will soon have smart home products available widely and at attractive prices.?  Welcome your digital twinImagine a digital carbon copy of yourself residing somewhere in the cloud, growing and evolving as you do. The concept of AI-based digital twins isn't new - it has been used by NASA to test the safety of space missions and by manufacturing companies to verify the effectiveness of new products - but an exciting new avenue for the technology is healthcare. Collecting a wealth of data from a tiny wearable sensor, digital twins can contain all the unique physiological information that is unique to you. Doctors can then use this digital twin to test everything from new medication to organ transplants in a risk-free environment. Digital twins are also vital in another fastgrowing health-tech field - personalised dosage. With drugresistant illnesses on the rise, doctors are pushing to replace one-size-fits-all treatments with solutions that tackle diseases on an individual level, taking each person's unique chemistry and environmental factors into account. Digital twins will help create personalised treatments and medication plans that work effectively and with minimal side-effects.?  Privacy, but not from the authoritiesTech giants like Google and Facebook are feeling the heat as governments and regulators globally are drafting laws to rein in web and social media platforms and holding them accountable for data breaches, spread of disinformation, and user privacy. Following the lead of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), India too has floated the Personal Data Protection Bill, which is aimed at giving individuals the ability to take back control of their personal data that is shared online, as well as ensuring that sensitive data of Indians is stored on servers within India. But while ensuring that our data isn't abused by Big Tech, the privacy bill also seeks to grant the government unfettered access to a variety of personal data of Indian citizens. It also includes open-ended provisions to ramp up such data collection, while allowing for government agencies and representatives to be excluded from such data collection. So while tech companies are being held more accountable for how they manage our data, they may also be arm-twisted into handing over that very data to the authorities. So in 2020, we will likely go from having our data monetised by multinational corporations to it being used by the government as a surveillance tool. Good bye, frying pan. Hello, fire.?  Spacious accommodationThey've been promising it for years, but in 2020, private space companies and NASA alike will have to put their money where their mouth is and finally usher in the era of space tourism, offering civilians a return trip into zero gravity and an out-ofthis-world view. Companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic already have lengthy waiting lists, despite a $250,000 deposit. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is also offering short sub-orbital trips for a similar ticket price. But it was NASA that really upped the ante when it announced that it will allow space tourists on-board the International Space Station for up to 30 days starting this year. A room in space won't come cheap though; space tourists will have to pay an eye-watering $35,000 per night, plus the cost of the flight to the space station on board a SpaceX or Boeing spacecraft, which in itself will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. As in the initial years of air travel, space tourism will only be feasible for the richest of the rich for the foreseeable future, but the industry is set to take its first giant leap in this direction this year.? Democratising gamingGaming is often derided as a rich man's hobby - more so in developing markets like India - and with good reason. The latest game consoles cost upwards of Rs 30,000, and high-end gaming PCs will set you back by about Rs 50,000. Add to that Rs 2,000 and more for each new blockbuster console or PC game, and you're looking at quite an expense. Cloud gaming wants to put an end to that. Just as the likes of Netflix changed how we consume films and TV, cloud gaming seeks to remove our dependence on expensive hardware and hefty game downloads. Like video streaming, cloud gaming services like Microsoft's Project xCloud - which is coming to India this year - only require a display device, a controller and a fast internet connection. The games run on powerful cloud servers, and the visual feed from the game is then relayed to your screen, and your controller inputs are streamed back to the server. The tech is still at a nascent stage and several teething issues exist, but with major tech and gaming companies getting behind streaming, 2020 will be the year when gaming goes the way of OTT video platforms, where all the latest blockbuster games are only a monthly subscription away.

It would help if she had a clue what capitalism is all about.A President Warren would seek to regulate big tech companies as utilities, break up big banks and split them from securities dealers, ban fracking of oil and gas, phase out carbon emission from buildings, cars and power plants in eight to 15 years, require big companies to appoint worker representatives to at least 40% of board seats, ban private health insurance and, effectively, for-profit college, and negotiate down drug prices. Her policies would directly affect companies with sales of nearly $5 trillion and stock-market value of more than $8 trillion, a third of the S...00 stock index. Taxes on the wealthy and corporations would rise sharply. 'She could create an environment where it is next to impossible to function' for health insurers, said Vicky Gregg, a former chief executive of BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee and now partner in a private-equity firm. 'There's no question that keeps you up at night if you're a health-plan executive.' Ms. Warren, in laying out her case, has said she is 'a capitalist to my bones,' whereas fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calls himself a 'democratic socialist.' 'I love what markets can do, I love what functioning economies can do. They are what make us rich, they are what create opportunity,' Ms. Warren said on CNBC last year. 'But only fair markets, markets with rules. Markets without rules is about the rich take it all, it's about the powerful get all of it. And that's what's gone wrong in America.'

Continue reading Misinformation about the Notre Dame fire spread quickly on social media</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Notre Dame Cathedral inspires so much awe in visitors that seemingly everyone who steps inside it feels a powerful, and personal, sense of connection to it. I visited it myself for the first time two years ago and, like everyone else I know, was thrilled by its foreboding Gothic architecture. In spite of myself, I snapped a couple dozen pictures. Even knowing that every inch of the building had already been documented by far better photographers than me, I felt overwhelmed by the need to take a piece of Notre Dame home with me.</p><p>And so to watch the cathedral burn today   helplessly, on a Periscope stream   was a tragedy. And while nothing will match the horror of seeing the world lose one of its most beautiful structures, the calamity showed once again how unprepared tech platforms are to process news events in real time. Conspiracy-minded goons continue to twist real-time events into nefarious plots in the absence of any facts, and platforms' viral sharing mechanics help their narratives dominate users' attention while the truth is still being uncovered.</p><p>At BuzzFeed, Jane Lytvynenko shows how one Twitter account misrepresenting itself as CNN falsely stated that the fire was the work of terrorists, and how another misrepresenting itself as Fox News posted a fake quote from a Muslim congresswoman allegedly saying  they reap what they sow.  (She said no such thing.) Both accounts put  parody  in their bios, but their visual branding copied CNN and Fox News exactly, there was nothing evidently parodic about their tweets, and few people likely clicked to check their bios before retweeting them.</p><p>On Facebook, a 2016 story about a plot to blow up a car outside the cathedral was linked from a site that regularly spreads Islamophobic misinformation, with no clear sign that it was totally unrelated to the fire. (Facebook's story designs don't make it clear when pages re-share older articles.)</p><p>And on YouTube, well   this happened. From Chris Welch:</p><p>A fire has broken out at the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral today, and, as you'd expect, many news networks are offering live coverage of the breaking situation. What's a little more unusual is that YouTube seemed to temporarily mix up the unfortunate burning of a historic cathedral with the 9/11 New York City terror attacks.</p><p>Underneath live streams from CBS and others, viewers saw an explainer for the September 11th, 2001, attacks. These two things are completely unrelated, and there has been no indication that the Notre Dame fire is a result of terrorism or even criminal arson.</p><p>The whole reason for the panel's existence is to fight misinformation. And so the fact that a YouTube algorithm took a look at a video of a cathedral on fire and linked it to a terrorism attack is profoundly unfortunate.  These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,  a YouTube spokesperson told welch.  We are disabling these panels for live streams related to the fire. </p><p>If ever there were a case for  these panels  to be  triggered  editorially by humans, rather than algorithmically by math, a project designed to fight misinformation and conspiracy theories would surely be it.</p><p>Of course, it didn't help that the president of the United States   while the building was still on fire   made these bizarrely conspiracy-tinged remarks:   They think it was caused by, at this moment, they don't know, but they think it was caused by renovation. And I hope that's the reason. Renovation, you know, what's that all about? </p><p>I don't want to overstate the case here: none of this misinformation went truly viral, and I imagine that most people who read about the fire will find an accurate account of what happened.</p><p>But it's easy to imagine how the combination of irresponsible speechifying by an elected official, combined with platform-related mishaps, will empower cathedral fire truthers. And even if you think some level of conspiracy theorizing is inevitable after a catastrophe, it's possible to wish social media companies didn't so powerfully enable their spread.</p><p>Until then, I'm reading personal accounts of what Notre Dame meant to Paris and the world. Here's a nice one from Mohamed A. El-Erian in Bloomberg. Here's a history of royal moments at the cathedral from Ella Kay. And here's a photo I took of the great church in 2017, when it still seemed as eternal as the Seine.</p><p>Democracy</p><p>EU countries give final approval to copyright reform aimed at Google and Facebook</p><p>It's official: the Copyright Directive is now law, with 19 of 28 countries voting in favor of it. It promises to have huge consequences for YouTube, Facebook, and other big tech platforms, and could make it more difficult for new tech companies to operate in Europe. It won't go into effect immediately, though   countries have two years to design the implementation, and the law could be amended before then.</p><p>Facebook to introduce livestreaming restrictions this month</p><p>Jennifer Duke reports on Facebook's latest move to self-regulate ahead of government action in Australia:</p><p>Sources close to the social media platform said those who broke the site's rules, such as spreading hate speech on Facebook, would be stopped from going live under the changes.</p><p>The new restrictions will likely be introduced before a government-led taskforce meeting later this month and ahead of the business' first quarter earnings call.</p><p>WhatsApp Users Spread Antivaccine Rumors in India</p><p>Same platform, different disinformation campaign. Newley Purnell reports:</p><p>Anti-vaccine misinformation, some of it from social media posts in the West, is spreading in India on WhatsApp, undermining efforts to root out measles and rubella in a country where tens of thousands of people are struck by the diseases each year.</p><p>Dozens of schools in Mumbai have refused to allow health officials to carry out vaccinations in recent months, largely because of rumors shared on Facebook's popular messaging app about the supposed dangers.</p><p>US White Nationalists Barred by Facebook Find Haven on Russia Site</p><p>Masood Farivar reports that Russia is welcoming white nationalists onto its largest social network with open arms:</p><p>For white nationalists banned from Facebook, VK, based in St. Petersburg, has become a favorite destination. Its laissez faire policy allows them to post hate-filled memes, praise Hitler, rail at immigrants and Jews, and doxx   publish private information about their enemies.</p><p>China Wins Allies for Web Vision in Ideological Battle With U.S.</p><p>Lulu Yilun Chen and Yoolim Lee write about China's  stunning ideological coup    persuading other nations to adopt its vision of a highly restrictive internet purpose-built for surveillance of its citizens:</p><p>The more free-wheeling Silicon Valley model once seemed unquestionably the best approach, with stars from Google to Facebook to vouch for its superiority. Now, a re-molding of the internet into a tightly controlled and scrubbed sphere in China's image is taking place from Russia to India. Yet it's Southeast Asia that's the economic and geopolitical linchpin to Chinese ambitions and where U.S.-Chinese tensions will come to a head: a region home to more than half a billion people whose internet economy is expected to triple to $240 billion by 2025.</p><p> For authoritarian countries in general, the idea of the state being able to wall off to some extent its internet is deeply appealing,  said Howard French, author of  Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China's Push for Global Power.  This is about the regimes' survival in an authoritarian situation. So that's why they like to do this. They want to be able to insulate themselves against shocks. </p><p>After WhatsApp and Facebook, TikTok fights fake news in India</p><p>Good for TikTok for trying to get in front of its inevitable evolution into a fake-news distributor. Aria Thaker reports:</p><p>TikTok, owned by Chinese tech unicorn Bytedance, recently began displaying a public-service announcement (PSA) to its users when they search for some politically relevant hashtags. The hashtags Quartz found that are shown with the PSA are the names of prominent politicians or political organisations, including  bjp,   narendramodi,   rss,  and  rahulgandhi,  among others. This coincides with the start yesterday (April 11) of India's parliamentary election, which will take place in seven phases over six weeks.</p><p> In light of upcoming elections, we request you to continue using TikTok in a responsible way,  the PSA reads.  Please do not upload or share any unlawful content on TikTok. Guard against fake news by always referring to verified news sources. </p><p>Silicon Valley's self-regulating days  probably should be  over, Nancy Pelosi says</p><p>The Speaker of the House tells Kara Swisher that regulations are coming:</p><p>Pelosi said Silicon Valley is abusing the privilege of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which says that internet companies are not responsible for what is posted on their platforms.</p><p> 230 is a gift to them, and I don't think they are treating it with the respect that they should,  she said.

In a video[2] released last month, James O'Keefe, a conservativeactivist, interviews an unnamed Google insider. The film, which has been widely shared by conservative outlets and cited by Sen. Ted Cruz[3] (R-TX) and President Donald Trump[4], stitches a narrative of Orwellian, politically-motivated algorithmic bias out of contextless hidden camera footage, anodyne efforts to improve search results, and presumed links between unrelated products. </p><p>Although the film's claims are misleading and its findings unconvincing, they are taken seriously by lawmakers who risk using such claims to justify needless legislation and regulation. As such, they are worth engaging (the time stamps throughout this post refer to the Project Veritas video that can be viewedhere[5]).Search algorithms use predefined processes to sift through the universe of available data to locate specific pieces of information. Simply put, they sort information in response to queries, surfacing whatever seems most relevant according to their preset rules. Algorithms that make use of artificial intelligence and machine learning draw upon past inputs to increase the accuracy of their results over time. These technologies have been adopted to improve the efficacy of search, particularly in relation to the gulf between how users are expected to input search queries, and the language they actually use to do so. They are only likely to be adopted to the extent that they improve the user's search experience. When someone searches for something on Google, it is in the interest of both Google and the user for Google to return the most pertinent and useful results. Board game enthusiasts, economics students, and those taking part in furious public policy debates over dinner all may have reasons to search for 'Monopoly.' A company that makes it the easiest for such a diverse group of people to find what they're looking for will enjoy increased traffic and profit than competitors. Search histories, location, trends, and additional search terns (e.g. 'board game,' 'antitrust') help yield more tailored, helpful results. Project Veritas' film is intended to give credence to the conservative concern that culturally liberal tech firms develop their products to exclude and suppress the political right. While largely anecdotal, this concern has spurred hearings and regulatory proposals. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-AR) recently introduced legislation[6] that would require social media companies to prove their political neutrality in order to receive immunity from liability for their users speech. Last week, President Trump hosted a social media summit[7] featuring prominent conservative activists and conspiracy theorists who claim to have run afoul of politically biased platform rules. The film begins by focusing on Google's efforts to promote fairer algorithms, which are treated as attempts to introduce political bias into search results. The insider claims that while working at Google, he found 'a machine learning algorithm called ML fairness, ML standing for machine learning, and fairness meaning whatever they want to define as fair.' (6:34) The implication being that Google employees actively take steps to ensure that Google search results yield anti-conservative content rather than what a neutral search algorithm would. Unfortunately, what a 'neutral' algorithm would look like is not discussed. Although we're living in the midst of a new tech-panic, we should remember that questions about bias in machine learning and attempts to answer them are not new, nor are they merely a concern of the right. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez[8] (D-NY) and the International Committee of the Fourth International[9] have expressed concerns about algorithmic bias. Adequate or correct representation is subjective, and increasingly a political subject. In 2017, the World Socialist Web Site[10] sent a letter to Google, bemoaning the tech giant's 'anti-left bias' and claiming that 'Google is ''disappearing' the WSWS from the results of search requests.' However, despite the breathlessness with which O'Keefe 'exposes' Google's efforts to reduce bias in its algorithms, he doesn't bring us much new information. The documents he presents alongside contextless hidden camera clips of Google employees fail to paint a picture of fairness in machine learning run amok. One of the key problems with O'Keefe's video is that he creates a false dichotomy between pure, user created signals and machine learning inputs that have been curated to eliminate eventual output bias. The unnamed insider claims that attempts to rectify algorithmic bias are equivalent to vandalism: 'because that source of truth (organic user input) has been vandalized, the output of the algorithm is also reflecting that vandalism' (8:14). But there is little reason to presumptively expect organic data to generate more 'truthful' or 'correct' outputs than training data that has been curated in some fashion. Algorithms sort and classify data, rendering raw input useful. Part of tuning any given machine learning algorithm is providing it with training data, looking at its output, and then comparing that output to what we already know to be true.Take a recent example from Wimbledon. IBM uses machine learning to select highlight clips[11], their algorithm's inputs include player movements and crowd reactions. While crowd reactions can provide valuable signals, they can also be misleading. 'An American playing on an outside court on 4 July may get a disproportionate amount of support, throwing the highlight picking algorithm out of sync.'[12] While we expect the crowd's cheers to be driven by their appreciation of a player's skill, they may also cheer to celebrate the appearance of an American on Independence Day. If IBM wants to identify moments of skillful play rather than the mere appearance of Americans on the court, they must reduce the relative importance of audience applause in their algorithm, debiasing it.  Despite the insider's claim that 'they would never admit this publicly,' (9:45) Google is quite open about its efforts to prevent algorithmic bias. The firm maintains a list of machine learning fairness resources[13], including an extensive glossary of terms[14] describing different sorts of bias, and sample code demonstrating how to train classifiers while avoiding bias[15]. These public resources are, frankly, far more extensive, and reveal more about Google's efforts to prevent machine learning bias, than anything in the latest Veritas video. The fact that Google News is not an organic, unfiltered search product (11:30) is not news either. Google's news content policies are open to the public[16], and Google gives further public guidance to publishers as to what their algorithms prioritize[17] in news pages. The 'demonstration' of Google search bias that follows, relying on autocomplete suggestions rather than actual search results, are far from 'undeniable.' O'Keefe first types 'Hillary Clinton's emails are' into Google's search bar and notes that Google does not continue to autofill the search. Without actually conducting a search, they conclude that 'Google is suggesting that people do not search for this term' and that 'its not even worth returning any results for' (15:48). But they haven't actually conducted a search. If they had, Google's search would have returned millions of web pages[18] concerning Clinton's use of a private email server as a government employee. When one uses a more generic query, with less punctuation, typing 'clinton ema' into the search bar, Google autosuggests 'clinton emails on film' and 'clinton emails foia', and surfaces results from Judicial Watch and the Daily Caller. While few people may use O'Keefe's convoluted search term, Google's autofill doesn't shy away from suggesting searches for Clinton's emails, and returns a deluge of results regardless of the search phrase used. Next, O'Keefe uses Google trends to compare searches for 'Hillary Clinton's emails' to searches for 'Donald Trump's emails'. Compared to searches for Clinton's emails, searches for Trump's emails are effectively nonexistent. However, these are relative trends, so the fact many more people searched for 'Clinton's emails' than 'Trump's emails' does not mean that no one has ever searched for 'Trump's emails.' Nevertheless, O'Keefe claims that the low relative interest in 'Trump's emails' implies that there ought to be no autocomplete suggestions for the search term. 'Now let's go back to Google.com and search for Donald Trump's emails and it should show us no autocomplete because according to Google no one searches for it compared to Hillary Clinton's emails.' (17:07) Despite this expectation, Google does indeed suggest search queries when one types 'Donald Trump's emails' into the search bar. The Google insider explains this result by saying; 'according to them (Google) Hillary Clinton's emails is a conspiracy theory and it's unfair to return results based on her emails' (17:40).; Is this the incontrovertible evidence of Google's bias that conservatives have been searching for? Not at all. The fact that there were relatively more searches for Clinton's emails than for Trump's does not mean that no one ever searched for Trump's emails. Simply because one query is used more often than another does not imply that the seldom-used query ought not generate search suggestions. Remember that O'Keefe never actually searched for 'Clinton's emails,' and generated an absence of autocomplete results by typing 'Hillary Clinton's emails are,' a more specific search term less likely to generate autofill suggestions. Finally, far from refraining from returning 'results based on her emails,' because it would be 'unfair,' if one actually searches for any of these Clinton email query permutations, Google returns a host of topical results. While undercover footage of a Google employee discussing the 2016 election is supposed to provide evidence of anti-conservative animus, these clips have been so stripped of context. The employee (who I have not named here because of the threats she has received following her involuntary appearance in O'Keefe's film) could be discussing either nefarious efforts to prevent Trump's reelection or Google's very public work to secure its services against Russian manipulation. Absent context it's impossible to tell. While perhaps inarticulately phrased, 'We got screwed over in 2016, it wasn't just us, it was, the people got screwed over, the news media got screwed over, like everyone got screwed over so we're rapidly been like, what happened there and how do we prevent it from happening again?' (3:12) does not a smoking gun make. The employee, for her part, says that she had been approached to discuss mentorship programs for women of color and was filmed recounting how Google has worked to prevent election interference. Escalating from mere misrepresentation to outright falsehood, the unnamed insider discusses Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. CDA 230 contains two substantive provisions[19]. The first, (c)(1), prevents 'providers of an interactive computer service' from being 'treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' This prevents Planned Parenthood from suing YouTube for hosting O'Keefe's undercover videos of Planned Parenthood employees. The second provision, (c)(2), allows content hosts to moderate content, or 'restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.' This ensures that if YouTube does not want to play host to O'Keefe's misleading videos, it does not have to. After reading only CDA 230(c)(1) to viewers, O'Keefe asks the unnamed insider about proposals to amend the statute. 19:14 O'Keefe: Some people think a solution is this section 230 and taking it away? 19:20 Unnamed Insider: I mean, they violated not only the letter of the law but the spirit of law, section 230 says that in order for them to be a platform they can't censor the content that they have, instead they decided to act as a publisher, making them responsible for everything they put on and they're still masquerading as a platform even though they're acting as a publisher. This is not a case of poor interpretation of law or clumsy use of language. It is simply not true. CDA 230 (c)(2) clearly contravenes the insider's claim. The full statute explicitly provides for private moderation; 'censorship' in the employee's parlance. It also makes no mention of a publisher/platform distinction. As far as the law is concerned, whether a website that hosts user submitted content is a 'platform' or a 'publisher' simply does not matter. The comparison between discreet refusals to host videos and Nazi book burnings that follow (22:57) do not inspire greater confidence. While conservatives may have reason to suspect that their cultural distance from Silicon Valley makes fair moderation difficult, this concern should not spur the embrace of conspiratorial claims made by those with a history of misleadingly editing video[20]. Public policy must rest on firm factual grounds, not aspersions and the deliberate misreading of existing statutes. Unfortunately, some members of Congress seem poised to legislate on the basis of misleading propaganda, instead of taking the time to understand how algorithms actually work.

The ideal city would have more than a million people, mass transit, an international airport, attractive housing and 'stable and business-friendly' regulations. But the retail goliath apparently isn't worried about how surging seas, extreme weather and deadly heat waves might affect its operations or the 50,000 employees it promises to hire in its new $5 billion 'second home.' The company also doesn't seem overly concerned with how much its ravenous appetite for energy and reliance on fleets of fossil-fueled delivery trucks are making those things worse. </p><p>Amazon made no mention of climate change in its 'HQ2' requests for proposals. Few, if any, of the public bids from 238 cities[1] in 54 states, provinces and territories throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico included risks from warming temperatures. Likewise, Amazon refuses to release data on its greenhouse gas emissions, making the Seattle-based giant a pariah among environmentalists who rank it as one of the least transparent corporations of its size. This year, unseasonable wildfires, 1,000-year floods and back-to-back scale-topping hurricanes made climate change more tangible for many Americans. Yet the nearly $566 billion corporate titan has managed to erect a tent around its circus over a second headquarters to try to keep out the frightening weather. And all the players seem willing to ignore the forecast.The company plans to announce its decision next year. In the meantime, analysts made their own rankings. Moody's Analytics considered 34 variables, including costs, quality of life and transportation. The analysis, published[2] in October, ranked Austin, Texas, a city racked in recent years by drought and flooding[3], first. Atlanta, prone to heat waves, was second. Philadelphia, a coastal city at risk of sea level rise, came in third.'We didn't take into consideration climate change risk or rising sea waters or anything like that,' Adam Ozimek, co-author of the analysis and a senior economist at Moody's, told HuffPost. 'Within the United States, within the 50 states, it's hard to look and find places where you're seeing major divestment or declines in investment due to reasons of climate change.'Another analysis[4] by Anderson Economic Group yielded different results but still ignored climate change. CNN[5] and The New York Times[6] made their own lists but mentioned 'climate' only in reference to business regulations. Noticing the research void, Aseem Prakash, director of the University of Washington's Center for Environmental Politics, formulated his own ranking based on climate vulnerability. He and his fellow researcher, Nives Dol\u0161ak, calculated the total number of days each county spent under a federally declared emergency or disaster. They based the assessment on 25 years of Federal Emergency Management Agency data on severe storms, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, coastal floods and weather-related fires. They used 1992 as the start date to include Hurricane Andrew, the second-most damaging storm in the U.S.[7] after the 1926 Great Miami storm. Only two cities \u2015 Portland, Oregon, and Pittsburgh \u2015 ranked in the top 10 for both the Moody's study and theirs. 'This suggests that economic and business criteria probably do not help us to understand a city's vulnerability to climate change,' Prakash wrote in a blog post[8] for HuffPost. Amazon declined to comment for this story. Including climate data in economic and market forecasts remains a surprisingly novel concept. It's only been in the past two to three years that insurance companies \u2015 whose business is based on predicting and planning for potential risks \u2015 began seriously reconsidering how it plans for a warmer future. The British Labour Party announced plans[9] to include climate change in its economic predictions just last month. And most big tech companies, such as Facebook, Apple and Alphabet's Google, release detailed reports on their energy use and overall output of carbon pollution. But not Amazon. The company touts its efforts to reduce its emissions of planet-warming gases, trumpeting the solar panels[10] on its warehouse roofs and encouraging customers to recycle its packaging[11]. In October, CEO Jeff Bezos tweeted a video[12] of himself christening the company's 18th renewable-energy project and largest wind farm yet \u2015 a roughly 100-turbine operation in Snyder, Texas \u2015 with a bottle of Champagne. Fun day christening Amazon's latest wind farm. #RenewableEnergy[13]pic.twitter.com/cTxeXdsFop[14] \u2014 Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) October 19, 2017[15] But Amazon scored an F for energy transparency, a D for renewable commitment policies and a C for energy efficiency on Greenpeace's 2017 Clicking Green report[16]. The annual report uses submissions by the company to Greenpeace, investor reports, investment announcements and media stories. 'They're one of the least transparent companies, tech or otherwise, of their size that don't report their greenhouse gas emissions,' Gary Cook, a corporate campaigner at Greenpeace, told HuffPost by phone. 'They've certainly done some sizable renewable energy deals in the last two years, but if you don't know how much they're solving for in terms of energy demand and smog, it's hard to assess how big these are.' While Amazon may be best known for its e-commerce store, the lion's share of its profit comes from its Amazon Web Services arm, which controls about 42 percent[17] of the global cloud-computer infrastructure that powers the internet. The division generated $4.58 billion in revenue in the third quarter of this year, Amazon reported in October. The company's e-commerce branch operates on thin margins, but AWS rakes in profit. The division earned $1.17 billion in income, compared with just $347 million from the rest of the company for the quarter.The data centers host a huge swath of the internet \u2015 including Netflix, Yahoo and HuffPost \u2015 and require enormous amounts of electricity. One data center uses as much electricity as 25,000 homes. The world's data centers already constitute about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the sector's energy consumption is set to triple[18] in the next decade. Amazon could leapfrog its rivals by making climate change and renewable energy a key focus of its hunt for a second headquarters, Cook said. 'For them to signal that this is important to them would really drive a much broader conversation among cities who are saying, 'Hey, we want Amazon and companies like them. We need to help them achieve their goals and deliver infrastructure, electricity and transportation options to advance their goals,'' he said. Amazon operates with a monopolistic power, leveraging its dominance in e-commerce and cloud-computer to become a powerful player in other markets, such as television production, publishing and fashion. The ethics of that power concentration aside, the company has a responsibility to use its market dominance to force systemic changes in its industry, Prakash said. If the company began pressuring UPS, FedEx and other delivery services to convert their truck fleets to electric vehicles, it could dramatically decrease the carbon pollution of each package sent from an Amazon warehouse.'If Amazon does, others will follow because it has clout,' Prakash told HuffPost by phone. 'That's why it's so disappointing that with the HQ2 they forgot about climate change. To me it suggests this kind of thinking is not deeply ingrained; it's still superficial.'

Talk centred around \"flattening the curve\" and social distancing, companies were transitioning vast numbers of staff out of the office and scores of others were being placed on furlough. In the midst of all this, a landmark moment almost passed by unnoticed. A sweeping new tax on tech giants, which had been years in the making, finally came into force in the UK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The initial remit of the tax, from then-chancellor Philip Hammond, had been clear. It was \"designed to ensure it is the established tech giants rather than the technology start-ups which shoulder the burden\". Yet now, almost two years after plans for a tech tax were first mooted and months after it was introduced, it appears the burden will fall elsewhere. In the past few weeks, first Amazon, then Google and now Apple have confirmed they will be passing the costs of the 2pc tax on to those using their sites to sell goods or run adverts.</p><p>The Treasury will still be collecting as much as \u00a3500m every year from the tax, which applies to social media firms, search engines and what are deemed \"marketplaces\", which facilitate sales between two parties.</p><p>The difference is, that cash won't be coming from the tech companies. It will be coming from the small businesses who sell over Amazon's marketplace, the advertisers who pay to have their ads appear on Google, or the app developers who use Apple's App Store to reach customers.</p><p>Richard Murphy, Tax Research UK founder, says this will be the \"easiest tax on Earth to pass on\", as the tech giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter are \"effectively monopoly suppliers\".</p><p>\"The reality is those platforms are unique and they can therefore pass the cost on if someone wants to advertise with them,\" he says.</p><p>This stems from the fact the tax is on revenue, instead of profit. \"This is essentially a sales tax levied on top of VAT on these companies and what we know about this form of sales tax is that it's passed straight on to the consumer,\" Murphy says.</p><p>Air passenger duty, for example, is a tax on airlines and not passengers, but it is determined by the passenger and is therefore passed on by the airline as part of the overall price. \"We'll see something very similar in the DST [digital services tax] in that it will be included as an extra cost for the buyer or seller,\" says Chris Sanger, head of tax at EY.</p><p>Tech firms have never shied away from plans to pass on the tax. In consultation documents from 2018, the Government noted that \"a number of respondents raised concerns about revenue-based taxes, regardless of exact design\".</p><p>\"This included noting that revenue-based taxes can generate high effective rates of tax on profits, risked being economically distortive or could be passed on in prices to other businesses and consumers.\"</p><p>Amazon, too, said it warned the Treasury of such a scenario. \"As we've previously indicated, the way that the Government has designed the digital services tax will directly impact the businesses that use our services,\" a spokesman for the retailer said.</p><p>The fact that this outcome is now playing out in the public eye could, however, pile pressure on the Treasury for a rethink.</p><p>\"It beggars belief that the vast majority of the Big Tech giants subject to the new digital services tax are shirking their responsibilities and passing the buck on to customers or smaller businesses,\" MP Dame Margaret Hodge says.</p><p>\"At a time when more and more money is being spent online, these huge digital corporations should pay the new levy themselves.</p><p>\"Most hard-working people pay their taxes; it's only fair that multinational companies should do the same.\"</p><p>Under the current legislation, the likelihood is that the tax's intended targets will be missed almost entirely. \"As usual with these sorts of regulations and tax increases, it's the smaller businesses that end up suffering disproportionately,\" says Richard Windsor, the Radio Free Mobile founder.</p><p>The question now is whether changes could be introduced to the tax to stop such practices taking place, and whether the Treasury could introduce legislation to block charges being passed on to small businesses and customers.</p><p>The Government may have limited power to force firms to pay the tax themselves, but competitive pressures could change decisions.</p><p>Facebook has insisted it won't pass on the costs of the tax to its UK customers in a move that will certainly draw the ire of cynics who may dismiss it as nothing more than a PR move.</p><p>Tax Research's Murphy believes the social media giant will find \"some other way\" to make up for funds lost through the levy.</p><p>Yet, even so, Facebook's decision could be enough to force attitude changes among the likes of Apple and Amazon.</p><p>And, in doing so, it could save the Government from yet another embarrassing about-face.</p><p>'At a time when more is being spent online, these huge corporations should pay the new levy themselves'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-162889871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RX-P561-DYTY-C1WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Based in San Francisco, Greg is joining Reuters from American Lawyer Media, where he was editor in chief of law.com and headed up newsroom innovation and engagement initiatives including the roll-out of new reporter-written topical newsletters. </p><p>Before that, Greg was editor in chief of ALM's San Francisco publication, The Recorder, where he started his career as a web editor and then reporter, covering the state Supreme Court and related judicial and executive branch agencies. In later editing roles, he oversaw The Recorder's coverage of the legal battle over same-sex marriage, investigations into stock-options backdating, the emergence of Internet privacy litigation and regulation, seismic shifts in the legal services industry, the rise (and sometimes collapse) of global law firms, and the upsizing of Big Tech legal departments. Greg will join us on April 9 and report to me. He brings to this role a broad and sophisticated understanding of the U.S. technology industry, as well as a strong track record in guiding reporters to produce ambitious and impactful stories on the biggest companies in Silicon Valley. They include exclusives on the Apple-Samsung phone litigation, Uber's battles with its drivers and would-be regulators, and the lack of diversity among lawyers working at or for Google and Facebook. Greg is a lifelong Californian who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a history degree. He and his wife, DeeDee Schroeder, live in San Francisco with their four kids. Greg likes to run, read and watch lots of kids' soccer, basketball and, lately, lacrosse. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TKBZ1089821523484725869251767300146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TKBZ-7393</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S34-1HP1-JCMN-Y4GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"319\"/><timeReceived>10:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Talking Biz News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002EUA</classCode><className>THOMSON REUTERS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519190 ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC7375 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But occasionally a brave male will admit he likes it too, same demographic mind you, so I kind of write for 55 and up, which luckily includes me, and if a few millennials, other than the two who I make read it, happen to come across it so much the better.</p><p>Although The Morning Star is, of course, online as well as the printed version, I'm pretty sure most of my readers are in danger of getting ink on their fingers. They, like yours truly, grew up with newspapers and prefer, trust, and gravitate towards the tactile experience. This also keeps me from going 'viral' which may sound like a disease but is actually a popularity quotient. Still, I don't think I want to go there.</p><p>But you can't turn back time (trust me, I've tried) and we all have to come to grips with the future of media.</p><p>The power, reach and dominance of Big Tech has forced local media to find their niche and role in our lives and in our communities. They are forced to go after smaller demographics because the former community at large is no longer there. Indeed, a fractured and fragmented media landscape dominated by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) threatens local media as a whole just as it threatens local retail and by default: local democracy and a sense of community.</p><p>The internet, it was shouted from the rooftops, would get rid of the gatekeepers in print, radio and TV that controlled the news cycle and replace it with a freer, more open exchange of ideas that would hopefully reveal something more resembling the truth and less like the establishment-dominated, mainstream media's version of history on the run.</p><p>Instead the fairly regulated mainstream media and its attempts to maintain fairness as well as community accountability has given up a huge chunk of market share to the click-dominated, money-driven, pretty much anything goes, especially if it goes viral, digital formats that cater to wide and narrow audiences alike.</p><p>That's not to say traditional media wasn't money-hungry in its day, it was and some people (not me) got very rich as a result, but there was at least an attempt to be locally responsible and accountable, and if not government was there to step in on behalf of the residents through legislation and oversight.</p><p>The new gatekeeper, Big Tech, and its growing impact driven by the young and now powerful (and so, so rich), is so far ahead of government, dominated by doddering dinosaurs, that any attempts at legislation would likely be too little, too late, and even possibly outdated by technology before they even became law.</p><p>Meanwhile the fracturing of the media landscape, lack of accountability and catering to the lowest common denominator through click bait, leaves us debating life and death situations where no one agrees on the facts fed to them by their respective media bubbles.</p><p>Fox News viewers think law and order is the vital issue of the day as they watch mayhem in Portland and ponder left-wing conspiracies that threaten America itself, while CNN viewers focus on the pandemic and its increasing death toll largely due to the White House's lack of leadership, while all the while sermonizing how political correctness is going to save us all from ourselves.</p><p>Yikes. So much for the truth.</p><p>Apparently knowing your audience isn't always good in the long run, and feeding them what they want to hear all the time may be even worse, and in service to economy and clarity that's all I'm going to say about that.</p><p>Glenn Mitchell is a columnist and former editor of the Morning Star.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mitchchap1@outlook.com\">mitchchap1@outlook.com</email></p><p>READ MORE: On the cutting edge of razor technology</p><p>READ MORE: Boomer Talk: Bureacracy and healthcare</p><p>@VernonNews <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsroom@vernonmorningstar.comLike\">newsroom@vernonmorningstar.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VERNON-4030791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VERNON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GH-J151-F103-30NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"728\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Vernon Morning Star</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had a new kid in town, as Dow Inc.  officially separated from DowDuPont  and replaced its parent company in the index. It's only one day, but this catalyst event, which we long expected would help the market recognize a sum-of-the-parts valuation greater than its whole, began to show its worth. DOW shares gained more than 5% in its first day of trading. You can read more about the streamlined Dow Inc. in our Alert from Monday <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Facebook  was a notable outperformer on the day, closing roughly 3.26% higher. This move was driven by a positive research note from Deutsche Bank, which reiterated its Buy rating on the stock and called out the social media company's opportunity to build out a significant revenue stream via e-commerce operations on Instagram.</p><p>According to the note, the analysts believe the opportunity can ultimately result in an additional $10 billion to Facebook's top line by 2021. Key to the initiative is the recently announced checkout feature (which you can see more about <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>), which per the company's website, \"makes it quick and secure for people to buy the products they discover on Instagram.\"</p><p>As we've addressed multiples times in the past, we believe Instagram represents the company's newest and most reliable source of growth as the core platform matures and growth tapers off. Given the company's well-known dominance in the targeted ad space, we view the deeper push into e-commerce as an obvious move, especially as Instagram is the go-to site for social media influences and brand names seek to take advantage of influencers' ability to drive sales. Furthermore, with Amazon AMZN quickly making strides into the targeted ad market, with the ability advertise at the point of sale, we believe the added ability to checkout directly on the Instagram platform as a much-needed defense against the e-commerce leader.</p><p>Regarding monetization opportunities, allowing companies to sell directly on the platform brings with it several levers Facebook can pull on to grow its top line and reach the $10 billion increase expected by the Deutsche Bank analysts. In addition to the additional ad space provided by the associated shopping cart, Facebook stands to profit from \"take-rate\" monetization (the company's cut of sales for hosting and selling through their platform). Per the Deutsche Bank release, the analysts believe that take-rate monetization will account for as much as half of their $10 billion estimate.</p><p>Additionally, there is the increased visibility Facebook will have into user shopping trends, knowing not only what users are searching for but what they ultimately end up buying. The ability to better target adds could ultimately lead to better returns for ad buyers and as a result allow the company to increase the cost of advertising on the platform.</p><p>From an engagement perspective, should Instagram come to be better known as a shopping platform, versus simply an influencer/photo sharing app, we could certainly see user numbers and time spent on the platform increase, again leading to an uptick in the amount Facebook can charge ad buyers -- more eyeballs inherently meaning a larger audience for advertisers to sell to.</p><p>Bottom line: Facebook appears to be on the right track with its recent decision. Finally, management appears to be wrapping its arms around its data privacy issues while exploiting new avenues for growth. As a result, we continue to view the shares as a buy for those willing to ride out any nearer-term volatility resulting from regulatory headwinds relating to big tech and data privacy.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy Markets</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Switching gears to the energy markets, WTI crude gained another $0.99 or 1.6%, settling in at $62.58 a barrel. It's a multi-month high for the commodity as we have not seen prices at these levels since November 2018. While the gains in WTI crude were bountiful on Tuesday, the move did not correlate to higher stock prices in two of our energy positions, Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  and Schlumberger  . Still, let's take a moment and put WTI Crude's push above $60 into context for our only U.S. exploration and production company, Anadarko Petroleum.</p><p>The key to our Anadarko Petroleum investment thesis relates to the company's ability to be cash flow neutral in a $50 oil environment, and how its management is very shareholder friendly with excess cash. While the company's cash flow neutral rate is pegged at $50 oil, management also notes that for every $1 increase above $50 oil per annum, the company generates an approximately $140 million of additional free cash flow.</p><p>If WTI crude can sustain these levels for an extended period of time, we are talking about a significant amount of cash generation management can then use to further the share repurchase program, which has $1.25 billion remaining; appropriately address the dividend, which already increased by 500% in 2018; or continue to fund debt reduction initiatives . Factor in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,</emphasis> which netted roughly $2 billion in cash proceeds, and Anadarko Petroleum suddenly has plenty of cash optionality.</p><p>Has Anadarko's improving profitably and increasing cash flow generation caught up to the stock yet? The answer is simply \"no,\" with the shares up only 3% year to date compared to a roughly 17% gain in the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund  . Sentiment remains terribly poor here, but the positive moves in the commodity suggest that the company is doing far better than what the market suggests. Still, we will maintain our Two rating on APC due to our preference for the higher-yielding BP plc  and Schlumberger.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCJIM-14915347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCJIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT8-FP41-JCHV-V54D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Every other footballingcountry, Australia aside, provides a ladder to the top, and even the A League is going to bring one in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Standing alone against the world, thisis a footballing form of American exceptionalism. One that raises questions about the universality of the game, the muscle of Fifa, the survival of domestic league pyramids, and suggesting an explanation to why the world's biggest economy still underachieves, and will not be sending a team to this year's men's World Cup.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Why Beckham's MLS dream could yet turn out to be a nightmare</p><p>Because this closed-shop arrangement, and the cosy protection the USSF gives to MLS, is under threat like never before. Two football club owners, faces pressed up against the window of MLS, are bringing a new legal challenge this spring. Hoping to force Fifato finally impose promotion and relegation on the USSF, bringing American soccer into line, more than 20 years late.</p><p>Riccardo Silva is an Italian investor and founder of MP &amp; Silva, a sports media agency he set up with Andrea Radrizzani, who now owns Leeds United. Silva set up Miami FC and is distraught that, after NASL's desanctioning, they have nowhere to play this year. But his financial stake in this is potentially even bigger than that: last year MP &amp; Silva offered $4bn for the next 10 years of MLS rights, quadrupling the current value of the current deal,as long as they introduced promotion and relegation. They said no.</p><p>But Silva still wants to find a way to shake up football in the US, to make it fairer, more open, and more marketable than it is right now.\"Broadcasters always say they don't believe MLS is real soccer because it's a closed league,\"he explains to </p><p>The Independent</p><p> from his central London office this week \"There isn't really a competition. It's not perceived as real football, real soccer, it's something a bit artificial. Where there is no sporting merit, no competitiveness. This is what everybody thinks.\"</p><p>Dennis Crowley is the founder of location app FourSquare and a huge soccer fan, who has set up his own semi-professional team, Kingston Stockade FC, in upstate New York. Silva and Crowley met up last year and shared their frustrations about the state of the football in the US, the lack of a fair pyramid and the damage that does to the standard of the national team.</p><p>Riccardo</p><p> Silva, right, is an Italian investor (Getty Images)</p><p>Those were the problems that drove Crowley to create Kingston Stockade in the first place, back in 2015. \"Part of the thinking was, what can we do to make soccer better in the US?\" Crowley tells</p><p>The Independent</p><p> overthe phone from San Francisco. \"Manifested in another selfish goal: what has to happen for me, at 40 years old, to see the US win a World Cup in my lifetime? Is that possible? It's very easy to sit around and complain: what things can I do, as a fan, to inch us a little bit closer to that? And we hit on this idea: let's make a club, and help other people make clubs.\"</p><p>Kingston Stockade play in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), effectively the fourth tier in the US. But no matter what they achieve, the closed system means they will never go anywhere. Nothing will be ever be enough to reach the top flight, theConcacaf Champions League or the Club World Cup. Football is meant to be meritocratic,except in the US.</p><p>\"Every other part of American culture is very much driven by the entrepreneurial spirit,\" explains Crowley. \"You make something great, you try to win against your competitors, and then you move to face off against bigger and better competitors. My other job is I work at a tech company. It started as a tiny little tech company, and over 10 years we built it into a big tech company. And this idea that you can't do that in soccer, it feels fundamentally broken.\"</p><p>Nowhere is the weakness of the system clearer than in the failure of the national team to reach this year's World Cup, for the first time since 1986. The USA, remember, finished fifth in a 10-game six-team league, behind Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras. It all ended in Trinidad last October as the USA disastrously lost 2-1, shocking soccer fans across the country.</p><p>This underperformance is what inspired Crowley and Silva, who ascribethe side'sstruggle to the lack of a proper football system in the US: \"A country of 300 million people, where soccer exists for a long time, and is very followed, should be constantly among the top 10, if not the top five in the world. It is the result of the disrespect of the rule of competition. Since it is not a competitive system, it's an anticompetitive system.\"</p><p>Dennis Crowley is the founder of location appFourSquare (Getty)</p><p>But how do you get USSF to change? The first hope of the promotion-relegation lobby was Eric Wynalda, who ran to replace Sunil Gulati as USSF president, advocating radical change, including 'pro-rel', to shake up soccer in the US. But in last month's election he failed and was beaten by Carlos Cordeiro, vice-president under Gulati, an establishment candidate but not quite as pro-MLS as Kathy Carter. But Cordeiro, in words that have encouraged reformers, has pledged to end the 'conflict of interest' at the heart of American soccer.</p><p>What exactly does he mean by that? Reformers see the overly-cosy relationship between USSF, MLS and Soccer United Marketing (SUM), who sell MLS TV rights, as the heart of the problems in the American game. USSF protects MLS' Division 1 status but sets harsh professional league standards for its competitors. They have de-sanctioned NASL for 2018, leaving Silva's Miami FC and the popular New York Cosmos with nowhere to play this year. NASL tried to reverse that decision in a court case in New York but they lost their appeal this week. So Miami FC's second team will play in the NPSL this year while their first team, now managed by Paul Dalglish, have to search for another competition to sign up for.</p><p>USSF, it is increasingly clear, are in no mood to compromise or to help any team or league outside of their protected bubble. So Silva and Crowley are taking a different legal approach. Article 9 of Fifa's statutory regulations enshrines promotion and relegation, ordering that a club's \"entitlement to take part in a domestic league championship shall depend principally on sporting merit\". Of course this is not the case in the US, where the only way into MLS is with a cheque. Silva and Crowley, or rather, Miami FC and Kingston Stockade FC, are bringing a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), appealing for arbitration, calling on Fifato finally impose its own rules on the US and bring them into line with the rest of the world.</p><p>\"Ultimately, you can't ask the USSF politely to do this,\" Crowley says. \"They're not interested. What we're trying to do with the CAS filing is to say 'listen, USSF has to play by Fifa's rules.' People have been trying to do this for years, and USSF has not been forced to respond. The thinking is that the CAS filing forces the issue, forces them to articulate their position, and hopefully forces them to make some changes here. The USSF has to acknowledge that this is part of Fifa's rules.\"</p><p>Is Fifagoing to allow the closed shop that is the </p><p>MLS</p><p>continue in its current form? (Getty)</p><p>The question for Fifais whether they have the stomach to forcibly impose this on the US. The fact that they have not done so yet, with MLS about to start its 23</p><p>rd</p><p> season, is revealing enough. But there is a bigger issue at stake here even than whether the US will ever have its own pro-rel pyramid, whether Miami FC will ever get to play top flight football, or reach the Champions League, and how an open system, rather than a closed one, would improve the US men's national team.</p><p>And that is whether football has to be organised the same way in every country or not. Football's universality has always been its strength. But if Fifais going to ignore such a huge exception - and even to defend its right to do so - then which other laws and tenets of the game are negotiable? \"There cannot be any discrimination between countries,\" Silva insists. \"If a rule is valid in Europe, it should be valid in the US. Otherwise, let's start playing in the US with 20 players. With bigger goals. With helmets. With hands. If FIFA have rules, they should be valid everywhere. Without discrimination of countries.\"</p><p>That might sound dystopian but there is a more immediate threat to the structure of football if Fifado not act. Which is that if Fifaallow the USSF to run their own closed shop, ignoring the sporting merit criteria, then how can Fifastop a lucrative trans-national super league from setting up?</p><p>\"If a closed league, where teams pay to be promoted, is formally accepted, then I think it would be the end of football in Europe,\" warns Silva. \"Basically only 20 teams in Europe will survive, and hundreds would die because the others would form a super league. And football as it is, as an inclusive, open system, will die. It will only be a little private club of the 20 richest teams in Europe. And hundreds of teams, with their tradition, with their importance to the community, will disappear.

All these banks have invested in e-wallet services as well, confirming that the threat to traditional banking of mobile money - or cashless transacting - is real.</p><p>SA has a huge unbanked population, with some researchers estimating it as high as 67% - people turned off by the banking system due to its exorbitant fees, Fica requirements and a general lack of trust. SA also has one of the highest cellphone penetrations in the world, with 87% individual ownership and 36% of them owning smartphones, according to the 2014 AMPS Report.</p><p>In the next couple of years there will be a massive switch in people's attitudes to mobile money, which will turn into another South African success story.</p><p>Mobile banking has several advantages.</p><p>It gives people a means of carrying money without the constant fear of losing it or being robbed. It gives the poor the ability to be part of a society and to use a banking system without being exploited. People can use their cellphones to pay taxi fares, buy groceries at a corner shop and to send money to others.</p><p>Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana and Zimbabwe are ahead of SA in mobile banking. The time has arrived for every supermarket, retailer, spaza shop, coffee shop and taxi driver to embrace mobile money.</p><p>Major companies in SA and the rest of the world are working on including mobile money in their business models and are allowing people to use it in ways never imagined. From automated payments for parking, to fridges that order milk and automated reward systems, mobile money is the future for all.</p><p>With big tech companies such as Apple, Google and Samsung getting involved in mobile banking, the industry is growing at a rapid rate. Regulators will be forced to adapt, making it possible for smaller businesses to use mobile money and allowing companies to launch their mobile money products.</p><p>In SA the slow growth of mobile money is due to the limitations put in place by the regulating bodies. The strong hold of the top five banks over the payment industry contributes to inhibiting growth. It is almost impossible for any firm to get a banking licence in SA. Without one, or a banking partner, it is illegal to launch a mobile banking company.</p><p>SA can no longer delay building mobile banking systems on a larger scale, as this will ease the critical problem of financial inclusion. People are already using alternative digital mediums as currency.</p><p>In other African countries, people use airtime as a currency. Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular among online shoppers.</p><p>These currencies will become another form of mobile money. As banks and regulators limit the growth of mobile money, people will find different forms and means of making payments. In the near future more people will accept alternative forms of payment.</p><p>&amp; 8226;Meyer is founder and CEO of Wallettec, which assists retailers to accept mobile transactions.</p><p>SA can no longer delay building mobile banking systems on a larger scale, as this will ease the critical problem of financial inclusion</p><p><person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>says digital banking will empower the poor.

He observed that \"digital banking will give the poor more control over their assets and help them transform their lives and by 2030, 2 billion people who don't have a bank account today will be storing money and making payment with their phones\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I have to say he's spot on and, in all my years as a mobile technology professional, I can say without a doubt that the future of mobile money is inevitable and this has some of the major financial institutions running scared.</p><p>Here at home, we saw Nedbank investing a lot in PocketPOS, First National Bank (FNB) developed Cell Pay Point, Absa has Payment Peddle and Standard Bank partnered with SnapScan. Not only did the banks invest in mobile payments, but they invested in e-wallet services as well, confirming that the threat of mobile money or cashless transacting is real.</p><p>The fact is South Africa has a huge unbanked population, with some researchers estimating it as high as 67 percent, who get turned off by the banking system due to its exorbitant banking fees, Financial Intelligence Centre Act (Fica) requirements and a general lack of trust in banks.</p><p>At the same time, South Africa has one of the highest mobile penetrations in the world with 87 percent individual cellphone ownership, of which 36 percent are smartphone owners, according to Mobile in South Africa 2014 AMPS (All Media and Products Survey) Report.</p><p>I do believe that in the next couple years South Africa will see a massive switch in people's mindsets regarding mobile money, which will turn into another South African success story.</p><p>The advantages of mobile banking are endless; mobile money can give people a means of having money on them without the constant fear of losing it or being robbed. It can give them the ability to be part of a society where they can make use of a non-traditional banking system without being exploited. People can make use of their cellphones to pay for taxi fares, to buy groceries at a local corner shop, to send money to relatives, and so on.</p><p>Countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana and Zimbabwe are already ahead of us. The time has arrived for every supermarket, retailer, spaza shop, coffee shop and taxi business to embrace mobile money as another form of payment. It's also encouraging to see more local major companies, and those in the rest of the world, working on including mobile money into their business models.</p><p>From automated payments for parking, to allowing your fridge to order milk or even an automated reward system, mobile money is not just a solution for the under-banked, but the future for all. And with big tech firms like Apple, Google and Samsung getting involved in mobile banking, the industry is growing at a very rapid rate.</p><p>Regulators will be forced to adapt, which will make it possible for smaller businesses to adapt to mobile money and allow companies to launch their mobile money products. This, in turn, will contribute to the country's economic growth.</p><p>In South Africa, the biggest factors behind the slow growth of mobile money are the limitations put in place by the regulating bodies.</p><p>Another factor is the strong hold the top five banks have over the payment industry. It's almost impossible for any company to get a banking licence in South Africa. Without a banking licence or a banking partner, it is illegal for a company to start a proper mobile banking company in the country, which means the industry's growth is limited.</p><p>The country cannot delay any more and needs to jump on the bandwagon because on a larger scale, we are really talking about the critical subject of financial inclusion. People are already using alternative digital mediums as currency.</p><p>In other African countries, we find people using airtime as currency. Bitcoin is also becoming more and more popular.</p><p>I do believe that these currencies will become another form of mobile money. As banks and regulators limit the growth of mobile money, people will find different forms and means of making payments.</p><p>In the near future we will find more people accepting Bitcoin or airtime as a form of payment.</p><p>Johan Meyer is the founder and chief executive of Wallettec, a software company that assists retailers in accepting any type of mobile transaction or currency type at their point of sale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MERCSA-48301424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MERCSA2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F91-SP81-JCV0-1524-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312450</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 13, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business.News.Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001153</classCode><className>MOBILE COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

In a paper titled \u201cCompetition in the Digital Economy\u201d, the Commission outlined the importance of creating regulation in a variety of industries, including finance, telecoms, and ecommerce.  It suggested that all parties should work together to improve the digital economy.  \u201cBanks, mobile network operators and the private financial sector role-players should begin the relevant innovations and product offerings that will deliver a cashless future for South African consumers,\u201d the Commission said.  \u201cHowever, South Africa\u2019s regulatory framework has not always achieved this balance, as has been the case concerning mobile money operators and their attempts to access the payment system.\u201d  It said that mobile money operators in South Africa constitute as non-banks, which means they cannot settle and clear payments and must be sponsored by a registered bank to operate.  The Commission said that this constrains the ability of mobile operators to compete with banks, as they rely on their infrastructure and incur increased costs.  The Commission interviewed major players in the banking and telecoms industries and confirmed there were significant conflicts in the mobile money sector.  \u201cStakeholders interviewed during the Commission\u2019s banking inquiry noted that there were conflicts of interest between banks and mobile money operators which made such joint ventures difficult,\u201d the Commission said.  \u201cThe current review of the payment system regulation should consider how best barriers to entry can be lowered, whilst continuing to guard against systemic risks.\u201d  However, it noted that the regulatory design for the inevitable competition arising from the entry of tech players must be \u2018appropriate\u2019, it said.  \u201cTo prevent systemic risks, regulation should put the relevant \u2018walls\u2019 to manage potential harm if commercial and banking functions are blurred.\u201d  \u201cIt should be noted that regulating part of the market whilst ignoring a significant portion which poses a systemic risk, namely fintech and big tech, is the real systemic risk. Capturing these functions through regulation would enable better oversight and prevent shadow banking.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43052106252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TG-6MY1-F07F-84MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>MyBroadband.co.za</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Mergers &amp;

McCrohan, a managing director for business services with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \"Unless you focus on the consumer, these technologies never take off.\"</p><p>The analysts said that financial companies have put plenty of effort into developing mobile payments systems, but were divided over whether there is enough demand for innovations such as the mobile wallet - the notion that a phone could store multiple card accounts and be used to initiate contactless transactions.</p><p>\"I don't think it's going to happen,\" McCrohan said. \"It's a solution looking for a problem right now, here in the U.S.\"</p><p>One difficulty, of course, is persuading the wireless carriers to implement the needed payments hardware in their phones, and there is little progress seen in developing a business model that could spur them to do so.</p><p>\"I don't see why Visa and MasterCard have any meaningful motivation to give up economies to either the carriers or the handset manufacturers,\" said Andrew Jeffrey, a managing director for equity research at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \"I'm not a believer in mobile payments. I believe that there's a tremendous amount of smoke and absolutely no fire.\"</p><p>Others were more bullish, especially as consumers begin to realize the capabilities of smart phones.</p><p>\"As more people manage their lives using a smart phone, I think the next step is a payment of some sort,\" said Brett Huff, a research analyst with Stephens Inc. \"I think that online payments, and accessing services via mobile, will be a key driver.\"</p><p>For Greg Smith, a managing director for financial technology equity research at Duncan-Williams Inc., it all comes down to options. \"People are going to want choice, and want to use different payment types at different times,\" he said.</p><p>Eventually, \"you will be able to completely facilitate commerce on a mobile phone,\" he said, \"but I do think it will take a long time.\"</p><p>Square Inc., the start-up offering a device that lets people accept cards using Apple Inc.'s iPhones, generated plenty of discussion, much of it critical. The analysts questioned its business model, which calls for Square to accept the risk for payments accepted by its merchant clients, and its pricing, which will likely have very thin profit margins.</p><p>Despite these caveats, several people agreed that there is value is offering card acceptance to very small merchants, whether the service is provided by Square or better-known companies such as Hypercom Corp. or VeriFone Systems Inc.</p><p>Mobile acceptance is \"a pretty popular product. It's clearly something the press has picked up upon, and I think some consumers are pretty excited about it,\" said Darren Peller, a vice president and senior analyst for IT consulting and computer services with Barclays Capital. \"I think it's something that shows the use, the potential use, of mobile for payments products.\"</p><p>Smith said the value in these systems is that they \"open up a world of small-value payments, and for somebody that's taking payments infrequently, it makes perfect sense. But is that going to be a humongous market? Probably not, at the end of the day.\"</p><p>Several of the analysts criticized interchange rates, not because they are too high, but because they are too complex. \"The complexity of those is the reason that many of the acquirers are able to get away with charging somewhat egregious spreads,\" Peller said.</p><p>Jeffrey said simpler rate tables would translate into more transparency, and ultimately less discord. \"I think interchange would be less of an issue for merchants if they knew that when Greg walks in with a particular card they're going to pay X,\" he said. \"A hundred pages of interchange rules are daunting for anyone.\"</p><p>There was less agreement about whether interchange should be regulated in Washington. \"It's hard to see the benefits\" of interchange regulations being set by lawmakers, Peller said.</p><p>And lower rates are not expected to translate into lower prices at retailers. \"What happens if interchange comes down? Do they really pass that on to the consumer?\" Smith asked. \"No. They make more money. It just comes out of one hand and into the other, and the consumers lose because their rewards programs go down.\"</p><p>There was universal agreement that there will be increased M&amp;A activity among banking technology vendors, largely because there has been so little in the past year. There is now a pent-up demand for deals, and buyers are sitting on cash that needs to be spent.</p><p>However, many of the big tech providers have already been bought, or merged with each other, and Smith predicted that the next notable trend would be for major vendors to get bought by even bigger tech companies that have a broad focus and want to hone their financial services expertise.</p><p>\"To me, the next big wave is going to be an IBM or an HP making a run at one of these guys. I think that definitely will happen at some point, to get somebody like a Fiserv or an FIS, with banking expertise,\" he said. \"The HPs of the world aren't growing dramatically anyway, so they don't need huge organic growth. If they could consolidate data centers and leverage that bank domain expertise, I think that could be a valid reason.\"</p><p>The conversation took place soon after reports emerged that Fidelity National Information Services Inc. was mulling a bid to sell itself to a group of private-equity companies. Though a deal never happened, Peller said buyers are eager to invest their money.</p><p>As soon as people feel \"more comfortable that you're going to see banks continue lending, then I think you absolutely will see more deals,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-2958369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YJM-1S30-YB35-R11F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 SourceMedia, Inc.

The use of mobile wallets as a means of payment will perhaps be the biggest disruption the financial sector in the UAE has ever seen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But old habits die hard. According to UAE Central Bank figures, about 75 per cent of transactions in the country are made in cash. In fact, the UAE has about Dh65.4 billion in cash circulating outside the banking system. \"That represents about 7 per cent of the economy,\" says Maki Vekinis, CEO of Emirates Digital Wallet, a unique platform established by 16 of the UAE's leading banks, formally launched at the Seamless Middle East conference in Dubai earlier this month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Developed over two years, the initiative isn't a digital wallet product akin to Samsung Pay. \"We took a blank sheet of paper and designed a system for a society that does not need cash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"A small merchant \u2014 the barber, the taxi driver \u2014 will download the app to receive money, and over time we believe we will reach a tipping point at which you won't need cash in your pocket to walk out of your house. We want to provide something that permeates society the way WhatsApp did: through a simple SMS with a link.\"</p><p>The system, which will be rolled out in the fourth quarter, \"is an exciting and groundbreaking project for the UAE\", says Vekinis.</p><p>But there's still work to be done. \"Until today, we have not seen the scale and ubiquity that we all dream of in terms of a mobile wallet solution,\" says Lutfi N. Zakhour, Senior Vice-President at consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton.</p><p>Teaching mobile  </p><p>Awareness is key for all stakeholders. \"We see banks playing a greater role in educating merchants of the benefits of using a mobile wallet,\" says B. Chandrasekhar, CEO of Arab Financial Services Company, which handles outsourced payment processing for banks across the GCC.</p><p>It's not just retailers \u2014 the people buying from them need to be brought into the loop too. \"We just assume that everybody knows how an m-wallet works. I can tell you that's not true at all.\"</p><p>One of the biggest challenges is consumer adoption. For Aref Al Ramli, Head of Digital Banking and Innovation at Mashreq Bank, it's a simple matter of value \u2014 for consumers and merchants. \"Whatever solution that goes out there has to be much cheaper than the current process [of e-payments and plastic] and it has to offer more value than paying with cash in hand.\"</p><p>The price of doing business with cash \u2014 for merchants and customers \u2014 is often underestimated.</p><p>Cash costs more</p><p>\"If you take the cost of processing cash for the bank and imagine how much money it could save, would you incentivise by giving a 5 per cent cashback on a digital transaction? Because if they do a digital transaction, you're going to save 5 per cent of your cost at least.\"</p><p>Banks would save on running branches, having queues, having cash tills, having tellers. There's also the time that goes into counting cash repeatedly, even with machines helping. \"Not only are you [the bank] doing that, the Central Bank is also counting the same cash,\" adds Chandrasekhar.</p><p>Game of money</p><p>Emirates Digital Wallet is aiming at something that represents the best of both worlds: matching the positive aspects of using notes and coins <br/>with the convenience of a smart device. \"I believe that by masking technology and making it fun to use \u2014 which we call gamification \u2014 it will appeal,\" says Vekinis.</p><p>\"If you look at the successful apps and the behaviour of people using these apps including that of small shop owners, we realise that it has to be intuitive, simplistic and one-dimensional.</p><p>When you put your hand into a pocket to pay at a shop, you give a Dh100 note. So we're thinking of a sliding Dh100 note appearing on your screen as you pay, then the change comes automatically. We're thinking of how to maximise the fun of using the app.\"</p><p>The data's in the details</p><p>One of the major benefits of a mobile wallet is the data it will reap for banks and payment processors. The information will help service providers offer tailored options or add-ons to their customers.</p><p>\"For example, if I book a flight to London, you [a service provider] can give me options for hiring a car, hotels and discounts at certain shops,\" says Chandrasekhar. \"That is the part of data that has been unleashed in other countries.\"</p><p>It's for this reason that his company has invested in its own analytics engine.</p><p>\"We can see both sides of the transaction \u2014 merchant and customer. We tell our banking clients: If you segment the data well, you can know in anticipation of the customer's travel exactly what they need. The engine can provide prompts on what you should offer your customers.\"</p><p>For the Arab Financial Services CEO, it's from here that a winner in the mobile wallet war will emerge. \"If you know exactly what a customer wants, you can tailor cashbacks and rewards accordingly so that he/she spends the maximum amount with your wallet, not a competitor's.\"</p><p>Challenges</p><p>With great amounts of data comes great responsibility. A year from now, the General Data Protection Regulation will come into effect in the EU. Does the UAE need something similar?</p><p>\"From a bank's perspective, we already have a huge amount of data coming in from customers today,\" says Al Ramli.</p><p>There's a big question of consent too.</p><p>\"Personally, if I'm sharing my name, transaction amount and value, I think that's fine,\" says Chandrasekhar. \"However, I would not be comfortable with giving you my demographic data.\" He believes a government directive addressing data privacy is in the works.</p><p>More fundamental than privacy is basic cybersecurity. \"What we are launching \u2014 all service providers \u2014 is something that turns a single smartphone into a platform,\" says Vekinis. \"The most important thing is to secure the app to the platform and double-secure the platform itself so there's no leakage of information.\"</p><p>Moreover, there are 1.3 million unbanked people in the UAE. This segment of society may include a large number who Vekinis calls \"invisible\" \u2014 those working in the back of restaurants, gardeners, painters and drivers. \"These people will gain a presence.\"</p><p>Q&amp;A \u00d6zgur \u00d6zvardar, Vice-President and GM, Middle East and North Africa at Verifone</p><p>What are the biggest challenges for m-payments?</p><p>The sector is growing every day. The biggest challenge it [faces] is cash. We have to convince people to move to e-payments. It can be with a plastic card, a mobile phone, a watch or something else. In order to convince them, first we have to make sure it is secure enough. People have to know that.</p><p>How can people be incentivised towards this?</p><p>We have to show them the benefits. Instead of having tonnes of cash in your pocket, why not use your card or phone? If you do, you will have some benefits. For example, in Turkey, where I'm from, card penetration is high [because] we have instalments and loyalty programmes to entice people.</p><p>The big tech firms have their own m-wallets. What's the future for consumers?</p><p>I think there is room for everyone. Samsung, Apple and Google came out with their wallets, but there is traditional business done by the banks. I don't think that one will win over the other one.

Offices are shut, our mass transit metros, cars, ships, and most trains and planes, are idling, some rusting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this extraordinary period, five things stand out for me, all of them connected by a thread that started 25 years ago.</p><p>One, the world is working from home. Well, some of it, anyway, a privileged minority. At my home, the typical day sees three two-way video sessions and an HD or 4K streaming TV session on. I've just upgraded my Airtel 100 Mbps fiber link to 200 Mbps, and now I'm getting amazing offers to move to 1 Gbps JioFiber. I've also moved to a mesh network to get stable WiFi everywhere, and noted that the devices reached me with the now-mandated sticker, \"Country of Origin: China.\" I've had to ensure working backup power so there's no downtime. But this is nothing compared to what India's USD 191 billion IT-BPM industry had to do to suddenly move to work from home, enabling most of its million-odd tech workers with stable, secure connectivity, and convincing clients that their data was secure. But first, the industry had to convince to DoT to let it work from home, and a reluctant DoT allowed relaxation in its OSP license conditions but demanding that all agents use VPNs, with draconian penalties for violations.</p><p>Two, my daughter is studying online. My driver's son is not, like over 1.5 million other school kids in Delhi alone. This exposes a stark digital divide in our society, between kids who have dedicated devices and fast internet access, and those who don't - and schools that can do online classes and those that can't. My school alumni batch struggled to identify a Rs 25k-laptop (we finally managed a pilot AMD-based HP unit at Rs 28k) and are trying to raise funds for laptops for 34 other kids we sponsor at our alma mater in Delhi. Another batch from the same school has donated 100 tablets. Yet most of the kids don't have their own space to study in. Many kids are in one-room homes where parents are struggling with loss of income, and are cutting back on meals. And all this leaves tens of millions of kids in India offline, wasting a year, while kids in richer homes move ahead. India has nearly 300 million kids in 1.4 million schools and 51,000 colleges. Can we get devices to all the kids, along with 4G connectivity, within this lockdown year? Probably not.</p><p>Three, not everyone can work from home, and of India's 450 million migrants, some 50 to 100 million lost their jobs and attempted a very difficult journey home, many on foot, when the lockdown was announced abruptly with a few hours' warning. Working with or fundraising for migrant support groups, I realized how difficult it was to even identify those migrants and send them money. The government says it sent some money by direct benefit transfer into the Jan-Dhan accounts of 330 million poor, and that is amazing, but sadly migrants who walked hundreds of miles home couldn't access that money then. We need a digital revolution to get them to be able to get to their own money anytime and spend it digitally without needing an ATM. That is work in progress, but it's centered around the smart, connected mobile device that half our adult population carries. We need to get that device and connectivity to the other half.</p><p>Four, India's commerce has gone digital suddenly, well beyond just payments, something that didn't really happen even after demonetization in 2016. Entire ecosystems are going contactless in 2020: commerce, delivery, bookings, dining. Imagine the challenges of measuring and ensuring the quality of service, something has done thus far only for the underlying mobile telecom network. Many techs and logistics innovations are driving all this, with startups and bigger players in the fray enabling MSMEs struggling to survive (and yes, some of those small businesses have died). Even kirana stores, traditionally resistant to tech and at loggerheads with GST, have had to adopt jugaad solutions like WhatApp groups and mobile wallets. And everyone's trying to enable those kiranas - Amazon and Flipkart included. And significantly, Jio Mart. But Jio is another story.</p><p>And that is my story number five. Jio. The star of 2020. In the lockdown when companies were shrinking, retrenching or shutting shop, Reliance was raising money to go debt-free. From April to July, it raised USD 21 billion, or nearly Rs 153,000 crore, selling a total of 33% equity stake in Jio Platforms to Facebook (nearly 10%), Google (7.7%), Intel, Qualcomm, and a range of private equity and sovereign funds. From its 2016 entry into a crowded market of nine incumbents (which magically shrunk to three by 2019) Jio has had a remarkable ride. With its legacy-free 4G-LTE network, data-ravenous customer base, and amazing ability to move obstacles and competition out of the way, including its apparent influence on public policy, Jio has truly transformed internet adoption in India. Can it tech-enabled and transform the small business and kirana?</p><p>The mobile phone and 4G networks have transformed connectivity and empowered millions, but in 2020, they've helped aggravate the digital divide for 300 million students.</p><p>That mobile call 25 years ago was a small step on a journey that has changed our country in once-unimaginable ways, from its economy to its politics. The mobile phone and 4G networks have helped replace dozens of our old tools and brought information, services, banking and payments, education, even healthcare to those who can pay. Telecom-powered services and platforms have brought information closer to citizens, but they've also helped flood them with news that is confusing, misleading, and often fake. They've transformed connectivity and empowered millions, but in 2020, they've helped aggravate the digital divide for 300 million students.</p><p>As we step into the next 25 years, the first five years will see over a billion Indians becoming 4G smartphone owners. And maybe 5G, a technology set to be transformative in as big away as the first mobile phone was a quarter-century ago. As we go there, the telecom industry and the powerful platforms that will ride on it, have their work cut out. So do their regulators - not merely DoT but myriad others including the Competition Commission, sectoral regulators like the RBI, and others yet to be formed: the Data Protection Authority, the Non-Personal Data Authority. The words from the US Congressional hearings where Big Tech was grilled might right a bell in India too: \"We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\"</p><p>The transformation of the world's largest democracy into a thriving, egalitarian society and global economic powerhouse is work in progress: we haven't reached base camp yet, and the peak is far away. And some the real heavy lifting has to be done by the telecom industry.</p><p>The author Prasanto K Roy, a public policy consultant, and tech columnist was chief editor for Voice&amp;Data and other CyberMedia publications for over a decade </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VO&amp;DTA-0054506946</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VO&amp;DTA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WM-9MV1-JB5M-W1T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">371440</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1249\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Voice &amp; Data, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Voice &amp; Data</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D15W</classCode><className>THIS DAY IN HISTORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001696</classCode><className>TELECOMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST00097Z0</classCode><className>HOME BASED EMPLOYMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPQ3</classCode><className>DIGITAL DIVIDE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DPHO</classCode><className>VIRTUAL EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000515</classCode><className>DISTANCE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000078</classCode><className>ALUMNI</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZEMTBFNzIxQTI3NEE1MkEwMTEwQTQ1QzM3QzhDMkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzMyRkUwN0EzNzQ2NENEMUJEMDY4MEYxRjJCNzUxODE</classCode><className>Alumni</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001005</classCode><className>LAPTOP COMPUTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001570</classCode><className>SHORT RANGE WIRELESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001845</classCode><className>WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N485110CC</classCode><className>URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N516000CC</classCode><className>INTERNET BROADCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

And one of those reasons is the behavioral advertising model it's often manipulative. So we have to think about how these businesses are incentivized and structured if we want to get to the root cause of massive surveillance in our economy today.'So declared FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra at a hearing[1] on online platforms and market power last week. Chopra, who's earned a reputation[2] as a crusader in his short term thus far, was opening the door to a far deeper conversation about Big Tech than one usually hears in Washington, even in the midst of the so-called 'techlash.' </p><p>To Chopra, fighting back against the dominance of these firms is not just a matter of marginal tweaks; it means asking fundamental questions about what abuses against the public we, as a society, are willing to permit in the name of making money.Would that actual legislators had Chopra's spine. Indeed, three days before Chopra's testimony, on the morning before the October Democratic debate, the New Democrat Coalition\u2014the largest congressional sub-caucus within the Democratic Party\u2014endorsed the Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act[3], or H.R. 2013.A major endorsement of a data privacy bill might sound like a good thing. But if H.R. 2013 winds up as the vehicle to which the House and the Senate can both consent, it would be a disaster for everyday Americans. H.R. 2013 is not trying to actually temper the tech industry's worst abuses. It is instead a tactical shield for the powerful, meant to provide cover for the industry and governments to encroach ever further on Americans' freedoms, while neutralizing organized dissent. What the Bill Does The United States really does need strong data privacy protections. A slew of high-profile data abuses from giant corporations have highlighted the cost of inaction, be it major breaches[4] (Equifax), political tumult[5] (Facebook and Cambridge Analytica), or profiteering off children's navet[6] (YouTube and Google). But H.R. 2013 does nothing to address these problems. Instead, it simply directs companies to 'provide affirmative[7], express, and opt-in consent[8]' to any data-gathering function that comes with their service.In other words, this bill would give you the opportunity to see how a corporation plans to exploit your personal data\u2014and require that you provide your consent\u2014but not the means to stop it. It doesn't force companies to cease their abusive practices, or institute new safeguards against personal-data breaches. It certainly isn't providing users with a right to be forgotten[9], or the power to meaningfully control the amount of information Big Tech can sell about you.H.R. 2013 believes the problem with mass surveillance is not the surveillance itself\u2014just that people might not know it's happening.That's the most charitable interpretation of the bill's intent. The real meat of H.R. 2013 comes in the second-to-last section, which states that it would 'preempt,' or override, state-level privacy laws. For one thing, that could salt the earth of the nascent movement against facial recognition technology sprouting in cities[10] like Oakland, San Francisco, and Somerville, Massachusetts. But the primary target of this preemption language is the California Consumer Privacy Act[11], which goes into effect next year.The CCPA not only grants Californians a right to be forgotten, it even lets them opt out of data tracking entirely while still using an internet service. Come January, the state's web surfers might actually be able to use Google without it spying on them.This would be truly unprecedented\u2014a 'disruption' of the tech industry, if you will. It represents a fundamentally different way of thinking about not just privacy, but fairness in a market economy. Implicit in H.R. 2013's disclosure-based regime is a belief that as long as an individual knows their privacy is being violated, they shouldn't get to complain about it. If you know that Google is spying on you, it's your own damn fault for continuing to use Google even though it's almost impossible[12] in our monopolistic, internet-centered world to get by without any of the company's services.As I[13] and others[14]\u2014even up to presidential candidate Andrew Yang[15]\u2014have argued elsewhere, this 'buyer beware' system is based on magical thinking. It's only reasonable in an imagined world where alternatives to the Big Tech giants are plentiful, big business fights fair against smaller competitors, and every single consumer is a well-trained privacy attorney capable of poring through and interpreting disclosure forms.Contrast this with the CCPA's privacy regime: By providing the right to opt out of data tracking, that law doesn't foist the responsibility for our privacy-absent world onto the victims. Instead, it actually cares about the little guy's situation, and sets policy based on the public's needs rather than what massive corporations consider 'fair.' It should, therefore, come as no surprise that the industry wants it squashed.This is the main reason the tech industry and its allies in Washington have been pushing for a national privacy bill lately. They haven't suddenly repented for their actions; they are scared that if they don't quickly spit out a do-nothing bill with the words 'data privacy' slapped onto it somewhere, other states and future progressive administrations might try to pass the real thing. And the real thing could threaten their profits. The New Democrats and Consensus You know that H.R. 2013 is a handout to the tech industry when you look at its backers. The bill was introduced by Representative Suzan DelBene (D-WA), the New Democrat Coalition's vice chair for policy coordination (how telling that it took seven months for her own caucus to endorse it), and a former Microsoft executive.From 1989 through 1998, she filled a host of roles at the original tech monopolist[16], including business and product management for the once-dominant Windows 95 operating system, and early versions of the Internet Explorer web browser. After trying her hand at entrepreneurship, DelBene returned to Microsoft to run its mobile division[17], before giving politics a shot a few years later.DelBene's press release[18] introducing the bill in March included an endorsement from the trade group BSA | The Software Alliance, which counts[19] Apple, Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, and Adobe among its members. Right above the BSA lobbyist's quote are a few words from Daniel Castro, a vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.ITIF doesn't disclose funding sources, which is never a good sign, but trackers at the Center for Public Integrity[20] have spotted tens of thousands from tech trade groups flowing into ITIF over the years. Google lists[21] ITIF as a funding recipient in its own disclosures. DelBene is an 'honorary co-chair[22]' of ITIF's board. Journalists[23] and policy experts[24] have mocked the way ITIF's findings just happen to line up with the industry's desires for years, including on privacy: In October, Castro pleaded[25] for a 'U.S. digital single market,' saying 'preemption is key' to avoid the absolute horror of overlapping digital-privacy standards. This is exactly the argument tech lobbyists have been making to shove bills like H.R. 2013 through Congress. Castro's co-author, Alan McQuinn, just revolved back into Congress[26] as a staffer on the House Science Committee.Moreover, ITIF has long-standing connections to the New Democrat Coalition. ITIF's founder, Robert Atkinson, was previously a vice president at the Progressive Policy Institute, the de facto think tank for New Democrats. According to his ITIF bio[27], he ran programs on broadband, e-commerce, privacy, and telecommunications, much like the work ITIF does today.The last 30 years have shown that the pro-market solutions which the New Democrats and their allies stand for only drive inequality, monopolization, and stagnancy. Even under a Democrat, Reaganomics is Reaganomics. Now that the tech industry is feeling unprecedented heat, they're hoping that New Democrats and their allies can do what they do best\u2014'get things done,' even if those 'things' are really nothing at all.The public shouldn't fall for it. Populist political candidates are surging, and tech encroaches more and more into our everyday lives. The sort of marginal tweaking and political gamesmanship that has sustained the New Democrats and their corporate allies for a generation simply isn't tolerable anymore. When America passes a national data privacy bill, it ought to actually ensure privacy\u2014not protection for the powerful.

Im selben Zug erfolgt die Migration der europ\u00e4ischen Gro\u00dfbetragszahlungssysteme Target2 und Euro1 auf den ISO-20022-Standard, der die Verarbeitungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von Zahlungsverkehrsdaten wesentlich verbessert. Soweit die regulatorische Seite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Immer mehr in Echtzeit</p><p>Marktseitig ist von einer weiteren Expansion von Echtzeit-Zahlungen auszugehen, die zunehmend zur neuen internationalen Norm werden. Dabei nimmt die Wettbewerbsintensit\u00e4t mit dem Einstieg der Big Techs aus den USA und China (Alibaba, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Tencent) sowie zahlreicher Fintechs dramatisch zu. Gerade die deutschen Banken mit ihrer guten Position im Zahlungsverkehr m\u00fcssen sich also gleichzeitig auf die grundlegende Modernisierung der Kerninfrastruktur des Eurosystems sowie ein sich schnell und drastisch ver\u00e4nderndes globales Umfeld vorbereiten.</p><p>Diese Ver\u00e4nderungen sind Teil eines beispiellosen globalen Umbruchs, getrieben von Regulierung, Digitalisierung und ver\u00e4nderten Kundenpr\u00e4ferenzen. Galt der Zahlungsverkehr jahrzehntelang als eher glanzloses, weil technisch trockenes Gesch\u00e4ftsfeld, so hat das vergangene Jahrzehnt eine grundlegende Neubewertung gebracht: Zahlungsdienstleistungen sind inzwischen ein zentraler Wettbewerbsfaktor.</p><p>Big Tech versus Banken</p><p>Zahlungsverkehr ist ein nat\u00fcrlicher, h\u00e4ufig t\u00e4glicher Kontaktpunkt von Privat- und Gesch\u00e4ftskunden zur Bank - und zum europ\u00e4ischen Einigungsprojekt: N\u00e4mlich dann, wenn wir B\u00fcrger unsere hartverdienten Euros irgendwo auf die Theke legen oder - immer h\u00e4ufiger - automatisch per NFC oder App \u00fcberweisen. Und nicht zuletzt zeigen die j\u00fcngsten Versuche, den Zahlungsverkehr politisch zu instrumentalisieren, die geopolitische Komponente dieses Themas.</p><p>Deshalb ist der Einstieg der Big Techs nicht zu untersch\u00e4tzen. Mit ihren propriet\u00e4ren, vertikal wie horizontal skalierbaren Plattformen schaffen sie eigene \u00d6kosysteme, die \u00fcber Skalen- und Verbundeffekte rasch Marktanteile gewinnen k\u00f6nnen. Teils sto\u00dfen sie schon ins Kerngesch\u00e4ft von Banken vor. So vergeben PayPal und Amazon inzwischen auch kleinere Gesch\u00e4ftsdarlehen an dort akkreditierte H\u00e4ndler und nutzen dabei deren Daten. Teils machen sie, Stichwort Libra, sogar den Zentralbanken Konkurrenz - oder versuchen es zumindest.</p><p>Werden sich Zahler und Zahlungsempf\u00e4nger nur noch innerhalb geschlossener \u00d6kosysteme bewegen k\u00f6nnen, also in der Apple-, Android- oder Amazon-Welt, wie der zust\u00e4ndige Bundesbank-Vorstand Burkhard Balz mehrfach fragte? Und wie werden dort die Interessen der europ\u00e4ischen Verbraucher und Unternehmen am Schutz ihrer Daten ber\u00fccksichtigt? Darauf m\u00fcssen Aufsichts-, Kartell- und Verbraucherschutzbeh\u00f6rden Antworten finden. Aber auch die traditionellen Kreditinstitute werden, so ist zu hoffen, noch ein gewichtiges Wort bei der Zukunft des Zahlungsverkehrs mitsprechen.</p><p>Zwei gute Nachrichten vorweg: Erstens, der elektronische Zahlungsverkehr expandiert seit Jahren dynamisch und die Wachstumsaussichten sind weiterhin gut. Zweitens, Europa ist diesmal vorne mit dabei. Um davon zu profitieren, d\u00fcrfen die Banken jedoch Themen wie die Target2-Konsoliderung, die ISO-20022-Migration und Echtzeitzahlungen nicht als Pflicht\u00fcbung, sondern m\u00fcssen sie als Chance begreifen, bestehende Gesch\u00e4ftsprozesse und -modelle weiterzuentwickeln. Die Steigerung der Geschwindigkeit, Kosten- und Prozess-Effizienz sowie Transparenz von Zahlungsverkehrsdiensten bieten ein enormes Potenzial f\u00fcr die Kundenbindung und die M\u00f6glichkeit, diesen Kontaktpunkt zu einer wertvollen Kundenerfahrung zu machen - zu einer bereichernden \"Customer Journey\".</p><p>Rasche Migration von Vorteil</p><p>Ein Beispiel ist die weltweite Umstellung auf ISO 20022, die zeitgleich zur Target2-Konsolidierung in Europa stattfindet. W\u00e4hrend das Eurosystem eine \"Big Bang\"-Umstellung vorsieht, gew\u00e4hrt Swift eine vierj\u00e4hrige Periode der Koexistenz von ISO 20022- und MT-Formaten. Dennoch bringt eine fr\u00fchzeitige Migration auf den ISO-Standard zahlreiche Vorteile: Die Datenqualit\u00e4t nimmt zu, die Anzahl von Compliance-R\u00fcckfragen ab, Automatisierungsgrad und Interoperabilit\u00e4t mit anderen Dienstleistern steigen.</p><p>Von der Pflicht zur K\u00fcr</p><p>Ein anderes Beispiel sind Echtzeitzahlungen. Erst j\u00fcngst wurde von der Europ\u00e4ischen Zentralbank, Swift und einer Gruppe von 19 Banken als Nutzern der Target Instant Payments Settlement-Plattform (Tips) ein Pilotprojekt mit internationalen Zahlungen nach Europa abgeschlossen. Dabei hat eine Zahlung aus Singapur, die in Deutschland abgewickelt wurde, bereits eine Geschwindigkeit von 41 Sekunden erreicht. Eine weitere Chance, die Customer Journey im globalen Zahlungsverkehr zum Echtzeiterlebnis zu machen.</p><p>Doch vor die K\u00fcr hat die Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rde die Pflicht gesetzt: Bis 31. M\u00e4rz 2020 sollten die deutschen Banken der Bundesbank melden, welchen der beiden vom Eurosystem lizenzierten Netzwerkdienstleister - zu denen auch Swift geh\u00f6rt - sie f\u00fcr den Zugang zum Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway (ESMIG) w\u00e4hlen. Ein wichtiger Schritt in die neue Welt des europ\u00e4ischen Zahlungsverkehrs!</p><p>----</p><p>J\u00fcrgen Marstatt ist Head of Swift Germany, Austria &amp; Europe Central.

Some advocates have proposed using the charter to pursue industrial policy or to end shadow banking. Some regulators have proposed giving financial technology firms bank charters, potentially breaking down the traditionally high walls between banking and commerce. An empirical survey of chartering decisions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency suggests that chartering is best understood as an ultracautious licensing regime for \"fit and proper\" applicants.

Policy Implications CONCLUSION</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>One of the consequences of the 2007-2008 financial crisis was that it became all but impossible to start a new bank in the United States, although this policy was never publicly articulated by anyone. To found a bank, you must obtain deposit insurance and a bank charter, both of which require approval by the government. (1) However, stung by the number of relatively young banks that failed during the crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stopped giving out deposit insurance and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the main federal regulator that charters banks, did not formally respond to any charter application for years. (2)</p><p>The prohibition against start-up banking could not last forever, and--again, without notice--recently, the FDIC has grudgingly started to do something about granting deposit insurance to newly chartered banks, or at least say something about the subject. (3) The OCC has cautiously moved towards granting new charters for banks, and even for some technology firms that are not banks. (4) The Chair of the FDIC said in a speech that a \"priority of mine is encouraging de novo bank formation;\" (5) in all, this led to fifteen approvals for new banks in 2018 and nine more in 2019. (6)</p><p>The apparent end of the no-charter era calls for a reassessment. How should the government use its charter-granting powers, now that it has apparently decided that new banks are permitted? Academics and regulators have come to entirely different views. A number of banking law scholars have argued that the charter should be given out parsimoniously and in exchange for a commitment by new banks (and old ones for that matter) to various public goals. (7)</p><p>The OCC has taken the opposite view. Rather than using the charter to narrow and direct the banking industry, it has announced that defining \"that which we call a bank\" (8) should be broadened to make room for financial technology (or \"fintech\") companies as well as regular, brick-and-mortar banks. (9) That means, as the Obama White House put it, companies making use of a \"wide spectrum of technological innovations which impact a broad range of financial activities, including payments, investment management, capital raising, deposits and lending, insurance, regulatory compliance, and other activities in the financial services space,\" might also be able to obtain a banking license. (10)</p><p>Unlike other corporations, which are entitled to a corporate charter essentially on demand, bank charters have always been difficult to obtain. (11) While corporate charters today permit corporations to operate for \"any lawful purpose,\" (12) bank charters are only available for companies engaged in the \"business of banking\" (13)--to the OCC that means taking deposits, making loans, or offering checking services--and only after considering the \"convenience and needs of the community to be served.\" (14) Those are only the start of the requirements. To even apply for a charter, as Bob Hockett and Saule Omarova have explained, \"[b]ank organizers are required to submit detailed financial information, business plans, and performance projections in order to convince chartering authorities of their ability to provide banking services in a safe and sound manner. (15)</p><p>This involved application process presents a challenge for anyone hoping to start up a \"normal\" bank. The OCC has occasionally experimented with the chartering of \"special\" banks--banks that perform some, but not all, of the functions of a normal bank. (16) These banks might hold money in trust, but not make loans or issue credit cards. (17)</p><p>On July 31, 2018, the OCC began accepting applications for its newest proposal for a special bank--the fintech charter. (18) Joseph Otting, the head of the Agency, said that \"[t]he decision to consider applications for special purpose national bank charters from innovative companies helps provide more choices to consumers and businesses, and creates greater opportunity for companies that want to provide banking services in America.\" (19) The nascent national fintech charter has support from the Democrat and Republican Comptrollers of the Currency who preceded Otting. (20) The Treasury Department has also expressed support, predicting that peer-to-peer lenders and payments processors might be particularly well served by the charter. (21)</p><p>The fintech charter has opponents as well, especially those who are concerned that fintech charters could obliterate the traditional distinction between banking and commerce. Some of the largest fintech operations in the country include PayPal, Amazon's payment system, and Apple and Google's wallets. (22) Should these firms have bank charters? They could then compete against banks in every way, rather than only through payment processing, which would make them ultimate \"shadow banks.\" (23) Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) have argued that \"[offering a new charter to nonbank companies seems at odds with the goals of financial stability, financial inclusion, consumer protection, and separation of banking and commerce.\" (24) State banking supervisors have posited that \"[a]n OCC fintech charter is a regulatory train wreck in the making\" and have sued, with some success, to stop it from happening. (25) Karen Petrou, a leading financial policy analyst, has concluded that people are likely to get \"hurt\" by the fintech charter. (26)</p><p>The banking charter has thus become the centerpiece of an argument about what chartered institutions should do for the rest of the economy. The chartering process also illustrates a remarkable divergence--worryingly common in banking regulation--between the law as written and the law as it is actually applied.</p><p>I argue that the best way to understand the OCC's chartering practice, at least as expressed through its written orders, is that it is engaged in \"fit and proper\" regulation, determining whether the promoters of a new bank are sufficiently experienced, adequately capitalized, and disinclined to break the law. (27) Chartering as practiced is not a philosophical debate about what banking is and should be, but a business viability analysis. When the OCC does grant a charter, it does so in a pro forma letter, without many conditions (though there are usually some) or even applications of the law to the facts of the submission. (28) It does not suggest that it is making decisions on policy grounds. (29)</p><p>But while writing an order approving or denying a chartering application looks easy, the actual application process is, it turns out, quite hard. Lawyers will tell you that behind the orders there is also a searching inquiry into the quality and viability of the business plan of the would-be bank and the track record of its managers. While the test is best characterized as a fit and proper test, (30) because it focuses on the management team and the business plan, it is certainly fit and proper with teeth.</p><p>This caution on chartering new banks also applies--it seems so far--to the OCC's approach to fintech. Rather than fully committing to the revolutionary promise of the fintech charter, the OCC has moved slowly in developing it. (31) Previous special charters have not exactly transformed the financial industry; they have largely gone to subsidiaries of already extant banks, offering established incumbents the chance to add services such as credit cards or trust deposits to their customers. (32) Nor has the OCC dispensed these charters easily or broadly. The OCC's approach to the fintech charter should be welcomed.</p><p>In documenting these practices, this Article provides the first comprehensive account of how chartering works on the ground since Kenneth Scott's government-funded analysis of the charter in 1975 appeared in the University of Chicago Law Review. (33)</p><p>It also offers four actionable prescriptions to policymakers. The first is directed to the OCC and FDIC, which should issue guidance reflecting their willingness to entertain charter applications by new banks, guidance that they can update when they feel that conditions warrant. The ban on start-up banking from 2010-2018 has been nothing less than secret law, and there is no good reason not to publicly announce a halt on accepting banking applications if regulators feel economic conditions warrant it--and, by the same token, to publicly update that guidance when conditions have improved.</p><p>The second is directed at courts, which should, the next time they hear a dispute over a charter grant, definitively apply Chevron deference and \"hard look\" review to the decision by the regulators. This is the ordinary standard for licensing decisions, but one that has not been articulated or applied to chartering decisions by the OCC, where instead lawyers have apparently concluded that a vague super-deference is the appropriate standard. (34)</p><p>The third is also directed at courts, which should conclude that the fintech charter, as OCC has articulated it, should be deemed to be within the power of the Agency and a reasonable interpretation of its statutory authority, with some promise to offer consumers inexpensive access to financial services. Once the actual practice of federal bank chartering is understood, the decision by the OCC to proceed with a fintech charter looks sober and defensible. Fintechs are not dissimilar to the credit card banks that OCC already charters, and that do not, like fintech charters, take much in the way of deposits. (35)</p><p>The fourth is directed at Congress, which should, if it wishes to have firms such as Amazon enter the business of banking (as Amazon's Chinese equivalent has done in China), (36) pass a fintech chartering act expressing its permission.</p><p>Extending the banking charter to big tech would be the sort of major question for which banking regulators alone should not be responsible. The OCC has been given the power to define what a bank should do--the Supreme Court has held that \"the 'business of banking' is not limited to the enumerated powers\" listed in the OCC's governing statute \"and that the Comptroller therefore has discretion to authorize activities beyond those specifically enumerated.\" (37) But the OCC has never given out charters willy-nilly; it has insisted that its charter holders perform \"at least one of the following three core banking functions: receiving deposits; paying checks; or lending money,\" (38) and it has almost always prohibited firms engaged in other businesses from offering some of those core banking functions. (39)</p><p>As Chief Justice John Marshall observed, there are differences between \"those important subjects, which must be entirely regulated by the legislature itself, from those of less interest, in which a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act under such general provisions to fill up the details.\" (40) Chartering fintechs that only do finance--a hot but small part of the financial marketplace (41)--is consistent with the OCC's legal authority to define the details of the business of banking. Chartering Amazon's payment system, however, would be a major question requiring congressional authorization before being undertaken by the OCC.</p><p>In what follows, I first review the law of charter applications. (42) I then consider the recent calls for more constraints on the bank charter and pair them with a broader critique of licensing that has spurred litigation and criticism of anticompetitive and bureaucratic state occupational licensing components. (43) suggest that banking--a dangerous, but heavily regulated activity (44)--offers a good test of the general value of licensing in the modern administrative state. I then turn to the empirical account of the actual practice of the OCC when it comes to charter grants using legal, qualitative, and mildly quantitative methods. (45) After that, I turn to the Agency's efforts to create a fintech charter, nascent though they are, and conclude with an evaluation of the policy benefits and costs of that charter. (46) A brief conclusion follows.</p><p>I. THE LAW OF CHARTERING</p><p>Chartering creates a bank, and with it, an intensely regulated relationship with the government that begins with the searching examination of charter applicants and continues with the high-touch supervision bank regulators impose on banks during their existence. Holding a charter nonetheless has its appeal, especially because it, and it alone, offers \"the ability to take deposits from the public, which provides an extremely cheap source of funding,\" as Michael Barr, Howell Jackson, and Margaret Tahyar have put it. (47) Banks pay depositors--especially these days--very little by way of interest, while other businesses cannot hope to borrow as inexpensively. (48)</p><p>The OCC's authority to grant charters comes from the National Banking Act, which outlines the Agency's powers, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which requires banks seeking deposit insurance to obtain a charter. (49) The Agency's practice for assessing charter applications follows two steps. (50) First, it considers whether to grant preliminary conditional approval for organizers who seek to create a new bank. (51) Second, final approval requires that the organizers establish over the course of a year that they have met the standards of the OCC, as set forth in its regulations, and the conditions imposed in the conditional approval order, if any. (52) Final approval means that \"the bank can begin to conduct banking business.\" (53) Preliminary approval allows the organizers of a would-be bank to raise capital and begin to meet the Comptroller's regulatory requirements. (54)</p><p>The OCC has said that in evaluating a charter application, it considers whether the organizers are familiar with OCC regulations, are competent, have created a board of directors with the ability to understand the types of services that the bank seeks to provide, and that the bank has provided for sufficient capital to meet the requirements of the organizers' business plan. (55) It rejects applications where there is a risk of immediate recourse to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund. (56) More controversially, it also is required to consider \"[t]he convenience and needs of the community to be served.\" (57) This public interest standard is one of the chief legal hooks on which bank reformers have hung the idea that banks should be compelled to take on public duties--though meeting it has not appeared to induce regulators to gesture at such a conclusion in the past.</p><p>The most important factors for the Agency--both as evidenced in its orders and application materials and as sensed by would-be applicants--concern the business plan of the bank and the experience of the promoters behind it. (58) Unlike the case with corporate chartering, where anyone can create a corporation for any lawful purpose, the OCC expects the organizing group behind a bank charter application to include promoters with diverse business and financial interests and even a degree of community involvement. (59) Factors that may be considered in assessing the quality of the application include size of the organizing group, the history of that group, and the group's choice of chief executive officer. (60)</p><p>In all, the OCC's licensing manual on charters amounts to 131 pages of requirements that banks must meet, making it fair to say that the ability to create a bank is considerably more constrained than the ability to create a nonbank corporation. (61) Moreover, the manual is no checklist--would-be charter holders must meet with OCC officials and present their case for the chartering application. (62) Feedback will be given, making the application process a meeting-oriented and iterative one. (63) Moreover, received applications are opened for a period of public comment, meaning that potential competitors can weigh in with criticism of the application. (64)</p><p>Once the meetings are concluded, the application completed, and the data provided, the OCC renders its decision without any trial-type process or opportunity for discovery or cross-examination. (65) The Comptroller is not required to hold a hearing on the record or make findings of fact in assessing charter applications. (66)</p><p>All of this results in a relatively concise order either granting or denying the charter application offered in a letter format, as we will see in Part III. The Supreme Court once called this sort of decision \"curt\" as it affirmed it. (67)</p><p>In addition to obtaining a charter from the OCC, the FDIC also must agree to insure any depositary institutions; (68) its willingness to do so is also a constraint, and the application process for deposit insurance is intensive and document heavy. (69) The Federal Deposit Insurance application is a forty-three-page-long list of requirements, including requests for information about management, capital, the needs of the community, the assets held by the financial institution, its information systems, and a set of certifications and pledges by the promoters of the institution, including oaths that must be taken by the directors of the bank that they will see to their \"legal responsibility and ... fiduciary duty to shareholders to administer the depository institution's affairs faithfully and to oversee its management.\" (70) All of this is in some ways duplicative of the charter application--but there is no question that any would-be national bank has two hurdles to surmount from the different regulators: charter approval and deposit insurance approval.</p><p>Judicial review of the OCC's denial of a charter is available, though that review has traditionally been limited--Barr, Tahyar, and Jackson have called it \"extraordinary deference.\" (71) As the Eighth Circuit has explained,</p><p>[T]he trend is for courts to grant some type of judicial review in many of these administrative type proceedings which concern the granting of licenses .... a brand of limited review.... The action of the Comptroller [to deny a charter application] herein would seem to fall into the general commercial area where discretionary actions are subject to limited review. (72)</p><p>But the actual standard of review has never been articulated satisfactorily, partly because banks have stopped contesting chartering decisions, given they always seem to lose. The Eighth Circuit has upheld a Comptroller chartering decision that was \"certainly not without some support in the record.\" (73) Other courts have concluded that \"the Comptroller's decision is entitled to a presumption of regularity,\" (74) and the Supreme Court affirmed that \"curt\" letter rejecting an application in Camp v. Pitts. (75) It all means, as Margaret Tahyar has put it, that \"a generation has grown to accept that the granting of bank charters is so up to the discretion of the bank regulators that the regulator need not even give reasons for a denial.\" (76)</p><p>The Supreme Court has given the OCC Chevron deference on its other interpretations of the National Banking Act suggesting--though it has never held--that Chevron deference would be applied to chartering decisions too. (77) The D.C. Circuit has also counselled deferring to the \"expert financial judgment\" of the Comptroller. (78)</p><p>The litigation risk of a reversal of chartering decisions by the OCC is, it is fair to say, low, though not nonexistent. (79) One court has held, applying (as is appropriate) Chevron deference, that the OCC cannot issue bank charters to fintechs unless they take deposits (a less appropriate conclusion, as we will see). (80) All told, this record of administrative law deference to the OCC, which has been (though it should not be) expressed as almost super deference, has arguably led some claimants aggrieved by a chartering decision to pursue constitutional claims against the agency, in lieu of administrative law arguments, without any more success. (81)</p><p>If anything, constitutional doctrine has empowered the OCC more than it has checked it. A number of courts have held that the Constitution's Supremacy Clause supports the National Bank Act's preemptive provision overriding state rules that prevent or significantly interfere with national bank powers, meaning that OCC charters come with a safe harbor against many state regulatory requirements. (82)</p><p>The law of chartering, in sum, gives the OCC a great degree of latitude in defining the charter, a fact which has not led the agency to take a \"long-arm\" or \"wildcat\" (83) view of its powers. Recently, it bestowed charters unwillingly, despite the flexibility it has been given. (84)</p><p>The disconnect between unfettered discretion to grant charters and an unwillingness to do so is always interesting, surprisingly common in bureaucratic practice, and something of a rebuke to those who believe that agencies always try to expand their turf. The OCC has not suggested a desperation to lord over more and more banks or to stretch the definition of banking to give it jurisdiction over an ever-greater number of nonbanks, semibanks, or banks-by-another-name. (85)</p><p>This leads to my first prescription--my recommendation that the courts explicitly apply Chevron deference and ordinary \"hard look\" review, not anything \"more\" than that, to OCC chartering decisions. (86) The leading cases setting forth the standard of review for those decisions were decided before Chevron, and, although they found that OCC decisions were susceptible to review, they made that review highly deferential. (87) But distinguishing between the various sorts of deference is difficult, at best, and the Supreme Court has generally preferred to apply simple and consistent standards to all agencies. (88) Rather than characterizing review of OCC chartering decisions as barely extant, the better approach would be to treat the Agency the way other agencies are treated--there is nothing in its statute or its area of regulation that provides for anything different. (89) Chevron deference and \"hard look\" review are the appropriate standard of review of the Agency's bank-chartering decisions.</p><p>II. MAKING SENSE OF THE CHARTER</p><p>If Part I of this Article offers a black-letter account of the law of chartering, this Part situates the charter in two different ways--first, as an old-school kind of government grant and second, as the tool that separates banks from other commercial enterprises. Once these two critical lenses of chartering are understood, the debate among scholars and regulators about what a modern banking charter should look like will make more sense. That is the project of Part III. Part IV turns from theory to the actual practice of the Agency in chartering.</p><p>A. Charters as Throwback Regulation</p><p>A surprising amount of the scholarship critical of the financial industry in the wake of the financial crisis has sought to recast banking from a private sector endeavor to a public sector grant. To these observers, the crisis revealed what we should have known all along: that the business of finance is essentially a public service only possible because of the public support that undergirds the financial system. (90) The essential publicness of the provision of finance justifies an intrusive regulatory hand when it comes to supervising banks. (91) In fact, these scholars see the existence of a viable banking system as something that is fundamentally derived from public power. (92)</p><p>This view says banks only work because people believe that they are safe, and people only believe they are safe because of the government guarantees provided by deposit insurance, the existence of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, and the likelihood that, if all else fails, banks will be bailed out at taxpayer expense. (93) The most important event in a bank's life, then, is the moment that the government agrees to allow it to provide banking services--the day it receives a charter, and with it, the government guarantees that back up the business of banking.</p><p>The implications of the importance of the charter allow for a much larger government role in directing or supervising banks. Some scholars wish to replace the relatively unconstrained charters that national banks currently have with more constrained ones that would encourage banks to follow government priorities. (94) Others would rely on the charter to do away with the growing prominence of shadow banks. (95)</p><p>The turn to charters to do the job makes everything old new again; my observation about those who believe that charters are central is that they are emphasizing a way that banking administrative law differs from contemporary administrative practice. (96) Charters and licenses were the principal ways that pre-nineteenth-century governments raised money or allocated economic resources. (97) But now there is no need for royally chartered trading companies to exploit trade with India or the South Seas, nor to build bridges and turnpikes to be financed with tolls in the nineteenth-century manner. Instead, after passage of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), courts have increasingly urged agencies to prefer broad, prospectively applied rules to individualized treatments of particular firms. (98) In 1973, the D.C. Circuit exulted over the Federal Trade Commission's decision to turn away from its adjudication model of policy making when it promulgated an octane-labelling rule, observing that \"courts are recognizing that use of rulemaking to make innovations in agency policy may actually be fairer to regulated parties than total reliance on case-by-case adjudication.\" (99) Chartering is an old school example of adjudication--an individualized determination after a review of the record.</p><p>Outside of finance, for regulated industries in ongoing relationships with their regulators, regularly passed rules are the much more common regulatory mechanism and, indeed, probably the more modern approach. (100) Most scholars would say that one of the most important developments in administrative law since the 1980s has been the rise and rise of the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which reviews major rules before agencies are permitted to promulgate them; that review is generally perceived to be searching and important. (101) The ascent of OIRA illustrates the importance of the rule in the modern administrative state.</p><p>But its evolution also underscores the independence of the OCC--OIRA does not review its rules or its licensing decisions. (102) The OCC's chartering determinations are elaborate permitting processes that it, and it alone, assesses. (103) This is not to say that chartering is wrong--or that there are not other parts of the government that rely on licensing regimes that generally evade White House supervision, ranging from nuclear power to telecommunications. Rather, it is a reminder of how atavistic these sorts of licensing regimes can be.</p><p>B. Banking Versus Commerce</p><p>There is a classic debate about financial regulation that turns on a business model question: whether the business is being operated as a bank or as some other sort of commerce. Would-be banks are entitled to banking charters, while commercial enterprises are not. (104)</p><p>This effort to police the divide between banking and commerce goes back to the original federal banking charter statute, which limited eligibility for the charter to those engaged in the \"business of banking.\" (105) Ever since, the OCC has insisted that national charter holders be \"banks\"; it has refused, with limited exceptions, to let nonbanks hold national banking charters, while even tough regulators such as the FDIC have allowed this on occasion. (106) When, after the financial crisis, the OCC was given responsibility over a number of thrifts owned, by a quirk of history, by nonbanks, it encouraged these firms to rid themselves of the charter. (107) As Saule Omarova has observed, the \"separation of banking and commerce is one of the fundamental principles underlying the U.S. system of bank regulation,\" and has been justified by the \"needs to preserve the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, to ensure a fair and efficient flow of credit to productive economic enterprise, and to prevent excessive concentration of financial and economic power in the financial sector.\" (108)</p><p>At the same time, policymakers have often wondered whether the separation of banking and commerce makes sense. President Trump's first head of the OCC, Acting Comptroller Keith Noreika, argued that \"[t]he recent financial crisis actually demonstrated that there is nothing inherently safer about separating banking and commerce.\" (109) He argued that</p><p>extending the charter to nonbanks \"has the virtue of bringing technology oriented financial companies that provide banking services out of the shadows.\" (110) The veteran financial free marketeer Peter Wallison is all for erasing the barrier and thinks it possible: \"Thankfully, current policy makes removing the line between banking and commerce, once and for all, relatively straightforward.\" (111)</p><p>The separation between banking and commerce is, moreover, threatened by facts on the ground. The rise of so-called shadow banks, firms that provide some of the services of banks without holding bank charters, is the second most consequential development of finance this century, after the financial crisis and its fallout. (112) \"By 2007, the shadow banking system had total assets of roughly $6.5 trillion--compared to $4 trillion for the then five major securities firms and $6 trillion for the top five U.S. bank holding companies,\" Chuck Whitehead has observed. (113) John Coffee contends that \"[t]he pervasive underregulation of 'shadow banking,' which continued for decades, was a leading cause of the 2008 financial debacle and the current economic stagnation.\" (114) As Adam Levitin has observed, the shadow banking sector has survived the crisis and is diverse and growing: (115)</p><p>Several distinct but interconnected shadow banking markets have emerged in recent years, including asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), auction-rate securities (ARS), hedge funds, money market mutual funds (MMMF), repurchase agreements (repos), and credit derivatives like credit default swaps (CDS) and total return swaps (TRS). (116)</p><p>Today, the shadow banking component of the global economy has been estimated at forty-five trillion dollars by the Financial Stability Board, a network of regulators. (117)</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting parts of this new financial sector are those firms seeking to combine finance and technology in some way that would permit them to offer financial services to customers over the Internet. (118) Some fintech shadow banks provide loans, peer-to-peer lenders being the most prominent example. (119) Others service debt, such as student loan debt. (120) And many online platforms are willing to hold money and make payments. (121) This is the strategy of the various online wallets, PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo being the most prominent. (122) Because these are the kinds of services that banks offer their clients, the ability of online institutions to offer the services without holding a bank charter makes them businesses that do bank-like things without the official designation of a bank or the regulatory protections and requirements to which banks must adhere.</p><p>The actual practice of the OCC is instructive in figuring out how that Agency plans to deal with the rise and rise of shadow banking. Its recent fintech charter practice, which is still very much in the nascent stages, suggests that it will grant charters to nonbanks, even with the fintech model that the OCC has chosen to welcome cautiously, as we will see in Part V of this Article.</p><p>III. THE GREAT CHARTERING DEBATE</p><p>The academic and legal debate over charters can be segmented into contemporary and historical camps. Today, we see a recent spate of banking law scholars arguing that the way the license works justifies turning banks into tools of the state, while government-skeptical observers worry about the development of an increasingly intrusive \"License Raj\" in all things, including banking. (123) This maps onto a historical debate that also had two sides. On one side were the free bankers, seeking loosened credit and suspicious of the powers of incumbent banks. (124) They sought to broaden access to charters. (125) Others, worried about bank collapses, have tried to limit charter access, meaning that they have been much more demanding in their approach to charter awards. (126) A final way to make sense of the chartering arguments is to see them as a case study in the broad debate over licensing in general and whether the United States has too much of it.</p><p>A. Could Charters Make for a Better Financial System?</p><p>The case for constrained chartering turns on the problems unique to banks. (127) Many think that regularly arriving financial crises bespeak a combination of problems, including inadequate controls inside financial institutions and aggressive entry into new, poorly understood financial markets. (128) Sometimes, the internal controls miss rogue traders--for example, Nicolas Leeson's hidden trades, carried out in the Singapore office of one of Britain's oldest banks, Barings, brought down that firm in 1995. (129) Bruno Iksil's 2012 unhedged derivatives trades cost J.P. Morgan $6.2 billion in losses in 2012 and, following investigations by regulators, $920 million more in fines. (130) Sometimes the controls miss bad strategies. (131)</p><p>These are business failures, but they do give little credit to regulators charged with monitoring financial institutions for safety and soundness. The institutions turned out to be unsafe and unsound, and that fact surprised both managers of the businesses, and the government agencies who oversaw them. (132) A search has unsurprisingly gone on for better mechanisms of supervision. Some think strict constraints on the business of charter holders might help. (133)</p><p>Recent financial regulatory scholars have tried to do more with chartering. Omarova and Hockett would use the charter as the legal and conceptual basis for imposing a broader set of responsibilities on banks. (134) Morgan Ricks would heighten the policing of chartering and regulating banks defined as money creators (who create money by making loans) and forbid shadow banks from occupying any space like it--he would defend the charter wall. (135) Claire Hill and Richard Painter make the case for \"covenant banking,\" which would expose managers to liability to shareholders for risky practices; this would modify the charter to manifest this new business relationship between shareholders and risk committees at the director level. (136) This Part of the Article reviews both these proposals in turn; they make the case for intensive regulation through charters and thus pose a question: Could the OCC provide this sort of intensive regulation?</p><p>Hockett and Omarova have called the chartering process the operative feature of the \"finance franchise,\" arguing that the traditional public interest component of bank charters could be used to justify some ends-based oversight of banks, such as requiring them to align their business models with policies designed to foster the overall efficiency of the economy. (137)</p><p>They have argued that finance is best understood as a \"public-private franchise\" system, in which banks are licensed to engage in the creation of credit-money, ultimately backed by the sovereign. (138) In their view, this makes banks quasi-public institutions providing a public good--access to credit. (139) The analogy is to utilities and railroads, which are sometimes owned by the state and, when privatized, are subject to regulation of prices, activities, and the like. (140) The charter is the mechanism through which much of this control is realized. (141) It is a basis to put banks to the service of industrial policy, or anything, really.</p><p>Consider the private cognate of the charter, the licensing purchased from an intensively regulatory business. McDonald's franchisees, for example, control almost nothing about the businesses they run. (142) Instead, McDonald's corporate headquarters produces each uniform, menu item, store design, and equipment. (143) By analogy, the franchisees who help the government generate and underwrite sufficient amounts of credit to support the economy could be regulated just as intensively, possibly towards publicly beneficial ends, such as the direction of investment towards public priorities. (144) Ultimately, this would use the charter to enact a form of industrial policy, a controversial thing to do among economists who trust laissez-faire and free markets more than dirigiste direction from the state. (145)</p><p>Ricks has also focused on the charter; he thinks it should be carefully policed to eliminate shadow banking (or at least any government guarantee backing institutions providing bank-like services without a bank charter). (146) In his view, \"entry restriction\" through charter protection is a critical component of well-done financial regulation. (147) As he has argued, \"[Financial and macroeconomic instability, monetary control, and private seigniorage.... supply a compelling justification for entry restriction.\" (148)</p><p>In Ricks's view, the control of the bank chartering process has financial stability advantages because it establishes a clear government role over insured depository and loan-making institutions and a clear delineation from other forms of financial intermediation (which, if they involved the expansion of the monetary supply, would not be permitted). (149)</p><p>The implication of Ricks's theory of money creation could lead to prohibitions of various sorts of shadow-banking ways to raise capital, including money market funds, securities lending businesses, and commercial paper--multibillion dollar businesses that would be under regulatory threat. By the same token, the fintech businesses that make loans--Amazon extending credit to vendors on its site and other peer-to-peer lenders--would also be under serious regulatory threat.</p><p>Others are much less sure. Acting Comptroller Noreika argued instead that the chartering \"narrative persists to keep commercial interests from owning or having controlling interest in banks, in part, because many view them as 'public interests' rather than the 'private businesses' they are.\" (150) In his view, banking is a business, not a contract-out government function. In the wake of the financial crisis, some academics have also questioned whether the licensing requirements of the Agency rule out too many potentially beneficial owners. Mehrsa Baradaran, for example, has made the case for \"possible alternatives to the strict separation of banking and commerce, such as commercial ownership of traditional banks.\" (151) These scholars and policymakers find the insistence on the separation of banking and commerce to be inefficient, bad for consumers, or both. And although the antiseparation crowd hails from across the regulatory spectrum, they have much in common with libertarian and free-market-oriented economists who have protested the overlicensing of American commerce, a group we will discuss in more detail in Part III.C.</p><p>B. The Chartering Debate Has Long Been with Us</p><p>The view that financial institutions are essentially providing a public service and should be treated as quasi-arms of the government is controversial, though, as we have seen, fair game these days. But treating bank charters as different and more precious than corporate charters is a view that has plenty of historical and contemporary support. (152) The battle over whether to give out banking charters freely or parsimoniously today echoes a nineteenth-century fight that only emphasizes how deep the worries over new banks go. (153)</p><p>No less than the American Bankers Association has observed that \"[t]he seal of approval conferred by the OCC when it charters a national bank is an important marker of trust to customers,\" suggesting that bankers, at least, think it is something special. (154)</p><p>Historically, that seal of approval has almost always been tightly controlled. (155) The first state banks were usually chartered by a special bill of the legislature. (156) The National Bank Act of 1864, which created both a federal charter for banking, as well as the OCC, reflected a theory of bank regulation premised on the importance of a controlled charter, even though it would control the federal charter less than some states controlled theirs. (157)</p><p>Loosening the constraints on access to bank charters has a long pedigree as well, though. The question as to whether banks are special, and should, therefore, be subject to special charter constraints, or whether they ought to be treated like other corporations is not only being debated today. In the mid-nineteenth century there was a great deal of attention paid to the promise of \"free banking.\" (158)</p><p>As Kenneth Scott has explained, many bank regulators and state legislators thought that charters \"should be readily available to anyone who complied with relatively simple and specific statutory requirements, rather than be grants of special privilege by the legislature.\" (159) New York and Michigan passed free-banking laws in the 1830s, and by the 1860s, half of the states had adopted similar policies. (160) Free banking was designed to facilitate credit access in a time when banks were viewed with suspicion and desire to create competition in the sector was strong. It allowed--at least in theory--states to develop a close-to-home financing channel that could be regulated with branch restrictions, capital ratios, and interest rate oversight. (161) At the same time, the free banking era featured unstable banks and wildcat start-ups that have led some to conclude that the era was a financially chaotic one. (162)</p><p>Charter expansionists, such as Noreika and Baradaran, and proponents of free banking are roughly on the same side of an age-old debate--they want more banking services offered by more people, to more people, on the assumption that doing so will lower costs and increase efficiency. (163) Traditionalists are more likely to take the perspective of those who believe that the charter must be zealously guarded either for reasons of financial stability, or because the finance franchise is a valuable government program that should condition participation on the provision of various public-spirited goods. (164)</p><p>C. Bank Charters as an Overlicensing Case Study</p><p>If history shows that restrictive banking licenses have long been a part of banking, one might take the free banking critique further. Licensing is ubiquitous in the federal administrative state and has come under criticism for being overly burdensome and understudied. (165) As Richard Epstein has observed, despite being the \"focal point of enormous public discontent, [licensing (or permitting)] has received scant attention in the academic literature.\" (166) One way to take the measure of licensing is to look at financial regulation, where no institution can operate as a bank without first obtaining government preapproval. (167) J.B. Ruhl and Eric Biber describe such a regime as an \"extreme specific permit[ting]\" regime, the sort of permitting most susceptible to administrative abuse. (168) But banking regulation has always had a chartering component accepted by both liberal skeptics of state capture and by conservative free market economists. (169) The banking charter offers a test of the case for and against licensing more generally.</p><p>The ideas of special charters and special responsibilities for businesses are often unconvincing in many contexts. It is one thing if a business is engaged in particularly dangerous activities; then professional licenses make sense. (170) Licenses might also make sense for professions where public service is a component of the job--doctors, with their public health mission, and lawyers, with their responsibility to serve as officers of the court, might be examples of this. (171) And, some sort of mechanism of professional discipline probably must exist if an industry is required to put the interests of its clients ahead of its own, as is the case for investment advisors and other sorts of professionals who put their licenses at risk if they betray their clients. (172)</p><p>But financial firms occupy an uneasy place in this set of concerns and that part of the case for licensing fits well with this worry. It is true that financial firms are dangerous. (173) Runnable financial firms count as risky, with the prospect of contagion. However, they are not exactly fiduciaries, especially when they are making markets, selling financial products, or even making plain vanilla commercial loans.</p><p>More generally, licensing has become a source of real controversy, especially as, at the state and local level, it has expanded beyond the professions to the trades, where a straightforward story about economic protectionism and rent-seeking can be told. Louisiana has tried to shut down some monks who dared to sell funeral caskets without a license. (174) Utah has required hair-braiders to obtain cosmetology licenses, meaning, as one judge put it, that a hair-braider \"cannot legally braid hair for money unless she spends thousands of dollars for hundreds of hours of classes that have nothing to do with her occupation of natural braiding.\" (175) There has been litigation over the District of Columbia's tour guide licensing. (176) The literature is openly skeptical that this sort of licensing is doing much good, and there is no shortage of other outlandish examples at which to point. (177)</p><p>All of this has motivated free-market types to take an especially close look at licensing--it is regulation, after all, and a heavy-handed sort at that, creating barriers to entry. Reputable economists dating back to Milton Friedman have argued that there ought to be no licensing at all--that surgeons should not be required by the government to attend medical school, that scuba divers should not be certified, and so on. (178)</p><p>And the case against licensing can go even further. Doing something about licensing abuses might not only lead to less-regulated markets, it might also give courts a greater role in policing the substance of economic regulations, a role they have stayed out of since the era of Lochner v. New York came to a close. (179) Libertarians confident in the wisdom of judges might want to bring back Lochner style scrutiny to the regulatory state.</p><p>In this way, the long-accepted licensing requirements of banking offer something of a test case for the claims of over licensing that have marked other, different areas of regulation. If the banking licensing regime looks problematic, then the case for licensing may be as bad as Friedman thought it was. In banking, where licensing has generally been accepted as appropriate, there is some indication of a desire for somewhat less rigor, at least when it comes to ownership, and, as we will see in Part V (the fintech Part) of this Article, perhaps also in business models as well. (180) Nonetheless, as we will see in the next Part, the chartering regime in banking does not look like regulation unmoored from the values that Congress created for the regime. The chartering decisions made by the OCC are technocratic, if not particularly well-explained. Concerns, if any, arise from the intensity of the nonpublic parts of the review of charter applications, and the corresponding difficulties in obtaining a charter.</p><p>IV. FEDERAL CHARTERING IN PRACTICE</p><p>This Part of the Article reviews how the OCC comes by and exercises its charter authority in practice. It is based on a review of all the charter denials by the Agency since 2003, no particularly difficult task given that there are so few. Although what goes into a denial is the most interesting way to analyze OCC's charter parsimony, the charter grant orders were reviewed as well, as were the Agency's applications, materials, and guidances. Lawyers who had successfully applied for charters were also interviewed, as were regulators.</p><p>In practice, the OCC makes obtaining a charter costly by insisting on a searching application process, and by discouraging marginal cases from proceeding. (181) However, once that process is concluded, it almost never denies charter applications and has made noises about trying hard to grant them. (182) This practice indicates that the charter is not an instrument of government control--at least, not because of the charter decision itself, which is given or not given based on the facts of the application rather than on the potential of the future activities of the bank and its competitors. Deposit insurance applications submitted with the charter application underscore the point--the FDIC does not make deposit insurance easy to get, but it never interacts with national banks seeking insurance ever again after doling the insurance policy out. (183) The OCC's ordinary supervision of an existing bank is without question rigorous, and can be used to send banks toward particular causes and to keep them out of certain businesses. (184) But there is little indication that any of this is related to the chartering decision itself.</p><p>A. The Practice of Chartering</p><p>The odd result of the OCC's searching charter application requirements is that, while navigating the OCC's approval process is no easy thing, the Agency rarely denies applications for bank charters.</p><p>When it denies applications, the denials come in short letters with little reference to the law and somewhat routine conclusions. (185) Charter approvals look quite similar to rejections--two- to five- page letters, generally, reciting a rote set of facts, the occasional legal reference, and an indication that the application has been approved or denied. (186) If anything, charter approvals and merger approvals are more elaborate than the denials, as the Agency often describes the proposed business in detail and outlines some conditions for approval, where appropriate. (187) Nonetheless, even with grants, the discussion section of approval letters is sometimes only a paragraph long. (188)</p><p>1. Illustrating the Approval Process: The Online-Only Bank</p><p>The OCC divides its charter applicants into two groups. De novo applications are for start-up banks, while charter conversion applications seek to change state-chartered banks, state- or federally chartered thrifts, or credit unions into nationally chartered banks. (189) The lawyers who represent clients approved for national charters are often sophisticated, including experienced practitioners from the financial regulatory groups of the highly profitable and well-known New York firms of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. (190) Because these firms are expensive, and would be unlikely to be hired for easily obtainable licenses, their presence in the application process suggests that navigating charter approvals at the federal level is complex, that bank charters are valuable, or both.</p><p>One way to make sense of how the Agency handles these sorts of applications is to investigate an illustrative charter application in some detail. The highest profile recent de novo application also helps to illustrate one way that fintech is finding its way into the banking space. Varo Money is an online-only lender that may serve as an example of how de novo charters are sought, as well as an example of a fintech shadow bank that hopes to come out of the shadows.</p><p>Varo's business model, as the bank put it in a press release, is to be the \"first national bank in American history designed for people who want to bank on their smart phones.\" (191) The firm seeks to provide a full panoply of banking services to customers comfortable with banking without ever visiting a bank branch; it has already built up a customer base by partnering with a duly chartered bank through which it can route deposits. (192)</p><p>Varo is a start-up supported by private equity--former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's firm, Warburg Pincus, has led the fundraising for it. (193) Varo's second financing round, in which it raised forty-five million of the seventy-eight million dollars in capital it had obtained at the point in which it applied for the banking charter, was premised on the pending application by the bank for a national bank charter, as it noted in its announcement closing the financing round. (194) As Colin Walsh, the CEO of the company, has said,</p><p>[T]he foundational banking products that we offer are the checking account, the interest bearing savings account, a form of short term sort of revolving credit and installment loans and those make up kind of the core of the banking products. ... [B]ecause we're in a mobile platform, we don't own branches, we have a partnership on our ATM networks as opposed to having our own ATMs, we don't do expensive cash handling, we don't have legacy technology; we're able to offer our products at very low cost. (195)</p><p>But Varo has suggested that a charter offers the promise of potential expansion abroad and at home, as well as regulatory simplicity. (196) As Varo's CEO has put it, without a charter, Varo was \"having deposits sitting with a sponsor bank and having lending through a series of state lending licenses,\" effectively giving the company twenty-one regulators. (197) If the OCC gives a final approval of its charter application, it will probably only have one--the national charter preempts most state consumer protection laws and all money transmitter requirements and usury limits. (198)</p><p>Obtaining a charter for Varo has proven to be a lengthy process, and, at the time of writing, it is still ongoing. The prefiling contact with the Agency began in 2017 with an application for a provisional charter filed on July 21, 2017. (199)</p><p>The application process for a national charter, which requires approval from both the OCC (for the charter) and FDIC (for the deposit insurance the bank must obtain if it is to take deposits), has been described by Varo's officers as a \"high hurdle\" that \"is incredibly demanding and complicated,\" because of the novelty of the business model. (200) \"The OCC is not going to relax their standards, so it's been a rigorous process. They're definitely not just sitting on it. We speak regularly,\" Varo's Walsh told the American Banker in January of 2018. (201)</p><p>No online-only banks had received charter approval from the OCC or FDIC before Varo. (202) In fact, the most high-profile, recent effort by an Internet firm to obtain such a charter, by the peer-to-peer lender SoFi, concluded with a withdrawn application after its CEO resigned in a sexual harassment scandal. (203)</p><p>Varo's application for a national charter was filed by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, a well-known New York law firm with plenty of banking expertise, on July 21, 2017. (204) The eighty-eight-page application, including exhibits, with an even larger confidential appendix attached (but not released to the public), follows a template consisting of responses to a series of questions set forth on an OCC form. (205) The questions range from the fundamental to the obscure, from how the bank expects to obtain sufficient capital to whether the bank's physical manifestations would be handicap accessible or would be located in historically significant buildings (in the case of Varo--a mobile-only bank that would have only a headquarters in Salt Lake City and a business office in San Francisco--the requirements would only apply to its headquarters and business offices). (206)</p><p>All told, the form application included twenty-five pages of responses to preset OCC inquiries with seven of those pages being devoted to the largest single response category, the management and ownership of the bank. (207)</p><p>Attached with the application were a number of public exhibits including the bank's bylaws, its plan to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act, and other forms of paperwork. (208) A larger set of confidential exhibits listed Varo's shareholders, its business plan, its management policies, and its prefiling financial statements--Varo began its application with two pages making the case for the confidential treatment of this information. (209)</p><p>After receiving the submission, the OCC published the nonconfidential components of the application and the fact that the filing had been made and invited comments for a thirty-day period. Varo got a positive comment from a Salt Lake City resident and a nine-page-long negative comment from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, speculating that the bank would not meet Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) priorities. (210) Despite the concerns that regulators and potential competitors have expressed with fintechs receiving bank charters, no comments were received from either regulators or competitors (partly this may be explained by the fact that Varo is seeking a standard national bank charter, rather than the special purpose charter that state regulators have argued is beyond the power of the OCC to offer).</p><p>Varo may have decided to apply when it did on the basis of a speech by the OCC's acting comptroller encouraging fintechs to apply for national bank charters. (211) The decision to apply was wise as to one regulator and unfortunate as to another. Varo received conditional approval from the OCC in a five-page letter that addressed, but ultimately dismissed, the comments that the bank would fail to meet its CRA obligations. (212) \"The Bank has demonstrated in its charter application and through discussions with OCC staff that it understands the requirements of the CRA and has begun to develop a CRA plan,\" the Agency observed. (213)</p><p>As is usual for grant letters, the references to legal authority were limited; but the OCC imposed conditions on Varo, most significantly that Varo would be required to raise $104 million in capital to obtain final approval for the charter, but also that it enter into an operating agreement with the Agency and obtain approval for the addition of any principals to the leadership of the bank. (214)</p><p>The conditional approval was dramatic--the OCC has engaged in so little postcrisis chartering. However, Varo was unable to obtain deposit insurance from the FDIC until February 7, 2020. (215)</p><p>Varo does not yet have final approval from OCC, though it is likely to get it, and accordingly remains unlicensed and dependant on its correspondent bank for banking services pending its passage of its final hurdle. (216)</p><p>2. Charter Denials</p><p>A review of every charter denial by the Agency between 2003 and 2017 is a straightforward recounting of the application of a fit and proper standard, but with teeth, to would-be bankers who appear to be inexperienced, criminal, or some combination of both. This describes the entirety of the Agency's denial oeuvre.</p><p>The OCC does not make overt policy choices with its denials, regarding, say, an oversupply of banking or the failure to serve a needed growth industry seeking funding, but rather objects to the experience or quality of the team behind the application or the prospects of the bank's business plan. (217) For example, it told one would-be California bank that it denied the bank's charter application because of a \"lack of banking experience on the proposed board of directors\" and because \"the two most senior members of the management team do not meet our standards for approval of the charter application.\" (218) It told another that the management team was not \"sufficiently strong,\" which warranted rejection of the charter application. (219) Sometimes it does not explain the reasons for its denial. (220)</p><p>Underlying these sorts of objections is often a sense that the applicants are naive, or, possibly, up to no good. In a South Dakota case, the Agency objected to the proposal by an acquiring bank to transition into a subprime credit card business. (221) As the OCC explained, the \"proposed business plan for the Bank to become an issuer of general purpose credit cards represents not only a significant change to the Bank's previous business, but also a shift to an intensely competitive segment of the credit card market, in which the Bank ... [has] no discernable experience.\" (222) When ExTran Bank sought a federal charter in Florida, the OCC rejected the application in perhaps its longest denial letter, amounting to 1666 words, or three and a half pages, (223) because it believed that \"the nature of the proposed activities ... pos[ed] particularly high supervisory and regulatory risks, including risks surrounding [the] Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering.\" (224) Moreover, \"the application ... provided no explanation or justification to demonstrate that the proposed level of staffing of the compliance department would be sufficient given the high supervisory and regulatory risks raised by the application.\" (225) The Agency apparently had doubts that ExTran would have had the capability, or even the desire, to catch illegal activity inside the bank. (226)</p><p>B. All Applications Analysis</p><p>Between 2003, the year during which the OCC first indicated its willingness to consider special purpose charters, and 2010, the OCC received 236 new charter applications and approved or conditionally approved 190 of those applicants. (227) From 2011 to 2017, charter applications declined dramatically--less than ten were received for those six years. (228) For applications for charters between 2003 and 2017, only four were denied, and three of those denials were in 2003 and 2004. (229) In sum, so-called \"de novo\" charter applications, for banks starting from scratch, all but disappeared, as Figure 1 below indicates (as we have observed, they have begun to rebuild steam in 2018-2019, after the period of study here). (230) The difference is apparent to the eye; moreover, the difference in means between 2005-2008 (roughly before and during the financial crisis) and 2009-2012 (during and after the financial crisis) are statistically significant at the p&lt;.05 level for de novo charter applications received and for conditional approvals of conditional charter applications. (231)</p><p>Nor has the situation been alleviated by charter conversions, or applications to turn state or federal non-OCC banking licenses into OCC licenses. Charter conversions also show a decline since the financial crisis, as Figure 2 below establishes, though the difference between precrisis applications or approvals and postcrisis applications or approvals is not statistically significant. (232)</p><p>The comparative vibrancy of charter conversions is probably related to the disappearance of de novo applications for charters; (233) because many banks struggled through the financial crisis, existing charters for cheap, small, and all-but-shell banks are available for conversion at an inexpensive rate.</p><p>The paucity of new entrants into the banking system prompted the 2017 approval of a national charter for a de novo bank to be greeted with hosannas from the Acting Comptroller himself, who pronounced himself \"encouraged that we are seeing increasing interest in becoming new banks and that de novo activity appears to be thawing slowly as the economy warms.\" (234) The Acting Comptroller welcomed the bank--a relatively small institution based in Winter Park, Florida--to national supervision, but cautioned that \"de novo banks are still exceedingly rare.\" (235) He recommended deregulation: \"Making the process of establishing de novo banks more efficient can only accelerate the recent positive trend and create more economic opportunity for consumers, businesses, and communities across the nation.\" (236)</p><p>The secret halt in the chartering of new lending institutions is not unique to the OCC. The FDIC also ceased entertaining applications from two different kinds of banks during the same period. First, it ceased approving applications from de novo industrial loan companies (ILCs) in 2008 and glanced a relatively skeptical eye on those applications from 2000 to 2007. (237) ILCs are lending institutions owned by commercial firms and mostly chartered by the state of Utah--a rare breach in the wall separating banks from commercial activities, but a relatively modest one in size. (238)</p><p>Second, between 2000 and 2007, the years leading up to the financial crisis, the FDIC received more than 1600 de novo charter applications for deposit insurance and granted approximately 75 percent of the applications. (239) But the crisis meant that applications, and grants, ground to a halt. Between January 2011 and July 2016, the FDIC received only ten applications for deposit insurance for de novo institutions, of which it approved three (all of which were from state-charted institutions). (240) The FDIC's caution won it the ire of former Acting Comptroller Noreika, who said that it was holding up a process in cases where the OCC was willing to charter banks. (241) In 2017, he complained, \"We, ourselves, since 2001 have chartered 14 institutions, and the FDIC hasn't acted on a single--any of those 14 applications .... They just let it hang out there forever, so that the organizers wasted all their money trying to get insurance, and then they gave up.\" (242)</p><p>In this way, Noreika suggested that the OCC, or at least he, was still a friend to the start-up bank community. But whatever its views of the FDIC, in all, the practice of the Agency indicates that it is certainly not doing what the charter reformers would like it to do. (243) The Agency spends no time evaluating the public interest in a new bank or nudging a bank towards policy priorities of the government. (244) Instead, it takes the measure of the management team, using a complex application and an ultimately low bar, and grants those applications that have managed their way through the process and met that bar. (245)</p><p>The OCC's searching application decisions have created some problems for its bottom line. Start-up banks have a choice of government agencies to turn to when they make their de novo applications. (246) State banks, assuming they can obtain FDIC deposit insurance, offer most of the features that national banks do, meaning that the OCC must balance its skepticism of business models against its desire for the examination fees that any new member of its system would provide. (247) Moreover, state charter holders have found that they are generally able to access the broader national market when it comes to obtaining clients and depositors, (248) meaning that what the OCC offers them amounts to either high-quality supervision or low-touch regulation. (249) OCC examination fees tend to be higher than state fees, meaning that state charters usually have a cost advantage. (250) Perhaps for this reason, since 2003, most bank start-ups have obtained state charters, which has led to outright worry by the OCC, as the Agency depends upon examination fees to fund its budget. (251)</p><p>C. What Should Be Done?</p><p>As we have observed, the OCC's practice when it comes to chartering banks has been extraordinarily secretive. For most of the past decade, it has refused to charter any banks; for the decade before that, it chartered many. (252) The change in policy has been unannounced and unexplained. (253) Nor has the FDIC done anything public to suggest that it is no longer willing to grant deposit insurance to start-up banks, although that appears to be its practice. (254) Moving from a licensing regime to a no-license-is-permitted regime without any sort of transparency about the decision and why it has been made looks like entirely arbitrary administrative law. (255)</p><p>Moreover, the solution is not particularly difficult. The OCC could issue a guidance document indicating that it would treat new applications for new banks in the wake of a financial crisis or troubled economy with \"enhanced scrutiny.\" That guidance would put regulated industry on notice without going through the complexities of rulemaking required by the APA. (256) In 2018, it, or the FDIC, could have announced that a new approach to de novo applications was being taken. (257) That it has chosen not to announce its new chartering policies, except perhaps obliquely in speeches, so suggests that the Agency feels particularly unencumbered by the regulatory requirements that most of its peer agencies must honor. (258) It is secret law, and secret law is bad law. (259) The OCC should publicize and update its willingness to consider charter applications.</p><p>V. THE FINTECH CHARTER</p><p>The conservative practice of the OCC when it comes to chartering actual banks has changed--maybe--with its new willingness to charter certain businesses that rely on the Internet to provide financial services to their customers. (260) The so-called fintech charter would expand the reach of both the Agency and the reach of the bank charter--a different practice from the OCC's recent unwillingness to expand the number of chartered banks at all. (261) The proposed fintech charter has occasioned consternation and lawsuits, but the concern is, while not unreasonable, largely misplaced.</p><p>After situating the state of play in the fintech marketplace, and in the existing regulation of it, I examine the Agency's practice when it comes to special charters. I then evaluate the costs and benefits of a fintech charter. With the preemption of state banking and usury laws, national charters offer the promise of a single regulator and the possibility of a technically superior, if more expensive, form of supervision. So far, the OCC has treaded extremely cautiously when it comes to fintech, and my normative conclusion is that this is appropriate and should be vindicated in court. Anything more elaborate than cautious approval on non-deposit-holding, Internet-based financial institutions of modest size should be a matter for Congress. The OCC's practice--so far consistent with this approach--also suggests that the charter-as-policy crowd are putting too much hope into the licensing mechanism as a promoter of broad financial sector reform.</p><p>A. The State of Fintech</p><p>Online providers of financial services, ranging from exchanges matching buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies to peer-to-peer lenders, provide bank-like services without holding bank charters. They are examples of the broadest definitions of shadow banks, even if they do not, in every case, fit the Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick borrow-short-to-lend-long-without-a-charter model in every particular. (262) Start-up exchanges can hold money for clients who wish to trade cryptocurrencies (or anything else), (263) which looks a bit like the taking of deposits. Social lenders take money from individuals and firms and match them with borrowers. (264) They are extending credit, which is something that banks do. So are online platforms such as Amazon and Alipay that make loans or extend trade credit to vendors on their sites. (265)</p><p>Some fintechs are money transmitters such as Western Union--they do not take deposits or make loans, but do hold money for customers, which is something that banks do. (266) Others are payment processors such as PayPal, but do not really let their customers hold balances. (267) Others are online lenders such as SoFi, Prosper, and Lending Club, and still others partner with chartered banks to provide the full panoply of banking services, including (for now) Varo. (268) Finally, there are all those technology firms associated with cryptocurrencies, including exchanges, hedge funds, and would-be wallets. As a matter of technology, these fintechs need not distinguish between any states in making business decisions--they exist on the Internet and can serve anyone with Internet access, and the Internet does not respect state boundaries. (269)</p><p>This sector is already big and has experienced rapid growth. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance has speculated that the worldwide fintech credit market in 2016 amounted to $284 billion, up from $11 billion in 2013. (270) Because these platforms are making loans and holding money, they are performing some of the features of the business of banking. (271) The OCC has proposed that they be awarded a banking charter for these reasons--creating a controversy. (272)</p><p>The OCC has observed that these and other start-ups are doing the things that banks do: \"[Discounting notes, purchasing bank-permissible debt securities, engaging in lease-financing transactions, and making loans are forms of lending money. Similarly, issuing debit cards or engaging in other means of facilitating payments electronically are the modern equivalent of paying checks.\" (273)</p><p>While the Obama Administration's comptroller Thomas Curry is the Agency head who began consideration of the special purpose fintech charter, it is the Trump Administration's Joseph Otting who helmed the Agency when it \"announced it will begin accepting applications for national bank charters from nondepository financial technology (fintech) companies engaged in the business of banking\" on July 31, 2018. (274) The Agency observed that its decision to accept applications was \"consistent with bi-partisan government efforts at federal and state levels.\" (275) That interest includes the current Treasury Department, which, also in July 2018, recommended that \"the OCC move forward with prudent and carefully considered applications for special purpose national bank charters.\" (276)</p><p>Complying with varying state charter requirements poses challenges for fintech firms. Some states require a brick and mortar presence before a state banking charter can be obtained, but fintech lenders have business plans premised on the ability to avoid these sorts of institutional investments. (277) Moreover, for a firm that is doing business across state lines, compliance with varying rules concerning interest rates, payment terms, and other consumer-protection-oriented services poses problems. (278) An OCC fintech charter would preempt these various state laws, conditional on some limitations on federal preemption created by Congress in the wake of the financial crisis. (279)</p><p>A variety of tech firms have considered applying for a special charter, but the Treasury Department has forecasted that two sorts might be particularly interested in the license. Marketplace lenders, including peer-to-peer and other unorthodox lenders, might be \"attracted to an OCC special purpose national bank charter because it would reduce licensing and regulatory cost[s] by consolidating supervision under one primary national regulatory structure.\" (280) Payments companies such as Stripe, Square, and PayPal/Venmo might \"look to the charter to obviate the need to obtain money transmission licenses in all 50 states.\" (281)</p><p>As Faisal Khan has observed, \"Obtaining money transmitter licenses is no easy feat. It involves a large amount of paperwork, money and time. It can take up to two years to amass all 50 state licenses.\" (282) Money transmitters \"touch\" money that is exchanged between two private parties, so a bill paid by a consumer to a cable company through a direct deposit bank account would require a money transmission license, as would a mortgage payment to any firm to which a mortgage originator had sold the mortgage. (283) This requirement means that almost all fintechs need these licenses--unless they obtain a banking charter that would preempt the requirements.</p><p>B. Revolutionaries in Waiting</p><p>The most serious disrupters of the business of banking--potentially Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google--are firms that would combine big commerce and finance, a combination that has not been permitted by regulators or legislatures since the founding of the republic. (284)</p><p>For example, Amazon Loans already extends short-term credit to businesses selling on its marketplace and has lots of data on how those businesses are doing, allowing it to make smart loan decisions. (285) Apple and Google are handling payments; Google has set up a mobile wallet in India that lets users link phones to bank accounts to pay for goods in stores and online and to make person-to-person money transfers. (286) Facebook is installing person-to-person PayPal payments into its Messenger app, and Apple is doing something similar with its own instant message program. (287) These Internet platforms have enormous balance sheets and could fund financing operations with other revenue-generating arms, making them both commercial firms who sell eyeballs to advertisers and financial service providers who hold money (albeit often only for very brief periods) and make loans. (288)</p><p>That makes them look like tech giants increasingly engaged in the business of banking, but the American firms are nothing compared to their Chinese peer, Ant Financial, which has almost instantly become an enormous financial firm largely by processing payments for Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer, and adding almost all of the financial services that the Internet can make possible. (289) Ant originates loans, manages money, and offers customers access to a money market fund with assets that amounted to $228 billion in 2017. (290) It also offers consumer loans to millions of users on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms; it does not yet take deposits, but will when the Chinese central bank grows comfortable with electronic compliance with know-your-customer requirements. (291) Chinese regulators have already given the firm an online banking license; regulators from Hong Kong are in the process of doing the same. (292) It is, as the Wall Street Journal has put it, \"the world's largest unicorn,\" with an equity value of $150 billion--a level that, until recently, may have qualified it as \"systemically important\"--that is, potentially too big to fail if it were located in the United States. (293) It is also, as Martin Chorzempa has observed, very much a component of Chinese policymaking, reflecting the desire of a government dissatisfied with its young, enormous, and inflexible banks to explore new ways to extend credit to its growing consumer class. (294)</p><p>C. The Fight to Charter Fintechs</p><p>1. State Outreach to Fintechs</p><p>There is already competition for charters in the fintech space--both New York and Utah are offering licenses that may meet the needs of fintech firms. (295) Two virtual currency exchanges--Gemini, owned by the Winklevoss twins involved in the founding of Facebook, and itBit--have obtained trust company charters from the State of New York and hope to operate their firms through that regulatory channel. (296) Square, the small-business-focused payment processor, has applied for an ILC charter in order to get direct access to the payments system. (297) SoFi, a peer-to-peer lending business, asked the FDIC (but later withdrew the request) to approve its application for an ILC charter, in which it raised the possibility that its business would offer credit cards and take demand deposits. (298)</p><p>State regulators, led by New York, have already sued to keep federal regulators from issuing a special fintech banking charter as something beyond the authority of the OCC, in one case successfully. (299) In addition to the lawsuits, state regulators have sought to appeal to fintechs, in part through an expansion of the National Multistate Licensing System (NMLS). (300) Founded by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the NMLS is meant to harmonize various licensing requirements and facilitate data exchanges. (301) State bank supervisors have vowed to expand the NMLS to nonbanks and to come up with a harmonized approach to money transmission licenses to spare fintechs the burden of acquiring such licenses in every state in which they do business. (302)</p><p>These state responses amount to the latest challenge to the not-so-neat boundary between banking and commerce, which both state and federal regulators take quite seriously--both states and the OCC want to give nonbank fintechs something like bank charters. (303) The question is whether they should both be able to do so.</p><p>2. The Federal Fintech Lawsuits</p><p>The intuition behind the litigation against OCC's fintech charter has some appeal to those deeply immersed in banking law. Banks take deposits and fintech firms--at least those eligible for a national fintech charter--would not. (304) This means that the fintech charter would be given to businesses that are not entirely engaged in every aspect of the \"business of banking,\" which is not unprecedented but rare. (305)</p><p>Or so federal practice suggests. Federal regulators have, in the past, guarded the line between banking and commerce. The government did not let the commercial giant Walmart get into banking in 2005, though Walmart customers might have appreciated the ability to do their banking where they did their shopping. (306) It has made it difficult for insurance and other financial companies to hold federal thrift charters as well. (307) Recently it encouraged commercial entities such as General Electric and insurers such as MetLife with long-standing lending arms to divest or restructure them. (308) And, more broadly, the government has fallen back in love with the traditional activity restriction, the original form of banking regulation, exemplified by the congressionally required promulgation of the Volcker Rule precluding banks from engaging in hedge-fund-like proprietary trading. (309)</p><p>And yet, federal regulatory practice is not uniform. During this period, the rise of so-called \"shadow banks,\" or institutions that offer the same sorts of services as banks, but that do not hold bank charters, has continued apace; firms and even individuals can obtain financing from money market funds, mortgage originators, mutual and hedge funds, the commercial paper market, or from peer-to-peer lenders over the Internet. (310)</p><p>The OCC should win the fintech charter lawsuits due to the deference it should be afforded to define the business of banking; (311) the decision to create a fintech charter has a reasonable basis in policy. It could improve access to services and rationalize the regulation of Internet-only businesses. Additionally, the cautious approach of the Agency does not suggest that big tech such as Google and Amazon will be able to make use of the charter.</p><p>As a general matter, courts have given the Agency deference when it has expanded the activities in which charter holders may engage. (312) The Supreme Court held as much when it deferred to the Agency's decision to permit banks to sell annuities; (313) we have already seen that lower courts almost always leave untouched Agency charter decisions (although they unfortunately do not always apply Chevron deference to those decisions). (314) In Clarke v. Securities Industry Association, for example, the Court held that the statutory term \"[t]he general business of each national banking association\" could reasonably be construed, as the OCC did, to allow a bank to establish a discount brokerage affiliate. (315)</p><p>Admittedly, there is modest precedent for the idea that expanding the sort of businesses that could hold charters would be inconsistent with the OCC's mandate. (316) A Florida district court once held that \"the core of the business of banking as defined by law and custom is accepting demand deposits and making commercial loans,\" meaning that operating a business that did not do both things would be inconsistent with the National Bank Act. (317) Another district court held that an institution that did not make loans could not be chartered as a national bank because it was not engaged in the business of banking. (318)</p><p>These few district court cases have been overwhelmed by the majority of cases deferring to the OCC's chartering decisions because those decisions have been cautious and reasonable, and remain that way today.</p><p>So far, most of the antifintech charter lawsuits have been dismissed as premature, with one exception. (319) One trial court has ruled that the OCC can only regulate deposit-taking institutions, and so offering a charter to fintechs that do not take deposits is beyond its powers. (320) But because the agency already regulates credit card banks that essentially do not take deposits, the decision is unpersuasive. (321)</p><p>3. Policy Implications of the Fintech Charter Fight</p><p>Social lenders and electronic payments processors are different from brick-and-mortar banks, to be sure, but there are good policy reasons to support the fintech charter. One is mere consistency: if the business of banking can include investment management and document storage (which banks offer through their safe deposit boxes), then it could also include peer-to-peer loans and loan servicing, and also investment accounts at online exchanges. The latter businesses are no more different from the business of taking deposits and making loans than are the former ones.</p><p>Moreover, as we will see, the OCC-proposed fintech charter would charter firms that are not taking all of the risks of a bank, that are not a threat to the deposit insurance fund, and yet, that want to extend credit in a bank-like way that makes the OCC's oversight understandable. (322) To explore why this is the case, and to make sense of the OCC's charter expansion ambitions, a deeper understanding of its historical approach and fintech charter rollout is called for; that consideration follows in Part V.D.</p><p>Giving fintechs a federal special purpose charter does not quite allow them to do all the things that banks do, including, most notably, taking deposits. (323) But it does federalize the law that these businesses must comply with in a way that is consistent with their Internet presence, which knows no state borders. Moreover, as we will see, the OCC's cautious approach to fintech chartering is consistent with its regulatory mandate, at least when afforded Chevron deference. (324)</p><p>The fintech charter looks less reasonable, however, if the worst is assumed over who might be eligible for it. The largest Internet giants increasingly all have a payments processing arm, as we have seen. (325) Given these potentially enormous bigtech businesses, a special purpose charter would go a long way towards eliminating the line between banking and the bulk of e-commerce and is the sort of major question that should be left to Congress, rather than to an agency, which is the final policy recommendation of the Article. (326)</p><p>The business of banking is capacious enough to apply to lending done through the Internet--at least provided that lending or loan servicing through the Internet is the only thing that the Internet firm does.</p><p>Permitting an enormous payments system to obtain a bank charter is not a totally unreasonable (at least as a matter of textual construction) interpretation of the National Banking Act--other countries have already offered online banking licenses to their Internet payments giants, and nothing in the statute requires new entrants into the banking services market to be small. (327) But it would undo the traditional separation of banking and commerce. In a Chevron deference era where financial agencies have broad statutory authority--the President has mused about doing a centibillion dollar capital gains tax cut through a Treasury Department letter--there must a place for the \"major questions\" exception to the doctrine if it has any hope of stabilizing the administrative state, as well as allowing for policy innovation. (328)</p><p>Awarding the Internet's biggest firms--firms engaged in search, social networking, and telecommunications--with banking charters really would erase the boundaries between banking and commerce, and such a big change in policy really is a matter for Congress, rather than the OCC.</p><p>D. The OCC's Cautious Expansion of the National Charter</p><p>The OCC charter extension model is best understood as one that cautiously enables established financial institutions to obtain licenses for new lines of business that do not fit within the Agency's regulatory model--in that sense it is a little different from the fintech charter, which would allow new entrants to make loans and process payments. This Part shows that the Agency has never used the special purpose charter to upend what banks can do; instead it is a cautious charter innovator. Credit cards, trust holdings, and shelf charters represent a relaxation of regulatory requirements for already trusted investors or banks who wish to expand their banking businesses. The fact that there are so few special charters suggests that the Agency views its evolutionary responsibilities circumspectly.</p><p>The OCC claimed authority for special purpose banks in a regulation promulgated in 2003, which provides:</p><p>The OCC charters a national bank under the authority of the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1 et seq. The bank may be a special purpose bank that limits its activities to fiduciary activities or to any other activities within the business of banking. A special purpose bank that conducts activities other than fiduciary activities must conduct at least one of the following three core banking functions: Receiving deposits; paying checks; or lending money. (329)</p><p>The Agency, along with Congress, has insisted on participation in the \"business of banking\" as a criterion for charter eligibility since its founding. (330) Its special purpose charters have reflected this insistence.</p><p>Its oldest special charter has been used by the subsidiaries of ordinary banks that want to offer their customers credit cards in addition to the usual deposit and loan offerings. Credit card banks were permitted to obtain federal charters if they engaged only in credit card operations and did not, for the most part, accept deposits, meaning that they would not need to obtain deposit insurance from the FDIC and be subject to its regulations. (331) The credit card bank usually exists as a bank affiliate that can get around state usury laws, which set maximum rates of interest for loans--rates that credit card issuers are capable of exceeding because of the OCC's national preemption power. (332) As of January 2018, only nine banks had taken the opportunity to become credit card banks and most of these are affiliates of other OCC-regulated banks. (333)</p><p>More popular has been the special trust charter--although it has not been much more popular. Fifty-five banks hold the trust charter; again, these are usually affiliates of other banks. (334) Trust banks are special purpose entities designed to hold assets identified in a contract between two private parties (in this way they \"take deposits\" and are thus engaged in the business of banking, but they do not loan out the resources entrusted to them). (335) Their profits come from fees charged to manage the assets held in trust; trust companies have a fiduciary obligation to put the interests of the beneficiaries of the trust ahead of their own. (336) Trust banks are not insured by the FDIC in most cases, a fact that may have induced the OCC to stop chartering trust banks for years, worried about the prospect of being on the hook for their failure. (337) The real advantage for trusts, as with federal credit card companies, is that the national charter preempts many state banking laws, enabling the trust to operate essentially nationwide. (338)</p><p>The OCC has occasionally evinced a willingness to charter \"bankers' banks,\" and has asserted the power to do so, though no such banks have yet received a federal charter. (339) A banker's bank is like a nineteenth-century clearinghouse in that it is owned by the banks and is intended to make cross-bank payments easier and to serve as a backstop for banks that find themselves illiquid, but not insolvent. (340)</p><p>Finally, in the wake of the financial crisis, the OCC created a \"shelf charter,\" allowing investor groups to prequalify for a national bank charter so that the group could compete in an auction for a failed bank, \"assured that the group already has preliminary approval for a national charter into which it could fold the acquired entity.\" (341)</p><p>The shelf charter, like the other special charters issued by OCC, did not enjoy much take-up, perhaps because the OCC made obtaining a shelf charter quite difficult--managing officers of the would-be bank had to be identified and available and shelf charter applicants underwent rigorous oversight. (342) Nonetheless, in 2010, the Agency allowed Bond Street Bank to acquire two failing Florida banks via a shelf charter. (343) The OCC authorized another shelf-chartered bank to acquire two small banks in Florida and one in South Carolina that year as well. (344) These shelf charters assisted federal regulators with their crisis cleanup and were essentially the last new-ish charters given out by the Agency for years.</p><p>In the past, the OCC also chartered community development banks, which are designed to encourage growth in underserved or low-income areas, and cash management banks, which are banking subsidiaries that manage the cash flow of larger business customers. (345)</p><p>These modest success stories should not obscure a pattern and practice that disfavors unconventional charters. The OCC has met the needs of credit card banks and trust banks, or, more accurately, the need of nationally chartered banks to operate credit card or trust affiliates, and the market for those needs is admittedly not large. However, it has not waded into shadow banking with charters available to all who wish, suggesting that it is unlikely to change things with the special purpose fintech charter.</p><p>E. The Slow Adoption of the Fintech Charter</p><p>On July 31, 2018, the OCC invited fintech firms to apply for a special purpose fintech charter. (346) In evaluating applications, the OCC indicated that it \"will use its existing chartering standards and procedures for processing applications,\" but that it would not require fintech charter applicants to take deposits and obtain deposit insurance. (347)</p><p>The decision by the Agency to accept charters has been one of long gestation. In 2013, Comptroller Thomas Curry indicated that he was interested in using the special purpose charter to offer fintech companies federal banking oversight. In 2016, the OCC published a white paper on the possibility, in which it indicated that it saw three potential advantages for fintech companies in obtaining a charter. (348) The first was reassurance: \"[A]pplying a bank regulatory framework to fintech companies will help ensure that these companies operate in a safe and sound manner so that they can effectively serve the needs of customers.\" (349) The second was the advantage of the nationwide preemption of state banking laws, which simplifies regulation, and, as the OCC put it, \"will help promote consistency in the application of law and regulation across the country and ensure that consumers are treated fairly.\" (350) Third, the Agency thought that new charterholders, with their different business models, might be good for banking and cause banking innovation, which could \"make the federal banking system stronger.\" (351) The OCC mused in the white paper about which fintech firms might be eligible for licenses--they would have to be engaged in one aspect of the business of banking--and how the Agency might modify its capital, business plan, and other regulatory requirements to suit the specialized charter market. (352) The Agency requested comments on the white paper. (353)</p><p>The OCC then proposed a rule indicating that it \"may charter other special purpose banks with business models that are within the business of banking,\" and that \"[a]s part of the agency's initiative on responsible innovation in the Federal banking system, the OCC [was] considering how best to implement a regulatory framework that [was] receptive to responsible innovation, such as advances in financial technology.\" (354)</p><p>The OCC also sought comments from the public as to \"whether it would be appropriate for the OCC to consider granting a special purpose national bank charter to a fintech company.\" (355) The OCC explained that it was considering various categories of fintech companies, including marketplace lenders that provide loans to consumers and small businesses, companies that provide payment-related services, businesses that engage in digital currencies and distribute-ledger technology, and companies that provide financial planning and wealth management products and services. (356) For his part, Comptroller Curry waxed enthusiastic: \"We will be issuing charters to fintech companies engaged in the business of banking because it is good for consumers, businesses, and the federal banking system.\" (357)</p><p>Curry's successors have agreed. One of them has said that using the special purpose charter for fintech companies would be a \"good idea.\" (358) Acting Comptroller Noreika said that fintech charterholders would not be subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, which means that they would not be subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve (the Fed). (359) His successor, Joseph Otting, has said that although he was \"not sure what it looks like and how it's funded,\" for fintech charters, \"there's a space there that a technology solution can solve.\" (360)</p><p>The Agency then invited fintech firms interested in obtaining a special purpose charter to \"maintain an open dialogue\" with the OCC beginning with exploratory precharter meetings. (361) It considered a \"regulatory sandbox,\" or pilot program, waiving certain regulations that would permit some banks to explore some fintech applications in a safe harbor from regulatory enforcement. (362) The OCC ultimately rejected the idea that fintech might be exempted from the most serious requirements that normal banks have. (363)</p><p>Amazon, Google, and Apple have been taking those meetings and have banded together to form a Washington lobbying group, Financial Innovation Now, which is on the record as supporting the fintech charter. (364)</p><p>In a draft supplement to its licensing manual designed to handle new special charters, the OCC indicated that firms that might be eligible for the fintech charter could not \"inappropriate[ly] commingl[e] banking and commerce.\" (365) The OCC has indicated that the special purpose charter will not be available to fintechs that seek to take deposits. (366) The Treasury Department agrees that this should not be the case, as fintechs \"should not be permitted to accept FDIC-insured deposits, to reduce risks to taxpayers.\" (367)</p><p>However, there have not yet been any fintech charter applicants, as this Article goes to publication, perhaps because of the OCC's circumspect vision, litigation risk, or external conditions.</p><p>F. Policy Implications</p><p>The OCC is funded by fees assessed on charter holders, and so the Agency always has an incentive to grow its charter and customer base. But regulatory budget building is not the only reason for fintech charters. (368) In an era where regulators worry about the growing importance of \"shadow banking\" and firms that offer bank-like services without actually holding a bank charter, the idea of bringing fintech lenders into the fold has regulatory appeal. (369) Capital requirements could be imposed on these firms, making them capable of surviving an economic or other shock. (370) Also, enabling new entries into the financial system should increase competition and impose market discipline on financial firms, an outcome which has long been a goal of regulatory policy and one espoused by all regulators who, like the OCC, signed on to the second version of the Basel Capital Adequacy accord, which made \"market discipline\" one of the three pillars on which it based market supervision. (371)</p><p>Obtaining whatever licenses are necessary to operate across state lines offers the prospect of regulatory complexity, meaning that these sorts of fintech firms might want a federal charter to essentially swap many regulators for one. (372) Although it would be inaccurate to call OCC regulation particularly \"light touch,\" the Comptroller does not have a maximum interest rate or the sort of usury provisions that many state regulators do impose. (373) Moreover, a charter could come with (though it need not) access to the Fed's payment systems, which might offer efficiencies for fintech lenders. (374) Currently, fintech firms rely on partnerships with suitably chartered banks to access the national payment system managed by the Fed; the firms may wish to cut out the middleman. (375)</p><p>The facts on the ground appear to indicate that the OCC is going to be a slow mover in the race to regulate fintech, and the early charter interest still leaves open the question about what to do with Amazon's payments processor and Google and Apple's wallet payment processors. This record offers comfort that the OCC's fintech charter would be incremental.</p><p>The change a different kind of fintech charter could make to the business of banking would involve a change in the traditional separation of banking and commerce, which, as the Acting Comptroller said in 2017, \"reaches back to the origins of banking in the United States.\" (376) Acting Comptroller Noreika indicated that he may be willing to rethink this very traditional separation, because \"mixing banking and commerce can generate efficiencies that deliver more value to customers and can improve bank and commercial company performance with little additional risk.\" (377) But this position was resisted. Community banks have feared the entrance of nonbank commercial businesses into the business of banking, and, although the Agency has not committed itself to offering a fintech charter to a nonbanking company, underlying some of the debate over fintech chartering is this central question of whether banking should continue to be so separate from commerce, given that, in the technology space, commercial firms are increasingly doing things that banks used to do. (378)</p><p>That is why my prescription follows from this state of affairs. The OCC should not leap to give charters to any fintech firm. This would demolish the boundary between commerce and banking in a way that would be ill-considered and insufficiently democratic. Doing so would challenge the constraint on regulators that is not always covered by their legal obligations, in that it would upend the settled expectations of regulated industry in a relatively dramatic fashion. Once regulatory initiatives have been institutionalized in a way that has affected investments, it is often better for Congress to do the upending, with its political accountability, than it is for regulators to change everything.</p><p>Such legislation would undo the separation of banking and commerce, a principle that banking regulators have carefully observed for centuries. (379) Whether the Internet's commercial giants should be able to offer their customers banking services is the sort of \"major question\" that an agency cannot and should not answer with an interpretation of its existing regulatory authority. (380) The chartering of Amazon's, Google's, or Apple's payment subsidiaries should only be permitted upon the passage of a fintech chartering act, and even then, Congress may want to think carefully about whether these instant financial giants, who can rely on the enormous balance sheets of their parent companies, should be permitted to enter the business of banking.</p><p>Finally, this fulsome review of the state of the bank charter suggests two broader conclusions about the state of licensing today. The first, is that agencies will not always seek to expand their regulatory turf by continually expanding the scope of the license. The OCC has hesitated to expand its charter to cover new kinds of financial firms, and only recently refused to give out any charters at all, missing out on the licensing fees that would have contributed to the Agency's bottom line. Licensing can, no doubt, be inefficient, bureaucratic, and opaque. But it does not always lead to mission creep. The second is that the high-end licensing of dangerous businesses--and banks can be dangerous--is often elaborate and complicated, requiring an investment in legal talent, compliance resources, and requiring sophistication in Washington as well as in the underlying business. Licensing is its own sort of big business, especially when it comes to cases where the costs of a mistake are high.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Reform of the financial charter in the United States is on the table. The actual practice of the Agency that makes national charter grants suggests that neither policy will be easy to realize. Because that cautious approach is consistent with the development of a fintech industry that would not undo the separation of banking from commerce, the OCC's special purpose fintech charter should be embraced. The OCC--and the courts--should make clear that the Agency's chartering decisions are reviewable subject to Chevron deference and a hard look at the facts--a standard that is probably best expressed as a requirement that the Agency make a reasonable decision. Once the OCC clarifies its approach to chartering--and updates it if it decides to modify its standards for charter grants--the chartering regime will stand on firm enough ground. Only Congress, however, should make the decision to vastly expand the ground of chartering to the payment systems of the biggest technology firms.</p><p>David Zaring *</p><p>* Associate Professor, The Wharton School.

See generally Kenneth E. Scott, In Quest of Reason: The Licensing Decisions of the Federal Banking Agencies, 42 U. CHI. L. REV. 235 (1975).

At least not until a recent and unpersuasive district court decision concluded that the Agency could not charter fintechs that did not take deposits. See Vullo v. Office of Comptroller of Currency, 378 F. Supp. 3d 271, 298 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (applying the Chevron test to the OCC's decision to accept fintech charter applications). The Chevron standard is the one most often applied by courts reviewing legal decisions by agencies. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,842-43 (1984). The standard of review under Chevron consists of two steps. For the first step, the reviewing court must ask whether, after \"employing traditional tools of statutory construction,\" it is evident that \"Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.\" Id. at 843 n.9. If so, the statute is \"unambiguou[s],\" and the agency must not differ from Congress's clearly expressed command. Id. at 842-43. If, however, the court decides that the statute is ambiguous, it then moves to step two of the inquiry. That step requires the court to uphold the agency's interpretation so long as it is \"based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" Id. at 843. Appellate courts have interpreted this to mean that they must defer to any reasonable interpretation of the statute offered by the agency. See id. at 845. \"Hard look\" review looks at the way the agency made its decision, including how it applied the law to the facts of the case. See Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut.

But he took time out for a freewheeling interview over video conference to discuss a wide ranging topics about growth in India, trade wars, the fintech disruption, Breaking up Big Tech and the backlash against Wall Street bankers. Edited excerpts:We've just seen an election and the return of Prime Minister Modi with an increased majority. Consequently, there is now an expectation for a stable government that will implement radical reforms of the sort that international investors would like to see. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>Ans: Under a second term for Prime Minister Modi, we are hopeful that the reform program will continue and accelerate to provide a great deal of upside for the Indian economy and Indian people. If that continues, it will be exciting for our business platform in India as well. The results of the election give us increased confidence in the investments we have made, as well as the investments we will continue to make in our Indian businesses, in both Bengaluru and Mumbai, but also with our clients, both as an investor and as an allocator of capital. Our base case on GDP growth is 7.5%, but if you look at our research, it indicates that if the reform program accelerates there can be considerable upside in the GDP growth on a forward basis. We are thrilled and watching closely. Is there anything specific you would like him to do in his second term?Ans: Continue the pace of reform. To the degree the reform process can continue to accelerate, I think it can lead to higher rates of economic growth, which obviously is tied to our franchise and investment businesses. What will be the key pillars of growth for Goldman Sachs over the next 5 years in India? How do you see the India franchise business play out over the next few years?Ans: If you think about the continuing digitization of the economy in India, obviously that's going to create many opportunities. As the talent and technology in the country becomes more and more integrated, it is going to need significant amounts of capital. As a proven investor, who has already helped grow Indian companies, there will be significant opportunities for us across a number of our businesses to add value. Additionally, as a market intermediary and a market investor, our firm will bring more foreign investors and facilitate direct investment to India. Our growth will closely match that of the growth of the Indian economy.What has been your India experience been so far? Great potential, but always a missed opportunity?Ans: We have always been very clear-eyed about the long-term opportunity in India and are now very hopeful that the pace of reforms will accelerate in a way that continues to promote higher rates of economic growth, which will present more opportunities for our business. To date, we've deployed a significant amount of capital as an investor in India, more than $3.6 billion over the last decade. We've built great client relationships, where we serve as an advisor and a facilitator for them.Based on that clarity and understanding of the Indian economy, our business here have met our expectations, but it's also always been a place where we've had hope for greater growth and opportunity. The re-election of Prime Minister Modi gives us more confidence in our investments as we continue to take a long-term view that will pay off for our businesses and our shareholders.What are the risk factors that are still attached to India?Ans: I would look at it slightly differently. I am looking at it over 10 year increments and think there has been a general direction of progress over the last 10, 20 and 30 years that will continue. India is still a place where the regulatory impact on business slows economic growth and while there is now progress being made to unleash some of that, I am hopeful that that progress will continue and accelerate.Is the progress too slow? Our bankruptcy law is still grappling with teething problems. So a lot of investors are running out of patience, too tired of waiting.Ans: It's par for the course when you are driving change in a major economy. While I am sure there are investors who are frustrated and want things to go quicker, we take a very long-term view and the context to that is that our firm continues to be very optimistic looking at the coming decades in India and the long-term opportunity for us to serve our clients in India.What does this new office in Bangalore mean?Ans: We are very excited about the new Bengaluru campus. The investment that we're making is reflective of the fact that it's a very important place where high-quality work is done from India for the worldwide Goldman Sachs network. It is also a further reflection of our global platform and that we think Bengaluru offers a great opportunity to bring high-quality people into our firm. We've had a big focus on engineering in that office as it has been a global innovation center for the firm. That will obviously continue given the availability of talent in India broadly and in Bengaluru. This new office represents a great global opportunity for us as technology and finance continue to converge.At times foreigners appear to be more bullish on India than Indian businessmen. Any thoughts on why that might be the case?Ans: I don't have a good answer for that, but look, I am focused on the next 10, 20, 30 years. I understand why you are trying to focus on shorter-term trends, but when Goldman Sachs makes a big business commitment to a place like this, when we open a huge office like Bengaluru and when we hire thousands of people, we've made a long-term bet. It would take a very significant dislocation to change that trajectory or direction.Tech companies have been under a lot of political pressure in the US especially when it comes to on-shoring of jobs. Why have US banks like Goldman not had to do the same?Ans: We run a global business. If you look at our business and the revenues of Goldman Sachs, only about 55% of it is in North America, and the rest of it is spread around the world. While there are pressures, particularly around manufacturing businesses, we try to strike the right balance as we are ultimately in the business of talent, technology and capital, which is spread around the world. Our footprint needs to match that. It is very important to our clients, who want us positioned globally. THE GLOBAL BEATIf the US-China tariff wars are not resolved soon, what kind of an impact do you see that having on the world economy?Ans: It is unclear whether or not we'll get some sort of a trade deal in the coming months. A month or two ago, it felt more likely than it feels today - obviously, very hard to gauge. I would highlight though what's at stake here is a fundamental rebalancing of the economic arrangement between the US and China. While we might have a trade deal, it's only one small part of that rebalancing that is going to require a compromise over the long-term from both sides. I actually think that it's going to be a difficult bumpy road and not as simple as whether or not we get a short-term trade deal. The degree that that relationship is bumpy over the coming decade versus when it is not, will have an impact on global growth given the size of both economies.Most MNCs will be or are tweaking their global supply chains even if there were to be an agreement sometime this year. Do you see India as benefiting from that? Ans: There is clearly a movement of people rethinking supply chains all over the world. In that context, anybody that is not China will benefit from the movement of these global supply chains - so sure at the margin there has to be some benefit. On the other hand, as I am talking to CEOs that are rethinking those supply chains, India is not the place that is immediately coming up the most in terms of such repurposing. Some are looking at repurposing back to North America, which is also benefiting. Vietnam and Indonesia are two that come up in conversations with CEOs.In Davos earlier this year you talked about a 50% chance of a recession in 2020. Now with the trade tensions, what's the chance today?Ans: I will start by saying the same thing that I said while being interviewed in Davos: I am not a good predictor of economic recessions. The general consensus at Goldman Sachs however is not different. The chance of a recession in 2020 is probably no higher or lower than 50-50. Certainly the time that I made the comment, we were talking about the chance of a recession being 50-50 at the back half of the year.While there's no question that trade is leading to a slowdown and affecting the growth trajectory, it still feels like the chance of recession in the next 12 months is low. Maybe it's slightly higher than it was in Davos, but if you are asking me: Do I think there will be a recession in 2020? I'll tell you it's a toss-up and can give you a distribution of outcome scenarios where there is and there isn't - so we will have to watch it more closely. You also had talked about the Fed switching over from being too hawkish to doveish in just a matter of 6 months. Where do you now stand on rates? Have they peaked in this cycle?Ans: Part of it depends on the cycle, obviously. If we enter a recession in the next 6-12 months, rates will probably peak. The consensus sentiment now is that we won't see a rate increase for well into late 2020 at the earliest. That was a big move and change from where we were last fall. If economic activity continues at trend, which is kind of where it sits at the moment, I would be surprised if that perspective is the same 6-12 months out. All these things you are asking tie back. What does the earnings momentum look like? Why is the bond market predicting more of a slowdown? All those things will have an impact as to whether or not there will be further interest rate increases before the cycle ends, but at the moment the consensus is that we certainly won't see anything until at least late 2020. That's a big shift from where we were at the beginning of the year.Is that the reason why you pushed back your strategy review to 2020? You find the environment difficult to predict, tougher than what was anticipated earlier?Ans: The rates environment has absolutely nothing to do with the timing on when we'll continue to communicate to the market about our plans. We have a lot of things that we are working through as we finish up and look at front to back reviews in our business and think about our continued push to increase transparency and disclosure in the firm. We are very, very focused on increased transparency and we are continuing to work through that.It is ultimately a process that has to be worked through and has nothing to do with the environment of the macro conditions at all.How are you preparing Goldman Sachs, yourself and your shareholders around the risk involved with 1 IMDB?Ans: We are working and cooperating with officials to get 1 IMDB behind us. It is not existential for Goldman Sachs, but we certainly want to resolve it and move forward.Bankers in the US have faced relentless bashing since the Great Recession. Do you think that has peaked or is it still more of the same?Ans: There is always going to be political rhetoric that challenges lots of different businesses at different points in time. Banks have had rhetoric that challenges them and in the US election cycle and there will be certain candidates that will continue to use that rhetoric.Today, technology companies have a great deal of political rhetoric challenging them around a whole variety of topics. In the last election cycle, big manufacturing businesses with jobs and supply chains offshore saw a significant amount of political rhetoric. My guess is in this election cycle we'll see some more. It ebbs and flows.From our perspective, we continue to be focused on how as an organization we help our clients by putting together talent, technology and capital. How do we help them grow? How do we give them the right kind of advice so they continue to make investments that benefit their shareholders and stakeholders? We feel very good about our client franchise and their ability to do that. While there may be political noise directed at businesses, including large financial institutions, it doesn't stop us from focusing on serving our clients.Technology companies clearly seem to have become the new villains. What are your thoughts on this talk of breaking up companies like Facebook?Ans: Facebook is a very big business. It has grown very, very quickly. It's has a big impact on society broadly, but it's also a very young company. Facebook was founded in 2004, so it's a 15 year old company that has grown to be one of the largest companies in the world with a huge customer base.Breaking up a company is a very, very difficult complicated thing to do. Like any other business that becomes big and influential, Facebook will have to make adjustments and I am sure there will be pressure on them to continue to adjust. They have just become a big business and will continue to be a big business. With that they will go through that evolution, as any other growing, highly-successful company does.So you are obviously not in favor of drastic action? Would you allow them some more time to self-regulate? Is that what you are saying?Ans: I'm not a regulator. In this case I'm an observer, an observer of the government's regulatory process. As a student of our own market in the United States, I will make the following observations.The prospect of the government breaking up a big company is something that happens very rarely here. It is a very, very complicated process. So my inclination is the chance of that happening is small.The chance of government regulation putting more rules, guard rails and parameters in place for the operation in some of these big businesses over some period of time is higher, especially around issues like privacy as we have seen in other parts of the world at an increasing pace.What I think is likely to happen because these are big influential businesses, just like financial services and they will have to deal with an evolutionary regulatory and government process.OF INDIAN REGULATIONS, DEAL FLOWS, CHINDIA &amp; MOREComing back to India, do you think India is really welcoming to foreign capital as it were a few years ago? In the last 1 year, we've seen major policy interventions or changes related to things like commerce or fintech and payments which has upset many global companies. You advise many such players like Amazon, Walmart etc. Aren't they upset with the goalpost shifting all the time?The review is over too short a period of time. The goal posts in any economy can keep shifting, including the US. We take a long term-view as we think about serving our clients and it's not the way we think about things to be commenting on short-term gyrations in any given year. There are times when progress is slower than we like it to be and then there are times where it accelerates, but ultimately there is enormous opportunity in India.We saw India Inc. being one of the most aggressive acquirers of assets around the world a few years back. Now most of them are saddled with a broken balance sheets. So will the deal continue to remain more inbound?We are going to see more foreign direct investment and more inbound capital, especially if Prime Minister Modi in his second term continues his reform trajectory. Conglomerates using leverage and adding assets around the world, I think we will see less of in the short term. There is no question that the digitization of the economy is attracting foreign capital and that will continue. Are you looking to double down on your PE portfolio?There is no number. We look for opportunities to deploy our capital for our clients. Goldman Sachs is one of the largest alternative investors in the world for clients around the globe and of our own balance sheet, so it's not surprising given that footprint and the global nature of our business, that we'd be one of the largest foreign investors in India.We've seen Goldman do very interesting collaborations with companies people like Apple. Since you talk about digitization of the financial services sector, is there a possibility of Goldman partnering with an Indian company in the fintech or payments space?Ans: We're just building our consumer businesses in in the United States. The expertise is more geared towards that market. In the future there may be opportunity and we are certainly open to it, but for now we focused on executing in our home market.So this pivot towards building out a consumer finance business in various parts of the world, will not have an India bearing?Ans: In the context of our building our deposit platforms around the world, we may indeed come to India, but that is not in our immediate plans. How do you see the whole fintech startups disrupt big banks and global banking?Ans: Banking is no different than any other industry. The combination of talent and technology is disrupting the way business is done. Personal financial services is a business where there is still a great deal of room for disruption. Are there some fintech platforms that will have a meaningful impact on the disruption? Absolutely. Are there incumbent players that will have a meaningful impact on the disruption and continue to be very strong in their incumbency? Absolutely.Then there are also those like Goldman Sachs, who haven't traditionally played in some of those markets, but are actually are very good at building technology platforms, have global reach, have balance sheet, have funding and have risk management capabilities which are deeply rooted that make us also very good disruptors. There is lots of room for people to disrupt and compete.I like our position in that and we are going to try to be successful in delivering products, particularly in the US, where we are consumer-focused to give them a much better experience than the current products that they have. We are optimistic that we can make a contribution in a small way and run a good business.It is often said, India is not a deep market, especially in investment banking. So GS's strategy of hunting with the elephants locally can be challenged. Your comments?In all major markets around the globe, we aim to work with the largest companies. As our franchises in local markets get stronger, in certain places we then expand to cover more of the market. Looking solely at investment banking, as an international firm in India, we are thinking of and engaging Indian businesses related to global capital flows and technology led disruptions. Given the strength of our network, capital and talent, the Goldman Sachs platform is going to be better suited in its ability to assist companies with needs for capital and strategic global partners. As an investor I think we've been much broader in terms of the companies we have allocated capital to and that will continue.You have obviously observed India and China over a long period of time. If you look at China it was a completely communist country till 1978. Yet 40 years later we find that China has giant private companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. There could be a dispute about how private they are but nonetheless they are bigger than the biggest Indian private companies. Why do you think that has happened? What has India done wrong? And how can that change?It is not a matter for right or wrong. While the Chinese have managed their economy, they have allowed for technology to become very significant and dominant in the way they have networked into that economy. When you look at individual economic capital, China is currently ahead with a significant portion of the population that can tie into, transact, and consume from these platforms. India has similar companies. It also has a much more open market system and that allows for more competition and many players competing for that footprint. Most importantly, it also has the same opportunity.

But he took time out for a freewheeling interview over video conference to discuss a wide ranging topics about growth in India, trade wars, the fintech disruption, Breaking up Big Tech and the backlash against Wall Street bankers. Edited excerpts:We've just seen an election and the return of Prime Minister Modi with an increased majority. Consequently, there is now an expectation for a stable government that will implement radical reforms of the sort that international investors would like to see. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>Ans: Under a second term for Prime Minister Modi, we are hopeful that the reform program will continue and accelerate to provide a great deal of upside for the Indian economy and Indian people. If that continues, it will be exciting for our business platform in India as well. The results of the election give us increased confidence in the investments we have made, as well as the investments we will continue to make in our Indian businesses, in both Bengaluru and Mumbai, but also with our clients, both as an investor and as an allocator of capital. Our base case on GDP growth is 7.5%, but if you look at our research, it indicates that if the reform program accelerates there can be considerable upside in the GDP growth on a forward basis. We are thrilled and watching closely. Is there anything specific you would like him to do in his second term?Ans: Continue the pace of reform. To the degree the reform process can continue to accelerate, I think it can lead to higher rates of economic growth, which obviously is tied to our franchise and investment businesses. What will be the key pillars of growth for Goldman Sachs over the next 5 years in India? How do you see the India franchise business play out over the next few years?Ans: If you think about the continuing digitization of the economy in India, obviously that's going to create many opportunities. As the talent and technology in the country becomes more and more integrated, it is going to need significant amounts of capital. As a proven investor, who has already helped grow Indian companies, there will be significant opportunities for us across a number of our businesses to add value. Additionally, as a market intermediary and a market investor, our firm will bring more foreign investors and facilitate direct investment to India. Our growth will closely match that of the growth of the Indian economy.What has been your India experience been so far? Great potential, but always a missed opportunity?Ans: We have always been very clear-eyed about the long-term opportunity in India and are now very hopeful that the pace of reforms will accelerate in a way that continues to promote higher rates of economic growth, which will present more opportunities for our business. To date, we've deployed a significant amount of capital as an investor in India, more than $3.6 billion over the last decade. We've built great client relationships, where we serve as an advisor and a facilitator for them.Based on that clarity and understanding of the Indian economy, our business here have met our expectations, but it's also always been a place where we've had hope for greater growth and opportunity. The re-election of Prime Minister Modi gives us more confidence in our investments as we continue to take a long-term view that will pay off for our businesses and our shareholders.What are the risk factors that are still attached to India?Ans: I would look at it slightly differently. I am looking at it over 10 year increments and think there has been a general direction of progress over the last 10, 20 and 30 years that will continue. India is still a place where the regulatory impact on business slows economic growth and while there is now progress being made to unleash some of that, I am hopeful that that progress will continue and accelerate.Is the progress too slow? Our bankruptcy law is still grappling with teething problems. So a lot of investors are running out of patience, too tired of waiting.Ans: It's par for the course when you are driving change in a major economy. While I am sure there are investors who are frustrated and want things to go quicker, we take a very long-term view and the context to that is that our firm continues to be very optimistic looking at the coming decades in India and the long-term opportunity for us to serve our clients in India.What does this new office in Bangalore mean?Ans: We are very excited about the new Bengaluru campus. The investment that we're making is reflective of the fact that it's a very important place where high-quality work is done from India for the worldwide Goldman Sachs network. It is also a further reflection of our global platform and that we think Bengaluru offers a great opportunity to bring high-quality people into our firm. We've had a big focus on engineering in that office as it has been a global innovation center for the firm. That will obviously continue given the availability of talent in India broadly and in Bengaluru. This new office represents a great global opportunity for us as technology and finance continue to converge.At times foreigners appear to be more bullish on India than Indian businessmen. Any thoughts on why that might be the case?Ans: I don't have a good answer for that, but look, I am focused on the next 10, 20, 30 years. I understand why you are trying to focus on shorter-term trends, but when Goldman Sachs makes a big business commitment to a place like this, when we open a huge office like Bengaluru and when we hire thousands of people, we've made a long-term bet. It would take a very significant dislocation to change that trajectory or direction.Tech companies have been under a lot of political pressure in the US especially when it comes to on-shoring of jobs. Why have US banks like Goldman not had to do the same?Ans: We run a global business. If you look at our business and the revenues of Goldman Sachs, only about 55% of it is in North America, and the rest of it is spread around the world. While there are pressures, particularly around manufacturing businesses, we try to strike the right balance as we are ultimately in the business of talent, technology and capital, which is spread around the world. Our footprint needs to match that. It is very important to our clients, who want us positioned globally. THE GLOBAL BEATIf the US-China tariff wars are not resolved soon, what kind of an impact do you see that having on the world economy?Ans: It is unclear whether or not we'll get some sort of a trade deal in the coming months. A month or two ago, it felt more likely than it feels today - obviously, very hard to gauge. I would highlight though what's at stake here is a fundamental rebalancing of the economic arrangement between the US and China. While we might have a trade deal, it's only one small part of that rebalancing that is going to require a compromise over the long-term from both sides. I actually think that it's going to be a difficult bumpy road and not as simple as whether or not we get a short-term trade deal. The degree that that relationship is bumpy over the coming decade versus when it is not, will have an impact on global growth given the size of both economies.Most MNCs will be or are tweaking their global supply chains even if there were to be an agreement sometime this year. Do you see India as benefiting from that? Ans: There is clearly a movement of people rethinking supply chains all over the world. In that context, anybody that is not China will benefit from the movement of these global supply chains - so sure at the margin there has to be some benefit. On the other hand, as I am talking to CEOs that are rethinking those supply chains, India is not the place that is immediately coming up the most in terms of such repurposing. Some are looking at repurposing back to North America, which is also benefiting. Vietnam and Indonesia are two that come up in conversations with CEOs.In Davos earlier this year you talked about a 50% chance of a recession in 2020. Now with the trade tensions, what's the chance today?Ans: I will start by saying the same thing that I said while being interviewed in Davos: I am not a good predictor of economic recessions. The general consensus at Goldman Sachs however is not different. The chance of a recession in 2020 is probably no higher or lower than 50-50. Certainly the time that I made the comment, we were talking about the chance of a recession being 50-50 at the back half of the year.While there's no question that trade is leading to a slowdown and affecting the growth trajectory, it still feels like the chance of recession in the next 12 months is low. Maybe it's slightly higher than it was in Davos, but if you are asking me: Do I think there will be a recession in 2020? I'll tell you it's a toss-up and can give you a distribution of outcome scenarios where there is and there isn't - so we will have to watch it more closely. You also had talked about the Fed switching over from being too hawkish to doveish in just a matter of 6 months. Where do you now stand on rates? Have they peaked in this cycle?Ans: Part of it depends on the cycle, obviously. If we enter a recession in the next 6-12 months, rates will probably peak. The consensus sentiment now is that we won't see a rate increase for well into late 2020 at the earliest. That was a big move and change from where we were last fall. If economic activity continues at trend, which is kind of where it sits at the moment, I would be surprised if that perspective is the same 6-12 months out. All these things you are asking tie back. What does the earnings momentum look like? Why is the bond market predicting more of a slowdown? All those things will have an impact as to whether or not there will be further interest rate increases before the cycle ends, but at the moment the consensus is that we certainly won't see anything until at least late 2020. That's a big shift from where we were at the beginning of the year.Is that the reason why you pushed back your strategy review to 2020? You find the environment difficult to predict, tougher than what was anticipated earlier?Ans: The rates environment has absolutely nothing to do with the timing on when we'll continue to communicate to the market about our plans. We have a lot of things that we are working through as we finish up and look at front to back reviews in our business and think about our continued push to increase transparency and disclosure in the firm. We are very, very focused on increased transparency and we are continuing to work through that.It is ultimately a process that has to be worked through and has nothing to do with the environment of the macro conditions at all.How are you preparing Goldman Sachs, yourself and your shareholders around the risk involved with 1 IMDB?Ans: We are working and cooperating with officials to get 1 IMDB behind us. It is not existential for Goldman Sachs, but we certainly want to resolve it and move forward.Bankers in the US have faced relentless bashing since the Great Recession. Do you think that has peaked or is it still more of the same?Ans: There is always going to be political rhetoric that challenges lots of different businesses at different points in time. Banks have had rhetoric that challenges them and in the US election cycle and there will be certain candidates that will continue to use that rhetoric.Today, technology companies have a great deal of political rhetoric challenging them around a whole variety of topics. In the last election cycle, big manufacturing businesses with jobs and supply chains offshore saw a significant amount of political rhetoric. My guess is in this election cycle we'll see some more. It ebbs and flows.From our perspective, we continue to be focused on how as an organization we help our clients by putting together talent, technology and capital. How do we help them grow? How do we give them the right kind of advice so they continue to make investments that benefit their shareholders and stakeholders? We feel very good about our client franchise and their ability to do that. While there may be political noise directed at businesses, including large financial institutions, it doesn't stop us from focusing on serving our clients.Technology companies clearly seem to have become the new villains. What are your thoughts on this talk of breaking up companies like Facebook?Ans: Facebook is a very big business. It has grown very, very quickly. It's has a big impact on society broadly, but it's also a very young company. Facebook was founded in 2004, so it's a 15 year old company that has grown to be one of the largest companies in the world with a huge customer base.Breaking up a company is a very, very difficult complicated thing to do. Like any other business that becomes big and influential, Facebook will have to make adjustments and I am sure there will be pressure on them to continue to adjust. They have just become a big business and will continue to be a big business. With that they will go through that evolution, as any other growing, highly-successful company does.So you are obviously not in favor of drastic action? Would you allow them some more time to self-regulate? Is that what you are saying?Ans: I'm not a regulator. In this case I'm an observer, an observer of the government's regulatory process. As a student of our own market in the United States, I will make the following observations.The prospect of the government breaking up a big company is something that happens very rarely here. It is a very, very complicated process. So my inclination is the chance of that happening is small.The chance of government regulation putting more rules, guard rails and parameters in place for the operation in some of these big businesses over some period of time is higher, especially around issues like privacy as we have seen in other parts of the world at an increasing pace.What I think is likely to happen because these are big influential businesses, just like financial services and they will have to deal with an evolutionary regulatory and government process.OF INDIAN REGULATIONS, DEAL FLOWS, CHINDIA &amp; MOREComing back to India, do you think India is really welcoming to foreign capital as it were a few years ago? In the last 1 year, we've seen major policy interventions or changes related to things like commerce or fintech and payments which has upset many global companies. You advise many such players like Amazon, Walmart etc. Aren't they upset with the goalpost shifting all the time?The review is over too short a period of time. The goal posts in any economy can keep shifting, including the US. We take a long term-view as we think about serving our clients and it's not the way we think about things to be commenting on short-term gyrations in any given year. There are times when progress is slower than we like it to be and then there are times where it accelerates, but ultimately there is enormous opportunity in India.We saw India Inc. being one of the most aggressive acquirers of assets around the world a few years back. Now most of them are saddled with a broken balance sheets. So will the deal continue to remain more inbound?We are going to see more foreign direct investment and more inbound capital, especially if Prime Minister Modi in his second term continues his reform trajectory. Conglomerates using leverage and adding assets around the world, I think we will see less of in the short term. There is no question that the digitization of the economy is attracting foreign capital and that will continue. Are you looking to double down on your PE portfolio?There is no number. We look for opportunities to deploy our capital for our clients. Goldman Sachs is one of the largest alternative investors in the world for clients around the globe and of our own balance sheet, so it's not surprising given that footprint and the global nature of our business, that we'd be one of the largest foreign investors in India.We've seen Goldman do very interesting collaborations with companies people like Apple. Since you talk about digitization of the financial services sector, is there a possibility of Goldman partnering with an Indian company in the fintech or payments space?Ans: We're just building our consumer businesses in in the United States. The expertise is more geared towards that market. In the future there may be opportunity and we are certainly open to it, but for now we focused on executing in our home market.So this pivot towards building out a consumer finance business in various parts of the world, will not have an India bearing?Ans: In the context of our building our deposit platforms around the world, we may indeed come to India, but that is not in our immediate plans. How do you see the whole fintech startups disrupt big banks and global banking?Ans: Banking is no different than any other industry. The combination of talent and technology is disrupting the way business is done. Personal financial services is a business where there is still a great deal of room for disruption. Are there some fintech platforms that will have a meaningful impact on the disruption? Absolutely. Are there incumbent players that will have a meaningful impact on the disruption and continue to be very strong in their incumbency? Absolutely.Then there are also those like Goldman Sachs, who haven't traditionally played in some of those markets, but are actually are very good at building technology platforms, have global reach, have balance sheet, have funding and have risk management capabilities which are deeply rooted that make us also very good disruptors. There is lots of room for people to disrupt and compete.I like our position in that and we are going to try to be successful in delivering products, particularly in the US, where we are consumer-focused to give them a much better experience than the current products that they have. We are optimistic that we can make a contribution in a small way and run a good business.It is often said, India is not a deep market, especially in investment banking. So GS's strategy of hunting with the elephants locally can be challenged. Your comments?In all major markets around the globe, we aim to work with the largest companies. As our franchises in local markets get stronger, in certain places we then expand to cover more of the market. Looking solely at investment banking, as an international firm in India, we are thinking of and engaging Indian businesses related to global capital flows and technology led disruptions. Given the strength of our network, capital and talent, the Goldman Sachs platform is going to be better suited in its ability to assist companies with needs for capital and strategic global partners. As an investor I think we've been much broader in terms of the companies we have allocated capital to and that will continue.You have obviously observed India and China over a long period of time. If you look at China it was a completely communist country till 1978. Yet 40 years later we find that China has giant private companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. There could be a dispute about how private they are but nonetheless they are bigger than the biggest Indian private companies. Why do you think that has happened? What has India done wrong? And how can that change?It is not a matter for right or wrong. While the Chinese have managed their economy, they have allowed for technology to become very significant and dominant in the way they have networked into that economy. When you look at individual economic capital, China is currently ahead with a significant portion of the population that can tie into, transact, and consume from these platforms. India has similar companies. It also has a much more open market system and that allows for more competition and many players competing for that footprint. Most importantly, it also has the same opportunity.

India's desire to do so is part of a global pattern. Earlier this year, France came up with a proposition to tax Google, Facebook, and Amazon. India following suit will lead to broader international consequences with a combination of factors determining how Big Tech is taxed.</p><p><br/>Digital taxation has been on the government's mind for some time. June 2016 saw India come up with a 'Google Tax', an equalisation levy that taxed digital advertising. In 2018, the revenue from the tax surpassed 10 billion rupees ($139 million). Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is also keeping an eye on the tech ecosystem. Modi himself has pushed for Digital India, Startup India, and called for digital payments post demonetisation. As India grows as a market for digital technologies, the scope for the government to tax big tech firms such as Facebook and Google grows.<br/>India is a huge market for companies. As of April 2019, Facebook had 300 million users in India. You can expect to see a significantly higher number from Google. The idea is that India is a big source of revenue for tech companies. However, because these companies do not have a significant economic presence (SEP) in India, they might not pay their fair share of taxes. This is where India's new proposed framework comes in. Multinational tech companies achieve scale without volume; they are structured in a way to pay less taxes. The proposal currently in the works will change that and make companies liable to be taxed.<br/>The complication here is that we live in a world where technology is a variable in international relations. Most giant tech companies are American and operate from Silicon Valley. The Trump administration might not like Big Tech but it will retaliate against other countries taxing Silicon Valley. The Americans have already postured against this seriously before. When faced with the prospect of data localisation by India, Trump's White House considered capping H-1B visas. The United States has already announced an inquiry into France's proposal to tax Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. There is a good chance that the matter might end in tariffs for France. This is something India has to consider as it goes ahead with taxing American Big Tech. Trump himself has been aggravated by the tariffs India places on the United States. He called out Modi and called the tariffs \"no longer acceptable\" during the G-20 summit. India's push for digital taxation will likely provoke a similar reaction from the White House.<br/>The other stakeholder here is Silicon Valley itself. It is unclear how firms will react to thinner profit margins in India. There is a possibility that they could acknowledge market leverage while lobbying through third parties. The other end of the spectrum is that they could threaten to pull out of the market, leaving India with no direct substitutes. One possible outcome of a proposed Indian tax could also be loss of future possible investment in India. <br/>If the government decided to tax Facebook and Google on revenue generated in India, they could see it as a sign to invest more in other markets. At the moment, India could be too big of a market to ignore. However, the imposition of taxes going forward might take away the incentive to innovate for the Indian consumer. It would also translate into slower deployment of new AI-based technologies by large tech corporations, potentially slowing down India's advancement in the AI race.<br/>All of the options above are highly unlikely, though. What is most likely to happen is the revision of a new framework with Big Tech at the table. Because both parties, the Modi government and Big Tech, have a lot at stake, a compromise seems like the rational outcome. This way Google and Facebook can have a say in deciding how they are taxed and how much they should have to pay. A mutually consented tax rate could be beneficial for all stakeholders. <br/>It would keep investment flowing while not forcing India to look for domestic substitutes. It would also ensure that India does not rely on Chinese substitutes, doubling the scale of Chinese digital companies. However, just because this seems like the rational way forward does not mean that it is the one that will be taken. There are so many ways that an Indian digital tax could play out; we can only hope that policymakers will have carefully considered its impact on India's foreign relations.<br/>Modi, Trump, China, and Silicon Valley \u2014 it is all a fascinating mess. It also goes to show how technology has inserted itself into foreign policy and geopolitics. As the Modi government might considers taking France's lead, it is a step toward taxation coming to terms with the digital economy. How this ends globally will determine profit margins in Silicon Valley and development budgets in New Delhi.<br/>(Rohan Seth is a policy analyst at the Takshashila Institution)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/20/25/30/156642496083.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/20/25/30/156642496083.jpeg</url></p><p>Modi govt's plan to tax tech giants could lead to broader international consequences, including discourse over how Big Tech is taxed<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QATART-152073867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QATART2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW3-2SW1-F11P-X4CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357157</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Qatar Tribune.
