Now, though, the party's White House aspirants in 2020 have become some of the Valley's fiercest critics in pursuit of a different political edge. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), for example, broadly has decried the \"major monopoly problem\" in the United States - particularly with Big Tech. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, has tangled specifically with Amazon over its treatment of workers. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Spokesmen for Klobuchar and Sanders did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Another candidate, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who has bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford University, last year raised concerns about corporate consolidation across industries, including tech. But Booker, a regular visitor to the Bay Area, has long raised considerable money from the tech industry. His office declined to comment.</p><p>Warren's proposal, which was published on the Medium website, has two key elements. First, the Democratic lawmaker said her administration would appoint \"regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>Second, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services - such as Amazon's marketplace for goods - as \"platform utilities,\" which would have to be spun off from tech giants' other businesses. In theory, that would stop Amazon from making, selling and promoting clothes, toys or other goods that compete with offerings from competitors on its website.</p><p>\"We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\" she wrote.</p><p>Recognizing the stakes, tech industry advocates quickly blasted Warren's proposal. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, said it was an \"unwarranted and extreme proposal, which focuses on a highly admired and highly performing sector.\"</p><p>Supporters, meanwhile, said Warren's antitrust pledge drew inspiration from history. In 1933, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, a law that forced banks to separate commercial and investment activities. Even today, banks are not permitted to control shopping chains, said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor and a critic of large tech firms, though Glass-Steagall was essentially repealed during the Bill Clinton presidency.</p><p>Wu and others also cited the 1980s breakup of AT&amp;T, which before it was split apart into seven regional \"Baby Bells\" controlled virtually every aspect of a consumer's telephone experience, from owning the handset in Americans' homes to operating the switches that connected their calls.</p><p>Warren's proposal also draws inspiration more recently from a forthcoming law article written by Lina Khan, an advocate of more aggressive antitrust enforcement, according to several people familiar with Warren's plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about her efforts.</p><p>To that end, the senator's proposal foretells a looming struggle among Democrats over how far to distance themselves from an industry they once considered an ally, according to Hal Singer, an economist at George Washington University's Institute of Public Policy.</p><p>\"This is going to be a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party,\" he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:brian.fung@washpost.com\">brian.fung@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-b8cac34e-4201-11e9-9361-301ffb5bd5e6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKY-PW21-JBFW-C374-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 10, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The conduct of foreign policy -- and horse-trading with foreign leaders -- is a core presidential duty.</p><p> The problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump's presidency, namely his inability or unwillingness to distinguish between himself and his office. Trump doesn't think institutionally or constitutionally.</p><p> In contrast to his carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries. It's not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn't know that they exist; it's that she doesn't care.</p><p> Her broad approach is if she doesn't like something about America, she'll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn't a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary.</p><p> One of Warren's signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, her plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed.</p><p> Someone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \"constitutionally or legally suspect\" is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda.</p><p> As conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple.</p><p> And on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it's not clear under what authority.</p><p> Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \"I appreciate what you're getting at Liz, but you can't do that.\"</p><p> To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren't thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution.</p><p> This gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump's Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal didn't raise a peep when President Obama rewrote immigration law after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn't have the power to do it.</p><p> To be sure, the reliable, consistent constituency for strictly bounded executive action is vanishingly small. It amounts to about a dozen senators, those Republicans brave enough to oppose Trump's emergency declaration to repurpose military funding for the border wall, the most problematic of his executive actions.</p><p> All you need to know about how seriously most of the left takes the Constitution is that at the same time it's freaking out about Trump, it's boosting the prospects of Elizabeth Warren, who is promising to ignore it as a matter of policy.</p><p> Rich Lowry is editor of the National Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BHERLD-50201595691415</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EA9601E9FB0B18A BHERLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-CJ01-JBCN-41PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145223</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Boston Herald Inc.

Senator Bernie Sanders, the economic populist from Vermont who jumped into the presidential primary last month, has decried Amazon's treatment of its workers. Other Democratic candidates, including Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator, have faced criticism for having closer ties to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Warren is attempting to stake a claim on the issue by being first with a detailed plan.</p><p>\"It certainly puts pressure on a host of candidates to address the issue,\" said Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic consultant who worked on Sanders' presidential campaign in 2016. \"It seems like her current proposal is more specific than what Senator Sanders has talked about in the past.\"</p><p>If more candidates roll out proposals that would crack down on big tech, it could indicate a broader shift in the relationship between Democrats and the industry. The party has long enjoyed generous donations from tech workers; Google representatives went to the Obama White House hundreds of times, according to The Intercept.</p><p>On Friday, some industry representatives were already pushing back on Warren's plan.</p><p>\"This unwarranted and extreme proposal, which focuses on a highly admired and highly performing sector, is misaligned with progressive values, many of which are shared within the tech industry,\" Ed Black, CEO of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, said in a statement.</p><p>Representatives from Facebook and Amazon declined to comment. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Under the plan, companies with annual revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer an online marketplace or platform that connects third parties would not be allowed to own both the platform and entities that use it. That would mean, she explained, that Google's ad exchange and its businesses that use the exchange would have to be spun off from each other. Warren said she would also appoint regulators to undo \"anti-competitive mergers\" like Amazon's purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos, or Facebook's takeovers of Whatsapp and Instagram.</p><p>Companies making between $90 million and $25 billion per year would have to meet standards of \"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory dealing with users,\" as the bigger companies would, but would not have to separate from participants on their platforms.</p><p>Warren has called previously for an antitrust crackdown on the technology industry, including in speeches in 2016 and 2017, although Republican critics point out that she has spoken favorably of Amazon's opening a warehouse in Massachusetts, and that she said the company's bringing a new headquarters to Boston would have been a \"good bet.\" And Friday was not the first time Warren addressed the issue of big tech on the campaign trail; in January she affirmed her support for breaking up big tech companies in response to a question from the Globe.</p><p>\"I believe we ought to be enforcing our antitrust laws and I'm deeply worried about tech giants that snuff out early-stage competition,\" Warren said then. She said that it is unfair for Amazon to be able to collect information on buyers and sellers who use its online marketplace, which it can then use to decide whether to compete with those third-party sellers.</p><p>\"There's a place where Amazon needs to fish or cut bait,\" Warren said, \"You don't get to do both at the same time.\"</p><p>But she has not made it a central part of her stump speech. Generally, her portrait of corporate greed in the American economy feels more \"It's a Wonderful Life\" than \"Silicon Valley,\" as her spotlight on role of big banks, lobbyists, and the wealthy brings to mind Henry F. Potter, the capitalist villain in the Frank Capra film. (Warren's golden retriever, a tail-wagging presence on some of her campaign stops, is named Bailey, after George Bailey, the do-gooder founder of a tiny lender in the film.)</p><p>Some voters have noted that makes her stump speech seem old-fashioned.\"I felt like I was at a progressives rally in the '20s, in a good way,\" said Alex Aakre, 21, a student at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, who crowded into a pizza parlor basement to see Warren last week. \"Someone my great-grandfather would have voted for.\"</p><p>On Friday, some advocates for more competition in technology were pleased to see Warren directing that brand of crusading populism toward big tech. \"It is long past time that policymakers begin to grapple with the power of these big tech giants,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, adding that he hoped other candidates would do the same. \"If you don't talk about big tech, you sound like you're not in the economy of 2019.\"</p><p>It is also another example of Warren buttressing her presidential run with a series of concrete policy proposals aimed at defining the debate within the rapidly expanding Democratic field \u2014 an approach that has excited liberal groups like the Vermont-based Democracy for America, which was founded by Howard Dean and endorsed Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary.</p><p>\"She is putting out and identifying very specific issues and very specific proposals on how she's going to answer them,\" said Charles Chamberlain, the group's executive director. \"It's really kind of setting a bold standard for laying out what kinds of politics, what kinds of big ideas, Democrats should really be getting behind.\"</p><p>Liz Goodwin of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

Elizabeth Warren is presenting the most thorough list of policy specifics on taxes, antitrust, student-debt relief, tackling inequality and much more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If enacted, they would \"significantly remake the American economy,\" as The New York Times put it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposals would be warmly embraced by Seattle progressives. Whether they would help or hurt her outside America's blue islands is a big unknown. The label of \"socialist\" (or in angry emails I receive, \"SOCIALIST\") is a candidate-killer in vast swaths of the nation. \"Massachusetts liberal\" has meant defeat since JFK was elected in 1960 (even Republican Mitt Romney couldn't break the Bay State curse).</p><p>Warren is no socialist. She can fairly be called a social democrat in the Western Europe mold, where capitalism coexists with a high-tax, high-regulation government.</p><p>Importantly, Warren's detailed plans are defining a leftward-moving Democratic Party while the Republicans have moved to embrace the economic nationalism and protectionist policies of their president.</p><p>We've come a long way from the \"neoliberal\" centrism that generally defined presidential contests and policies since the late 1980s. Then, the scope of disagreements was narrower, such as limited increases or decreases to taxes. President Barack Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership would have been embraced by both parties in that era. No more.</p><p>A President Warren would push to break up Big Tech, and has specifically named Amazon along with Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power  -  too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" she wrote in March. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>That essay then goes into great detail about how she would seek legislation to label these giants as \"platform utilities ... (to be) broken apart from any participant on that platform.\" Anti-competitive mergers would be \"reversed\" by regulators. Amazon could say goodbye to Whole Foods and Zappos, which would return to being free-standing companies.</p><p>This is only the beginning of a sweeping set of policy recommendations.</p><p>She wants to seek an \"ultra-millionaire\" tax on the 75,000 wealthiest U.S. households. That would cost Jeff Bezos $4.1 billion in the first year - the world's richest man is worth nearly $149 billion. Also on Warren's agenda is a new tax on big corporations (60 Fortune 500s, including Amazon, avoided all federal income\u00a0taxes in 2018).</p><p>Warren claims these would raise $3.8 trillion over a decade. The money would pay for some of her other ideas, such as free college and student-loan forgiveness, green industries, lower-income housing and child care.</p><p>So thorough is her agenda that supporters wear \"Warren has a plan for that\" T-shirts. (But the agenda appears to have some blind spots. Depressingly, the senator has had little if anything to say about high-speed rail - a critical way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions - or transit or even Amtrak. She did back a high-speed rail proposal in Massachusetts, but that's not the national transportation vision we need.)</p><p>Nevertheless, Warren's plans would mean radical change or a much-needed antidote to the decline of the middle class - or both. They are helping her popularity among Democrats but attracting critics, too. In addition to those on the right, her tax proposals have caused some prominent center-left economists to raise questions.</p><p>Were she to win the primary, Warren's agenda would test the question about whether the 2016 election was really about the economy. I think not: Donald Trump ran on culture-war issues, immigration and white anxiety. With his bluster, unique manipulation of the media and help from the Kremlin, he still lost the popular vote. The expansion that began under Obama continued.</p><p>In 2020, the economy might become central if a recession arrives, particularly one that can be blamed on Trump's trade wars.</p><p>Otherwise, turnout - and vote suppression - would be important. Large numbers of younger people, educated women, and minorities would heavily support a Democrat. Large numbers of older white people would tend to back a Republican.</p><p>And could the Democrat capture vital states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016? Could Democrats win a Senate majority and keep the House, without which Warren's proposals would be dead on arrival at Congress?</p><p>Warren is a fascinating mix of brains and the common touch. She was a Harvard academic who led establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new agency to combat the banksters (which is now being weakened by the Trump administration). When GOP senators refused to confirm her as the bureau's head, she ran for the Senate and won.</p><p>Yet she was born in Oklahoma, where her family, as she put it, was \"on the ragged edge of the middle class ... kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails.\" She bootstrapped her way up and is a more gifted retail politician - appealing personally to voters - than Hillary Clinton, able to articulate an agenda that's also backed by rigorous academic research.</p><p>Intellectuals are often poor politicians. But not always (think Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama). Warren fits into this successful category.</p><p>It's way too early to say she'll win the nomination, facing formidable challenges from Joe Biden in the center and Bernie Sanders on the left.</p><p>Trump and the hard-right GOP behind him have so scrambled American politics that it's difficult to pinpoint today's center. And I suspect that many more people back Trump than the polling shows - they lie to pollsters.</p><p>It's also difficult to say how much voters want to change the American economy. Many are too young to remember the era from the end of World War II to 1980. Many who do remember believe in Trump's nationalism rather than a return to the mixed economy that was ushered in with the New Deal and supported by both parties.</p><p>On the other hand, socialism isn't a dirty word to a surprising number of millennials. These younger people have doubts about capitalism as it's practiced today and are willing to experiment.</p><p>Thus, while laissez-faire Trumpism will continue long after the Donald is gone, the Warren agenda will likely define the Democratic Party's economic policies of the future. Finding a consensus between such radically different viewpoints will be challenging.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-23291b888f0911e99c19ac95e42655ae</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WBV-VJ41-JBKM-D0M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 16, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the sheer volume of her plans, and their detail and variety, is forcing her rivals to play catch-up and stake out their own positions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Her proposals would tip power from executives and investors to workers and allow the federal government to more aggressively steer the development of industries. She has called for splintering technology companies, like Amazon, that millions of consumers rely on in their daily lives. She would reduce the rewards for entrepreneurs to build billionaire fortunes and for companies to create global supply chains, scrambling the incentives for work, investment and economic growth.</p><p>  Ms. Warren would seek big tax increases on the wealthiest individuals and corporations, creating a new tax on household assets that exceed $50 million as well as a new tax on corporate profits. From those two steps alone, she says she would raise at least $3.8 trillion over a decade -- money that would go toward her plans on student debt cancellation, free college, child care, the opioid crisis and green manufacturing.</p><p>  [Read more: Ms. Warren is picking up support in Iowa, according to a new poll.]</p><p>  A review of the policy rollouts the 2020 Democrats have made since entering the race shows that Ms. Warren has issued the largest number of detailed plans among the major candidates -- roughly 20 in all, on subjects as varied as Big Tech regulation, housing costs and Pentagon contracting. Most of her rivals have released fewer than half a dozen; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who leads in early polling, has issued only two.</p><p>  But Ms. Warren has already drawn criticism from centrists and conservatives who say her plans -- many calling for new regulations -- would hurt business and the economy, stifle innovation and potentially harm the very workers they were intended to help. ''Were they to get done, they would cause significant problems,'' said Tony Fratto, a former Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration who is a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington.</p><p>  By pushing out so many proposals so early, Ms. Warren has framed much of the debate in the Democratic primary race, aiding her own rise in the polls.</p><p>  ''It's rare, at this stage of a presidential campaign, somebody distinguishes themselves by the boldness and detail of their policies,'' said Robert B. Reich, who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. ''She is asking the biggest questions that exist, and that is: How do you make a free market work? How do you make capitalism actually work for the many rather than the few?''</p><p>  Ms. Warren is hoping that her ambitious agenda will win over Democratic primary voters, and that her emphasis on protecting American workers will have crossover appeal in a general election. But President Trump and his Republican allies would almost certainly use her proposals to portray her as too extreme.</p><p>  Like other Democrats running for president, she would need her party to not only keep the House next year but also take control of the Senate, a difficult feat, to have any chance of pushing the bulk of her agenda through Congress. Even then, her transformative policies would surely face fierce resistance. In the House, she would face overwhelming opposition from Republican lawmakers as well as misgivings from the sort of centrist Democrats who helped deliver the majority last year. And Senate Republicans would be positioned to block many of her proposals using the filibuster, a tactic that Ms. Warren has said should end but that still enjoys bipartisan support.</p><p>  Some of the policy ideas Ms. Warren has promoted in recent months have been hallmarks of her political career. A bankruptcy expert who helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she has long pushed Democrats to embrace more structural changes to the economy, even at the risk of putting off wealthy donors.</p><p>  But Ms. Warren's advisers have also seen the policy rollouts as an opportunity to put pressure on other campaigns and steer the party's center of gravity leftward. They were keen to announce her student debt cancellation proposal before any other rival's, partly to claim that turf as their own.</p><p>  They have also carefully structured the order of her policy announcements, beginning with the ''Ultramillionaire Tax'' that provided a built-in answer to the question, ''How will you pay for it?''</p><p>  Now, other Democratic campaigns are being measured against Ms. Warren's policy benchmarks. In a night of back-to-back CNN town-hall events in April, every candidate faced a question that related to a proposal from Ms. Warren.</p><p>  [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]</p><p>  Ms. Warren's agenda includes a plan to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt, depending on a borrower's income, and to eliminate tuition at public colleges. She has proposed a universal child care system that would be free for low-income families and limit other families' costs to 7 percent of their income. And last week, she offered a broad economic program to promote American exports and spur job creation.</p><p>  As part of that program, Ms. Warren called for a $2 trillion federal investment in climate-friendly industries and suggested other steps like more actively managing the value of the dollar.</p><p>  Her ideas resonate with a growing group of liberal economists who see evidence that free markets need more forceful government intervention in order to function properly and not just deliver spoils to the very wealthy.</p><p>  Fans of Ms. Warren's proposals say they would help the economy by attacking income inequality: New taxes on the rich would fund investments in workers and encourage companies to spend more on wages and strategic investments than on executive pay.</p><p>  They say that her aggressive use of antitrust regulation would unleash more competition and dynamism in an economy increasingly dominated by incumbent businesses, that her industrial policies would help the United States capture global market share in emerging industries like clean energy and that her spending on child care would encourage more Americans, particularly women, to work.</p><p>  ''You're going to change norms, you're going to change the way people act and the things they do with that money,'' said Heather Boushey, the executive director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ''I can only imagine the kind of innovation and productivity it would unleash in our economy.''</p><p>  Critics say Ms. Warren -- with her proposals for new business regulation and focus on encouraging companies to locate production in the United States, rather than seeking the lowest-cost and most efficient production hubs around the world -- will hinder American companies as they attempt to sell into India, China and other developing nations.</p><p>  ''To me that is the biggest risk in this, that you hobble American corporations so they cannot be globally competitive,'' Mr. Fratto said. ''We want these companies to compete globally. Because sooner or later, they have to.''</p><p>  Ms. Warren would also risk hurting consumers by breaking up technology companies, particularly Amazon, said Natasha Sarin, a University of Pennsylvania economist who favors many of Ms. Warren's goals but has written skeptically about her proposed wealth tax. She said taxing wealth could discourage innovation and risk-taking by entrepreneurs who invest time in their ideas hoping for a large payoff down the road.</p><p>  ''It's a really important shift in how tax policy works in the U.S.,'' she said, ''and it's not obvious to me that it's a shift for the better.''</p><p>  Ms. Warren would impose a 2 percent annual tax on a household's assets, including stocks and real estate, that exceed $50 million. She would add another 1 percent tax on assets above $1 billion. Some other advanced countries, like Spain, impose similar taxes. But the United States never has, and some experts question whether Ms. Warren's plan is constitutional. Some economists, including Ms. Sarin, say the tax would struggle to raise the revenues Ms. Warren forecasts, because it is relatively easy for the ultrawealthy to hide or shield assets from taxing authorities.</p><p>  Ms. Warren's campaign has amplified the impact of her policy rollouts by timing many of them to campaign trips. She unveiled her broad economic program and her green manufacturing plan ahead of a visit to Michigan and Indiana. She issued a proposal on public lands before visiting Colorado and Utah. Her opioid plan came before a visit to West Virginia and Ohio.</p><p>  Policy makes up a large part of Ms. Warren's pitch to voters on the campaign trail, where, from school gyms to house parties, she guides audiences through one proposal after another. She explains her wealth tax by likening it to the property tax paid by homeowners, only broadened to include the ''diamonds, the stock portfolio, the Rembrandts and the yachts'' of the super-rich.</p><p>  ''Right now in America, there is a real hunger,'' Ms. Warren said at a Democratic Party event in Iowa on Sunday. ''There are people who are ready for big, structural change in this country. They're ready for change, and I got a plan for that.''</p><p>  ''I got a plan'' has become a personal trademark for Ms. Warren, drawing cheers from crowds and inspiring T-shirts and tote bags. And her policy announcements serve as fund-raising opportunities, too, helping to drive news coverage and give her supporters more reasons to donate.</p><p>  Though Ms. Warren has far outpaced her major rivals in issuing detailed policy plans, some are working to make up ground.</p><p>  In just one day last week, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey offered a housing plan that would provide a tax credit to renters, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas introduced a voting rights plan and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York issued a plan to legalize marijuana.</p><p>  Mr. Biden -- who entered the race in late April, four months after Ms. Warren -- introduced a climate plan last week and an education plan the week before. Senator Kamala Harris of California has put forth plans on teacher pay, gun control, equal pay and abortion. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has issued plans about education, rural America and banking.</p><p>  Mr. Sanders, like other senators in the presidential race, is also drawing on legislation he has proposed in Congress, most notably his ''Medicare for all'' bill, the latest version of which he introduced in April. Ms. Harris has a bill to create a big tax credit for low- and middle-income Americans. Ms. Warren likes to talk about the anticorruption package that she proposed last year.</p><p>  [Keep tabs on all 23 Democrats running for president with our candidate tracker.]</p><p>  Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., has not released any detailed policy plans, though he has talked about overhauling the Supreme Court and plans to deliver a speech on foreign policy on Tuesday.</p><p>  For sheer variety, no candidate can match Andrew Yang, a businessman and political newcomer. His website lays out his ideas on roughly 100 topics, including widely shared goals like fighting climate change as well as less common ones like abolishing the penny and supporting the unionization of mixed martial arts fighters. Most of his proposals, though, are described only briefly.</p><p>  One subject Ms. Warren has not broadly addressed in her policy plans is health care, which is a top concern of voters. Ms. Warren supports a Medicare for all system in which the government would provide health insurance to everyone, but she has been less specific on the role she foresees for private insurers.</p><p>  And Ms. Warren and most of the other Democratic candidates have yet to issue detailed plans on immigration -- a central issue for Mr. Trump.</p><p>  Jared Bernstein, a former White House economic adviser to President Barack Obama and top economist for Mr. Biden when he was vice president, said he applauded Ms. Warren's ideas but wondered whether the federal government -- particularly after several years of management by Mr. Trump -- was up to the task of implementing them.</p><p>  ''It's probably important to be appropriately humble about our ability to see the implications of big interventions,'' he said. ''But I love the aspirations. I love thinking big.''</p><p>  Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz and Astead W.

Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to break up Big Tech companies. The proposal entails appointing a bunch of regulators to undo mergers that her administration would deem anti-competitive. Warren\u2019s plan would classify any company that runs a marketplace and makes more than $25 billion a year as a \u201cplatform utility\u201d and prohibit them from selling their own products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Considering the prevalent loathing of Big Tech and capitalism in general, it\u2019s likely to be a popular idea. Many conservatives, angered at social media platforms, will also find the notion of breaking up these companies agreeable. But there are a number of good economic and idealistic reasons to oppose Warren\u2019s plan.</p><p> Warren\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t only strip the incentive for big companies to invest in growth and innovation; it would inhibit small-business innovation as well. It\u2019s true that Big Tech frequently swallows enterprises to eliminate competition. Yet many times smaller tech firms don\u2019t have access to capital that allows them to bring big ideas to fruition, or they can\u2019t take the risk.</p><p> I look forward to the day that market forces, rather than meddling politicians with aversions to the profit motive, smash Apple for good. But does anyone believe a gaggle of technocratic political appointees are going to do a better job of allocating investments?</p><p> \u201cTwenty-five years ago,\u201d Warren writes, \u201cFacebook, Google, and Amazon didn\u2019t exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It\u2019s a great story  but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\u201d</p><p> The fact that Facebook, Google and Amazon didn\u2019t exist 25 years ago tells us the opposite. It highlights how quickly innovative ideas can transform the marketplace in an era of relative deregulation. I\u2019d tell you to ask the executives at Woolworth\u2019s or Blockbuster  and soon AOL, MySpace and Sears  but there aren\u2019t any.</p><p>Apple or Amazon were early adapters of the market\u2019s new realities. Now, some of their businesses are forced to compete with other giants like Walmart or Samsung. This has been beneficial for consumers.</p><p> That hasn\u2019t stopped Warren from acting as if tech companies are the new Standard Oil. \u201cI want a government that makes sure everybody  even the biggest and most powerful companies in America  plays by the rules,\u201d Warren claims. This misleading turn of phrase has become standard on the left, which often acts as if companies are breaking the law or using \u201cloopholes\u201d when they fail to adhere to the imaginary regulations. Tech companies aren\u2019t breaking any rules by ignoring Warren\u2019s fictitious strictures. We already have a place to adjudicate mergers: the Justice Department. They already do a terrible job . And if the DOJ is susceptible to partisan pressure, surely a second regulatory body based on capricious progressive concepts of the common good would likewise be ripe for abuse.</p><p> A number of voters, regrettably, seem to believe that increasing regulatory oversight helps alleviate the destructive relationship between government and business. Yet, by giving politically motivated regulators expansive powers to dictate how and when companies can grow, Warren would not only imbue government with more power to pick winners and losers, she would further incentivize CEOs to placate government officials and politicians rather than do what\u2019s best for their companies and consumers. It would be a lot more productive if we left markets to compete and instead broke up government power.</p><p> \u201cCurious why I think FB has too much power?\u201d Warren asked on Twitter after Facebook took down some of her ads. \u201cLet\u2019s start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn\u2019t dominated by a single censor.\u201d</p><p> A person doesn\u2019t need to be exceptionally perceptive to notice that Warren\u2019s grievance regarding a \u201csingle censor\u201d shutting down debate on social media is weakened by the fact that she went to a competing social media platform to perpetuate the debate. Nor did it take much work to find out that virtually every major news site had covered her plan .</p><p> Her own tweet debunks the notion that a sole social media site can dominate news coverage . Taking Instagram away from Facebook would do nothing to induce the social media giant to embrace open debate. However, forcing a private entity to run ads that call for its own destruction is an unambiguous attack on free expression.</p><p>Facebook contends they removed Warren\u2019s ads because they violated rules against use of its corporate logo. \u201cIn the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads,\u201d the company explained. That makes the tech giant a far more robust space for free expression than your average news channel. And as sure as state intervention into TV news \u201cfairness\u201d would backfire so, too, will opening the door to Big Tech intervention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNH-605388bc472a11e99c5b00163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0N-CG51-JBCN-42H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409153</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The proposal entails appointing a bunch of regulators to undo mergers that her administration would deem anti-competitive. Warren's plan would classify any company that runs a marketplace and makes more than $25 billion a year as a \"platform utility\" and prohibit them from selling their own products.</p><p>Considering the prevalent knee-jerk loathing of Big Tech and  capitalism in general, it's likely to be a popular idea. Many  conservatives, angered at social media platforms, will also find  the notion of breaking up these companies agreeable. But there are  number of good economic and idealistic reasons to oppose Warren's  plan.</p><p> For starters, Warren's plan wouldn't only strip the incentive  for big companies to invest in growth and innovation; it would  inhibit small-business innovation, as well. It's true that Big Tech  frequently swallows enterprises to eliminate competition. Yet many  times smaller tech firms don't have access to capital that allows  them to bring big ideas to fruition, or they simply can't take the  risk. Big corporations can do both.</p><p> I look forward to the day that market forces, rather than  meddling politicians with aversions to the profit motive, smash  Apple for good. But does anyone believe a gaggle of technocratic  political appointees are going to do a better job of allocating  investments?</p><p> \"Twenty-five years ago,\" Warren writes, \"Facebook, Google, and  Amazon didn't exist. Now they are among the most valuable and  well-known companies in the world. It's a great story -- but also  one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and  promote competitive markets.\"</p><p> The fact that Facebook, Google and Amazon didn't even exist 25  years ago tells us the exact opposite. It highlights how quickly  innovative ideas can transform the marketplace in an era of  relative deregulation. I'd tell you to ask the executives at  Woolworth's or Blockbuster -- and soon AOL, MySpace and Sears --  but there aren't any.</p><p>Apple or Amazon were early adapters of the market's new  realities. Now, some of their businesses are forced to compete with  other giants like Walmart or Samsung. This has been beneficial for  consumers. Now, if Twitter and Face-book want to stay on top, they  probably should stop antagonizing half of their marketplace. Then  again, in 25 years, it's quite likely that a bunch of new platforms  will overtake both, no matter what they do.</p><p> That hasn't stopped Warren from acting as if tech companies  like Google are the new Standard Oil. \"I want a government that  makes sure everybody -- even the biggest and most powerful  companies in America -- plays by the rules,\" Warren claims. This  misleading turn of phrase has become standard on the left, which  often acts as if companies are breaking the law or using  \"loopholes\" when they fail to adhere to the imaginary regulations.  Tech companies aren't breaking any rules by ignoring Warren's  fictitious strictures. We already have a place to adjudicate the  usefulness of mergers, and it's called the Justice Department. They  already do a terrible job without any more help. And if the DOJ is  susceptible to partisan pressure -- Democrats are now arguing that  Trump ordered it to block the Time Warner/AT&amp;T merger -- surely a  second regulatory body based on capricious progressive concepts of  the common good would likewise be ripe for abuse.</p><p> A number of voters, regrettably, seem to believe that  increasing regulatory oversight helps alleviate the destructive  relationship between government and business. Yet, by giving  politically motivated regulators expansive powers to dictate how  and when companies can grow, Warren would not only imbue government  with more power to pick winners and losers, she would further  incentivize CEOs to placate government officials and politicians  rather than do what's best for their companies and consumers. It  would be a lot more productive if we left markets to compete and  instead broke up government power.</p><p> \"Curious why I think FB has too much power?\" Warren recently  asked on Twitter after Facebook took down some of her ads. \"Let's  start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has  too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social  media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.\"</p><p> A person doesn't need to be exceptionally perceptive to notice  that Warren's grievance regarding a \"single censor\" shutting down  debate on social media is weakened by the fact that she went to a  competing social media platform to perpetuate the debate. Nor did  it take much work to find out that virtually every major news site  had thoroughly covered her plan to break up Big Tech.</p><p> Her own tweet debunks the notion that a sole social media site  can dominate news coverage or a national debate. Taking Instagram  away from Facebook would do nothing to induce the social media  giant to embrace truly open debate. However, forcing a private  entity to run ads that call for its own destruction is an  unambiguous attack on free expression.</p><p> In the end, Facebook contends that they removed Warren's ads  because they violated company rules against use of its corporate  logo. \"In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring  the ads,\" the company explained. That makes the tech giant a far  more robust space for free expression than your average news  channel. And as sure as state intervention into TV news \"fairness\"  would backfire so, too, will opening the door to Big Tech  intervention.</p><p> David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist and the author  of the book \"First Freedom: A Ride Through</p><p> America's Enduring History With the Gun.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20190316Ar03701</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN8-0RP1-DXVP-V091-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren[1] announced on Friday a new plan to use existing and new anti-trust measures to break up large tech firms. As part of her proposal, Warren said she would use competition laws to keep marketplace operators from also selling directly to customers. Amazon[2]'s marketplace is one of the most successful parts of its online retail strategy, accounting for more than half of sales on its website. </p><p>Warren has made similar comments before. Elizabeth Warren is gearing up to fight big tech. The Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful announced on Friday a plan to use new and existing anti-trust measures to break up large tech firms, reverse mergers, and decouple platforms. She explicitly named Google, Facebook, and Amazon in an open letter published on Medium titled[3]\"Here's how we can break up Big Tech.\" Warren outlined a plan to use new and existing laws to achieve these goals. The proposal includes passing legislation that would outlaw companies from competing on the platforms that they manage. Companies with more than $25 billion in global annual revenue and \"that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties\" would be called \"platform utilities\" under Warren's proposal.  \"These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform,\" Warren writes.  \"Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.\"Warren explicitly named Amazon and its marketplace platform, saying that Amazon can use the data it gathers from selling other companies' products to create its own private-label products, ultimately running smaller companies out of business. She writes that in this proposal, \"Amazon Marketplace and Basics ... would be split apart.\" Amazon did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Warren's proposal. Amazon's marketplace business has been outpacing Amazon's direct sales for years. The sector now accounts for more than half of Amazon's total sales on its website[4]. The online retailer isn't the only one that operates a marketplace while directly selling goods. Walmart also has a similar model. And, this isn't the first time Warren has talked about splitting up third-party marketplace platforms from companies that sell directly to customers. Read more: Elizabeth Warren accuses Amazon of using a 'special information advantage' for 'anti-competitive' practices[5] Speaking with The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin in September[6], Warren criticized Amazon for the fact that it is both a marketplace \u2014 essentially, a platform for other sellers \u2014 and a direct retailer itself. Warren said that, ultimately, Amazon should not be in both businesses. \"You got to pick one business or the other, baby,\" Warren said. \"You want to be a competitor, be a competitor. That's great. You want to be the platform provider that is a different function. If you're getting a huge competitive advantage from being a platform provider because of all this information you keep scraping off, then we no longer have competition going on.\" Read more on

I'll see you guys on Instagram.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there's one small problem. Facebook owns its former competitor, Instagram \u2014 which has over 1 billion users worldwide. It has also acquired What's App, Oculus, ConnectU, and over 70 other companies. If you're frustrated with Facebook's policies related to privacy, you have almost nowhere to go. This isn't a problem limited to Facebook users. Competition in the American tech sector is being gobbled up by the largest players, and it's threatening our entire industry.</p><p>I've spent a career working in tech as a software engineer. And I believe regulated markets are the best way to build and deliver innovative products. That might sound counterintuitive. But increasingly, the largest players in the game aren't playing by the same rules. Instead, they're using their power to bully or buy out the competition.</p><p>That's why I was thrilled last week when Senator Elizabeth Warren put forward a bold plan to break up the largest tech companies, including Facebook, Google and Amazon. Many parts of the plan are strong and have widespread support by industry experts, such as breaking up Facebook and Instagram. Other parts inadvertently jeopardize privacy and increase consumer risk of malware and spyware. Overall, it's a strong start to an antitrust conversation that is long overdue.</p><p>The stronger parts of Warren's plan deal with blatantly anticompetitive behavior by our tech giants. Recently, Google was fined $2.7 billion by the European Union for anticompetitive behavior with its search engine.</p><p>If a seller wants their product to enjoy high ranking in Google's search engine, you need to pay to play. When competitors found ways to showcase goods excluding Google, it threatened their ad revenue. The EU fined Google for erasing their competitors from search results. It's notable that although Google is based in America, it's the E.U. that's led the way in prosecuting anti-competitive behavior and protecting consumer privacy.</p><p>Where I diverge from Warren is her prioritization of competition over cybersecurity and privacy. In an interview with Nilay Patel of The Verge, Warren argued that the Apple App Store needs to be separated from Apple hardware division. Warren's reasoning was \"either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.\"</p><p>This position would have unintended consequences, because it makes iOS devices far more vulnerable to spyware, malware, and even ransomware. Apple's control of the App Store allows it to reject many types of malicious software that would steal users' information.</p><p>One of Facebook's 2018 scandals was the revelation it had been stealing information on who you called and text messaged, both actions taking place outside of Facebook services. Android users were affected by this theft while iOS users were not. That consumer protection would not have existed without the strict rules and sandboxing of the App Store.</p><p>That said, Warren is correct that Apple can wield the power of the App Store in anticompetitive ways. Apple TV users were not able to use their device to watch Amazon Prime Video until December of 2017, which locked users into buying movie and TV content on iTunes. In a patently anticonsumer move, Amazon retaliated by refusing to sell Apple TV in the world's largest online marketplace. These kinds of indefensible actions should be met with fierce scrutiny by American regulators.</p><p>When I was a teenager, the most valuable American companies were in finance and manufacturing. Today, the world's most valuable companies tend to be tech. The crown jewels of the economy are no longer companies like Lehman Brothers, but rather Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, and Microsoft.</p><p>Countries like Russia, Ireland, and France are gunning for Silicon Valley and missing, because it's hard to replicate the American spirit. To quote novelist James Clavell in 1962, \"You got something to do, you do it. That's American style.\" We don't ask for permission, we're willing to bring in talent from around the globe, and we are fearless when taking on titans.</p><p>Which is why the tech industry is worth fiercely protecting, even from its most self-destructive impulses. Senator Warren is right; we need a tech industry where new companies can take on Amazon, Google, or Facebook and succeed or fail on the worth of their product. Without competition, Silicon Valley will stop taking risks and will stop innovating. Tech is too important, too fundamentally American, to let it destroy itself.</p><p>Brianna Wu is a software engineer in Dedham.

It also hit a nerve among Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who've grown increasingly concerned that curbs on anticompetitive conduct are poorly enforced.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That all but ensures that restraining the power of dominant companies will be a focus of the 2020 campaign as Democrats seek to unseat President Donald Trump. This month, presidential candidates Amy Klobuchar and Julian Castro are set to appear at an Iowa event along with Warren to discuss monopoly power in rural communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, Warren's prescription for targeting big tech is not without political and legal risks. Breaking up a company would entail years of litigation and could alienate some voters who enjoy its services. And even advocates of reining in big companies aren't necessarily on board.</p><p>\"Elizabeth Warren's proposal is very radical because it's front-running the intellectual debate rather than codifying what the intellectual debate has produced,\" said Luigi Zingales, director of the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago. \"The people who think there is a problem are probably in the minority, even in the academic world.\"</p><p>Warren's broadside is part of a wider rethinking of antitrust enforcement in the U.S. that until now has has been mostly relegated to legal conferences and academic papers. At its heart is the view that antitrust officials have fallen down on the job, leaving broad swaths of the economy dominated by large firms insulated from competition. Plenty of lawyers and economists dispute there's a problem, but its proponents have pushed the break-em-up idea to center stage in the antitrust circles of Washington and academia.</p><p>There's a split on how to deal with the issue. One view, advanced by Barry Lynn's Open Markets Institute in Washington, calls for throwing out the current playbook and reorienting antitrust enforcement away from its emphasis on consumer prices. Lynn advocates for reining in the ability of big platforms to squeeze sellers. One way to do that - which Warren embraces- is prohibiting tech platforms from moving into different lines of business where they can abuse their power as middlemen.</p><p>Another camp supports stepped-up enforcement under the existing framework based on consumers. That's a balanced approach that was articulated at a conference last week in Washington that featured former Justice Department and FTC officials. It's an approach Warren would reject, said William Kovacic, a former FTC commissioner who is now a professor at George Washington University Law School.</p><p>\"She'd say, 'it's nice and it's cute, but you guys don't have the guts or the vision to see what has to be done and I do and everything that went on in here is a timid response to a serious problem, and the house is burning down and you still want to water the bushes in the back yard,'\" Kovacic said.</p><p>NOT ALONE</p><p>Warren's not alone in favoring a more aggressive approach. Joe Simons, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, has acknowledged the possibility enforcers may have fallen short. He set up a task force last month to investigate tech companies and possibly unwind past mergers. The chairman of the House's antitrust panel, Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said earlier this year that when it comes to tech companies, \"every option is on the table.\"</p><p>Talk like that would have been dismissed as fanciful just a couple of years ago when Silicon Valley was the darling of the Obama administration. Now it's grappling with what increasingly seems to be an existential threat. And it's coming not just from liberal Democrats like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Even Republicans are on the attack. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told the Conservative Political Action Conference this month that Facebook and Google are \"a law unto themselves\" and are threatening competition. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas even retweeted Warren, saying she was right to criticize Facebook for having too much power.</p><p>Warren has called for legislation that would treat large tech companies like Amazon as utilities and ban them from owning participants on the platform. Under that scenario, Amazon's marketplace, for example, would be split from its AmazonBasics business. Google search would be spun off from the rest of the company. Warren also said she'd seek to undo past mergers that she said undermined competition, including Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Google's purchase of DoubleClick.</p><p>Preventing tech platforms from moving into other lines of business - also called vertical integration - is an idea backed by Lina Khan, an antitrust scholar who wrote an influential paper on Amazon's threat to competition. Khan, who was recently hired to work for the House antitrust subcommittee, lauded Warren's proposal. She argues that separation addresses the risk that technology platforms like Amazon and Google will discriminate against companies that depend on them.</p><p>Breaking up companies is practically unheard of today in antitrust enforcement. The last example occurred in 1982 when AT&amp;T reached a settlement with the Justice Department to give up its local phone companies. Nearly 20 years later in the U.S. antitrust case against Microsoft, a federal judge ordered the company split up, a decision later reversed on appeal. Warren, like many others, credited the Microsoft case for paving the way for Google's success.</p><p>NOT MUCH TO SHOW</p><p>Since then, U.S. enforcers don't have much to show when it comes to policing tech platforms, while European officials have brought antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. The FTC and Justice Department are frequently criticized for approving mergers that allowed Facebook and Google to strengthen their dominance. In 2013, the FTC under President Barack Obama closed an investigation into whether Google violated antitrust laws by skewing search results.</p><p>Some experts are still mystified by that decision.</p><p>\"Why didn't you pull the trigger? You had the shot,\" Kovacic said. \"That's what they have not answered for us.\"</p><p>Bringing a case today to force a breakup of a tech company, let alone three of them, would require years of litigation and face a skeptical judiciary, according to Kovacic. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled against a group of states and the U.S. in an antitrust case against American Express Co. that some saw as hobbling enforcement against tech platforms.</p><p>And there's a risk Warren's proposal will alienate some voters, given that people understand the benefits the companies provide, said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. While her vision will find support among liberal Democrats, Crane said, it also resonates in some quarters on the right. Former Trump adviser Stephen Bannon reportedly supports regulating Google and Facebook like utilities.</p><p>\"The question is how deep will the political support be for the kind of very aggressive change in direction that Liz Warren is pushing,\" said Crane. \"Will she ultimately get traction and will it turn into votes? I'm a little skeptical that's going to happen for her.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Massachusetts U.S. Sen.

Impeachment involves the House of Representatives exercising a responsibility clearly bestowed on it with broad latitude by the U.S. Constitution, to punish an act by President Donald Trump that was foolish and improper, but also squarely within his constitutional powers.</p><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say Trump violated the Constitution on his call with the Ukrainian president, but there's no serious argument for this.</p><p> The conduct of foreign policy -- and horse-trading with foreign leaders -- is a core presidential duty.</p><p> The problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump's presidency, namely his inability or unwillingness to distinguish between himself and his office.</p><p> Trump doesn't think institutionally or constitutionally.</p><p> In contrast to his carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries.</p><p> It's not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn't know that they exist; it's that she doesn't care.</p><p> Her broad approach is if she doesn't like something about America, she'll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn't a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary.</p><p> One of Warren's signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, her plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed.</p><p> Someone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \"constitutionally or legally suspect\" is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda.</p><p> As conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple.</p><p> And on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it's not clear under what authority.</p><p> Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \"I appreciate what you're getting at Liz, but you can't do that.\"</p><p> To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren't thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution.</p><p> This gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump's Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal didn't raise a peep when President Barack Obama rewrote immigration law on his own after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn't have the power to do it.</p><p> To be sure, the reliable, consistent constituency for strictly bounded executive action is vanishingly small.</p><p> It amounts to about a dozen senators, those Republicans brave enough to oppose Trump's emergency declaration to repurpose military funding for the border wall, the most problematic of his executive actions.</p><p> All you need to know about how seriously most of the left takes the Constitution is that at the same time it's freaking out about Trump, it's boosting the prospects of Elizabeth Warren, who is promising to ignore it as a matter of policy.</p><p> Rich Lowry is on Twitter @ RichLowry</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Rich Lowry</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-89079ce066506be9395a9b6a82afd06e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B0A38BDF88A NWBKLA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCN-CG21-JBCN-450F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Crowley Post-Signal, Louisiana State Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren's recent proposal to break up big tech companies bears out my warning on this site from last September that tech companies' actions are setting the stage for a return to Teddy Roosevelt type trust-busting.</p><p>In her post explaining her plans to break up the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, Warren referred to the trust-busting efforts of the early 20thcentury. She argues that now, like a hundred years ago, monopolies are bad and competition is good. The growing tech giants that gobble up competitors wipe out the competition that is needed to make companies better and stymies innovation.</p><p>Wonder if she applies that same philosophy to government monopolies that attempt to thwart competition in the field of education? But I digress.</p><p>Months ago, the U.S. Justice Department gave notice that it too was looking into the growing concern that big tech was hurting competition and stifling the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>The concern I raised last September that social media platforms could be declared public utilities is a plan Warren embraced as something called \"platform utilities.\" Warren wrote: \"These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.\"</p><p>How will the Valley respond? Days before Warren's announcement, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg declared a new \"privacy manifesto\" to reassure users about Facebook's concern over privacy issues. Big tech is feeling heat. However, the offered solutions won't turn down the flame. Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal panned Zuckerberg's proposal.</p><p>Be careful of all the regulators Warren plans to send out across the Internet to force the break-ups and the post-break-up adherences to whatever rules are created. There is also a danger to innovation and entrepreneurship from a swarming locust of regulators.</p><p>At the end of my trust busting column last September I asked: \"Is it too hard to imagine that either political party, sensing public frustration with the dominance of the Internet mega companies, could pull out Teddy Roosevelt's big stick and attempt to re-create some form of trust busting for the modern era?\"</p><p>Now, Warren has introduced the idea into the presidential contest, which begs the question, what will be the political repercussions?</p><p>Silicon Valley has had a cozy relationship with Democrats, sending large portions of political donations to Democrats. Will Republicans stand up for these businesses with the possible payoff of Silicon Valley donors switching sides? Or will vote counters find that the trust-busting appeals to the public and Republicans will come up with their own version of tech break-ups, presumably with fewer regulators?</p><p>And, how will Kamala Harris respond?</p><p>The California senator has good relationships in the Silicon Valley and counted on her friends there to support her presidential bid. Keeping a distance from the Warren proposals could strengthen her ties with Valley leaders at the risk of offending progressive voters who want to take big business down.</p><p>Joel Fox is editor and co-publisher of Fox and Hounds Daily, where this column first appeared.</p><p>Fox and Hounds</p><p>Joel Fox</p><p>Guest columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Fox and Hounds</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Joel Fox</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Guest columnist</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VISTIM-vis-1838319303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VISTIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-V7K1-DYJJ-P4P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257778</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Visalia Times-Delta All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Visalia Times-Delta (California)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Before cracking down on Amazon, Facebook, and Google, let\u2019s kill the public policies that rig the game in the favor of Amazon, Facebook, and Google.</p><p> For example, a House committee last week passed a bill to set the minimum wage at $15 an hour.Amazon, which recently agreed to pay its workers $15 an hour, is lobbying for this law in order to break its competitors who lack Amazon\u2019s volume and cannot operate on its tight m rgins.If you worry that Amazon is becoming too powaerful, stop outlawing its smaller competitors by supporting the wage law that will outlaw its compet-i tors\u2019 business model.</p><p> In fact, all regulations and taxes that add to the cost of operating a bric-kan-dmortar store help Amazon by shutting down mom and pop businesses or preventing them from starting.Warren ought to examine the fe-d eral regulations that cripple Main Street, and try to a-l leviate that burden wherever possible, before resorting to the extremely invasive but occasionally necessary measure of breaking up a lawfully built company.</p><p> If Amazon really is the bad guy, then why are so many in Congress eager to pass a federal Internet sales tax bill and net neutrality regulations that it favors? Net neutrality is a major lobbying priority for all three of Warren\u2019s boogeymen \u2014 Amazon, Facebook, and Google\u2014 because it freezes in place a business model that favors these giants.Passage of such a law does not seem like a great way to challenge their market dom-i nance.</p><p> Internet sales taxes are similar.Amazon already co-l lects these taxes. That\u2019s why it is lobbying for a federal law to require all online retailers to collect them. Again, this is a measure designed to break Amazon\u2019s compet-i tion in the area of fulfillment.</p><p> If a local bookstore gets ou-to-fstate orders over the Internet, it would now be required to calculate, collect, and remit state taxes that until now were the sole r-e sponsibility of the ou-to-fstate buyer.It is beyond the ability of most small businesses to calculate, collect, and remit taxes for thousands of different state and local jurisdictions nationwide. But Amazon can do it, and so this law enhances its advantage in the market.If Warren is really serious about battling Amazon\u2019s dominance, she can do it by opposing this bill.</p><p> Finally, of course there are the rafts of corporate we-l fare state and local politicians offer the likes of Am-a zon. Does Warren have any pull with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, or the Virginia Demo-c rats who prostrated themselves before Amazon, offering billions in handouts and special targeted tax breaks?</p><p> If Warren is serious, and if she really wants to curb the -ecommerce giant\u2019s power, she should start by a-t tacking the tax and regulatory subsidies the company is using to slant the playing field against its compet-i tors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-172264A433E7F0E8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898012A0743ED NWBKGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-81P1-DXVP-V068-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Waycross Journal-Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren pledged on Friday to take aim at Amazon, Facebook and Google if she is elected president in 2020, breaking apart each of the big tech companies and introducing sweeping new regulation of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The proposal marks the most ambitious and aggressive effort targeting the tech industry offered by any Democratic contender for the White House, and it could put pressure on other presidential aspirants to offer similar plans for more aggressive tech oversight.</p><p>\"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" Warren said.</p><p>Warren's proposal has two key elements. First, the Democratic lawmaker said her administration would appoint \"regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>Second, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services - such as Amazon's marketplace for goods and Google search - as \"platform utilities,\" which would have to be spun off from those tech giants'business on those platforms.</p><p>Her plan primarily targets only those companies with annual revenue over $90 billion, and it would embolden federal and state regulators to issue steep fines and other penalties that harm competition or consumers. Even web users could sue Amazon, Facebook and Google if they violated Warren's proposed federal rules.</p><p>Warren's blueprint comes as she prepares to speak to supporters in Long Island City, New York, where Amazon initially sought to construct one of two new headquarters. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Sun Media Corporation.

A spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said a bill introduction was not imminent.</p><p>Warren's latest policy proposal promised to be a central element of her New York appearance as well as her scheduled visit Saturday to the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas.</p><p>Sen. Kamala Harris of California represents the tech industry's home state, while Sen. Cory Booker has come under scrutiny for his past ties to tech companies - though he's stepped up his criticism lately.</p><p>Facebook spokeswoman Monique Hall said the company had no comment on Warren's proposal.

Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) proposal to break up the country's largest tech companies has set the tone for the Democrats vying for their party's 2020 presidential nomination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The progressive senator staked her claim as a trustbuster on Friday with an ambitious plan to break up companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. She argued that Big Tech's market power has stifled competition and even democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people,\" Warren wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Her plan involves appointing regulators who share her views on the industry and pushing legislation that would make it illegal for a large internet company to both own a platform or marketplace and also compete in it \u00af which critics say gives tech giants an unfair advantage over startups and local businesses.</p><p>Warren's plan is the most aggressive proposal yet from any candidate in a party that has increasingly pushed a tougher stance on Silicon Valley. Going after tech companies has quickly become a go-to issue for Democrats, whether they're centrists or firebrand progressives.</p><p>Warren's proposal was the latest reminder that the party has moved on from the Obama-era days when it actively courted the tech industry and celebrated its ties with entrepreneurs and innovators.</p><p>\"You go down the list [of candidates] and most of them have staked something out on this issue,\" said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that advocates for a tougher crackdown on Amazon and other internet platforms.</p><p>Mitchell added that its long overdue that policymakers discuss antitrust as a way to crack down on corporate giants.</p><p>\"It's very healthy for our country that we're having this conversation,\" she said. \"It's a huge shift and it's really important that it's come back in the discourse.\"</p><p>But not everyone is so excited about tech companies becoming a top target in 2020.</p><p>The tech industry quickly pushed back on Warren's proposal, painting it as fringe and potentially destructive for the economy.</p><p>Carl Szabo, the general counsel for the trade association NetChoice that represents Google and Facebook, blasted Warren's \"hipster\" views on antitrust.</p><p>\"Breaking up tech companies would hurt \u00af not help \u00af America's middle class,\" Szabo said in a statement. \"Sen. Warren's proposal would increase prices for consumers, make search and maps less useful, and raise costs to small businesses that advertise online. This proposal is bad for all Americans.\"</p><p>\"The idea of breaking up some of our most successful American technology companies \u00af who lead the world \u00af and regulating them like public utilities would take us back to the stone age, hurt consumers, and stifle innovation,\" Tom Donohue, the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's most powerful business lobby, said in a statement. \"This is not a vision for the future, but an archaic idea that should be dumped in your computer trash can.\"</p><p>A handful of other candidates declined to echo Warren's proposal when asked about it over the weekend. But Democrats have almost universally taken up the idea that Big Tech needs to be dealt with either through regulations on the collection and sale of personal data or by antitrust enforcement.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), a presidential candidate and the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, recently introduced a bill that would make it easier for regulators to block mergers that lead to \"harmful consolidation.\" And over the weekend she floated a proposal to tax internet companies' targeted advertising revenue.</p><p>Warren isn't the only lawmaker to propose splitting up the biggest tech companies. Last week, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who chairs a House subcommittee on antitrust, proposed a potential Glass-Steagall-like bill for the tech industry in an interview with the Financial Times. The 1933 law, later repealed during the Clinton administration, prohibited financial firms from owning both commercial and investment banks. For online platforms, such a law could force them to separate divisions that sell products or data.</p><p>Warren's bill also comes as some regulators are ramping up oversight of the tech industry. President Trump has previously raised questions about whether industry players are running afoul of the nation's antitrust laws.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently announced a new task force dedicated to scrutinizing tech giants' market power. The agency said that task force could potentially look at unwinding past mergers in the industry.</p><p>But Sam McGowan, an analyst with Beacon Policy Advisors, argues that the FTC would face enormous obstacles in trying to take on the Silicon Valley titans, and he believes the agency \"recognizes it's a little bit like David and Goliath.\"</p><p>McGowan also believes that even if Warren wins the White House in 2020, her plan could easily be stymied by Congress. But he said Silicon Valley should be concerned about how the industry has become a frequent target of Democratic candidates like Warren.</p><p>\"I think it's a little bit like 'Medicare for all,' \" he said of the progressive health care reform blueprint.</p><p>\"Some of the more extreme proposals aren't going to get adopted,\" he continued. \"But some version of Warren's plan is eventually going to go into effect if a Democrat wins.</p><p>\"It's clearly a threat to the tech industry, and they understand that very well.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

Elizabeth Warren pledged on Friday to take aim at Amazon, Facebook and Google if she is elected president in 2020, breaking apart each of the big tech companies and introducing sweeping new regulation of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The proposal marks the most ambitious and aggressive effort targeting the tech industry offered by any Democratic contender for the White House, and it could put pressure on other presidential aspirants to offer similar plans for more aggressive tech oversight.</p><p> \"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" Warren said.</p><p> Warren's proposal has two key elements. First, the Democratic lawmaker said her administration would appoint \"regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p> Second, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services - such as Amazon's marketplace for goods and Google search - as \"platform utilities,\" which would have to be spun off from those tech giants' business on those platforms.</p><p> Her plan primarily targets only those companies with annual revenue over $90 billion, and it would embolden federal and state regulators to issue steep fines and other penalties that harm competition or consumers. Even web users could sue Amazon, Facebook and Google if they violated Warren's proposed federal rules.</p><p> Warren's blueprint - detailed in a Medium post - comes as she prepares to speak to supporters in Long Island City, New York, where Amazon initially sought to construct one of two new headquarters. The company ultimately withdrew from the city amid staunch local opposition and fierce criticism from national figures, like Warren, who felt Amazon had received \"taxpayer bribes\" from New York.</p><p> \"We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\" Warren said Friday.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-2112566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898FC6AFE8AB7 NWBKTN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM4-BF81-JBCN-44YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Herald, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a The Daily Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,' Warren wrote in a post on Medium.Warren said she would nominate regulators who would unwind acquisitions such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's purchases of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.Investors shrugged off her comments. Shares of Facebook closed up 0.3 per cent on Friday, while Alphabet fell 0.08 per cent and Amazon.com lost 0.3 per cent.It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal.The most famous case in recent memory is the government's effort to break up Microsoft. </p><p>The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.Warren also proposed legislation that would require tech companies like Google and Amazon that offer an online marketplace or exchange to refrain from competing on their own platform. This would, for example, forbid Amazon itself from selling on its Amazon Marketplace platform.Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined comment.'An archaic idea' Tech companies have come under fire because of their role in displacing existing businesses. Amazon has replaced many brick-and-mortar stores and has been criticised for poorly paying its warehouse workers.Facebook has angered lawmakers for losing track of users' data and for not doing more to stop foreign meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Google has clashed with smaller companies, like Yelp, over search placements and has raised concerns it would comply with China's internet censorship and surveillance policies if it re-enters the Asian nation's search engine market.Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies.NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group whose members include Facebook and Google, said Warren's plan would lead to higher prices.'Senator Warren is wrong in her assertion that tech markets lack competition. Never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services and opportunities online,' said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice.In Washington, the president of the US Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, said breaking up the big tech companies would 'take us back to the Stone Age.' 'This is not a vision for the future, but an archaic idea that should be dumped in your computer trash can,' he said.Public Knowledge, a tech policy group, called Warren's plan a step toward protecting the next generation of businesses, but stopped short of a full-throated support for breaking up the tech giants.'We need legislation specifically targeted to enhance competition on digital platforms so that there is a real opportunity for new, innovative competitors to succeed,' said Charlotte Slaiman, the group's policy counsel.Tim Wu, a professor of law, science and technology at Columbia Law School who coined the term 'net neutrality' and has warned against an economy dominated by a few giant firms, said in a tweet that it was 'heartening' to see the idea of breaking up the tech giants gaining some traction.Tech companies are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2m and Facebook spent $12.62m, according to their filings to US Congress.Published in Dawn, March 10th, 2019 </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-RPNW1084631552195841255251762500031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RPNW-7005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKY-RJ61-JCMN-Y2G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><timeReceived>5:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Dawn</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 10, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren called yesterday for breaking up technology giants, like Facebook, Google and Amazon, so that such companies do not crowd out smaller competitors, prevent future innovation or hold too much power and influence in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Massachusetts Democrat, who is among several candidates seeking the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, unveiled her plan to impose new antitrust measures on tech companies, which would bar many from owning any participants on their platforms and reverse some tech mergers, in a Medium.com post.</p><p>Arguing that \u201ctoday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power\u201d over America\u2019s economy, society and democracy, Warren said her presidential administration would make major changes to the tech sector to crack down on such influence.</p><p>The senator likened her plan to steps lawmakers took a century ago to break up oil, railroad and communications \u201ctrusts\u201d in an effort to ensure competition.</p><p>In that tradition, she said, her proposal would restore competition to the tech sector through two major steps: Passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as \u201cplatform utilities\u201d and broken apart from any participant on that platform; and appointing regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.</p><p>\u201cThe steps I\u2019m proposing today will allow existing big tech companies to keep offering customer-friendly services, while promoting competition, stimulating innovation in the tech sector and ensuring that America continues to lead the world in producing cutting-edge tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we protect the future of the internet.\u201d</p><p>Under Warren\u2019s proposal, companies with annual global revenue of at least $25 billion, which offer online public marketplaces, exchanges or platforms for connecting third parties, would be designated as \u201cplatform utilities\u201d and prohibited from owning any participants on their platforms.</p><p>They would also have to meet a standard of fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory dealing with users and be barred from transferring or sharing data with third parties, she noted. Federal regulators, state attorneys general or injured private parties would also be able to sue platform utilities who violate such requirements.</p><p>Tech companies with annual global revenues between $90 million and $25 billion, meanwhile, would also be required to meet similar standards, but would not have to structurally separate from participants on their platforms, according to the senator.</p><p>Warren, for example, offered that under her plan, Amazon Marketplace, Google\u2019s ad exchange and Google Search would be considered \u201cplatform utilities\u201d and split apart.</p><p>The Democrat added that her proposal would also empower federal regulations to break up mergers that reduce competition, like those involving Amazon, Whole Foods and Zappos; Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram; and Google, Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>She argued that \u201cunwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market, which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about our privacy.\u201d</p><p>The senator further stressed that such changes will not impact how Americans use Google, Facebook and Amazon. They will, however, help small businesses sell their products on Amazon, prevent Google from demoting competitors\u2019 products on it search engine and force Facebook to protect user privacy, she said.</p><p>Warren announced her proposal to break up \u201cbig tech\u201d ahead of a campaign organizing event in Long Island City, New York.</p><p>Amazon was expected to open part of its second headquarters in Long Island City before the company backed out of that expansion in February.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Elizabeth Warren</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPRREP-MERLIN_84979114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPRREP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-FSV1-JCTS-G0CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">308103</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Republican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)</publicationName><edition>ALL S EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren pledged on Friday to take aim at Amazon, Facebook and Google if she is elected president in 2020, breaking apart each of the big tech companies and introducing sweeping new regulation of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The proposal marks the most ambitious and aggressive effort targeting the tech industry offered by any Democratic contender for the White House, and it could put pressure on other presidential aspirants to offer similar plans for more aggressive tech oversight.</p><p> \"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" Warren said.</p><p> Warren's proposal has two key elements.</p><p> First, the lawmaker said her administration would appoint \"regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with Whats-App and Instagram and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p> Second, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services - such as Amazon's marketplace for goods and Google search - as \"platform utilities,\" which would have to be spun off from those tech giants' business on those platforms.</p><p> Her plan primarily targets only those companies with annual revenue over $90 billion, and it would embolden federal and state regulators to issue steep fines and other penalties that harm competition or consumers.</p><p> Even web users could sue Amazon, Facebook and Google if they violated Warren's proposed federal rules.</p><p> Warren's blueprint - detailed in a Medium post - comes as she prepares to speak to supporters in Long Island City, New York, where Amazon initially sought to construct one of two new headquarters. The company ultimately withdrew from the city amid staunch local opposition and fierce criticism from national figures, like Warren, who felt Amazon had received \"taxpayer bribes\" from NewYork.</p><p> \"We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\" Warren said Friday.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-b0af2b661745dd331f7aa12336897961</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899AA5719889C NWBKMA</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-4V91-JBCN-43PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Patriot Ledger<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Then the fracking revolution came about, and the U.S. resumed its long-lost place as the world's No. 1 oil and natural gas producer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result: lower oil prices for American consumers, less dependence on petrodespots, a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation (with concomitant benefits in carbon emissions), and hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.</p><p>You don't have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing -- much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary -- to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.</p><p>Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to \"ban fracking -- everywhere.\" Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports -- another U.S. industry that has seen dramatic growth in recent years -- and a \"total moratorium\" on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue.</p><p>American Indian tribes also got about $1 billion from those leases in 2018. Isn't the Warren campaign supposed to be about sticking it to richer Americans instead of poorer ones?</p><p>That's a question that would-be Warren supporters might ask a little more insistently as she approaches front-runner status.</p><p>Take health care. As an ethical matter, it may be defensible for Warren to argue that \"Medicare for All\" is fairer than the current system. As an economic matter, she could be right that overall costs will come down under her scheme. And as a political matter, it isn't surprising that she has been less than forthright about the middle-class tax increases her plan will require.</p><p>But what about the fact that Warren isn't merely proposing a dramatic change in the way 170 million or so Americans obtain health insurance? She is advocating the abolition of an entire industry, one that employs about 550,000 people. Whatever one thinks of health insurance companies (and most Americans seem satisfied with the coverage they have), isn't it worth wondering what these half-million workers might do with themselves after being put out of work -- or, as voters, what they might think of Warren's designs for their future?</p><p>Then there's big tech, another industry Warren doesn't like and promises to \"break up\" by turning Facebook, Amazon and Google into regulated utilities. For this task, involving some 800,000 workers and companies with about $500 billion in revenues, she has ... a 1,700-word plan.</p><p>One wonders what Warren thinks might happen when things don't work out. Industries aren't assemblages of Lego blocks that can be taken apart and reassembled according to a clever new design. They are complex and evolving ecosystems, organized around scores of institutions, hundreds of laws, thousands of personalities, millions of relationships and a potentially limitless number of ideas.</p><p>What will happen to the real human beings whose lives and careers will be upended or derailed while the mandarins of the Warren administration try to figure things out? Will President Warren have contingency plans for her ever-proliferating plans when -- as they inevitably will -- things don't go according to plan?</p><p>Of course she won't. She won't because she can't; she can't because the central flaw of every economic plan is the plan itself. That's the lesson of the 20th century, and it's why Warren's critics aren't totally off the mark in accusing her of being a socialist -- not in intent, but in mentality. Those with plans for everything prove only that they can't be trusted to plan for anything.</p><p>Voters may not yet see this, which is why Warren has risen in the polls. But they will, eventually, especially when they notice what the senator's plans entail for them. </p><p>For the sake of democracy, let's hope Democrats give America a better, safe, easier choice.</p><p>The New York Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHATNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHATNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCJ-Y5D1-DY58-F2DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chattanooga Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chattanooga Times Free Press (Tennessee)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

Then the fracking revolution came about, and the U.S. resumed its long-lost place as the world's No. 1 oil and natural gas producer. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The result: lower oil prices for American consumers, less dependence on petrodespots, a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation (with concomitant benefits in carbon emissions), and hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania. </p><p>  Elizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.</p><p>  You don't have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing -- much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary -- to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.</p><p>  Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to ''ban fracking -- everywhere.'' Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports -- another U.S. industry that has seen dramatic growth in recent years -- and a ''total moratorium'' on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue.</p><p>  American Indian tribes also got about $1 billion from those leases in 2018. Isn't the Warren campaign supposed to be about sticking it to richer Americans instead of poorer ones?</p><p>  That's a question that would-be Warren supporters might ask a little more insistently as she approaches front-runner status.</p><p>  Take health care. As an ethical matter, it may be defensible for Warren to argue that Medicare for All is fairer than the current system. As an economic matter, she could be right that overall costs will come down under her scheme. And as a political matter, it isn't surprising that she has been less than forthright about the middle-class tax increases her plan will require.</p><p>  But what about the fact that Warren isn't merely proposing a dramatic change in the way 170 million or so Americans obtain health insurance? She is advocating the abolition of an entire industry, one that employs approximately 550,000 people. Whatever one thinks of health-insurance companies (and most Americans seem satisfied with the coverage they have), isn't it worth wondering what these half-million workers might do with themselves after being put out of work -- or, as voters, what they might think of Warren's designs for their future? </p><p>  Then there's big tech, another industry Warren doesn't like and promises to ''break up'' by turning Facebook, Amazon and Google into regulated utilities. For this task, involving some 800,000 workers and companies with about $500 billion in revenues, she has ... a 1,700-word plan.</p><p>  One wonders what Warren thinks might happen when things don't work out. Industries aren't assemblages of Lego blocks that can be taken apart and reassembled according to a clever new design. They are complex and evolving ecosystems, organized around scores of institutions, hundreds of laws, thousands of personalities, millions of relationships, and a potentially limitless number of ideas. </p><p>  What will happen to the real human beings whose lives and careers will be upended or derailed while the mandarins of the Warren administration try to figure things out? Will President Warren have contingency plans for her ever-proliferating plans when -- as they inevitably will -- things don't go according to plan?</p><p>  Of course she won't. She won't because she can't; she can't because the central flaw of every economic plan is the plan itself. That's the lesson of the 20th century, and it's why Warren's critics aren't totally off the mark in accusing her of being a socialist -- not in intent, but in mentality. Those with plans for everything prove only that they can't be trusted to plan for anything.</p><p>  Voters may not yet see this, which is why Warren has risen in the polls. But they will, eventually, especially when they notice what the senator's plans entail for them. It's one thing for a Democratic politician to promise, as Barack Obama once did, to ''spread the wealth around'' -- but only when ''wealth'' and ''wealthy'' mean the same thing. The Warren standard is to spread your wealth around whether you're wealthy or not.</p><p>  In a recent column, my colleague David Brooks posed a difficult and necessary question: If the choice is Trump or Warren, what then? David's answer is that one would have to choose Warren, for the sake of democracy. Maybe he's right. But voters tend to place their personal interests ahead of their political ideals. And, other than Bernie Sanders, no Democratic candidate would more richly tempt Americans to vote the former than Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>  For the sake of democracy, let's hope Democrats give America a better, safe, easier choice.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It's a good question, because, as she herself notes, 'Twenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn't exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world.' To Warren, our most dynamic and innovative companies constitute a problem that needs solving.She described the details of that solution in a blog post[3]:First, [my administration would restore competition to the tech sector] by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform. </p><p>* * *For smaller companies, their platform utilities would be required to meet the same standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users, but would not be required to structurally separate.* * * Second, my administration would appoint regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers. I will appoint regulators who are committed to unwind[ing] anti-competitive mergers, including: - Amazon: Whole Foods; Zappos; - Facebook: WhatsApp; Instagram; - Google: Waze; Nest; DoubleClickElizabeth Warren's brave new world Let's consider for a moment what this brave new world will look like \u2014 not the nirvana imagined[4] by regulators and legislators who believe that decimating a company's business model will deter only the 'bad' aspects of the model while preserving the 'good,' as if by magic, but the inevitable reality of antitrust populism[5]. Utilities? Are you kidding? For an overview of what the future of tech would look like under Warren's 'Platform Utility' policy, take a look at your water, electricity, and sewage service. Have you noticed any improvement (or reduction in cost) in those services over the past 10 or 15 years? How about the roads? Amtrak? Platform businesses operating under a similar regulatory regime would also similarly stagnate. Enforcing platform 'neutrality' necessarily requires meddling in the most minute of business decisions, inevitably creating unintended and costly consequences along the way.Network companies, like all businesses, differentiate themselves by offering unique bundles of services to customers. By definition, this means vertically integrating with some product markets and not others. Why are digital assistants like Siri bundled into mobile operating systems? Why aren't the vast majority of third-party apps also bundled into the OS? If you want utilities regulators instead of Google or Apple engineers and designers making these decisions on the margin, then Warren's 'Platform Utility' policy is the way to go.Grocery Stores. To take one specific case cited by Warren, how much innovation was there in the grocery store industry before Amazon bought Whole Foods? Since the acquisition, large grocery retailers, like Walmart and Kroger, have increased[6] their investment in online services to better compete with the e-commerce champion. Many industry analysts expect[7] grocery stores to use computer vision technology and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of check-out in the near future.Smartphones. Imagine how forced neutrality would play out in the context of iPhones. If Apple can't sell its own apps, it also can't pre-install its own apps. A brand new iPhone with no apps \u2014 and even more importantly, no App Store \u2014 would be, well, just a phone, out of the box. How would users even access a site or app store from which to download independent apps? Would Apple be allowed to pre-install someone else's apps? That's discriminatory, too. Maybe it will be forced to offer a menu of all available apps in all categories (like the famously useless browser ballot screen demanded by the European Commission in its Microsoft antitrust case)? It's hard to see how that benefits consumers \u2014 or even app developers.Source: Free Software Magazine[8]Internet Search. Or take search. Calls for 'search neutrality' have been bandied about for years. But most proponents of search neutrality fail to recognize that all Google's search results entail bias in favor of its own offerings. As Geoff Manne and Josh Wright noted[9] in 2011 at the height of the search neutrality debate: [S]earch engines offer up results in the form not only of typical text results, but also maps, travel information, product pages, books, social media and more. To the extent that alleged bias turns on a search engine favoring its own maps, for example, over another firm's, the allegation fails to appreciate that text results and maps are variants of the same thing, and efforts to restrain a search engine from offering its own maps is no different than preventing it from offering its own search results. Nevermind that Google with forced non-discrimination likely means Google offering only the antiquated 'ten blue links' search results page it started with in 1998 instead of the far more useful 'rich' results it offers today; logically it would also mean Google somehow offering the set of links produced by any and all other search engines' algorithms, in lieu of its own. If you think Google will continue to invest in and maintain the wealth of services it offers today on the strength of the profits derived from those search results, well, Elizabeth Warren is probably already your favorite politician.Source: Web Design Museum[10] And regulatory oversight of algorithmic content won't just result in an impoverished digital experience; it will inevitably lead[11] to an authoritarian one, as well:Any agency granted a mandate to undertake such algorithmic oversight, and override or reconfigure the product of online services, thereby controls the content consumers may access. This sort of control is deeply problematic [because it saddles users] with a pervasive set of speech controls promulgated by the government. The history of such state censorship is one which has demonstrated strong harms to both social welfare and rule of law, and should not be emulated. Digital Assistants. Consider also the veritable cage match among the tech giants to offer 'digital assistants' and 'smart home' devices with ever-more features at ever-lower prices. Today the allegedly non-existent competition[12] among these companies is played out most visibly in this multi-featured market, comprising advanced devices tightly integrated with artificial intelligence, voice recognition, advanced algorithms, and a host of services. Under Warren's nondiscrimination principle this market disappears. Each device can offer only a connectivity platform (if such a service is even permitted to be bundled with a physical device) \u2014 and nothing more. But such a world entails not only the end of an entire, promising avenue of consumer-benefiting innovation, it also entails the end of a promising avenue of consumer-benefiting competition. It beggars belief that anyone thinks consumers would benefit by forcing technology companies into their own silos, ensuring that the most powerful sources of competition for each other are confined to their own fiefdoms by order of law.  Breaking business models Beyond the product-feature dimension, Sen. Warren's proposal would be devastating for innovative business models. Why is Amazon Prime Video bundled with free shipping? Because the marginal cost of distribution for video is close to zero and bundling it with Amazon Prime increases the value proposition for customers. Why is almost every Google service free to users? Because Google's business model is supported by ads, not monthly subscription fees. Each of the tech giants has carefully constructed an ecosystem in which every component reinforces the others. Sen. Warren's plan would not only break up the companies, it would prohibit their business models \u2014 the ones that both created and continue to sustain these products. Such an outcome would manifestly harm consumers.Both of Warren's policy 'solutions' are misguided and will lead to higher prices and less innovation. Her cause for alarm is built on a multitude of mistaken assumptions, but let's address just a few (Warren in bold): 'Nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon.' Yes, but it has only 5% of total retail[13] in the United States. As my colleague Kristian Stout says[14], 'the Internet is not a market; it's a distribution channel.' 'Amazon has used its immense market power to force smaller competitors like Diapers.com to sell at a discounted rate.' The real story, as the founders of Diapers.com freely admitted[15], is that they sold diapers as what they hoped would be a loss leader, intending to build out sales of other products once they had a base of loyal customers:  And so we started with selling the loss leader product to basically build a relationship with mom. And once they had the passion for the brand and they were shopping with us on a weekly or a monthly basis that they'd start to fall in love with that brand. We were losing money on every box of diapers that we sold. We weren't able to buy direct from the manufacturers. Like all entrepreneurs, Diapers.com's founders took a calculated risk that didn't pay off as hoped. Amazon subsequently acquired the company (after it had declined a similar buyout offer from Walmart). (Antitrust laws protect consumers, not inefficient competitors). And no, this was not[16] a case of predatory pricing. After many years of trying to make the business profitable as a subsidiary, Amazon shut it down[17] in 2017. 'In the 1990s, Microsoft\u200a\u2014\u200athe tech giant of its time\u200a\u2014\u200awas trying to parlay its dominance in computer operating systems into dominance in the new area of web browsing. The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement. The government's antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.' The government's settlement with Microsoft is not the reason[18] Google and Facebook were able to emerge. Neither company entered the browser market at launch. Instead, they leapfrogged the browser entirely and created new platforms for the web (only later did Google create Chrome).Furthermore, if the Microsoft case is responsible for 'clearing a path' for Google is it not also responsible for clearing a path for Google's alleged depredations? If the answer is that antitrust enforcement should be consistently more aggressive in order to rein in Google, too, when it gets out of line, then how can we be sure that that same more-aggressive enforcement standard wouldn't have curtailed the extent of the Microsoft ecosystem in which it was profitable for Google to become Google? Warren implicitly assumes that only the enforcement decision in Microsoft was relevant to Google's rise. But Microsoft doesn't exist in a vacuum. If Microsoft cleared a path for Google, so did every decision not to intervene, which, all combined, created the legal, business, and economic environment in which Google operates. Warren characterizes Big Tech as a weight on the American economy. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. These superstar companies are the drivers of productivity growth, all ranking at or near the top[19] for most spending on research and development. And while data may not be the new oil[20], extracting value from it may require similar levels of capital expenditure. Last year, Big Tech spent as much or more on capex as the world's largest oil companies:Source: WSJ[21] Warren also faults Big Tech for a decline in startups, saying, The number of tech startups has slumped, there are fewer high-growth young firms typical of the tech industry, and first financing rounds for tech startups have declined 22% since 2012.But this trend predates the existence of the companies she criticizes, as this chart from Quartz[22] shows:The exact causes of the decline in business dynamism are still uncertain, but recent research points to a much more mundane explanation: demographics. Labor force growth has been declining[23], which has led to an increase in average firm age, nudging fewer workers to start their own businesses. Furthermore, it's not at all clear whether this is actually a decline in business dynamism, or merely a change in business model. We would expect to see the same pattern, for example, if would-be startup founders were designing their software for acquisition and further development within larger, better-funded enterprises. Will Rinehart recently looked at the literature to determine whether there is indeed a 'kill zone'[24] for startups around Big Tech incumbents. One paper finds[25] that 'an increase in fixed costs explains most of the decline in the aggregate entrepreneurship rate.' Another shows an inverse correlation[26] across 50 countries between GDP and entrepreneurship rates. Robert Lucas predicted these trends back in 1978[27], pointing out that productivity increases would lead to wage increases, pushing marginal entrepreneurs out of startups and into big companies.It's notable that many in the venture capital community would rather not have Sen. Warren's 'help': If big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are prevented from acquiring startups, that actually reduces competition. The reason is that if there is less M...ue to legal uncertainty, there is a reduced incentive for angels ...s to fund those startups in the first place. \u2014 Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis) March 8, 2019[28]Arguably, it is also simply getting harder to innovate. As economists Nick Bloom, Chad Jones, John Van Reenen and Michael Webb argue[29], just to sustain constant growth in GDP per person, the U.S. must double the amount of research effort searching for new ideas every 13 years to offset the increased dif\ufb01culty of \ufb01nding new ideas. If this assessment is correct, it may well be that coming up with productive and profitable innovations is simply becoming more expensive, and thus, at the margin, each dollar of venture capital can fund less of it. Ironically, this also implies that larger firms, which can better afford the additional resources required to sustain exponential growth, are a crucial part of the solution, not the problem.Warren believes that Big Tech is the cause of our social ills. But Americans have more trust[30] in Amazon, Facebook, and Google than in the political institutions that would break them up. It would be wise for her to reflect on why that might be the case. By punishing our most valuable companies for past successes, Warren would chill competition and decrease returns to innovation.Finally, in what can only be described as tragic irony, the most prominent political figure who shares Warren's feelings on Big Tech is President Trump[31]. Confirming the horseshoe theory[32] of politics, far-left populism and far-right populism seem less distinguishable by the day. As our colleague Gus Hurwitz put it[33], with this proposal Warren is explicitly endorsing the unitary executive theory[34] and implicitly endorsing Trump's authority to direct his DOJ to 'investigate specific cases and reach specific outcomes.' Which cases will he want to have investigated and what outcomes[35] will he be seeking? More good questions that Senator Warren should be asking. The notion that competition, consumer welfare, and growth are likely to increase in such an environment is farcical.

Per CNBC:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren ... released a plan to fight disinformation to hold tech companies accountable for their actions in light of the 2016 election.\"</p><p>That's one way of putting it, certainly. Another would be: Having bought into the conspiracy theory that the 2016 election was meaningfully affected by people arguing stupidly online Ms. Warren has released a plan for the federal government to regulate the press, the publishing industry and the internet.</p><p>Why? To save democracy, naturally:</p><p>\"Warren proposed to combat disinformation by holding big tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google responsible for spreading misinformation designed to suppress voters from turning out.</p><p>\"'I will push for new laws that impose tough civil and criminal penalties for knowingly disseminating this kind of information, which has the explicit purpose of undermining the basic right to vote,' Ms. Warren said in a press release.\"</p><p>It is difficult to know where to start here. No such \"democracy\" exemption exists within the First Amendment, and no such exemption should exist within the First Amendment.</p><p>Ironically enough, Ms. Warren's proposal would represent a boon to precisely the sort of corruption and entrenchment of power that she insists she wishes to fight. In the vast majority of cases, it would be wholly impossible for the government to determine what sort of speech served to \"undermine the basic right to vote\" or to \"to polarize and disenfranchise particular groups\" or to \"disempower voters,\" such that any concerted attempt to do so would necessarily be driven by partisan interest and little else besides.</p><p>In effect, Ms. Warren is seeking the power to decide what is true and what is not - and what may be disseminated and what may not - and to apply this power to the elections in which she herself takes part. That she is chasing this authority while accusing the incumbent president of seeking to use his office for personal political gain (which he did) is startling.</p><p>Charles C.W.

I hope you enjoyed lunch. It's time now to get our energy session kick-started. So we are focusing on the energy markets this whole afternoon. A couple of presentations ahead of us from Javier and from John, as I mentioned earlier, speaking about the changes in the market and what that means we're about to learn how we're positioned for the changes in the energy markets. I'm especially happy that we are joined here today by Bob Schaffeld from Southern Power. Thank you for taking the time. He'll also join me up here on stage after John to speak about Southern's use on the market and to get a bit of an outside perspective and the partnership, of course, that we have together. Just one thing to note at this point, the structure of the afternoon is a bit different. So Q&amp;A, if you have questions after Javier's presentation, jot them down. Remember them because we're doing a joint Q&amp;A session after John's for both Javier and John, (inaudible) will be there. But with those words, I would like to invite Javier on stage.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO, EVP, ACTING VP OF SALES - EUROPE &amp; AFRICA, MEMBER OF BOARD OF MGMT &amp; PRESIDENT OF ENERGY SOLUTIONS, W\u00c3\u00a4RTSIL\u00c3\u00a4 OYJ ABP: Thank you, Natalia. Good afternoon, everybody. I mean they told me I have a challenge after the delicious lunch to keep you giving a dose of caffeine, and I'm going to make sure you get your energy up, getting you fully energized. I see some faces getting nervous but I'm not going to make you jump or dance, but I'm going to tell you what's happening in the planet. What's happening in the energy market. We are today -- we are in 2018 in the biggest energy revolution of the humankind. Renewables already have the technical capability to become the dominating source of energy. And whether renewables are entering into the grids, there's going to be a need of flexibility due to the intermittency of wind and solar and the engine technology that W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 has been developing during the last years to make it most flexible way to back up and to enable wind and solar to integrate has the biggest opportunity ever. The same with the storage. Storage is getting born now. It's a very small market, but it's providing flexibility too. It's enabling renewables to be into the grid. And we as W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4, we have -- we are launching today our smart energy vision in which we -- and look, we enable a future of 100% renewables, thanks to the engine technology and the energy storage technology that will enable this to happen. I would remind that today, we have a bit more than 10% of the global power generated is wind and solar. So still we have more than 3/4 of the planet are powered with inflexible solutions that stop renewables from happening. And those are the ones that need to leave, and the investments happening in the coming decades are going to make this ecosystem of energy system in the planet change radically from what we have today.</p><p>So let me invite you to our journey across the globe. I mean, you have here the map of our planet and you can see different geographies, different market trends, different power situations, different needs, but there is a very common denominator in all the geographies is that renewables are entering into the grid. In some places like the U.S., there's a very high penetration, very strong upsurgence of renewables, places like Australia, very strong impulse, impact of renewable into the grid. And there are places in which there are no renewables at all today, but there are starting to plan to have them. And this is bringing an enormous, enormous opportunity for flexibility to be the one unlocking this future. Our future with renewables become the baseload. And that cannot happen if there's not a solution next to the renewables, integrated, connected that makes solar and wind be dispatchable, sustainable, (inaudible) emissions, but at the same time affordable, the lowest cost possible, but very important today, who could live without the battery in their phone without electricity? So it needs to be reliable. So we cannot be reliant fully on the weather. So we need flexibility to make solar and wind be the winners. And that's what W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 position is going to be. Already yesterday by today and tomorrow, and our market is getting bigger, our marketing is getting bigger.</p><p>In some geographies that you see that there aren't renewables and you've seen in the last couple of years, we're installing baseload applications. And I'd like to mention Bangladesh because in the 3 tables in which I was sitting, Bangladesh's name came. Bangladesh is a country in which we have more than 1/3 of the grid, and they have close to 0% renewables. But the country has the ambition to have a deep penetration of renewables in the near future in the coming decades. And today, they have the most flexible grid, having 1/3 of the grid being with W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 technology, with our engine technology. They're going to be able to go beyond 60% renewables already with the amount of engine power they have.</p><p>At least during the last 40 years of life, I have been listening that the resources of the planet have finished and they are going to be ending, what will we do later? The good news is that renewables are infinite. So we cannot see any limitation. And this is a slide that I want to show you in the white circles, white bubbles, you can see the electricity consumed by the whole planet in 2009 compared to the predictions going forward. This is university study for New York, in 2050, very much aligned with our view and with Bloomberg New Energy Finance view and you see the resource of solar. Solar is able to power the whole world and many planets like our planet. Still less than 10% of the power generated in the planet is by solar. The reason that we have too many inflexible assets, we have too much coal, we have too much nuclear, and we have too much big gas turbines extremely efficient but extremely inflexible that when solar is entering into the grid, those investments are losing money and then solar is not the preferred investment. So engines and storage are here already yesterday. But today and going forward, the opportunities are amazing -- amazingly big to unlock this future of 100% renewables, and let me show Bloomberg's. I think there are most -- 3 analyst companies we have been checking these figures with and they are matching very well. This is -- I would say this is probably the most aggressive growth from this market analyst from the 14, 1-4, 14% solar and wind power that we have installed in the planet today, end of 2017. We will go to less than 50%, 5-0, to 47% in 2040 in the coming 2 decades, 23 years. And this is our reality we see. And we are here with our engines and our energy storage, taking a position as W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 to accelerate this investment, to accelerate this growth of solar and wind. So we need renewable energy to be the winner. And I'll stop -- you see these additions and still you can see coal, you can see inflexible gas, you can see a little bit of nuclear, totally not needed, but inertia from old-fashioned investment plans that are not needed anymore. And we, as technology leader and technology provider and technology thought leader, we know and we see and we are learning the markets that flexibilities making renewables happen and succeed.</p><p>On the top of the graph you see, on top of the gas that can be also flexible gas, but on the top of the graph, you see gray rectangles. Those are the flexible capacity, which will be engine -- reciprocating engine, extremely fast to enter into the grid and get out of the grid without affecting the life cycle and without affecting the costs. So you can keep it idle and then run in and run out and support wind and solar and energy storage. And if we make assuming into that grid part, we see the predictions, what is going to happen. I mean, we are going for now market for flexible engines below 5 gigawatts around 5 gigawatts, as you can see last year in 2017, to more than 10x on fold in the coming 2 decades. And this is going to be the biggest opportunity for renewables to happen is that flexibility is opening the door, is observing, is making sure that renewables can be sustainable, affordable, but for sure, reliable. I mean, there's no cleaner and no cheaper way to produce power electrons than solar and wind. But if it's not reliable, nobody will bet on it. So we need flexible engines, and we need energy storage.</p><p>You know very well that 2 years ago, we partnered -- we were the screening -- more than 2 years ago, we were screening the top energy storage companies in the globe. They were mostly focused on the U.S.U.S. is the most advanced grid in terms of how much energy storage is installed, and we were always hitting Greensmith Energy company as the #1, as the biggest integrator, as the integrator who had the software platform to make storage succeed. And John Jung, the head of that business, now part of W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 since we acquired Greensmith 1 year ago, will talk after me and explain how we are taking a leading position in energy storage moving forward. But remember that the storage market is this blue one. It's a very small market, but growing faster than anything. And we are already one of the top 3 integrators in the planet of energy storage through the acquisition of Greensmith. And going forward, we are positioning ourselves to keep a leading position in the storage market.</p><p>But engines, engines that in the past have been used for baseload are now being the only way to integrate renewables, but also the only way to plan your baseload thinking in the future of renewables coming. So let me come to our country, you know that we have plants in -- power plants of W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 in the last 20 years, we have in 177 countries. So we were talking in the table that the countries that we didn't install a plant, I would not like you to go there, honestly. So we go to all kind of places, paradises and the opposite. And let me come to one of the paradises, to Philippines. Philippines is a country that is running on coal today. It's massively run by coal, dirty, inflexible power generation and are below 10% renewables being a windy country, with very nice coastline and supersonic country as you know. And you can see from the picture, which in fact is from one of the nice national parks there. We have been modeling, and this is what we do in every country we go. In the U.S., we don't do it country size, country level, we do it state level, we do it city level, we do industrial park level, we do it together with a utility. Natalia will (inaudible) listen to Bob Schaffeld that will join us coming from one of the top 3 biggest utilities in the planets from Southern from the U.S. We are very honored to have you with us both on -- the same that for Southern, we are modeling what can be done with your assets and what would be needed to maximize the renewables. How much flexibility is going to be needed? How much inflexibility need to leave the grid? In Philippines, in which the country knows that needs to bring renewables in and stop polluting and reducing the cost of electricity, we have been modeling the country. We're having modeling what would be the meaning of 20% renewables, 60% renewables, 80% renewables, up to 85% renewables. Let me highlight that the white part of the pie is the flexible engine market. It's the need of flexible capacity that the engine can provide with this very quick start, very quick leaving the grid. In 20%, they're still a very tiny one in light blue. You have this still baseload gas. But when you go to 60%, only coal is resistant because it's very difficult to decommission these plants apparently, especially (inaudible) and mentally. But when you go in that tipping point in 80%, you can see that it's the maximum ratio of flexibilities when the maximum renewables happen. How to make this past to 100% renewables? And again, remember, we have 14% globally today. So it's a long journey that we, as W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4, want to accelerate. To go from 85% to 100%, we need the last jump is to generate gas for an excess of renewable power, is to create synthetic gas from excess of wind, excess of solar and provide this flexibility with clean gas with biofuels, with biogas, with hydrogen solutions. And that is also answering one of the questions I had in the lunch. This is where W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 is developing and finding new solutions to accelerate this past.</p><p>So in a little bit, the solutions of the planet, I mean, now zoom out of Philippines. Let's look a bit about something that is a bit more familiar. In the planet, we have renewable power, we have inflexible generation. Please remember, combined-cycle gas turbines, nuclear, coal. We have flexible generation that normally engines in any kind of gas, biogas, fuel, biofuel and energy storage. And let me remind that flexible generation and energy storage is what W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 is having a leading position. We are leaders globally in flexible power generation and we are leaders in energy storage since the acquisition of Greensmith. So the good old days for me, but the good old days when there were no solar and wind, there was no need for flexibility. There was this huge plants totally centralized, pollution was not an issue apparently, technology has developed. We are already crossing the 10%. We are getting close to the tipping point. The tipping point in which renewables are already having the same amount of renewables as the inflexible power. And in that moment, the grid is totally shaking. And we see that in many countries already. We see that in many states in the U.S., we see in some countries in Europe, we see it in the South Australia. Flexibility is needed. Flexibility needs to take over. Inflexible gas needs to be replaced by flexible gas. And energy storage starts to be born, and that is the situation in which we are now. So it will start to happen. So it's just to mention that we have 11 projects in energy storage last year, and all the big companies in energy storage, like Tesla, had 5 projects last year. So it's a very tiny market today. But it's providing good services, providing good services in short term. So we need to accelerate this trip, this journey, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and then a future of 80% renewables. When renewables are close or reaching 80%, renewables will be the baseload, will be the main source of power, will be the way we powered our gadgets, the way we operate, the way hospitals are run. And in that moment, inflexible power is dead. God bless inflexible power that is dead at that time. And God bless the flexibility. Flexibility will already have penetrated in every country, in every system. We already see it. Again, in the most advanced countries, we already see this penetration accelerating. And we are, as W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4, making sure that this is possible in the fastest manner as possible. And storage will become a major player in the whole mix, the grid will be mixed within renewables. Flexibility, I mean, the flexibility you will have gas. You will have engines that will be making sure that you never have a blackout, even if you have 1 month of no sun or you have several weeks of no wind, you still can get the best quality power into your grid.</p><p>And the final push is what I mentioned in Philippines also is going to the renewable. You always have a lot of picks in wind and solar that, that excess will be used to create other products to create water through desalination to create food processors. To create gas, we have a huge gas infrastructure. I mean, Roger and Pierpaolo were talking about the gas infrastructure. How to transport the goods across the globe through maritime means and by onshore means and gas will be transported to generate this power through flexibility. And power to gas will be an option that as I said W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 is making sure that we develop and we take a foothold on. Summarizing where we are. And I was mentioning flexibility and energy storage. W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 has made a conscious decision. You'll remember 1.5 years ago in the Capital Markets Day 2016, I was telling to you that W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 was positioning itself as the energy system integrator. We were not anymore an engine power plant maker who was delivering power plants. We were really modeling grids, we were adding part of solar, we were hybridizing grids. And through the cooperation and the acquisition of Greensmith later on, we have enlarged our portfolio, becoming the leading, the #1 globally system integrator. We don't deliver what we produce, we deliver what the customer is needing. We have the ultra-flexible, the most flexible way to generate power with our technology that we have gone from the 2 digits minutes ramp-up to the 1 single digit. Now we are in the second range to go from 0% to 100% power. With energy storage, we go to the millisecond for short duration, but to the milliseconds, we are really able to integrate any source of intermittent or unreliable power to make sure that we get everything from the sun, everything from the wind, everything from any clean source renewables. We have the solar competencies in-house to make sure that we can hybridize grids. There are no anymore grids that have 1 or 2 single sources. There are going to be multiple assets. There are no big plants with big chimneys anymore, hopefully. There will be small plants closer to the demand. And the gas infrastructure is crucial, we sell LNG there, but any kind of gas, biogas, synthetic gas, methane, we can create methane also with excess of renewables and transport it. We enable gas to happen, and when there is no infrastructure in the country, we make it happen. This is the story I wanted to share with you today and still I'll see a lot of -- all the eyes are very open, and I see Natalia was spoiling that we can not have questions now. But we will have a long session of questions together with John. And I want to highlight before finalize my part two examples. In very remote locations, but very advanced grids. I want to go first to Arizona. I will not talk about Southern because Bob is here today, and he has lot more wisdom about that one. But Tucson Electric Power is a utility, but let me share with you that this is the #2, it's the #2 in the planet in amount of storage per capita that they are serving and the amount of people they are serving in this utility, they have the biggest ratio of storage #2 in the world. So this utility and W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 have partnered. I mean they have found us, we have found them, we have been developing together, we have installed for them energy storage, we have installed them the integration platform. With the acquisition of Greensmith, W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 has been developing the integration capabilities to have the wind they have, the solar they have. You know very well that is really an amazing place of solar radiation (inaudible) in Arizona. And when solar, wind and storage have been there, we have come with flexible engine gas or flexible gas engine with the flexibility to make sure that power is reliable. Power quality is guaranteed. Cost of the power is the lowest possible, and the emissions are the lowest you could find in any grid. And that is the solution that W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 together with Tucson have made happen in this big utility. And we are very proud of this case because, as you know, our technology compared to other power generation technologies do not need water for cooling. I know that's a small technical detail, but in a place like Arizona, water is like ice cream in winter in Finland, I mean, it's not needed. I mean, there's no one, you cannot find it. So you don't find water in Arizona, we don't waste it. So just only the operators and our customer people and our own people are drinking some water, only those ones. And let me go to down under, to a fascinating place, a fascinating island, so big to be called a continent also, and it's the country of Australia. And you know that in South Australia, AGL, the biggest utility there has invested in the biggest battery in the planet, that is they are to provide services to solar and wind, and they have called W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4. We've gone there, we have made, we've found each other, and we have modeled the grid, we've modeled the needs they have. Now we can really see that the battery is used in the best way, and we see that the 100-megawatt battery that lasts 2 to 3 hours. Now we are installing a 211-megawatts flexible gas power generation with our engines to make a total grid full of solar power battery, that is not a small battery. We are installing flexible gas. And as you can see in my slides, now AGL has announced and that's in the media that they're going to retire. They're going to decommission a multi-gigawatt coal plant. I mean, they're still in South Australia there is coal power generation. They are retiring it now. They're going to start renewables, plus 750 megawatts of flexible gas. Guess who is going to install it, but I'm not writing that in the slides. So this is the story, this is what is happening in the U.S., in Australia, in Indonesia, in Europe, in Africa. Africa is a fascinating place in which they go for renewables since it's the cheapest way to produce power with so much solar radiation. But at the same time, they know that they need flexibility, and I would say that W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 is the #1 power generation company in the whole continent.</p><p>Summarizing our smart energy vision, we strive for 100% renewable future. This planet deserves it, you deserve it, you deserve that this path, this journey accelerates. We change the speed. We make it faster. Today, we are too far, too far. So we bring our system integration capabilities. We model, we design. We provide consultancy, but we also take care of the whole turnkey solutions. We take care of the whole life cycle through our service agreements. We are present everywhere. So we bring the flexibility and reliability to make renewables happen, very excited about this future. It's amazing. Thank you. Questions after I invite John Jung, who is the CEO of Greensmith Energy, which is a 100% W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 company and is part of our energy business, in charge of energy storage and integration. Thank you, John.</p><p>JOHN JUNG, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, GREENSMITH ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, INC.: Thank you, Javier. Hello, everyone. This is a really good timing for a number of reasons, I suppose. I'm -- just because I'm new, I just want to introduce myself, I live in San Francisco. Although, I spend a lot less time these days there than I did before. I'm a start-up guy. I'm someone who has now built 5 VC-back companies, all serving the B2B sector. And prior to that, for my sins, I was also a strategy consultant for A.T. Kearney. The timing is good, not only because we, as Greensmith, a W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 company had been building our technologies for about the last 9 years, which why I would argue is not 184 years, but those 9 years are in dog years. But it was very much during a time when the market for energy storage was really developing. I mean, I'd argue that energy storage as a market has just shown up recently. And the timing is also good, not only because of the penetration of renewables, and as you saw in Javier's presentation, we believe that tipping point is about 20% penetration, which different parts of the world are going to get to. But also because the affordability of the energy storage, which was also the question around the cost of batteries, those lines have begun to cross as well to the tune of about almost 80 systems that we've now had an opportunity to deliver in the 7th and 8th country, thanks to becoming -- being part of W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 as well.</p><p>The final reason why the timing is good is that, I think, what you will hear from Bob from Southern company who has more, I think, generation capacity than the country of Finland, if memory serves, it's not just about 1 asset over another or a hydrocarbon exchange into electrons or photon to electron exchange, et cetera. It's about how do we make these grid assets work better for me, work better for our customers. And while we have deployed a lot of energy storage, a lot of batteries, a lot of bidirectional inverters, we think that is the reason why we are a W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 company. That is why the timing is so important. So today, I'm going to take you through a slide set that hopefully demystifies not only energy storage but shows you how it fits in within the W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 portfolio to make us not only relevant, but a leading competitor in multiple market segments over the next 10 years.</p><p>So this slide just represents the portfolio of things that we as a company bring to bear today. So, of course, we heard about services, we also have LNG capability around people wanted to convert gas into liquid fuel. And of course, engine power plants where W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 asked, I guess, about 30 years ago, what if we put these engines on land? And 68 gigawatts later, we're now operating in about 177 countries. But future technologies around renewables, future technologies around energy storage and integration. And I would argue as importantly, the software that many grid operators around the world, both in developing countries as well as developed countries, are missing to optimize a myriad of grid assets that not only are a</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>Senegal or Ivory Coast, where you're basically just trying to go from 56% of your villages to 100% of your villages having access to electricity or in places like California, which I think is about the seventh largest economy in the world, where you have a bit of Maslow's hierarchy of electron needs, as I like to say in terms of where that comes from, and recently, we went from a 33% of target of solar and wind mainly by 2020 to 50% target by 2030. We want to be relevant, and we want to be that master energy system integrator to all markets and really take advantage of what W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 has done to create its market position around the world. So if we kind of summarize some of the, kind of, key trends that are relevant to what I'm going to be talking about is, of course, there's a tremendous amount of renewable investment, but there's still plenty of fossil generation that also has to interact and be optimized with it. Secondly, when you are going from baseload fossil generation to renewable generation, it's not just that you're not getting electricity when the sun is gone or when the wind is not blowing, you're replacing baseload stable, spinning mass generation of electrons with inverter-based electricity, which is very, very challenging to grid operators. When you're trying to manage frequency, when you're trying to manage voltage of things, oftentimes, renewables are also being implemented at the edges of the grid where most modern grids were really built from the middle out. And of course, the customer choices that many commercial industrial customers as well residential customers want. So it presents a tremendous set of challenges that sometimes are not talked about, I would say, in terms of when the debt curve, I guess, some parts of the world talk about. Secondly, key power equipment OEMs are pursuing leadership in hybrid. I mean, W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 is not the first company to really want to lead in this space because, I think, everyone believes that is very important. And it's more than diversification and providing a portfolio. A one-stop shop of all these solutions. It's all about how does a company, a competitor bring it all together so that whether you're a grid operator in Australia or whether you're grid operator in Hungary, you're really making a relationship with a long-term partner that can be there to, again, bring and optimize all these pieces together. And of course, one word that was used a lot a while ago that's making a comeback is called smart grid. And smart grid is very diverse, but it involves what grid operators are investing in beyond and among other things to control and optimize, gather more information, integrate the grid, et cetera, and that market is expected to grow considerably. And of course, because it relates to computing and software, it also is associated with a very high-profitability opportunity as well. And of course, you know energy storage is one of these kind of interesting technologies where customers know, boardrooms know that they need to buy energy storage, but they're not quite sure what they're buying, which is both good and bad. The good part about that is if we are able to bring clarity beyond showing up to meetings with batteries and inverters, I think we not only provide that education to our customers, but again, we get that much more trust in the relationship. Then this is just a sense, there's just no question that there's going to be a lot of energy storage out there. There's a lot of energy storage around the world that is in excess of 10 years old. But mostly, they're compressed air and pumped hydro, which you need to be really geographically blessed in order to implement. And while we see some scant investment in those technologies, much of the energy storage systems that have been going in, including ours, have been based on batteries and they have been based on lithium-ion batteries. And part of that reason is not only the volumetric density requirement and the performance and safety, but also because lithium-ion, as an industry, has reduced its price by about 50% over the last 18 months. Part of the reason is that station and storage applications are a very small fraction of the overall manufacturing capacity of some of the largest battery companies in the world. So in other words, energy storage is benefiting off of all the investment that's gone on in for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and we expect that to continue as well. Just to give you a sense of who we are. We are an energy storage technology company. We are not a battery company. We think there's a big difference between the two. It's like -- it's like the chipset that's from either AMD and Intel. We think that's important, but that's just the ticket to the ball game, as we say in the United States. There's a lot of other things related to integration, use case, software and optimization that needs to come. And that's why Greensmith really decided in 2008 to really build competency across the entire value chain. And I'll give you a good example, software. When I say software,it's software controlling assets that have an incredible amount of potential energy contained in them. So you can't really design, sort of, Angry Bird software. Thermal runaway vent is pretty serious stuff unless you understand the batteries, unless you understand how to grid interconnecting your substation, unless you understand the intermittency associated with solar that's very different than wind. And how to integrate all these different pieces. And although, we were bought, I think, the transaction closed July 3 of last year. We were also invested in by other rather large companies, like E.ON and [AP]. And because we really set our sights on building technologies that were credible to some of the biggest power companies in the world. We feel like over the last 9 years, we learned what we needed to learn in order to very quickly hit the ground running and be part of the W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 organization. And I'm going to give you 2 real examples of how that's already delivering results. We, I guess, got noticed a little bit when we delivered with about 30 people within the organization. Turnkey about a 1/3 of the total energy source deployed in 2016. It wasn't terawatts of energy storage or anything like that, but that was in essence more than GE, Siemens and ABB combined. And I think to me, that's a definition of disruptive technology that it doesn't matter how many engineers you have, it doesn't matter what kind of brands you have, it doesn't matter what kind of balance sheet you have. If you have technology, ideas that are better and you can execute better than somebody else, and obviously, even a very conservative industry, such as the power industry, is going to utilize your technologies as well. We really cut our teeth on the first, I would say, grid scale and energy storage market and that was the PJM wholesale market, which I believe is the largest wholesale market in the world. I think their gen capacity is about 160 gigawatts of gen. And they were the first ones to experiment with the different type of asset that can respond to a frequency regulation problem that they had. This is a wholesale operator that gives you a signal every 2 seconds, and they establish a new signal called RegD and they were trying to understand the value of faster-responding assets to solve a frequency regulation problem. So they were very, very successful in this exercise. So successful that they thought they would need about 1% of that overall gen capacity to address different consumer -- regulation issues. They were successful with 0.7% of their gen capacity. And then, of course, that expanded into the California market, which is going through a lot of capacity issues, as nuclear power plants and other combined-cycle gas peakers and other things get retired. And we are a technology-agnostic company. And that starts with batteries. To this day, there isn't a single battery that's appropriate for all use cases for energy storage. Batteries are very much like car engines, you have Ferrari engines, you have Volkswagen engines. And the two, both have jobs to do, but they're instituted in vehicles that do very, very different things. Energy storage are very much the same way. So it's become almost fashionable to say, one is battery agnostic, but we have actually integrated 16 different batteries since inception, which I think then applies to other grid assets that we're also integrating, not just batteries and that includes wind generation, solar generation, fossil generation. Fossil generation not only from W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4, but also people like Caterpillar. We have an island in the Azores where we're bringing all those pieces together, downloading load data and predicting weather based on weather data, and basically, operating the entire island grid with all these different uses, and that's what Javier is talking about around being that future integrator of choice. And of course, we cut our teeth by being evaluated by some of the biggest power companies in the world. And we also benefited during the early days when I was going from concept to product by Apri and Sandia National Labs as well. Whoops. Okay, this is just examples of some of our handywork. The top left is a frequency regulation system in PJM. We have 6 systems in PJM. I think Tesla just because they started in residential, they have none. And this system has done over 40 million cycles of charge and discharge because it's responding to a command every 2 seconds. So the proverbial energy storage is charged when electricity is cheap and the sun is shining, and discharge when it's expensive and it's at night time. Energy storage is the first multi-application programmable appliance that grid operators have access to. And that's part of the reason why, I think, we have these case studies to show you. The middle top is a 20-megawatt, 80-megawatt hour system, which until early 2017 was the largest system deployed globally. It was in Pomona, which is just near Los Angeles, and they had a massive gas leak. I don't know if you heard about that, but it was a pretty big deal in California. That system from notice to proceed to commissioning was built in 4 months. So you can do almost a 100 megawatt hours of energy storage in 4 months. These technologies can be done that way. And if you go on YouTube and Google, Greensmith, Pomona, you'll see a Benny Hill kind of video on a time-lapse video on all the men and women who are part of unionized labor in that local area that don't even know how a battery works, but they basically built the system and broke overall record in effect.</p><p>The lower left is more of a proverbial California where capacity is an issue. Our customer there was actually a utility, not an independent power producer called San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. And of course, they're worried about a lot of intermittent resources there. The lower bottom is the 10-megawatt that, I, think, Javier touched on with TusconElectric Power, that's part of a microgrid. And a lot of people think energy storage is sized at 10%, 20% of the solar capacity. This one, it was 5x bigger than the solar capacity because we wanted to optimize that particular application at a university microgrid there that -- where the off-taker was Tucson Electric Power and the actual asset owner was E.ON Climate &amp; Renewables. The lower right is Puerto Rico, where as you know they appear to be suffering from more energetic storms all the time. We keep breaking these 50-year, 100-year weather records all the time. And that is at a military base where you have mission-critical functions that need to be up, regardless of what the grid is doing. So it's combined with solar, of course, but it's also doing 7 different applications to do ramp brake control, intermittency smoothing, fire compensation, peak-shifting and so on. So again, an example of a technology generation about 2 years ago that we delivered on that island, microgrid islands or one of our biggest markets that we're attacking now that were part of the W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 organization. The top right is one that, I think, was mentioned where these are the assets that (inaudible) our software controller is controlling, wind, solar, diesel gen set from Caterpillar, load, weather forecasting to optimize the entire grid. And this is just another kind of sample of some of the deployments. We are now in our seventh and eighth country. We just closed something in Singapore, which will be the first grid-scale system there, sold entirely by a legacy W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 sales individual that had relationship in that area. And then, Hungary was another place where we're actually implementing. So this hypothesis about the acquisition not only being beneficial from a W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 portfolio of capability standpoint, but as Greensmith, who we were having a lot of fine growing very quickly to access global markets literally overnight. This is sort of proof in the pudding that, that is actually working, and the post-merger integration is going quite well. And this just gives you an evolution of not just what's happening on the grid, but how energy storage that we're delivering or becoming much more advanced, much more sophisticated, while some of the competitors are just working on their first. And energy storage solves multiple problems, and it's more than about batteries and inverters, I think, that's why we spend so much time building our software. And so could I ask that the software video real quick that explains it a little bit?</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>Very high-level but I think that's one of the first marketing investments that we ever made as a company. So I was pretty happy to show that off. We use that for our customers. And as Javier said to Bloomberg, I think in New York, energy storage is like bacon, everything kind of tastes better with bacon, which is a little bit risky depending upon what part of the world you're in. But the Hydro video that you saw up there, we actually combined energy storage with the Hydro plant recently in the United States for an old transmission company called AEP they operate -- I think, they are the largest transmission company in the United States. So if you have software or if you have integration beyond batteries and inverters, you can actually accentuate the performance of your grid assets both existing and new by using energy storage. This is very, very high-level kind of explanation of the software. I mean, people always say software, but what does it actually mean? It's a three-tiered modern architecture. So we thought we'd bring some modernity to the grid in the software. The top is what the energy storage system does for living. It can do a number of different things, those are categories. The middle is your OS, just like you have IOS that gets updated in your phones. We have one of those too that we can remotely update, that has rule-based engines and HMI, multi-relational database stack and all that good stuff. And then the bottom is the physical integration layer with the world. And that's the key, so that you cannot only use the latest battery innovations that come 5, 10 years down the road that we don't know of today. But also again orchestrate, just like a symphony, a myriad of different grid assets that all need to be working better together. Not just the charge and discharge of battery, but to optimize the economics of electricity and make the grid much more reliable and the right is just some of the data inputs that we have. And I just -- I'm not going to go through this, but I just wanted to give you a sense of the rich mathematical algorithms that we offer with our software. This is the stuff that does all the computing depending upon whether you're U.K. IPP, worried about all the wind generation up in Scotland. And therefore, you're bidding in on the auctions of the ancillary market services market that was created in the U.K. Or you're in PJM responding to a signal for frequency regulations every 2 seconds. There's a lot there. And it's all been proven and tested by a lot of very diligent grid operators. And this just gives you a dashboard sense of how modern it is. The top left just, we envision a world where grid operators are going to operate not just a dozen energy storage systems, but hundreds and thousands. And they are all doing different things, doing different jobs in different locations, combined with different assets, but maybe they all need to be enacted in order to resist a brownout or blackout event. And so that's kind of thinking that we built in. And our software was also RIG certified in CAISO, which is a transmission operator in California. What that means is it's been qualified such that if you want to get paid in the California market for your services, you can use the GEMS software to do that. And renewables as the new baseload, I mean, what that really means to me is that as the economics of solar and wind become way beyond parity, way beyond, you want to use all the electrons that are created. Even if it takes 8 minutes for the photons to arrive on the planet and all that kind of stuff. And then you want to start using fossil generation engine plants flexibly to meet the variability in what your needs are and you need to be able to orchestrate. And the value that, that creates is very, very compelling. This is just 1 ROI example where the payback of adding energy storage to our engines is less than 2 years. It's the closest thing to a no-brainer in the power industry that I've seen. And what's more, we can be innovative as a company in bringing storage as a service to our customers, so that they can either buy energy storage as a separate piece of equipment with software and services, or they can just have their services contract that Wartsila has with pretty much everybody, modify it, to include energy storage, so we can provide the benefits of energy storage as a service, as opposed to it being a capital, CapEx exercise for these companies. So I think, we're just scratching the surface on business models and other innovations that we can bring to the party.</p><p>And this is just an example of, again, the thing that keeps grid operators up at night, typically, which is more about frequency and stability, as opposed to necessarily whether they have enough electrons to serve load.</p><p>And so the summary here. Yes and I have 40 seconds. So there's a lot of transition happening around the world and we don't need to be right about exactly what percent of renewables is going to be penetrated where, and at what date. We just have to be ready. And that readiness means not just having a portfolio of capabilities, but knowing how to bring it together to serve a particular customer in a particular market with a particular vision, of who they want to be over time. And as I said, grid operators around the world are having a bit of an existentialist moment. It's just not because of the penetration of renewables, but there's a lot more customer choice where people are able to put solar on their roofs. Google and some of the big tech companies that I live nearby, they're going 100% renewables because they want to. And so what are you going to do? Stop serving them as a utility, no. You are going to have to really innovate as a company. And we believe, we're well positioned to do that. And then, the other thing is Wartsila, I think that's, a typo, has 68 gigawatts of installed-base just in energy solutions alone. Of course, if you include Marine, I think, it's something like 200 gigawatts around the world. But let's just start with the non-mobile power plants. That means we can have a captive market to retrofit energy storage to. And that's why that ROI case study I alluded to earlier is so important because we are starting to have those conversations, everybody wants to talk about energy storage right now. So it's a great opportunity for us to bring something more than PowerPoint to the show, which is real use cases.</p><p>And then of course, the purpose to enable sustainable societies through smart technologies, that's more than a phrase. That something that I believe after being in the start-up racket for a long time, I hope you sense the excitement in my voice of being now part of an 18,000 person company where I believe my desire as a person to have an impact on the grid in all the ways. And by the way, energy storage doesn't care where the electrons come from, I always say that. We just want to do a better job with them. I feel that my personal goals are much better positioned now as a Wartsila company than I was when having fun as just simply a small start-up. Thank you very much.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Thank you, John. Indeed, (inaudible) indeed we're going to have the Q&amp;A time. We'll do together John and I, and the intention of doing together is to give you a complete view, complete view of this modernity vision going for 100% renewables and we as Wartsila we are going to accelerate that journey, again, through engines and energy storage. I mean, I think you felt from John [Schwartz] that the GEMS, the software platform that Greensmith has been developing is the jewel of the crown of this acquisition that we successfully did more than a year ago. I would say so. Any questions, please?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You have 2 camps here and Camp #1, and this is the Wartsila camp, says that you will have engines, which means that the production side becomes flexible. And that's the way to go. The other camp says that the production doesn't have to be flexible at all because you will have batteries, which take all the volatility and you can run with indeed very stable production. Meaning, gas turbines. So which of the 2 ways is the winning camp, is it the Wartsila camp or is it the battery plus gas turbine camp?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: I can tell you. And I think I said it, gas turbines are dead. God bless the gas turbines.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: But how can you say so? I mean (inaudible) Excel spreadsheet. It's not that clear.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Yes, yes, but I mean, I think, we will be super benefit from listening to Bob later. But I can tell you we see this everywhere. When we say that we are in 177 countries, I think we meet often, I think every 3 months, something like that but normally, I am not in Helsinki, I live here, but in the weekends only. And normally, we are everywhere. You saw the graphs about investments, there is going to be investment in combined cycles of course, but you'll see that in 2 years, the investments in combined cycles have reduced 50%, 50%. And our sales as you know have increased 69% in 2 years in Energy Solutions. This is an effect that is coming because of the renewables can take over the efficiency is not the Holy Grail anymore. Is the sustainability, means coming from renewables, of course the cost of electricity, not fuel, and the flexibility is replacing the old grail of efficiency. Flexibility is letting all the solar and all the wind be into the grid. I said, you have your point, and you made a very good question, I mean, we have a lot of countries and the speed is very different. Again, we're selling baseload solutions in countries with 0% renewables. In those places, is because they know that they will have to buy and they will have to invest in renewables because it will be no-brainer. But those who invest in combined cycle today, indeed, I mean, I will make a rhetoric question, it's like those who invest in a nuclear plant today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I can understand the situation when renewables are close to 100% because the other capacity doesn't matter anymore. It's hardly used at all. The efficiency doesn't simply matter, but it's a long way before we're at 80%. And until that, the efficiency plays still an important role. But can you just help me really to make it simple, why will gas turbines die?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: I don't want to repeat the same. So then I'll try to tell from another angle. And we were mentioning the tipping point when renewable penetration and allocation is 20% and this is not mathematical, some places with 12% is enough, other places need 30%. The disturbance into the grid due to wind, due to clouds, due to the night is too heavy. And gas turbines are by far, mechanical engineer, the most efficient source of electricity when they run full capacity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: But your friend says that's why batteries are good.</p><p>JOHN JUNG: I'm the friend?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: No, no.</p><p>JOHN JUNG: I just wanted to check.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Yes, yes. (inaudible) I have the battery camp and John has the Wartsila camp. You misjudged that one.</p><p>JOHN JUNG: So just a couple of perspectives. Given that, again, I don't care where the electrons come from and all that kind of stuff, is that perhaps the U.S. market although it's what 1/7 of 6.7 terawatts that are being generated on the planet, is a little bit ahead of the curve, but I think some of the CEOs of the biggest power companies are basically saying they don't see within the next couple of years another investment in CCGT. And then that's backed up by the retirements, not just in the United States, across the U.S., but also Germany, after they made that investment decision like 4 years ago, the headlines are. And then on top of that, I mean 3.8 gigawatts of orders last year of engines, I think, both in developing countries where GDP growth is 7%, 8% as well as places where actually load is decreasing because we're becoming more efficient. I just think that it's a bit of a false choice, as to whether it's 1 camp or another camp. I think, Wartsila is well positioned for either eventuality. And although, I think it's bold of us to really have a 100% renewable vision, the truth is we're going to have a lot of financial success between now and then, no matter what that real sort of outcome looks like as well. So just...</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: When you said my friend, I thought it was a friend who's making gas turbines because those are friends of mine, so I feel pity for them, today. But, indeed, as you mentioned that market is disappearing and we know they will come back. They will bring those companies who make gas turbines, they will develop flexible solutions with engine, some of them are investing in engines, well both of them have engines, in fact. And we said energy storage. But again, we're one of the top 3 integrators of energy storage so Wartsila [with a camp], or Wartsila we want both and you have seen the figures of Bloomberg that is quite neutral, I would say, quite renewable friendly I would say analyst like we are or even more we are -- that sees the growth of engine market 10x [folded]. And of course, the storage is 100x folded because there's very little today. And we want to lead both.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And okay, finally, can you just tell me you showed the (inaudible) flexible capacity installments by year, can you define what is flexible capacity? Is it only engine or is it simple cycle turbines as well, what is it?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: I mean flexible capacity is something that can respond to the intermittency of renewables. So again, (inaudible) today that as an engineer, an open-cycle turbine is not able to respond so quickly doesn't have the time enough and at same time, the technologies develop to run constantly and stable. When you stop it and start it you are reducing the maintenance periods and you are increasing the [level isotopes] of energy massively.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes, yes, but what products are these, what is your definition of flexible? Which products? Is it engines and simple cycle turbines?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Simple cycles are out of flexibility, they are not flexible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So only engines?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: No, no engines -- massively engines. And any solution that can in seconds get into the grids.</p><p>JOHN JUNG: Energy storage that can respond in about 40 milliseconds, if needed.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: That was on the top...</p><p>JOHN JUNG: Yes, yes, on top but I think when we talk about flexibility in general, it's not attached to a particular piece of hardware. It is what are the assets that are on the grid today? What are the products and solutions that we offer today that allows that continuous kind of response at a time when intermittency becomes such a big issue. And we think that is well before 100%, we think that the tipping point based on real (inaudible) modeling of not only IPP's territory, but even single countries like Philippines, is around 20% penetration, which a lot of different parts of the world are getting to as well. So I hope that answers the question.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Thank you, good question.</p><p>TOMI RAILO, ANALYST, SEB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Tomi Railo, SEB. Can you talk a little bit about financials, how much in megawatts was the order intake, for example, last year what was the revenue? How profitable is the business? What is the, sort of, room for expansion in monetary terms? When are you heading to $100 million level, $200 million level? What is the financial potential of Greensmith in the coming years?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: You're referring about the energy storage...</p><p>TOMI RAILO: Greensmith.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Yes, yes. I tell you and I give -- we're not -- we cannot and we're not going to be indicating figures from -- we have several business lines. We have Greensmith with energy storage and integration. We have solar. We have engines. We have gas infrastructure. We're not making a difference there. Just to give you a figure. Globally, energy storage integrated in the whole planet in 2017 was below 700 megawatts. We, as Wartsila, deliver more than 3 gigawatts close to 4 gigawatts, 3.7 something last year. So just to tell you, you could really compare megawatts to monetary value.</p><p>JOHN JUNG: We expect a lot of revenue growth. It's very much the end of the beginning. But it's nice to be part of the diversity of having a lot of engine -- reciprocating engine revenues and sales to allow us to grow energy storage in these new technologies. But it's a very infantile market to be clear on energy services.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Exactly, the storage is going to grow huge angle. Engine is going to grow with positive angle, but different. One more only, so.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Okay. Then I'll have to choose from my 2. Can you talk about the competitive landscapes. This is to John. So if you said you have a 30% market share, so who has the 70% remaining? And how much bigger are you then number 2? And how do you do if you put that into a global scale? I guess, Javier slightly answered that by saying 700, but I didn't really get -- how should we think about the 3, 4 gigawatts? So just talk about kind of the rest of the competition in this space.</p><p>JOHN JUNG: Sure. First off, let me just kind of explain the math of how that's counted. Because you have an entire value chain that supplies energy storage market, right? So if you look at the battery market, for instance, there's probably about 3 players for stationary storage that supply 80% of the overall batteries. They are companies like LG Chem, Samsung, BYD and others. So it's sort of depends on how you calculate because energy storage is one of these markets where in the beginning, there were a lot of so called forward integrators that showed up with a piece of equipment and tried to integrate systems, et cetera. And now they're retrenching back to selling batteries and inverters and what not. But if you look at, as Javier points out, the act of integrating a system, very much like integrating a phone or integrating any kind of energy system, and also talk about the software that it's touched. That's where in places like the United States, we are #1 or #2, depending upon how you calculate AES' capacity in the United States for energy storage. Of course, AES is a power company. It's a utility that has sold itself a lot of energy storage system. It's not an independent technology company (inaudible). So I'm not quite sure if that's an apples-to-apples comparison. Others include companies like Tesla, who have recently deployed large systems, 1 notably, in South Australia. So anyway, I hope that gives you a sense of the top competitors, but the other thing that I did want to mention is there's a big difference in the business model associated with those competitors. In terms of what role they play along the value chain. Our business model is very comprehensive, except for the fact that we do not want to manufacture batteries and inverters because those are global commodities that are available, where again, we like the freedom of selecting the right components to really integrate these turnkey systems. But to be that integrator and to combine energy storage with a lot of other assets, you have to do pretty much the entire job of integrating energy storage in order to do that. And that's the position that we are very proud of, but we also think it's just scratching the surface, given again we have installed-base of 68 gigawatts and a sales force that we have never had before around the world.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Thank you for the questions. Thank you, John. And I will welcome to the stage Bob Schaffeld. We're very honored to have the Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Development Officer of Southern Power.</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD, SENIOR VP &amp; CHIEF DEVELOPMENT OFFICER, SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY: Always fun. Thank you so much for having me. It is a special position to be in when you save the best for last. No wait, it's the last is always the best because it's the last. So I think I'm in that spot. I thank you so much for the opportunity, Javier, Jaakko. Thank you for allowing me to be here. I'm in a unique position in this conversation, primarily because I'm both a customer and a partner. And so you have my slides, I believe, in your book. So you won't hear me sticking to the slides very much. I'll use them as a backbone to have a quick conversation and we'll get to any questions that you may have for me. From an orientation standpoint, let me first talk about who we are and then I'll talk a little bit about what we do and then I'll more, specifically, dive into a conversation about Southern Power Company and W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4 and what we plan to do together. So Southern Company as you may all know a very large investor-owned utility, on the other side of the pond. Primarily, it's a regulated retail utility in the Southeastern United States. Southern Power company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company. This is really the way to think about it we're the IPP of Southern Company. We'll talk about that and I'll show you a map, but before I do that, let me talk about who we are, not just what we do. These are our core values, these are the things that we talk about it. So we're -- I'm working with the team to develop energy Solutions for the future, working with customers. We first are owners and operators of very large, very complex, very dangerous equipment, we never skip having an opportunity -- never skip having a conversation about safety. Keeping our people safe, keeping Wartsila's teammates safe, at the forefront of all we do. And then we execute our business as you see outlined here. We really do believe that a foundation of trust, superior performance, and total commitment is what a successful partnership is based upon and it's how we run our business. So who is Southern Power then? Now you know how we're trying to behave, let's talk a little bit about who Southern Power is. I introduced us as the IPP of Southern Company, but we're 48 power plants scattered across the lower 48 of the United States. That's a healthy mix of natural gas, combustion turbine technology. About 9,000 megawatts, it's about 2,000 megawatts of solar and about 2,000 megawatts of wind. So we're across 11 states. We have the opportunity to play in most of the major markets, interfacing with many, many customers of all shapes and sizes, be that municipalities, co-ops, traditional investor-owned utilities, like ourselves in the wholesale marketplace, as well as commercial industrial customers. So we may be meeting with the city of Garland in Texas one day, and Google the next. So a variety of feedback points along that customer chain.</p><p>We are actively growing. We -- right now, the focus is on renewable growth, just as today's conversation outlines. The focus for us, right now, is wind, but we're also actively under construction on a solar project and a natural gas project. It's an expansion case, not a newbuild, but Southern Power is very much in a growth mode. Which leads to conversation around Wartsila and what we're doing together. It's about -- for Southern Power company, it's about being ready for what's next and we absolutely believe that because of the renewable penetration, as men before me have outlined well, what Wartsila's engines bring to the equation may not be fully valued in United States yet, but it's coming quickly, this flexibility value is significant. And so what are those market opportunities? And what do we see? What we see is Wartsila bringing flexibility to fully support the integration of all the renewables. Whether it's the wind corridor through the center of the U.S., or the solar penetration on the coastline. It's a significant integration challenge. You've heard all these details before so I'm not going to dive deeply into them, but it provides our customers an opportunity not only to minimize their cost exposure to volatile market prices, but also from a resiliency and grid reliability standpoint, as you just heard John and Javier talk about grid reliability, frequency, modulation, et cetera. It's -- this technology is a terrific value-add proposition for our customers. And so our end-use customers are telling us this is what they want. This is the technology that Southern Power Company has -- is going to market with and we'll talk a little bit about that partnership now.</p><p>So what are we bringing to the table? We're a -- we Southern Power company long-term, builder, owner, operator of power generation projects, again, across the United States. And what we're bringing is a perspective that with the changing conditions that we -- you can see here on the left, Wartsila is bringing the brand recognition, the credibility, and the strength to the table. So when Southern Power Company and Wartsila walk into a customer's conversation and present a solution, it arrives with great deal of credibility. And as we offer those flexible solutions, it gives them a dispatchable generation picture that optimizes their reliability as well as their economics. So what does our partnership look like, specifically, not generally? It's an MOU we engaged last summer. It commits both parties to work together to develop 2 specific projects: One in the Southwest Power Pool, indicated on the map with our site in Oklahoma. And then secondly, in ERCOT, which is the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. So it's the Texas market. And why do we pick those 2 areas? I want to back up, what those are, 2 sites that Southern Power has and is actively developing solely for the purpose of the Wartsila engine deployment to take it into both markets for multiple customers.</p><p>So why SPP? SPP has a significant transmission congestion challenge and curtailment issues, due to the high penetration of wind. So if you think about the center of the U.S. being our wind corridor, the immediate and recent additions of all the wind in SPP has caused transmission issues and continues to do so. Therefore it's creating real challenges on a cost basis or energy price basis for our customers. Also the ability for them to get the energy transmitted to where it needs to be. Therefore, Wartsila solution is perfect from a flexibility standpoint. I think, you asked a question about what is flexibility? How do you define flexibility? You have to ask the customer. What is it that they need at in any given point in time. Is it immediate fast start for price support, for price arbitrage? Is it immediate actual energy delivery because of curtailment from resources. It gives you a technology like the Wartsila engines give you the flexibility to address multiple needs that customers may have with the intermittent resource penetration risk that we're seeing here. And it is the flexible gas can really help smooth this variable energy resource challenge that we're facing. Not only in SPP, but also in ERCOT. So we talked about why SPP, but now I'll just speak briefly about why ERCOT because it is many of the same reasons with the power prices and the volatility that we're seeing in the ERCOT market. The flexible engines can really give our customers an opportunity to hedge their price risk. It's as simple as that. When you have significant price spikes, our customers can call on these engines and at a known generating price, they avoid paying the price spikes that, that volatility brings.</p><p>So as I suggested earlier, this is what the partnership brings. Wartsila's bringing the 50SG engines. We will go see those tomorrow in (inaudible). I'm excited about that trip for good engineer having to -- getting the opportunity to spend time on a plant floor, it's a good day. So a little nerdy about that, but I'm excited to see that. The machines are impressive. They're proven and they're very valuable. If you're reading the news from the U.S., you know that there are grave concerns already about this summer in ERCOT, this summer in SPP, and I believe the value proposition will begin to be seen by many more customers. So an aggregation of customers across these 2 sites, you have Wartsila's technology in our development plans, the partnership, we will be able to lever that into a place that our customers are, I believe, surely going to have an appetite for.</p><p>We're jointly marketing the projects as well. And if you think about that, from a marketing standpoint from a origination standpoint, that gives us the opportunity not only to bring to bear Southern company's knowledge of customers like us or customers that we have access to, but also the Wartsila customers that exist today. So we're leveraging those relationships up as well.</p><p>And so at the end of the day, it's as simple as what I've just been describing. It's -- we're committed to this partnership. We believe that this is -- these are 2 sites that will be the starting point for a broader deployment opportunity with Wartsila's credibility, with Southern's name, with our customer -- combined customer base, we do see this as an opportunity for the future. We are out in front, I know Tucson, and I know others have really taken a leadership position in this, which I greatly respect. But as an IPP going to market to be able to sell these positions at an economy of scale level that gives our collective customers a clear access to affordable flexible power. We really do believe that this is going to be a significant part of our growth for next few years. I did that very quickly and I got it -- got us back closer to track. And I'm happy to go deeper into this, Javier. I'll follow your lead on this, but thank you for letting me be here.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Thank so much.</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: Oh, absolutely. Enjoyed it. Thank you.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Questions for Bob, in case that there is something for the Wartsila part I will help.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm just interested, why Wartsila? I can think of other companies with great brand and credibility?</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: So there may be other companies with great brands and credibility. And I'm willing to bet that Southern Company may own some of those assets already. What I can tell you is as we look at the flexible requirements of these specific needs, super fast start, Javier said it 2 or 3 times, you can't use a gas turbine to respond this way, it's cost too much. The maintenance cycles on those gas turbines are not feasible for this type of work. The Wartsila engines are the perfect fit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you haven't included storage in your plans, why not?</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: Thank you, we actually do. I have just gone very quickly through the presentation. Our focus for this piece of the flexibility is about the engines, but wherever John went, we had this conversation often. We continue -- remember, let me back up, our business model as an IPP is really to build fully contracted units. So where I have a customer that is interested in a solution, we're in a position to provide it. I mentioned, that we have got wind under construction right now. We've got solar under construction right now. We've got a build-out on a natural gas combined cycle underway right now. We have many customers that we're discussing storage options with just as we're discussing the Wartsila engine build-out. So stand ready to offer that product, but we would require a long-term power purchase agreement to cover that investment, and we haven't had any customers that are willing to take that position yet. But we would be happy to do it and fully supportive of storage technologies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: But it sounds, I think, commercially storage is still a bit more risky than putting in a flexible plant?</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: So I agree with the statement, but the way I would say it is batteries and this isn't -- they're a critical resource for the grid going forward. In many cases this is transmission or distribution offset, more than a generation play. So being on the generation side of the business, commercial equation for doing a battery and making a battery investment as a standalone investment, unrelated to transmission or distribution, it's a much more complex case. And we just haven't run into a customer that's interested to sign it up. Although I know that and if Tucson were here, they would be talking about their hybrid project, which is very impressive. So we're fully supportive and expecting batteries to be a part of our portfolio as well at the right place, right time, right structure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Maybe related to the first questions, I mean clearly you chose W\u00c3\u00a4rtsil\u00c3\u00a4, can you talk about the other options that you had on the table? Also what type of solutions were you looking at? Was it kind of clear for you that it is going to be combustion-based engine technology?</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: It was definitively clear who we were going to go with. Because of the nature of the engine, because of the efficiency, because of the responsiveness and the credibility it was clear -- definitively clear, who we were going to go with. If Wartsila was open to partnering with us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: What would have been the Plan B, if they weren't open for partnering?</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: I think we would be having more of a battery -- back to the battery storage. But you're talking about significantly larger batteries, so it's a little bit of an apples and oranges, we'd rather have both.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I mean, looking at you've got 9 gigawatts of gas production, which I assume is baseload. Are you -- is the plan to phase this out with flexible? Is flexible currently, let's say new addition, to complement wind and solar, I mean, how does it fit into your existing?</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: So I fully believe and support all the arrows in the quiver, if you ever heard our CEO use that analogy. Depending on what specific customer needs are and specific regions of the U.S., even in specific locations, any one of these given solutions may fit in the future. I agree with the overwhelming position that the days of very large new combined cycles getting built. I think, those are few, if not much further out in the future, and I think large, investor-owned utilities will be the ones predominantly building those, if they come back. I think, distributed energy resources are -- is what the grid is asking for. Control at the customer level is what they're asking for. But there again, if we're able to aggregate customers that justify building a larger natural gas combined cycle, because of the efficiency, economies of scale, we would absolutely do it again. I don't see it as -- we don't have any plan to phase out our existing gas fleet. Remember as a wholesale electric business, as long as I can keep those plants fully contracted to have a sustainable revenue source, I will keep those plants alive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sorry, with your capacity, it looks like you're at that 20% tipping point or ahead of it that they talk about. So do you recognize that tipping point? And if so, what proportion of your capacity would be flexible power?</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Can we put back the slides, if you want.</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: I was only going to -- it doesn't matter, if you can't, just going to go back to the math.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: We can see now.</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: So our customers at Southern Power Company are non-specific to any region. So 20% of a Southern Power fleet is not a tipping point in and of itself because of the geographic diversity. It's not a concentrated location. That said, we're experiencing curtailment on some of our solar plants, curtailment in some of our wind plants because of congestion that we talked about. So even in where we're located in SPP and ERCOT, we do see an opportunity for flexible engines to relieve some of those pressures on our own. But the tipping point to us it doesn't matter as directly as it would to regions specifically. Does that make sense?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I think so.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: I believe we have run out of time, totally. Bob, thanks so much.</p><p>ROBERT A. SCHAFFELD: It was my pleasure. Thank you so much, thanks for having me.</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA, CEO, PRESIDENT AND MEMBER OF BOARD OF MANAGEMENT, W\u00c3\u00a4RTSIL\u00c3\u00a4 OYJ ABP: So, great. Thank you for listening, thank you for all the questions. The idea really was today to talk about these 2 business: We have in Marine and Energy. I really hope that you also like the idea of bringing some outsiders, bringing in customer, partner, talking about where Wartsila is. And Bob thank you, really, thank you very much for taking the time and being with us. A partner who is actually also really going through our facilities. Yesterday they were in Warsaw and now they are traveling to Trieste. And finally, signing the contract with us I really hope that's going to get closer and closer. But I -- we promised also that we will have a final session for questions. If any burning issues any questions you wanted to ask earlier, but you didn't have time. So we're still here all who have made presentations. And of course, we also have the rest of the board of management, if you want to ask anything, this is now the moment.</p><p>There is one.</p><p>TOMAS SKOGMAN, HEAD OF RESEARCH OF FINLAND, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, this is Tom from Carnegie. In your vision in the Energy side you will be kind of also a distributor for batteries and for solar panels it sounds like. So I just wonder what is the P&amp;L impact from this and the balance sheet impact? Will you see revenues? Or will it be any kind of kickbacks from the battery manufacturers? Or how do you plan to do this, and it will be very different case-by-case? Or do you have a company strategy on this?</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Tom, thank you for the question. When we build integrated solutions in Marine industry or in Energy, we already use different kind of suppliers. It's not only our engines or only our equipment. In power plants, there are generators and there are all kinds of other equipments which we put through and build the whole thing. I mean the integration part in the energy sector was very important that there will be suppliers actually helping us to put the whole plant together. So, I mean, you will -- there are different ways how you can handle it, I mean, whether it goes through us or whether it goes even directly to our customer, but it's case-by-case.</p><p>TOMAS SKOGMAN: So you actually plan to have own revenues from a lot of battery sales in the future. Is this -- should I understand it like this or it will be just be [LNG] billing the customer for that...</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Depends on the case. There might be cases where it goes through us and where it goes directly.</p><p>TOMAS SKOGMAN: And it's the same with the solar panel basically.</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Yes.</p><p>TOMAS SKOGMAN: All right, thanks.</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: There is one.</p><p>ROBERT JOHN DAVIES, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: All right, so Robert from Morgan Stanley. Just one question, on the Energy business, just if you could flesh out a little bit more around which pockets in terms of regions you're seeing the strongest growth and where you expect, I guess, growth to be strongest in the next few years, just on the regional basis, you mentioned emerging markets, but can you...</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Javier -- is Javier anymore. Could you take the microphone and just -- I know them, but I let you to answer it.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Absolutely, I mean, I would not need to go to the stage, I can answer from here, definitely the U.S. is very strong market for us. Middle East, also a very strong market for us going forward. Southeast Asia, and Australia, very strong markets for us and when I say very strong in which we should be doing big contracts, and big orders moving forward. So just to mention last year as you know, because was reminded several times that Bangladesh was our biggest year in Bangladesh ever was 2017, but was also our biggest year in Indonesia and was also our biggest year in the U.S. and going forward, we see the geographies I mentioned being the ones that we have big programs of renewables coming and flexibility being needed. And for us being the hottest markets moving forward. But again, very global. So country per country, we always will have one single priority in many places.</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Thank you. There's one more.</p><p>ANTTI SUTTELIN, HEAD OF RESEARCH OF FINLAND, DANSKE BANK MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Thank you. It's Antti. Coming back to this Bloomberg energy finance picture showing flexible capacity installments, does this number mean -- when I look at it, it looks like 2018 about 9 gigawatts, and then 2025, maybe 27 gigawatts, does this mean that if this source would be right in its estimates, should this mean that your gas power plant business or your whole power plant business should grow 3x as big as it is today? Or how should we read this?</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Javier is there again to answer.</p><p>JAVIER CAVADA CAMINO: Yes, Antti, thank you for the question. Indeed, those are Bloomberg new energy finance predictions. You said it very well. Indeed, whenever you look at different analyst predictions, are a bit different. So I mean they're the ones who have a much more ambitions -- ambitious expectation in terms of renewables. On flexibility, I want to remind that is fully linked to the growth of renewables, the growth of that market. But said that, we have on our own forecast that shows a big growth of our addressable market moving forward.</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Thank you.</p><p>No more questions, then Natalia.</p><p>NATALIA VALTASAARI: Thank you. So on my behalf as well, thank you for taking time, full day out of your schedules. I know you're all busy to come and listen to our story. I hope we have been able to make you better understand how we differentiate, how we are positioned today, and how we will be positioned in the long term as well.</p><p>Any feedback, as I said, that you may have please do forward it to us, either through the form or just verbally to me, so that we can make sure that our next CMD is even better than today. So positive and negative feedback happily taken. And yes, I think with that, we're concluding this event. So those of you leaving Helsinki, safe travels home. And we look forward to seeing you very soon.</p><p>JAAKKO ESKOLA: Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Miriam Wohlfahrt gibt inDeutschlands Fintech-Szene ist aktiv wie nie[1] zu bedenken:Nach wie vor hat die kleinste aller deutschen Sparkassen Bad Sachsa eine hnliche Bilanz wie N26, das wird in der allgemeinen Nachrichtenlage gerne \u00fcbersehen.Eine echte Bedrohung f\u00fcr die Banken geht von ihnen nicht aus. Eine Revolution, Disruption, ja selbst eine Evolution sieht anders aus. </p><p>Auch die bekanntesten und erfolgreichsten unter ihnen plagen sich mit Problemen, die f\u00fcr deutliche Risse in der Fassade sorgen, wie bei Revolut (Vgl. dazu:Customer fury at Nikolay Storonsky's Revolut lock-out[2]). F\u00fcr noch mehr Ern\u00fcchterung sorgt hufig ein Blick in die Bilanzen, wie bei der solarisbank (Vgl. dazu:Exklusiv: Die Solarisbank kommt gerade mal auf echte Ertrge in H\u00f6he von 2 Mio. Euro[3]). Der langjhrige Liebling der Szene, die Fidor Bank, ist seit einiger Zeit Teil der zweitgr\u00f6ten franz\u00f6sischen Bankengruppe, der Groupe BPCE[4]. Bei der solarisbank und N26 sind \u00fcberdies Banken und Technologiekonzerne engagiert. Ohne Anschluss an ein groes digitales kosystem haben die meisten Fintech-Startups auf Dauer keine berlebenschance. (Vgl. dazu:Moven wird zu einer 'gew\u00f6hnlichen' Bank mit Anschluss an ein groes digitales kosystem[5]). Echte Challenger-Banken gibt es nach Ansicht von PwC ohnehin nicht (Vgl. dazu:There is no such thing as a challenger bank (PWC)[6]). In den nchsten Jahren, so ein Tenor der Studie, wird die Zahl der Challenger Banken sinken; nur wenige werden den Spagat zwischen rascher Skalierung und Profitabilitt schaffen und ein tragfhiges Geschftsmodell entwickeln. Das gilt in hohem Ma f\u00fcr die Challenger Banken mit Vollbanklizenz. Die regulatorischen Anforderungen sorgen hier f\u00fcr einen Kostenblock, der im Tagesgeschft erst einmal verdient werden muss. Fr\u00fcher oder spter werden, ja m\u00fcssen die Challenger Banken, der Logik des Bankgeschfts folgend, zu 'normalen' Banken werden (Eigenzitat). Die eigentliche Bedrohung geht von den Internetkonzernen aus. Die Banken sind mittlerweile von Google .... abhngig (Vgl. dazu:Big Tech und Banking: Darum wird daraus nichts).[7] Die Banken haben ihre digitale Souvernitt[8] verloren, die Fintech-Startups haben sie nie besessen.hnliche Beitrge [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/bilanz/article181072174/Die-Zahlenfrau-Deutschlands-Fintech-Szene-ist-aktiv-wie-nie.html\">https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/bilanz/article181072174/Die-Zahlenfrau-Deutschlands-Fintech-Szene-ist-aktiv-wie-nie.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/customer-fury-at-nikolay-storonskys-revolut-lock-out-rgr2kbs2c\">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/customer-fury-at-nikolay-storonskys-revolut-lock-out-rgr2kbs2c</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://finanz-szene.de/14-08-18-ertragsschock-fuer-solarisbank-euphorie-um-kwitt-was-kann-die-blockchain\">http://finanz-szene.de/14-08-18-ertragsschock-fuer-solarisbank-euphorie-um-kwitt-was-kann-die-blockchain</url>/ [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupe_BPCE\">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupe_BPCE</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bankstil.de/moven-wird-zu-einer-gewoehnlichen-bank-mit-anschluss-an-ein-grosses-digitales-oekosystem\">https://bankstil.de/moven-wird-zu-einer-gewoehnlichen-bank-mit-anschluss-an-ein-grosses-digitales-oekosystem</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bankstil.de/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-challenger-bank-pwc\">https://bankstil.de/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-challenger-bank-pwc</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.finews.ch/news/banken/32824-big-tech-banking-analyse-wettbewerb-daten-regulierung\">https://www.finews.ch/news/banken/32824-big-tech-banking-analyse-wettbewerb-daten-regulierung</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bankstil.de/das-ende-der-digitalen-souveranitat-der-banken\">https://bankstil.de/das-ende-der-digitalen-souveranitat-der-banken</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BNKS1318621534694949412251761700021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNKS-131862</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T2P-YKC1-JCMN-Y20D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"540\"/><timeReceived>4:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bankstil</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 19, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>German</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>DEUTSCH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She had come for a meeting with other government officials at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and she wanted to spread the word that it was high time for the West to join forces and beat China at writing the global rules for artificial intelligence.    Parker\u2019s plea came as a surprise to others. Less than two years earlier, Donald Trump\u2019s White House had rejected a similar pitch by France and Canada during a Group of Seven (G7) meeting, arguing that international rules for AI would be premature and hamper innovation.    But China\u2019s blatant ambitions to become the world leader in AI had since alarmed U.S. policymakers and tech executives. Not only was Beijing pouring billions into the research and development of AI, but reports also suggested that the Chinese government was using it to build up an all-seeing surveillance state. And it was becoming increasingly clear that, as the country\u2019s tech giants were exporting their technology around the globe, China was pushing for its ideas to become international standards.    This convinced the White House that, despite differences with its allies over what rules are needed, Western countries should band together to make sure their companies, rather than Beijing\u2019s, remained at the forefront of developing AI.    Europe and the U.S. agree on what they don\u2019t want \u2014 a future in which AI is used to build up an Orwellian surveillance apparatus \u2014 but they\u2019re far from able to agree what they do want.    \u201cWe\u2019ll never apologize for wanting to have the use of technology in a way that is consistent with our values,\u201d Parker told POLITICO over the phone from Paris. By joining ranks, she added, the West would be able to come up with \u201ca good counter to what China is doing.\u201d    What she didn\u2019t say at the time was that the White House was also ready to revisit the Franco-Canadian proposal from 2018.    Four months later, in June 2020, the U.S. signed on to a tweaked version of the pitch, announcing that all G7 members (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.) plus Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, India, Slovenia and the EU would launch an alliance dubbed the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) to support the \u201cresponsible and human-centric development and use\u201d of AI.    The idea was to do it \u201cin a manner consistent with human rights, fundamental freedoms and our shared democratic values,\u201d the countries added in a statement.    In other words: a different approach from China\u2019s.   \u2018Trustworthy\u2019 versus \u2018innovation\u2019?   As artificial intelligence changes societies around the world, this new GPAI alliance as well as the OECD have emerged as the key arenas for the U.S., Europe and other Western countries to join forces and come up with global standards for AI.    But first, Europe and the U.S. need to see eye to eye, and that isn\u2019t a given. They agree on what they don\u2019t want \u2014 a future in which AI is used to build up an Orwellian surveillance apparatus \u2014 but they\u2019re far from able to agree on what they do want.    The EU, home of stringent privacy laws, wants to become a leader in \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI and plans to release the world\u2019s first laws for AI early next year. This, Brussels hopes, will protect Europeans against abuse and boost consumer trust in European AI while giving its industry a competitive advantage in the long run.    The U.S., on the other hand, considers Brussels\u2019 approach \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and \u201cinnovation-killing,\u201d echoing the position of its own tech industry, whose representatives have warned that too many rules would  stifle innovation. In feedback to a first draft of Europe\u2019s upcoming laws for AI, submitted to the EU in May, for instance, industry giant Google warned Brussels that too many new rules would \u201csignificantly weaken Europe\u2019s position vis-a-vis global competitors.\u201d    The job of the new GPAI alliance, which will meet for the first time in December, will be to bring those two positions together.    A platform called RadVid-19 that identifies lung injuries through artificial intelligence is helping Brazilian doctors detect and diagnose coronavirus | Nelson Almeida/AFP via     Few details have been shared with the public about the partnership. But a series of conversations with officials and appointed members, conducted on the condition of anonymity because the work is confidential, suggests that it does not intend to work on any legal instruments.    But its role will likely go beyond bringing top-notch AI scientists and policymakers to the same table \u2014 and could influence the OECD\u2019s work on developing detailed AI principles, which in turn are meant to provide a framework for governments drafting hard laws.   Corporation rules   The work to form a Western alliance on AI comes as the technology is moving from the realm of science-fiction into everyday use. Today, AI is used to treat cancer , predict the outbreak of violent conflicts , analyze satellite data to monitor migration patterns , power military operations and even write news articles .    But it also comes with significant risks, beyond being abused by governments to spy on their citizens: Most of today\u2019s cutting-edge AI systems are, for example, prone to discriminate against vulnerable groups and minorities. This has led to text analysis software  labeling being Jewish or being gay as negative, British students from poor areas being disadvantaged during exams, or  a Black American being arrested for a crime he did not commit.    Against this backdrop, organizations ranging from the Catholic Church to Big Tech corporations have all released nonbinding ethical principles for how to develop and use AI.    While European leaders are eyeing laws as sweeping as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.S. has been pushing a light-touch approach to regulation within its own borders.    Yet these have not stopped companies and governments from rolling out invasive technology, including in privacy-conscious Europe, where law enforcement is now using facial-recognition technology with minimal public oversight.    What rules do exist have largely been developed by industry players \u2014 such as Google, Facebook and Apple in the U.S., or Tencent and Alibaba in China \u2014 for themselves.    \u201cThe rules for AI are, in effect, being written in code by the biggest tech companies who have the biggest AI research and the biggest pools of data and the biggest connection to a number of people who are the providers of data,\u201d said Mark Surman, the executive director of the Mozilla Foundation.    President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen at the AI Xperience Center of the VUB university in Brussels | Pool photo by Stephanie Lecocq via     While policymakers have long been told by the industry that AI systems were black boxes whose inner workings were virtually impossible to understand, that argument is now falling on deaf ears.    Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and professor of ethics and technology at Berlin-based Hertie School, said that governments \u201care starting to understand that [the tech industry] is not that different from the pharma industry, or finance.\u201d    \u201cWhen you start to understand that it\u2019s all software \u2026 and someone chooses which algorithms to use, which data to use, what threshold of performance to achieve, you realize that those are all things you can check and regulate,\u201d she added.   Enter the OECD   The hard part for governments will be to come up with the rules. While European leaders are eyeing laws as sweeping as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.S. has been pushing a light-touch approach to regulation within its own borders.    Even so, governments involved in GPAI acknowledge that to regulate the global AI industry, international rules are needed \u2014 rules that are often drafted in standard-setting bodies where China has been particularly active over the past decade.    Beijing has notably been pushing its ideas inside the Internet Engineering Task Force, an international organization developing core protocols for the internet; and technical standard-setting bodies like the United Nations\u2019 International Telecommunication Union, whose recommendations are often made policy by countries in the Global South.    The new alliance will be governed by a council, which will meet annually at the OECD in Paris.    \u201cThey really have made a big push over the last 10 years,\u201d said Michael R. Nelson, who directs the technology and international affairs program at think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThey\u2019ve also hired consultants to work with the companies to push their visions.\u201d    To counter these efforts, the West is seeking to build its own community, and seems to have found it at the OECD. In May 2019, the organization released its own broad guidelines for the use and deployment of AI, the first international agreement on AI endorsed by Trump\u2019s White House. In addition \u2014 and with the White House\u2019s blessing \u2014 the OECD in February launched an initiative to monitor and develop best practices in governing AI.    It wasn\u2019t until the spring of this year, when it became clear that the OECD would host the secretariat of the GPAI, that the U.S. decided to throw its weight behind the new alliance, according to officials involved in the negotiations.    Bionic limbs displayed at the Amazon Re:MARS conference on robotics and artificial intelligence | Mark Ralston/AFP via     \u201cThe U.S. decided to join because it was better to be inside the tent influencing its efforts than outside,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank whose board includes members of tech giants like Amazon or Google.    The new alliance will be governed by a council, which will meet annually at the OECD in Paris. Apart from that, most details are still yet to be decided.    What\u2019s already become clear, however, is that finding a joint position won\u2019t be easy.    When members of one of the partnership\u2019s four working groups met for a first confidential online meeting earlier this summer, it didn\u2019t take long until participants from Europe and the U.S. started clashing over issues such as which players in the industry deserved the greatest support from policymakers, according to one participant.

F\u00fcr Deutschland d\u00fcrften \u00e4hnliche Zahlen gelten. Dem Konzern geh\u00f6rt die weltweit gr\u00f6\u00dfte Video-Plattform (Youtube) und er erstellt die Software f\u00fcr acht von zehn Smartphones weltweit. Diese Allgegenwart hat zu Aufrufen gef\u00fchrt, die Macht von Google einzud\u00e4mmen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Laut einem k\u00fcrzlich im \"Wall Street Journal\" ver\u00f6ffentlichten Bericht bereitet das US-Justizministerium eine kartellrechtliche Untersuchung gegen Google vor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In den USA erhielt Google bisher nur geringe Geldstrafen</p><p>Es ist noch unklar, auf welchen Teil von Googles Gesch\u00e4ft die Untersuchung des Justizministeriums abzielen wird, geschweige denn, welche Art von Sanktionen in Frage k\u00e4men. Angesichts der massiven und vielf\u00e4ltigen Gesch\u00e4fte von Google - einschlie\u00dflich der Tatsache, dass Google selbst Teil der gr\u00f6\u00dferen Holding Alphabet ist - kann das regulatorische Vorgehen eine Reihe von Folgen haben. M\u00f6glich w\u00e4ren zum Beispiel eine verst\u00e4rkte Aufsicht, neue Beschr\u00e4nkungen f\u00fcr die Gesch\u00e4ftsausweitung und sogar eine Zerschlagung, wie sie derzeit auch bei Facebook diskutiert wird.</p><p>Die US-Ausgabe von Business Insider sprach mit mehreren Kartellexperten und Wall Street-Analysten, um sich ein Bild von den m\u00f6glichen Auswirkungen und den Risiken f\u00fcr Google zu machen. Das Folgende k\u00f6nnte Google passieren, wenn festgestellt wird, dass es gegen die Kartellvorschriften verst\u00f6\u00dft.</p><p>Seit seiner Gr\u00fcndung vor zwei Jahrzehnten hatte Google die gr\u00f6\u00dften Probleme mit den staatlichen Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden in Form von Geldstrafen. In den USA wurde gegen Google eine Reihe von bescheidenen Bu\u00dfgeldern f\u00fcr Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen Datenschutzbestimmungen verh\u00e4ngt. In Europa waren die Strafen hingegen strenger: Die Europ\u00e4ische Kommission hat Google im Laufe der Jahre zu Geldstrafen in H\u00f6he von insgesamt rund 10 Milliarden US-Dollar f\u00fcr verschiedene wettbewerbswidrige Praktiken verdonnert.</p><p>Experte \"glaubt nicht, dass ein Bu\u00dfgeld in Frage kommt\"</p><p>Es steht zur Debatte, ob diese Sanktionen bei einem Unternehmen wirksam sind, dessen Bilanzsumme \u00fcber 100 Milliarden US-Dollar liegt. Nach Ansicht vieler Experten, mit denen Business Insider gesprochen hat, steht dies jedoch diesmal kaum zur Diskussion.</p><p>\"Ich glaube nicht, dass ein Bu\u00dfgeld in Frage kommt\", sagte Robert Lande, Rechtsprofessor der Universit\u00e4t Baltimore, zu Business Insider. Das liegt daran, dass das US-Justizministerium, wie Lande erkl\u00e4rte, keine Geldstrafe gegen Google erheben kann, es sei denn, das Unternehmen hat gegen eine bereits bestehende Vereinbarung versto\u00dfen. Und bisher gibt es keine solche Vereinbarung zwischen Google und dem Justizministerium.</p><p>Ein weiterer Grund, warum sich Google keine Sorgen um hohe Bu\u00dfgelder in den USA machen muss, ist die Art und Weise, in der die US-Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden den durch wettbewerbswidriges Verhalten verursachten Schaden im Vergleich zu dem in Europa beurteilen.</p><p>Das Vorgehen der EU bietet dem US-Justizministerium eine gute Vorlage</p><p>\"Die EU konzentriert sich mehr auf die Sch\u00e4digung von Wettbewerbern, w\u00e4hrend sich die USA auf die Sch\u00e4digung von Verbrauchern konzentriert\", sagt Michael Carrier, Rechtsprofessor an der Rutgers University. In einer Welt mit kostenlosen Webdiensten f\u00fcr Verbraucher - von Google Mail bis Android - ist es schwierig, die Sch\u00e4digung von Verbrauchern zu begr\u00fcnden.</p><p>Doch das Vorgehen der EU jenseits des Atlantiks bietet eine gute Vorlage f\u00fcr die Teile von Googles Gesch\u00e4ft, die in das Hoheitsgebiet des US-Justizministeriums fallen. Insbesondere das Werbegesch\u00e4ft von Google, das Gesch\u00e4ft mit den Suchmaschinen und die Android-Software haben sich als erfolgreiche Untersuchungsziele der EU-Beh\u00f6rden erwiesen.</p><p>\"Ich w\u00fcrde damit anfangen, mich mit dem EU-Verfahren gegen Google zu befassen\", sagte Carrier. \"Hat Google bei der Suche seine eigenen Einkaufsdienste den Konkurrenten vorgezogen? Welche Auswirkung hatten Exklusivit\u00e4tsklauseln auf Anzeigen? Und was ist bei Android mit der B\u00fcndelung von Google-Software mit Android?\"</p><p>Fr\u00fchere kartellrechtliche Untersuchung wurde als \"leichter Klaps auf die Hand von Google\" verspottet</p><p>Obwohl diese Bereiche vergangener Verst\u00f6\u00dfe m\u00f6glicherweise ein Ausgangspunkt f\u00fcr das Justizministerium sind, sagte eine Quelle auf dem Capitol Hill, die k\u00fcrzlich mit Business Insider gesprochen hat, dass die Untersuchung wahrscheinlich offen dabei sein wird, \"alles\" \u00fcber Google zu untersuchen.</p><p>Die gro\u00dfe Frage ist, ob eine potenzielle Ma\u00dfnahme des US-Justizministeriums gegen Google mehr Biss haben w\u00fcrde als die kartellrechtliche Untersuchung der Federal Trade Commission 2013 \u00fcber die Gesch\u00e4ftspraktiken von Google in den Bereichen Suche und Smartphone.</p><p>Lest auch: Tesla, Amazon und Co.: Bei diesen 13 Unternehmen verdienen Praktikanten Tausende Dollar pro Monat</p><p>Google hat diese Begegnung ohne finanzielle Nachteile hinter sich gelassen und sich nur vagen Versprechungen verpflichtet, einige Gesch\u00e4ftspraktiken zu \u00e4ndern, was von vielen Kritikern als ein \"leichter Klaps auf die Hand von Google\" verspottet wurde.</p><p>Die Macht der \"Big Tech\"-Unternehmen wird Thema im Wahlkampf 2020</p><p>In Anbetracht des aktuellen politischen Klimas und der Rhetorik, mit der \"Big Tech\" zerschlagen werden soll, wird es diesmal vielleicht anders sein. Zum ersten Mal seit dem fr\u00fchen 20. Jahrhundert ist die Konzentration der Macht der Unternehmen ein wichtiges Thema bei den anstehenden Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen in den USA.</p><p>Bekannte Politiker - wie die Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidatin Elizabeth Warren - forderten eine Zerschlagung der wichtigsten Akteure der Technologiebranche, darunter Google, Apple, Facebook und Amazon. Im Fall von Google sagte Warren, um den Suchgiganten \"abzuwickeln\", w\u00fcrde sie damit beginnen, dass das Unternehmen gr\u00f6\u00dfere Zuk\u00e4ufe wie den Kartendienst Waze, das Smart-Home-Hardware-Unternehmen Nest und die Werbeplattform DoubleClick ver\u00e4u\u00dfern muss.</p><p>Das ist vielleicht leichter gesagt als getan. Mehrere Kartellexperten, die diese Woche mit Business Insider gesprochen haben, sagten, die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Zerschlagung sei gering.</p><p>Zerschlagung von Google ist kaum m\u00f6glich</p><p>\"Es ist sehr schwierig, fr\u00fchere Zuk\u00e4ufe r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig zu machen\", sagte Carrier von der Rutgers University. \"Die Unternehmen sind verschmolzen und die Bestandteile lassen sich nicht mehr voneinander trennen.\"</p><p>So wurde das Smart-Home-Unternehmen Nest, das 2014 von Google \u00fcbernommen wurde, nun vollst\u00e4ndig in den Hardwarebereich des Unternehmens aufgenommen. Im Mai k\u00fcndigte das Unternehmen auf der diesj\u00e4hrigen I / O-Entwicklerkonferenz an, dass das Branding f\u00fcr seine Smart-Home-Produkte jetzt \"Google Nest\" lauten wird, wie in \"Google Nest Learning Thermostat\" und \"Google Nest Secure Alarm\".</p><p>Lest auch: Diese 20 Unternehmen beherrschen das Internet in Deutschland</p><p>Blockaden zwischen dem ehemaligen Nest-Team und Googles eigener Hardware-Abteilung sind ebenfalls verschwunden, teilte Rishi Chandra, Vizepr\u00e4sident des Nest-Produktmanagements Business Insider k\u00fcrzlich in einem Interview mit: \"Es ist jetzt ein Team. Eine Roadmap f\u00fcr die gesamte Organisation.\"</p><p>Aufgrund der Schwierigkeiten, die mit einer echten Zerschlagung einhergingen, sagten Experten, dass ein plausibleres Ergebnis f\u00fcr die Untersuchung des Justizministeriums die Blockierung zuk\u00fcnftiger Gesch\u00e4fte f\u00fcr Google sei. Und f\u00fcr den Technologieriesen k\u00f6nnte dies ein potenzielles Risiko darstellen.</p><p>Das Verbot von Zuk\u00e4ufen k\u00f6nnte Googles Cloud-Dienst schmerzlich treffen</p><p>\"[Das Justizministerium] kann Zuk\u00e4ufe nat\u00fcrlich blockieren\", sagte Michael Pachter, Manager bei Wedbush Securities, zu Business Insider diese Woche. \" bezweifle, dass es viele Unternehmen gibt, die Google kaufen 'muss' ... [Aber] das Blockieren zuk\u00fcnftiger K\u00e4ufe ist immer ein Risiko f\u00fcr jedes gro\u00dfe Unternehmen.\"</p><p>Auf die Frage, wo es Google am meisten weh tue, wenn das US-Justizministerium sich f\u00fcr eine Strategie der Blockade statt einer Zerschlagung entscheidet, sieht Dan Ives, ebenfalls Manager bei Wedbush Securities, am ehesten das Cloud-Computing-Gesch\u00e4ft des Unternehmens betroffen. Die Google Cloud Platform (GCP) rangiert heute auf dem Markt abgeschlagen auf Platz drei hinter Amazon Web Services und Microsoft Azure.</p><p>\"Das Hauptproblem hierbei ist, ob dies den Fokus von Google auf Zuk\u00e4ufe im Zusammenhang mit der GCP einschr\u00e4nkt\", sagte Ives. \"Als [Thomas] Kurian zu Google kam, war dies der Trommelwirbel f\u00fcr viel wichtigere Transaktionen im Cloud-Bereich.\"</p><p>Untersuchung wirft ihre Schatten auf Google</p><p>Kurian wurde im Januar als Cloud-Chef von Google engagiert und l\u00f6ste Diane Greene ab. Nach 22 Jahren bei Oracle sollte Kurian das Cloud-Gesch\u00e4ft des Unternehmens im Wettbewerb mit Unternehmen wie Amazon und Microsoft unterst\u00fctzen. Analysten gehen davon aus, dass ein Teil der Aufholung auf dem Cloud-Markt durch Fusionen und \u00dcbernahmen erfolgen k\u00f6nnte.</p><p>Jetzt sagte Ives, dass das Potenzial der Untersuchung des Justizministeriums Google m\u00f6glicherweise vor einer aggressiveren Zukaufstrategie zur\u00fcckschreckt, selbst wenn eine solche Auflage gar nicht erhoben wird.</p><p>\"Es f\u00fchlt sich an, als w\u00fcrden die Fl\u00fcgel von den Schatten der kartellrechtlichen Ermittlungen beschnitten\", sagte Ives. \"Es w\u00fcrde mich wundern, wenn sie sich aggressiv um Fusionen und \u00dcbernahmen bem\u00fchen w\u00fcrden, jetzt wo sie im Rampenlicht stehen.\"</p><p>Dieser Text wurde aus dem Englischen \u00fcbersetzt und leicht gek\u00fcrzt.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, October 10th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S.-China trade focus today. Big story as investors await any details out of these high level talks that are getting under way this morning in Washington. The U.S. also could be easing some restrictions on Huawei. We've got that for you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was a lot of volatility in markets overnight after there was a report that the Chinese delegation would be leaving today and then saying no, we're leaving Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ahead of the talks, futures showing the markets are lower this morning. We're expecting a decline at the start of trading -- fractional move after a big gain yesterday on the hopes of at least partial trade deal.</p><p>Dow Industrials finished off 182 points at the close yesterday, three- quarters of 1 percent. The S&amp;P was up 26. And the Nasdaq up 80 points, better than 1 percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are mixed. FT 100 down 9. CAC 40 in Paris up 17. And the DAX index in Germany lower by 2 points. And the economic data driving stories there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher with the Korean KOSPI index bucking the trend, lower after a holiday the day before -- fractional moves across the board there.</p><p>China continues a full court press on the NBA. An exhibition game still scheduled to tip off in about half an hour. It's happening in shanghai this morning but it will not be seen on televisions in China.</p><p>Other related events were canceled and Chinese businesses continue to pull away from the league.</p><p>Also off the air there -- \"South Park\" but that doesn't stop the show from taking a swipe at China last night.</p><p>Plus, Apple removes a controversial app that tracks police activity in Hong Kong citing safety reasons. Companies are caving in to China's demands.</p><p>Facebook's other social media brands, meanwhile -- a new poll shows most people do not even realize they're using apps owned by Facebook. The numbers coming up.</p><p>All those stores coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business' Dagen McDowell. The \"Wall Street Journal's\" wealth management reporter. She's the host of the podcast, \"Secrets of Wealthy Women\" -- Veronica Dagher. And the assistant editorial page editor at the \"Wall Street Journal\" -- James Freeman.</p><p>Lots to talk about this morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes. I hope if President Trump doesn't get a deal soon with China. I hope he moves quickly to make trade peace with all of our friends around the world.</p><p>The Japan deal is a good template. I would say if you're going to play this out with China, you need a reason to give people to invest and other trade deals would be very helpful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want something like TPP.</p><p>FREEMAN: That that would be nice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: I know you don't -- you can't call it that. So, you know, new plan but you did it with japan, how about every other country, offer them the same deal and try to get that done and then, you know, you've got leverage to play it out with China. We'll see where it goes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's Brexit. You have to believe that once Brexit does happen, if it happens, he'll move aggressively to do a deal with the U.K.</p><p>FREEMAN: That would help too. And of course, the Congress can help by passing the USMCA with Canada and Mexico. Maybe they will --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's up to Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. But she might -- there might be an incentive to show they're not just the impeachment Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That they actually care about the American people? Really? Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see. We'll see.</p><p>Right now it's all about taking down the President.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": And what kind of trade deal are we going to get? I'm just curious though, right? Is it going to be a skinny deal that some people are speaking about? Because if we get that skinny deal, I just wonder, to your point from before, how much is that really going to move the market in the long term?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I don't know that that's going to be all that positive. Maybe we get a rally on news of a skinny deal. We'll see.</p><p>But that push for impeachment is certainly top of news. Supporting the impeachment of President Trump reaching a record high, apparently. According to a new Fox News poll, the majority of voters say that they want President Trump impeached and removed from office. That's up 9 points from July.</p><p>Former vice president Joe Biden officially backing calls for the push. The 2020 hopeful trading barbs with President Trump yesterday. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts. To preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think he's going to make it. I didn't think he was going to make it for a long time. I don't think he's going to make it.</p><p>And I guess this is one way he could do it. He didn't say that until right now and he sees what's happening to him. I guess he's no longer the frontrunner.</p><p>And he's been caught red-handed. I mean here's a man who is on tape saying exactly what he's going to do in terms of corruption and he gets away with it. If that ever happened to a Republican, they'd be getting the electric chair right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Fox News contributor, former House Speaker and \"Trump versus China\" author, Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker -- it's always a pleasure. Thanks for joining us -- Newt.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you make of these polls that say 51 percent of people would like to see the impeachment? Are you buying this?</p><p>GINGRICH: Look, I think if you have week after week of the \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\" and all the major networks giving their version of reality, it has an effect. Does it mean that Trump's going to lose the election? No. Does it mean he's going to be impeached? No.</p><p>But a lot of this is just the sheer weight of unbelievably biased coverage and the fact that the Democrats have been playing a game. The fact is, for example, you have a guy who is a leaker who we call a whistleblower because that sounds so much nicer, he didn't blow a whistle on anything. He didn't witness anything.</p><p>It's now turning out he's a Democrat. He may well have actually worked with some of the Democratic presidential candidates. But all of this takes a while.</p><p>And we've seen this three or four times now. We saw it with Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH: We saw it earlier with the Russian collusion. You know, the news media comes in, creates a totally biased story. For a brief period the country goes well, if that's true, then of course you're right. And then they begin to go yes, but it's not true. And then gradually we get back to where we were.</p><p>So my guess is in a week or two Trump will be back at about where he's been all along which is 45 percent support and considering that he probably is at 5 to 8 percent above that, just because people in this kind of environment, people won't tell you they're for Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH: Because the social pressure's so great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So are you -- do you agree with the White House's move to say I'm not going to cooperate with the impeachment measures because it's an impeachment show. They need to take the floor --</p><p>GINGRICH: You know look, this --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- let me just show you this editorial piece in the \"Journal\" this morning. You've seen it this morning, \"Back to you, Nancy\". The editorial board of the \"Wall Street Journal\" writes this. \"No one should be surprised if the White House chooses to fight back and hard when Democrats are trying to remove Mr. Trump from office and brand him as impeached for 2020. The Pelosi Democrats are fighting ugly and Mr. Trump is fighting ugly back.\"</p><p>This is what I find really interesting because the Democrats always fight ugly. They're not afraid to get in the mud. That's just been who -- that's who they are, that's been the case for years.</p><p>They haven't met a guy like Mr. Trump who says you know what, yes, let's get in the mud, I'm ready for it and fights back the way he does. They don't like it.</p><p>GINGRICH: That's right. That's how he won the presidency. If he hadn't been prepared to match Hillary and to stay slugging it out, he wouldn't have become president. So it shouldn't surprise us any.</p><p>This is not an impeachment. I mean I'm going to make this very clear. This is a coup. The first left wing gathering of the crisis level was on the ninth on November, 2016 -- the day after the election. They had gatherings in eight or nine cities.</p><p>By the middle of December of that year, \"Vanity Fair\" had an article on the movement to impeach Trump. By the day of the inaugural, the \"Washington Post\" -- literally, the day of the inaugural, the \"Washington Post\" had a story that the move to impeach Trump was underway and the following day of course you had a huge series of rallies against Trump all over the country, the day after he's sworn in.</p><p>So this shouldn't surprise anybody. The left hates Trump, that includes the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post\". They're going to do everything they can to destroy him. They can't -- they're afraid he'll win the next election so they're trying to find somebody.</p><p>But in the end, it's pretty stupid. I mean, you know, Nancy Pelosi can't even play tic tac toe. She can't figure out that there's a second step.</p><p>For example, this guy who they're keeping secret, well, if they do pass impeachment, it goes to the Senate. And Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has already said the minute it gets to the Senate, he's having this guy in under oath and public.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GINGRICH: So they haven't thought through that. Act two is the Republicans in the Senate. They're going to ask Hunter Biden what did you do for $600,000 a year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Newt -- it's Dagen McDowell. It looks like that the Democrats are trying to trip up the President or set up the President, if you will. And trick him into doing something they could then say oh, obstruction of Congress -- you've actually heard them say that. We're going to now impeach him for obstruction of Congress when he wasn't actually doing anything to obstruct an impeachment proceeding that actually isn't an impeachment proceeding because they haven't voted on it yet.</p><p>Again, if you read the -- if you read every word in some of these newspaper articles, not the \"Wall Street Journal\", and they will say, well, one of the articles of impeachment under Richard Nixon was failure to provide information to Congress related to the inquiry. So you see where they're going here.</p><p>GINGRICH: Sure. But let's start with -- you know, a reporter said the other day that Speaker Pelosi -- what if this doesn't work out and this guy doesn't stand up. And her answer was oh, we have many candidates for impeachment. This is just the easiest one to explain.</p><p>I mean this is all a game. And that's why it's not an impeachment. It's a coup. It has nothing to do with the constitutional concept of impeachment which is for high crimes and -- it has nothing to do with that.</p><p>This has to do with left wing Democrats who can't stand the idea that the American people gave the White House to somebody who clearly violates all of their norms and actually behaves as though he's a conservative and he's the most aggressive anti-liberal in my lifetime and it drives them crazy. So I don't think they can control themselves.</p><p>Part two of this is not Trump leaving Washington. Part two is if they have the nerve -- I said openly, you can always impeach if you have a majority if you're prepared to commit suicide.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GINGRICH: Nancy Pelosi forces all of her moderate and red district Democrats to vote yes on impeachment. Collin Peterson's a good example, he's in a Minnesota district that was 30 points for Trump.</p><p>Now how is he going to vote yes in impeachment and run for reelection. And so if she's prepared to become the minority leader again, they can get the patient to the House then it goes to the Senate where I think they get ripped to shreds.</p><p>And I think you get Biden brought in and they say were you not aware that your son was making $600,000 a year. I mean, does anybody in America believe that my two daughters could be making $600,000 a year and I wouldn't know it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: $600,000 a year.</p><p>GINGRICH: And that's the Biden current claim.</p><p>BARTIROMO: From Ukraine? Wow.</p><p>GINGRICH: from one company. Just from Ukraine. That doesn't count whatever else he was making.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I didn't realize it was $600,000.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ok. Newt -- thank you.</p><p>GINGRICH: I cheated. It's $50,000 a month times 12 so $600,000 a year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which is roughly double what an ExxonMobil board member makes.</p><p>ExxonMobil board member in the most recent fiscal year made about [$300,000] on average, $330,000, so Hunter Biden whose work experience was being on the board of Amtrak was making 600 grand a year.</p><p>FREEMAN: Are you saying that Burisma is no ExxonMobil?</p><p>GINGRICH: Wait a second. It's totally legitimate for Biden to be on the Amtrak board because Joe went back and forth to Wilmington on Amtrak all the time. They had a lot of knowledge about Amtrak.</p><p>I would like to know, other than maybe reading Wikipedia, what did Hunter know about anything involving Ukrainian national gas company?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.</p><p>Well, similar story in China where, you know, the money was big there. The $1 billion which turned into $1.5 billion after his trip with his father on Air Force 2. Newt, thank you. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>GINGRICH: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Newt Gingrich there.</p><p>While we were talking Delta Airlines reported earnings.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the numbers now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. The stock not liking what came out in terms of earnings. As you can see, it's down 0.8 percent. This is the second best airline carrier of the year.</p><p>Ok. So earnings per share were better than expected, $2.32 a share versus the estimate of $2.26. But a miss by a little bit when it came to revenue. Coming in at $12.56 billion.</p><p>Investors are concerned about what is going forward for Delta. Their guidance was very light for the all-important holiday quarter. That's the fourth quarter. They guided in a range of $1.20, to $1.50 when the (INAUDIBLE) estimate is $1.51. so much lower there.</p><p>And then you have to remember. They don't fly -- and this a good thing for them -- the 737 Max jet that's been under fire but when that returns, they might be affected by pricing from other airlines. So those are some head winds affecting the company, especially an economic slowdown on an international level that could affect them going forward.</p><p>Back to you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Lauren. Stock is down better than 1 percent. We've got a big show this morning. Don't miss it. The \"Gartman Letter\" editor and publisher Dennis Gartman is coming up.</p><p>To talk markets and China. The CEO of Waze, Noam Bardin is here. The company marking one year since its carpool service debut and Google partnership. And then the former senior advisor to President George W. Bush, Fox News contributor Karl Rove joining us to talk impeachment and his \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed ed today. House Financial services committee member. Congressman Lance Gooden is here and the CEO of Sanders -- Francis David Savin talks short-term rentals and hotel industry, similar to Air BNB but not really. We'll tell you about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, two British ISIS prisoners now in custody in the U.S. Cheryl Casone with the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well Maria -- the two ISIS fighters tied to the notorious British terror cell, the Beatles, they are the only two ISIS fighters removed from removed from Syria by the U.S. so far but officials say, there could be more thousands of others remain in custody under Kurdish control as of now.</p><p>Well, when it comes to social media business in particular -- American Cinderella come up short and their knowledge. According a new Pew Center of Survey. Just 29 percent of us know that Instagram and What's App are owned by Facebook.</p><p>Over all less than half of those asked knew the answers to a digital knowledge quiz but there's Facebook in the pre-market, down slightly.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>And then I love this story -- Maria. Uber is now letting your pets come along for the ride. They're now letting passengers bring along their furry friends to reduce cancellations. Surprised pets, believe it or not, are one of drivers' biggest complaints. The new program is going to be available in select cities. That starts on October 16th.</p><p>Because don't discriminate against my dog or my cat. Come on now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: It's ridiculous.</p><p>Yes. Drivers were flipping out about it. Well, too bad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let me point out, if you've got a fluffy little nugget like a Charlie or a Dusty that can sit in your lap, that's a big difference than a Slob-o-pus who gets in your car and starts shedding everywhere.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like a bloodhound.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the same thing as traveling with your dog on an airplane, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Airplanes have become a nightmare though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean you can't have that kind of a big dog on a plane.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying. If you have a small dog, it's ok, it doesn't cause too much disruption, what's the problem?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But now if you have the dog, if you put it in a crate and pay $125, $150 per trip for a dog, put it under the seat like luggage. But if you have the dog out, you have to -- they've really cracked down on emotional support certificates for people. And so even if you take your dog out of the crate, they lose their business.</p><p>And people -- it's not just an Uber driver. It's all the other people on the plane where some individuals like to make up that they have dog allergies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think they're making -- I agree with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ma'am, if you have a dog allergy, you need to tell the airline in advance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I told the airline in advance that Charlie would be here -- period.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. I have my -- yes. I drive now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Then you've got Charlie right there in the car.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Apple is under pressure this morning. The technology giant removes a controversial app that tracks police activity in Hong Kong. The reason they removed it -- are they caving like others? We'll take a look.</p><p>Then testing optional, a growing number of colleges remove standardized test requirements.</p><p>Back in a minute with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>American companies eager to reach China's 1.4 billion people are now facing censorship hurdles.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton is covering the story this morning. And it is getting wider and wider and wider.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: It sure is. And Apple is the latest one. They removed the HKMap.live app from its app store. And the \"People's Daily\" had actually criticized Apple saying that they had not -- I'm quoting here, \"The People's Daily, obviously state-run media -- Apple had not hidden their malicious motive in providing navigation for the riders.</p><p>Apple -- and this is coming from Apple, this is their statement. The App has been used in ways that endangers law enforcement and residents. So they're basically saying both sides are finding out where these protesters are showing up and it's just augmenting a very tense situation.</p><p>But Apple was clear to us in its statement, in its response saying, \"We pulled this app because of safety concerns, not political concerns,\" because of course the larger conversation we've been having with these U.S. big brands, I mean whether it's the NBA or Activision Blizzard or Vans sneakers or Tiffany's is that U.S. companies are caving.</p><p>The one thing I will say about big tech functioning on mainland China -- is that it's really two companies that we would know the name of. It's basically Apple and Microsoft. Both of those companies over the years have at least agreed to play -- if they're not playing ball with the Chinese state, they're at least playing a few innings.</p><p>Google is not there. Google started to do some work called Dragon Fly. It was going to be a search engine over there but its own employees really just raised such a fuss that the company ended up killing it.</p><p>Facebook we know really tried to be there. I mean Mark Zuckerberg was teaching himself Mandarin. He was going over. He was courting officials. It just didn't work out.</p><p>And then eventually this spring Mark Zuckerberg said something like, kind of like it was a bit of sour grapes. Let's hear it from the cynical perspective, well, we didn't really want to be there anyway.</p><p>But both Apple and Microsoft have found a way, love it or hate it, to actually work within the system. I just want to quote one of the people from Apple. It's policy chief saying that censoring for the Chinese government, so Apple is there, they know that censorship happens, but she says encourages greater overall freedoms and that it facilitates the free flow of ideas and information.</p><p>Now, there are a lot of people who call absolute nonsense on that quote and they say look, Apple just has so much of a presence there and a footprint there, that it is in their best interest to get along.</p><p>But more recently Apple has removed pro democracy songs by Hong Kong singers from the Chinese music store. It did remove Taiwan's flag from the emoji library. And as we know, I mean Taiwan and China have been governed for decades separately but the idea of the Communist manifesto is for reunification and then with this latest salvo is this hot maps in Hong Kong.</p><p>Microsoft we know, bought LinkedIn and they have LinkedIn up and running there. And they say well, we can't really pull out of China with LinkedIn because then that deprives the Chinese people of looking for their hopes and dreams.</p><p>As they said, maybe not willing to play ball, Apple and Microsoft, but they're certainly willing to play a few innings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What was the statement again? We need to impose censorship in order to promote free speech?</p><p>BOLTON: That's from Apple. Yes, that's Apple.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can you believe what it sounds like? It's like censorship somehow --</p><p>BOLTON: You remember this when Apple agreed to let some data centers be on the mainland and people went absolutely bananas about that. And that's the response as you said. I know. It sounds.</p><p>When you read it, you're just like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know I would like to see it. I'd like to hear from right now, the Business Roundtable, right.</p><p>The Business Roundtable said that they want to put profits second or third after the other stakeholders, employees and the communities they operate in. What does the Business Roundtable have to say about China's behavior?</p><p>DAGHER: Well, just as you allude to the statistics, 1.4 million inhabitants in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 1.4 billion.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>DAGHER: Yes, exactly -- billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's them kowtowing to a different communist.</p><p>FREEMAN: The community should be worried about those -- the stakeholders. I also -- I wonder about these Silicon Valley people, who tell us how much they care about civil liberties, the Activision employees were -- some of them were demonstrating --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. Because they stripped that young man of his gaming title and actually his prize money because he did make a statement on a streaming service in support of the Hong Kong pro democracy protesters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Well, Google did not want to be evil so they walked away from the Pentagon. But they set up shop for their A.I.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BOLTON: So actually to me, that's actually the bigger problem I think going forward is that we depend, happily or unhappily, on companies like Google to develop our next generation of A.I. And so if we're not letting that happen, or Google's employees are blocking that, then you can make an argument we're at a disadvantage versus the Chinese when it comes to this kind of technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Companies are waking up to this and you have to thank not just President Trump but Secretary Pompeo. He's done a great job in speaking to businesses about the national security issues around that.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Deirdre -- thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Sure. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.</p><p>Coming up markets are watching all of these developments. U.S. and Chinese officials meeting later this morning, the expectations coming up.</p><p>Markets have worsened in the last hour, down 58 points on the Dow Industrials now.</p><p>Then this crypto warning, an Apple co-founder speaks out about regulating digital currency, his comments right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our top story this half an hour, the U.S.-China trade situation, the two sides are holding high level negotiations this morning in Washington ahead of increased U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into this country, that is set to go into effect October 15th. There was a lot of volatility in the markets overnight after a report said that the Chinese delegation would be leaving today. The White House said that it has no knowledge of any news that it would be leaving early.</p><p>Joining us right now is The Gartman Letter editor and publisher, Dennis Gartman. And Dennis, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks for being here.</p><p>DENNIS GARTMAN, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, THE GARTMAN LETTER: Thanks for having me. You guys scraped the bottom of the barrel and there I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- what? Not true, Dennis. But tell me this, how are you investing and what do you see about this China story that is actually dictating how you allocate capital and look at these markets.</p><p>GARTMAN: Well, first of all, I have only my own money at risk, it's my few million source, very -- it's sacrosanct and what I talked about in my newsletter I do. And for the first time in quite some long while I'm actually getting modestly and I mean, the operative word here is modestly net short.</p><p>I'm a little concerned about how quickly things sold off last night on the mere rumor and a rumor of a rumor that the Sherpas had not been able to reach and sort of an agreement and that there would be a delay or even an early leaving by the senior Chinese delegation.</p><p>So the fact that you were able to give up almost 400 Dow points in the course of a half an hour, tells me that underneath here there's nothing but thin air. So you have to be very careful. I think that the -- I keep in my own index called the international index of the 10 largest stock markets in the world and it made its high last January, January 29th actually of 19 -- 2018, we have not come anywhere close to being -- to making new highs. And so we've actually been in an international bear market for almost a year and-a-half. Let's be careful.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK, so given that the downer for the markets, the trade fights have been and now the president facing possible impeachment, do you think he now gets a deal? Is there -- is it a necessity for him and how do the markets react?</p><p>GARTMAN: I think it's an -- James, I think it's a necessity for both presidents, for Xi and for Trump to get some sort of a deal. It's going to be what's the term now, a skinny deal, it won't be a broad and expansive deal, we won't probably be able to get intellectual property rights taken care of. We'll probably not be able to get infrastructure. We'll probably not be able to get a broader representation. We'll get some soybeans sold. We might even get some corn sold. But will there be anything broad and expansive? Sadly, probably not. Will the Chinese give us promises that they won't keep? Probably so. And sadly, that's just the history of these sorts of agreements.</p><p>So it will be less than anybody hoped for (INAUDIBLE). And we'll probably have to wait until after the next election to get an expansive trade agreement signed between both countries.</p><p>DAGHER: Dennis, what percentage of your portfolio now is in cash and have you increased that and also, what's your read on precious metals like gold?</p><p>GARTMAN: Well, first of all, I'm quite bullish of the precious metals -- I've been bullish of gold for quite some period of time. I'd really like to see gold get above 15 20, that will be a breakout to the upside and I'll add to my gold position. Gold is probably 30 or 40 percent of what I own which is probably a little too much for the average American to have. But I'm quick to take losses, I'm quick to get out if something should turns against me.</p><p>As far as cash is concerned, the rest of my stuff is in bonds, corporate debt and I hedge it with derivatives. So actually if you want to say cash, I'm probably a hundred percent cash because I'm not -- I'm equally net long and net short, my net exposure to the stock market is relatively minimal at best.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we're heading into the third quarter earnings reporting season, are there anything in the charts that you see that indicate performance ahead? I know you look at technical in terms of charts.</p><p>GARTMAN: Yes, I look at technical rather substantively. And it bothers me that if you look at the Dow, if you look at the S&amp;P, if you look at the Russell two -- 5000 or whatever. Well, almost whatever index you look at, you're getting what the technicians call a head and shoulders top which is formed over the course of the past several months.</p><p>But more importantly as I said earlier, the fact that my international index has refused to make a new high since January of 2018 tells me that the internals are starting to turn down.</p><p>And I watch the CNN, and I hate to put in a plug for another network but the CNN Fear and Greed Index is a really good index for the average American to take a look at. And it has been making consistently lower highs and lower lows and it's turning quite bearish.</p><p>So I just think that one should be -- should be careful. Pros can be quietly modestly just a tad net short. The average investor should be -- it's still a bull market for him. He should be less long than he's been however.</p><p>But for the pros, being short is not such a bad idea right here and I'm short marginally. And the operative word here is marginally. Remember, this is my own money at risk.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Dennis, it's Dagen McDowell. Have you done any work on market reactions to impeachment proceedings?</p><p>GARTMAN: Well, having lived through two impeachment proceed -- well, actually --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why I asked you, my friend.</p><p>GARTMAN: It's not pretty. The -- what happened during the Nixon impeachment which never really got to impeachment itself was terrible. The Dow fell from a thousand six to 474 over the course of that what, 18 months of the entire impeachment proceedings.</p><p>During the -- during the Clinton proceed -- impeachment, the market actually didn't do very badly at all but I continue to remember how long it dragged out in the Nixon affair. And this seems more like the Nixon affair than it does the Clinton affair.</p><p>So quite honestly, there's nothing good that comes out of it. The best that you can say is that things won't get bad. The worst that you can say is things can get terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Any thoughts on the Fed cutting rates in a week and-a-half or two weeks and what about the earnings period? What are you expecting?</p><p>GARTMAN: If I were the -- if I were a voter on the Fed, I would probably vote not to cut rates. I think however, that there's probably going to be a slight majority for cutting rates. Certainly we'll probably get a 25 basis point cut before the end of the year. The question shall be, will we get 25 in the next week and 25 in December --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We got the minutes yesterday -- we got the minutes from the September meeting yesterday when the central bank approved the quarter point reduction. And those minutes showed that investors are expecting the rate cut. But there's real division within the Fed.</p><p>GARTMAN: And I don't mind that. I don't mind having the Fed arguing one with the other. That doesn't -- that doesn't bother me even much at all. But the fact was, there's a great deal of dissension. The beige book was relatively inconsequential. The minutes were terribly inconsequential.</p><p>And I'm not -- I don't find it detrimental to find divisions within the FOMC. In fact, I rather like it. It shows they have -- we have individuals looking at their own data and making a decision and I think that the Fed chairman will do a fine job of keeping -- making -- finding some sort of consensus.</p><p>Do I think that they'll end up cutting rates? Yes, I do. 25 basis points. But as I said, if I were the -- if I were on the FOMC, I'd be a dissenter and vote no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Dennis, great to talk with you. Thank you so much.</p><p>GARTMAN: Thanks, Maria. Good to be on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And to you, Dennis Gartman joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, standardize test, sigh of relief. More colleges ditching the traditional requirement.</p><p>Plus, navigating the competition, the CEO of Waze weighing in on how his company is racing to catch Uber and Lyft. That's coming up. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Major changes to college acceptances following the massive college admissions scandal. Cheryl Casone with headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Probably this was coming, Maria. A growing number of colleges are no longer looking for SAT and ACT test scores. One in four schools have now dropped the admission requirement in the wake of the Varsity Blues scandal. And this is happening as the ACT has announced students who have already taken the entire exam can retake specific sections, instead of taking it all over again.</p><p>Facebook's CEO soon going to be back on the hot seat in Washington. Mark Zuckerberg is going to be returning to Capitol Hill October 23rd to testify before a House panel about the Libra cryptocurrency project.</p><p>Now, the proposal has been sharply criticized by lawmakers in the U.S. and actually around the world after a string of privacy lapses at Facebook.</p><p>Steve Wozniak speaking out about government regulation of cryptocurrencies by the way. According to the Bloomberg, the Apple co-founder says countries will only want control as digital currencies grow in popularity.</p><p>And then Maria, you're going to love this one. Sully, former President George H. W. Bush's service dog has received the Public Service Award from the ASPCA. It is given to an animal or officer who demonstrates a commitment to their career. Sully was at the former president's side from 2018 until his death and actually beyond, as you can see by the casket there.</p><p>Sully now serves injured veterans and their families, Maria. We've talked about this before. He's working and I think very hard at Walter Reed Medical Center.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a beautiful story.</p><p>CASONE: I love Sully.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Beautiful. Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I have a service dog story really quickly. Jennifer Williams who was Dana Perino's producer here, she trained a service dog, Spike, in the building. And now he's in like doggy college. But she works with Canine Companions, CCI Canine and one of the new puppies is named after Tyrus. They named a puppy after Tyrus. I think that was Dana's doing.</p><p>But again, if you follow CCI Canines, any of the service dog organizations that raise these animals for veterans and other people in need, it's really -- they're really uplifting stories. Better than Ellen and G -- and G. W. Bush having a little love fest. Dogs are much better than humans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that.</p><p>FREEMAN: Also, he got into doggy college on the merits, there was no corruption.</p><p>DAGHER: That's right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Blaming that -- blaming the SAT and the ACT is absolutely the worst response here. I understand why colleges don't want to face the corruption inside their institutions, they want to point the just but this is the benchmark and if you need to work on security to make sure someone actually took the test, that's fine. But this is how you get away from all of this insider connections stuff is you have a benchmark everyone has to meet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wake Forest where I went and where one of your children goes, Wake Forest though waived the requirement a while ago. There are a lot of universities that don't require you to take the test.</p><p>FREEMAN: They should bring it back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break and then competing with Uber and Lyft, I'll be speaking with the Waze CEO next. The company is facing some stiff competition but it's doing well. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Waze, the popular app that helps users report and avoid traffic in real-time has for the past year been creating car pools across the country and across the world.</p><p>My next guest knows all about that and dealing with the competition. Joining me right now is the CEO of Waze, Noam Bardin. Noam, it's great to have you on the program this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>NOAM BARDIN, CEO, WAZE: Thank you for having me. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you, I love the app. I know that people love it who drive and use it. So it's certainly been real successful even though you've got competition left and right. Tell us about the evolution and growth of Waze and how many users you have today?</p><p>BARDIN: So Waze is always an about improving your daily commute and traffic. And traffic really is the ill of modern life. I mean, it's terrible for your health, it's terrible for the economy, it's terrible globally, 30 percent of the emissions come from traffic.</p><p>And that was our mission from day one. And we started by optimizing existing infrastructure, right. Those short cuts that we used to find you with Waze and still are kind of known for are also a way of using more roads that up and now have not been used, right.</p><p>So we've finished optimizing the roads and now the second phase of our business, we're moving into carpooling. We're looking into your car. You've got four empty seats in your car. 75 percent of Americans commute alone. And so by allowing some of our drivers to leave their car at home once or twice a week and finding another driver who lives close to them, works close to them and allows them to take that ride, we can actually take cars off the road.</p><p>And this is crucial because, yes, we all feel that traffic's getting worse. It is. Like we see it statistically. It's getting worse, what you're feeling is right. And no one's coming to save us. I mean, the government's not going to save us. Technology's not going to save us. We need to do something about this because we are traffic and we really are the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So are you up to 120 million users across the world? Tell us about the growth that you've seen, first off, since being acquired by Google. Just in that short period of time.</p><p>BARDIN: So it's interesting. When we started talking to Google about the acquisition, we were doing 10 million active Wazers a month. Today we're about 130, we'll probably end the year around 140 million active Wazers globally. And so, we've seen huge growth since we joined Google and in general. And this is really kind of that special love that we have. People when they talk about Waze, they get a little smile on it because we really help them in one of their worst part of their day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because when you say active users, those people who are using the app but also contributing to it. You see a police car, you're putting that in. You see an accident, you're putting that in. The users are part of the experience.</p><p>But tell me how you separate from Google Maps because I know that Google recently updated Google Maps with live -- with the live camera. A lot of people say Waze and Google Maps are a buried treasure for Alphabet. But how do you differentiate from Google Maps? Is it -- is it -- is that a partner or a competitor?</p><p>BARDIN: So, Google Maps is about all your transportation needs, right. They have walking and they have public transit and riding and things like that. At the Waze, we only do driving. So we go really really deep on the driving experience.</p><p>So every day when you go to work, you should be using Waze. When you're in France and don't know how to get somewhere, you should use Google Maps. And so, that focus for us really allows us to go deep. We know HOV lanes and the time it takes in HOV lanes. We know the tolls and how much it costs to go to the tolls. Like we can give all that granular data that you really need every day when you're commuting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you -- how do you protect people's privacy? Obviously with the Google Maps the camera is live. Your privacy, you know, you've got all of this information in there that is now accessible. How are you protecting people's privacy while doing all of this?</p><p>BARDIN: So there's a big difference between a Google product and Waze. The Google actually owns and operating system which is Android. And so there are all kinds of constraints that come with that. We play by the rules of the app stores, the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store. And so we act like every other app that are constrained by the same rules as every other app.</p><p>So if you don't want to share anything with us, turn us off, there's no problem. But when you use Waze, the deal is quid pro quo. When you drive with us, you give us the data where you are based on how fast you're going, we can warn other drivers whether or not to drive there. You report traffic. We tell it to the drivers behind you. So it's really a community effort.</p><p>And the actual map is built by volunteers. We've got local volunteers more or less any city in the world who will update the map when a new road is opened, a new intersection. And this really gives them that hyper local feeling of how did Waze know that this intersection just show -- just opened up. Well, someone that lives there just actually made that change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but what about this data sharing program? I mean, here too the worries over privacy come up. Tell us about the new data sharing program.</p><p>BARDIN: So Waze for cities is a program we've had for a while now. We have about 1,200 cities, partnered with transportation, municipalities connected to our platform. And we do is we share anonymous data that helps them plan their roads better.</p><p>Again, our mission is really to fight traffic and cities are very important to end this. And so, we share data back and forth, they can a close segments on our side, if there's like a big parade or a marathon, we can tell them where there are accidents.</p><p>And we have a lot of work around natural disasters, hurricanes, we will help show where to go. We'll close roads that are flooded. And it's really worked between volunteers, your elected officials and the Waze employees working together on this one platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how do you see transportation in the future? I mean, you've got A.I. obviously out there and that is bringing up the subject of driverless cars. Tell me how you see the transportation industry in general changing, let's call it in the next 20 to 50 years.</p><p>BARDIN: Well, I think there's three main trends going on. One really is electrification as cars move from fuel to electricity. The second really is transportation as a service, not owning a car but leasing a car when you need it or a car with a driver. And so -- and the third change is really the ability to have autonomy in the car that is driving by itself.</p><p>So these changes are usually plumped together but they're very, very separate. We're focused very much on transportation as a service. What we feel is that since we have multiple people driving alone the same place, if we could get them to share their car, right, we can actually make a change. (INAUDIBLE) they don't need to own two cars in your family, if we could bring it down to one car family, we've done our bid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Noam, how are you going to -- how are you going to monetize this?

According to Flaherty:</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGooglewill pay very well and the benefits will be wonderful, but any conservative who takes this job will have to sell his or her soul. Anyone with an ounce of personal integrity should not even consider it.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGoogleis not trying to hire a free-market advocate because it suddenly believes in free markets. It is a monopoly and it intends to stay that way. Googlewants to buy off and defuse critics who have been emboldened by the election of <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person>\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cThere is no, new conservative-friendly Google. The company\u2019s plan to hire a conservative liaison and more Republican lobbyists is a continuation of Washington business as usual that Trump ran against.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGoogle\u2019s influence permeated the Obama administration, particularly in its \u2018capture\u2019 of its regulators. As we sought to publicize at the time, the Federal Trade Commission, and its Chair Edith Ramirez, appeared to take its direction from Googlein squelching an anti-trust investigation that was recommended by its staff.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cAny conservative or libertarian who takes a job with Googlewill be automatically suspect. I call on all the leaders of all right-of-center groups to rebuff Googleuntil there is serious change in the orientation of the company, starting with ending the censorship of conservatives in search results.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGoogleand a handful of Bay Area companies now control the flow of online news, as more and more Americans get their news online instead of through newspapers or television. As a result, Silicon Valley is exerting ever-increasing control over politics and the government, notwithstanding Trump\u2019s election.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cBig Tech\u2019s newfound political power, coupled with the hoard of personal information that these same companies compile on every American, is particularly dangerous for conservatives. No one in the conservative movement should contribute to this problem by fronting for Google.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> Last week, we sent <person><nameText>President-elect Trump </nameText></person>a letter warning him about the influence of Silicon Valley in advance of his meeting today with tech executives.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Except for PayPal founder Peter Theil, Silicon Valley billionaires opposed Trump\u2019s election. Most prominent was Google\u2019s <person><nameText>Eric Schmidt, </nameText></person>who was photographed election night with a \u201cStaff\u201d badge at Hillary\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d party.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Our letter was prompted by a November 30 letter sent by tech giants to Trump urging him to adopt their policy preferences and to appoint their allies to important government posts. We ask Trump to \u201ctake their self-serving recommendations with a grain of salt.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> We provide a number of very specific warnings to Trump about the involvement of these companies with the federal government, including an account of the disastrous 18F partnership with the General Services Administration. We also specify how the priorities of Silicon Valley plutocrats are often in conflict with the interests of the middle class on issues like immigration.<br/><br/><br/><br/> NLPC has been a critic of the Obama administration\u2019s close and often improper relationship with tech companies. Former Googleexecutive Andrew McLaughlin resigned from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) after we demanded that he do so. Our letter to Trump describes how OSTP became little more than a lounge in the White House for Googlelobbyists.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-PMN811278420161215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MDB-CN21-J9XT-P21V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 15, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NATIONAL LEGAL &amp;

No one in the conservative movement should contribute to this problem by fronting for Google.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> Last week, we sent <person><nameText>President-elect Trump </nameText></person>a letter warning him about the influence of Silicon Valley in advance of his meeting today with tech executives.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Except for PayPal founder Peter Theil, Silicon Valley billionaires opposed Trump\u2019s election. Most prominent was Google\u2019s <person><nameText>Eric Schmidt, </nameText></person>who was photographed election night with a \u201cStaff\u201d badge at Hillary\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d party.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Our letter was prompted by a November 30 letter sent by tech giants to Trump urging him to adopt their policy preferences and to appoint their allies to important government posts. We ask Trump to \u201ctake their self-serving recommendations with a grain of salt.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> We provide a number of very specific warnings to Trump about the involvement of these companies with the federal government, including an account of the disastrous 18F partnership with the General Services Administration. We also specify how the priorities of Silicon Valley plutocrats are often in conflict with the interests of the middle class on issues like immigration.<br/><br/><br/><br/> NLPC has been a critic of the Obama administration\u2019s close and often improper relationship with tech companies. Former Googleexecutive Andrew McLaughlin resigned from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) after we demanded that he do so. Our letter to Trump describes how OSTP became little more than a lounge in the White House for Googlelobbyists.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-PMN814024520161216</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MDD-PSC1-DXCW-D1J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 16, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NATIONAL LEGAL &amp;

According to Flaherty:</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGooglewill pay very well and the benefits will be wonderful, but any conservative who takes this job will have to sell his or her soul. Anyone with an ounce of personal integrity should not even consider it.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGoogleis not trying to hire a free-market advocate because it suddenly believes in free markets. It is a monopoly and it intends to stay that way. Googlewants to buy off and defuse critics who have been emboldened by the election of <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person>\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cThere is no, new conservative-friendly Google. The company\u2019s plan to hire a conservative liaison and more Republican lobbyists is a continuation of Washington business as usual that Trump ran against.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGoogle\u2019s influence permeated the Obama administration, particularly in its \u2018capture\u2019 of its regulators. As we sought to publicize at the time, the Federal Trade Commission, and its Chair Edith Ramirez, appeared to take its direction from Googlein squelching an anti-trust investigation that was recommended by its staff.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cAny conservative or libertarian who takes a job with Googlewill be automatically suspect. I call on all the leaders of all right-of-center groups to rebuff Googleuntil there is serious change in the orientation of the company, starting with ending the censorship of conservatives in search results.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cGoogleand a handful of Bay Area companies now control the flow of online news, as more and more Americans get their news online instead of through newspapers or television. As a result, Silicon Valley is exerting ever-increasing control over politics and the government, notwithstanding Trump\u2019s election.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> \u201cBig Tech\u2019s newfound political power, coupled with the hoard of personal information that these same companies compile on every American, is particularly dangerous for conservatives.

I appreciate the opportunity to open this conference on competition in the fast-changing and dynamic communications industry.  So, my first question for you this morning is, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d That\u2019s what the famous Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi asked with the first radio broadcast over water, on May 13, 1897. After inventing what was then \u201ccutting edge\u201d radio technology here in Italy, Marconi sent that message across the Bristol Channel in England; soon after that he was sending messages across the Atlantic. Tapped out in Morse code, it said: \u201cAre you ready?</p><p>\u201d This was followed by: \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d And, the reply: \u201cYes, loud and clear.\u201d Wireless communications was born.  The world, of course, has never been fully ready for the many incredible advancements radio communications have enabled. But, it has been more than eager to embrace them. For over a century, since that first radio broadcast across the Bristol Channel, the communications industry has been marked by constant innovation. It\u2019s a dynamic industry that has delivered enormous value to consumers, starting here, in the birthplace of wireless communications, to countries around the world.    Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust at the United States Department of Justice, spoke in Rome a few weeks ago. He recalled the epithet that \u201call roads lead to Rome,\u201d and the power of network effects on display in the Roman Empire. Today\u2019s conference topics are built on the power of network effects\u2014how they deliver value to markets, and how they can hinder the competitive process.  Indeed, with the development of advanced networks and the Internet of Things, we are entering a world of ubiquitous connectivity. Instead of \u201call roads lead to Rome,\u201d a more descriptive epithet for our time is \u201call roads lead to everywhere and everything\u201d or, maybe, \u201call roads lead to all roads.\u201d  The ongoing development of wireless communications that Marconi helped advance, and eventually commercialize, has forever changed our world. There are now network connections and wireless signals crisscrossing the globe. This city of Milan and my home in Washington, D.C. no longer seem quite so far apart.  In fact, I can hold up my smartphone from this podium and see if I have any text messages from distant Nigro family relatives in San Fele, Italy, or obtain critical, time sensitive information, such as a picture of the Italian Caprese avocado toast my daughter ate for breakfast today.  In the modern era, however, it is also so much more than simply sending messages. In the last century, telecommunications was one of the most important industries in every economy in the world. It was how people and businesses shared information in real time. In the next century, however, many industries will rely on telecommunications not just to communicate, but as an integral part of the services their customers\u2019 desire. Telecom is rapidly evolving from being a means of communication to providing the platform on which other industries operate.  Consider Amazon or Uber in the United States. Retail businesses and transportation services once stood beside communications providers as pillars of industry. Now, retail and transportation depend on communications not just to do business more expeditiously, but as part of the service itself. Telecom is quickly becoming inextricably intertwined with many other industries and changing the way we do business; it is restructuring entire industries.  Throughout the decades since Marconi first sent his message, we have seen that innovation and consumer welfare are best served by competition and competitive markets. When the pace of innovation is stifled by external controls, be they unnecessary regulations or monopolists, consumers suffer. That is what I would like to talk about today \u2013 our responsibility as Department of Justice officials to enforce the antitrust laws through effective law enforcement, rather than unnecessary regulation. Regulated markets tend to react more slowly to the rapid changes that are the lifeblood of dynamic industries such as communications. In contrast, by preserving competition through effective antitrust enforcement, markets and competitors are free to embrace innovation at the pace of invention, unconstrained by the reigns of a regulator.  I\u2019ll begin my remarks by talking about some general principles of antitrust enforcement and remedies in dynamic industries, before touching on a few of the key topics that will be the focus of the panels the next two days.  The United States\u2019 first federal antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed in 1890, seven years before Marconi sent that message asking: \u201cAre you ready?\u201d When it came to having a tool to maintain competitive markets, the country was ready\u2014it had in place a law enforcement regime designed to protect competition and competitive markets.  We also had much to learn in those early days. The drafters of the Sherman Act did not understand key market concepts in communications like network effects and gatekeeper power, or economic concepts like HHIs and Upward Pricing Pressure. They, however, endorsed a law enforcement regime, rather than a regulatory regime, which proved wise\u2014they lacked the depth of thinking that we do about the features of communications markets that can sometimes make them conducive to competitive problems. But, they did understand there were dangers from the misuse of corporate power, even as they were hesitant to interpose governmental authority over free enterprise. We are wrestling with the same tension today.  In resolving that tension, let us be clear about the proper role of the government in dynamic industries. We are not inventors; I know I am certainly not, which is why I am here speaking to you today. We do not develop new technologies. Nor do we provide incubators for inventors\u2014that is what free and competitive markets do. Our job is to use law enforcement to protect those free markets and competition, to the benefit of consumers, innovators, and the economy as a whole. At our best, we protect the environment in which the modern-day Marconis have reason and opportunity to tinker, invent and invest to bring new technologies to market.  That is precisely the intuition underlying this Antitrust Division\u2019 approach to merger settlements. Mergers change market structures. The question for us is whether the change is good or bad for consumers. When anticompetitive harm results from changes in market structure, attempting to wrestle the firm to behave in a way that we think replicates a competitive outcome makes no sense, even assuming we can guess what the competitive outcome would be, or should be, absent the merger. A problem caused by a structural change requires a structural fix. It is not our job as law enforcers to use our power to approve transactions as an opportunity to step in and order the firm to adhere to certain dictates. Regulatory restrictions and dynamic markets do not mix well.  That is our guiding principle: whenever feasible, competition, as maintained through effective antitrust enforcement, is preferable to regulation. Competitive markets dynamically weigh risk and reward, support investment, and pivot to new innovation. Regulation, in contrast, is rigid and tends to be slow moving\u2014lagging both competitive problems and new innovations. The literature describes as \u201cregulatory lag\u201d the delay between changes in market conditions or technology and the adjustment of regulations based on those factors. Particularly when attempting to regulate access to markets as a solution to a competitively problematic market structure, regulation and its resulting lags will typically mean delayed entry, expansion, or innovation.    A story from communications law history underscores the point. In the 1950s, a Texas rancher and inventor thought there should be a way to make and receive a phone call while riding a horse or tending to an oil field. So, Thomas F. Carter set out to build a device to attach to his telephone, then on AT&amp;T\u2019s monopoly network, that would use radio signals to transmit out in the field. In many ways, his invention, the Carterfone, was the first mobile phone.  AT&amp;T was then a nationwide telephone monopolist in the United States, and it sought to block the Carterfone. At the time, its equipment business, Western Electric, was vertically integrated with its telephone system, and naturally fought innovators who tried to develop new equipment.  Moreover, AT&amp;T had the assistance of FCC regulation, using a tariff filed with the FCC in 1957 to prohibit interconnection of non-AT&amp;T equipment like the Carterfone. So AT&amp;T was able to employ an FCC tariff to block the Carterfone.  Carter eventually turned to legal action. He filed suit in federal court in 1965, but that case was dismissed. So nearly a decade after first attempting to bring his invention to market, in 1966 the industry regulator, the FCC, undertook an inquiry into the effect of its own rules. Two and a half years later, the FCC issued its famous 1968 Carterfone decision, insisting that AT&amp;T permit the attachment of devices like Mr. Carter\u2019s to the telephone network.  There we see the belated benefits of regulation. Over a decade after its invention, and eleven years after AT&amp;T filed an FCC tariff prohibiting its use, Mr. Carter had won access to the markets with the assistance of the sector regulator.    The Carterfone decision is rightly celebrated for opening up the monopoly telephone system to innovative new equipment. But consider that it took Tom Carter three years to win that result through a proceeding at the FCC, eleven years after the tariff was filed. Do you see what I mean about regulatory lag? Think about all the inventors and innovators who were not so persistent and who just never bothered in the decades prior. Even as Carterfone demonstrates the benefits of regulation when it produces a competitive result, it also exemplifies its pitfalls.  Indeed, compare what Apple and Steve Jobs did as they developed the iPhone in 2007. In a competitive U.S. wireless market, he was able to find a launch partner with AT&amp;T, which sought exclusive access to the device in order to gain a competitive advantage. The rest, as they say, is history.  It is remarkable to think that if Apple\u2019s iPhone had followed the same path to the market that the Carterfone did, we would be looking forward to FCC action this year.  Whereas in a regulated monopoly market, the first mobile phone took over a decade to reach the market; in a competitive wireless market, the iPhone took just a few short years. How much would consumers have lost these last ten years if the iPhone had needed to seek court or FCC intervention to change the world?  The answer is too much. Particularly in dynamic and innovative markets, consumers do not deserve to pay the price of delay. That is why we believe in competitive markets unbridled by the reigns of regulation and behavioral dictates. Thus, as AAG Delrahim has said, we disfavor regulatory settlements and, instead, have a strong preference for structural settlements because they leave competitors and markets free to adapt and change with product availability and consumer demand.  Our recent settlement in connection with the Bayer/Monsanto transaction is a good example of this philosophy. Any farmer will tell you that agriculture is an incredibly innovative industry. As they have for millennia, seeds like corn and cotton are undergoing constant technological development to improve their yields. Meanwhile, seed treatments that ward off insects and disease are at the forefront of agricultural innovation.  As you know, Bayer proposed to acquire Monsanto in a $66-billion-dollar transaction. We worked with the parties to resolve all of our competition concerns with a historic divestiture. The proposed final judgment requires Bayer to divest businesses and assets valued at approximately $9 billion dollars. More importantly, none of the competitive problems, including the areas of vertical concern, were attempted to be managed using behavioral dictates.  A few features of that settlement underscore our approach in dynamic markets. First, we undertook a thorough investigation and we were ready to litigate while also coordinating across jurisdictions. Although our friends at the EC were also working on their own review, we worked closely with them to coordinate our remedies.    Most importantly, the relief we obtained is purely structural. Bayer has agreed to divest itself of all of the businesses and assets needed to fully address both our horizontal and our vertical concerns with the transaction. While there are temporary commitments in place to effectuate the divestiture, it is important to note that they are a means to support the structural relief we obtained. After those transition commitments have passed, the market structure obtained in the settlement will remain, and throughout it will remain flexible to innovation and evolution in the industry.    We have also included in the Bayer/Monsanto settlement a number of new provisions to allow for more effective enforcement of the decree. Along with enforcement provisions that have been in all of our recent settlements, we have also added a new provision regarding the interpretation of the decree, which we intend to include in all decrees going forward.  That emphasis on structural solutions to structural problems is particularly important in dynamic industries like agriculture and communications. When new technologies and modes of doing business are rapidly evolving, how can static behavioral commitments meaningfully solve competitive problems? Equally concerning, how can we write behavioral commitments that do not themselves risk hindering innovation and investment? As AAG Delrahim explained in a speech last November, regulatory remedies fall short by attempting \u201cstatic solutions to the realities of dynamic markets.\u201d In dynamic industries especially, antitrust remedies should preserve the flexibility of competitively structured free markets, unconstrained by regulation.  With that background in mind, let me turn to some of the specific topics we will be discussing the next two days.  First, wireless. We have come a long way from Marconi\u2019s radio and the Carterfone, and even from the introduction of the iPhone. Mobile wireless network infrastructure has become a crucial component of any advanced society.  According to GSMA, Europe and the US have the highest levels of mobile user engagement in the world. Just to give you a sense of the scope\u2014the US has 400 million wireless subscribers; that\u2019s more subscribers than the entire US population. Meanwhile, in Europe, there are 456 million mobile subscribers\u2014that is over 84% of the population.  Mobile wireless is critical to both economies. Wireless services alone generate $189 billion in annual revenue, and devices add to that another $84 billion. And that is just the services themselves, with trillions of dollars in commerce flowing over the networks. Millions upon millions of jobs are supported by wireless infrastructure.  Yet demand continues to grow. In tomorrow\u2019s economy, not only will each individual be \u201cconnected\u201d but most consumer products will be as well. Already, a connected carbon monoxide detector can save lives by turning off a home\u2019s furnace when it senses danger. The possibilities to add value to people\u2019s lives through further device interconnectivity on the Internet of Things is enormous. As more and more devices connect and machine learning technologies provide greater uses for that connectivity, demand will likely continue to increase at an enormous rate.  Some claim that 5G technologies appear poised to meet that increasing demand; that they represent a leap forward in capabilities. We may, some argue, see speeds ten times faster than LTE, or more, alongside lower latency and greater security.  What does that mean for competition enforcement? As in medicine, first, we should do no harm. With companies and infrastructure developers rapidly innovating and testing new models, we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward. Free market competition provides the best means by which to test and to hone the emerging wireless networks to provide a platform for tomorrow\u2019s economy.  Just as we hope to let free market competition play out, however, we should avoid market structures that require regulatory intervention. I doubt anyone desires a return to the days of a regulated monopoly provider that can exclude new equipment like the Carterfone. Wherever the 5G evolution takes us, I hope we can agree that a competitive market, not a regulated one, is our goal. It is certainly a priority of the Antitrust Division to push for policies that promote the development of \u2014 and competition in \u2014 5G technologies.     Another item on the agenda for this conference is big tech, and how we should be thinking about competition among large tech players and in emerging virtual markets. Indeed, these topics have been on the agenda for many events this year. People around the world are thinking hard about the development of massive online platforms and aggregators that generate tremendous network effects. How do we maintain the value they deliver to consumers at the same time as we use antitrust enforcement to police the competition in their industries?  A few key points to bear in mind. First, the Antitrust Division has active matters in this area as well. We expect a decision any day from the United States Supreme Court on our American Express case. After a lengthy trial, the district court found that American Express restrained competition on the merchant side of its platform\u2014the market in which credit card networks compete for the business of merchants. The Supreme Court is now considering an appeal from that decision that asks what consideration should be given the other side of the platform. Whatever it decides, its ruling will likely impact how we think about antitrust enforcement for platform businesses.  We should also base enforcement decisions, as always, on evidence and sound economics. The bigness of technology companies as a general matter, or their success in delivering value to consumers, is not alone a basis for antitrust enforcement action. Competition enforcers should act only when an evidence-based assessment suggests antitrust enforcement will prevent real consumer harms. Also, there is a great deal of debate around so-called \u201cbig tech,\u201d but with these relatively new business models it is important our understanding of their economics is sound. For example, some are discussing a framework of thinking about big tech in terms of platforms and aggregators; they believe whereas platforms connect users with content, aggregators connect with users directly and package content for them. If so, these models may imply different competitive incentives and market structures that may be relevant to competition analysis.  Another key point is that the consumer welfare standard is flexible enough to deal with the novel kinds of competition issues presented by online platforms. Although many of these services are zero cost to consumers in a monetary sense, they do cost consumers their time and attention, and oftentimes their data and other information about them. Revealed preferences suggest that consumers place value on their data such that its use forms a dimension of platform competition. Applying a consumer welfare standard through this lens, the antitrust laws are up to the task of analyzing platform industries.  The Antitrust Division has also prioritized competition in video delivery, as exemplified by our recent enforcement action against the vertical merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner. We expect a decision from the court tomorrow, so I will not comment on the case.  Vertical issues in telecommunications typically arise from gatekeeper power\u2014the power to affect or control access to a market. In the case of video distribution, this concern arises as Internet disruption threatens to challenge profits that industry incumbents have long enjoyed. We have sought, in a number of past cases, to prevent the harms that arise from aligning the incumbents\u2019 incentive to delay disruptive competition with the ability to do so.    Our Bayer/Monsanto remedy addresses a version of this concern. It requires the structural divestiture of certain important Bayer seed treatment product lines to remedy the competitive harm that would result from the vertical integration of those lines with Monsanto\u2019s leading seed business. Bayer has critical seed treatments products, and so the merger would have given it the incentive and ability to raise prices that Monsanto\u2019s rival seed companies pay for those treatments, ultimately raising prices for farmers.  By requiring the divestiture of Bayer\u2019s seed treatment businesses, we eliminate the incentive and ability to increase prices to Monsanto\u2019s rivals. A behavioral remedy, in contrast, would have attempted to dictate the terms on which Bayer sells those seed treatments, even as they undergo continued development and innovation in the years to come. We chose a free market solution over a regulatory one.  An important benefit of structural settlements is that they solve, for good, the competitive problem resulting from the merger. Behavioral commitments, meanwhile, attempt temporary solutions. Many celebrated the Comcast/NBCU settlement conditions back when that merger went forward in 2011. Those conditions expire on September 1, 2018. When we wake up on September 2, the merger will be here; the final judgment will not. Presumably, either all of the adverse effects the final judgment was intended to address have been solved, or not. While I want to be clear not to comment on Comcast/NBCU, more generally, it is our concern about the \u201cor not\u201d world that compels our strong preference for structural fixes to structural problems.  The end result of these regulatory fixes, unfortunately, can be markets that simply beg for more regulation. Some have said that the answer to expiring behavioral remedies is to extend them. Instead of five or seven 7 years, maybe behavioral decrees should be ten or fifteen years, or longer; although a decree that is too long may be just as stifling as one that is too short. Others have said the answer is to impose new sector regulations to fill the gaps. All of those suggestions, however, miss the point of antitrust enforcement as a law enforcement regime. The reason we favor structural relief is because we believe competition, not human dictates, is the best vehicle for promoting consumer welfare. Using antitrust law to impose yet more regulations is counterproductive and distorts incentives to innovate.    Let me conclude by acknowledging how fortunate we are. We live in a time of tremendous potential and rapid change. As consumers, that gives us much to look forward to; as enforcers, it gives us much to think about. The reason competition enforcement has proven time and time again it is up to the challenge of fast changing markets, is that it has benefitted from a vibrant community of academics, enforcers, and practitioners, thinking through the hard issues as they arise. Now, it is time to do our part. I look forward to an interesting discussion over these next two days.  Thank you. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN882898620180612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ6-WW21-J9XT-P1B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 12, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The giants in the field (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google and its parent, Alphabet) are associated with big and scary numbers. Let's use market cap as an example. </p><p>Facebook's market capitalization is above $500 billion. That makes it the piker of this group. Amazon accounts for above $840 billion, Alphabet is also in the 800s neighborhood. Apple's market cap passed the $1 trillion mark. It is natural to think that with such size comes power and that at least some of such power comes at somebody else's expense. Confirming this suspicion for many, are the headline stories of strategic acquisitions, where the giants seem to be gobbling up potential challengers. For example, Facebook paid close to $22 billion for WhatsApp in 2014. This was an intuitive response\u2014Facebook acted to nip in the bud a potential disruptor of its own social media dominance. If valid, this understanding of the acquisition would make it look a lot like the machinations of the late 19th century 'robber barons,' whose behavior prompted the drafting of antitrust statutes. Innovation and Exit As Putz says, a recent survey of more than 2,000 voters in the US concluded that roughly two-thirds think the recent antitrust reviews of Big Tech are sensible. This means that that 'collective hand-wringing' of left, right, and political center has struck a nerve with constituents and it will likely continue. The problem is that many of the innovators in the tech world look specifically to the acquisition of their corporate entities by one of the giants as their natural way of cashing in on their innovations. It is their exit strategy. It is also the exit strategy of the private equity and/or venture capital firms that have supported them as startups. It is not clear who exactly benefits by blocking or rendering rusty the hinges of that exit. However, it is very clear that innovation is disincentivized. Putz observes that a lot of startups are 'effectively features rather than fully fleshed companies\u2014think plug-in rather than rival browser.' The prospect of acquisition is their only realistic 'out,' for both the managing group that got together in the paradigmatic dorm room and their financial backers\u2014and accordingly that prospect was critical to their getting 'in,' in the first place. Putz's focus is chiefly on the seller's side of this market\u2014the startups happy to be acquired by a giant. He notes that there have been 445 M...eals closed by the Big Four since 2007. But let us look briefly at the buyer's side. What is in it for the giants, and for their customers? Other than consolidation for nefarious purposes, that is? Innovations, Android, and Instagram The year 2007, as it happens, was the year Google launched Android, the mobile operating system based on a modified version of Linux, based on assets it had acquired when it purchased Android Inc., two years before. Android has been integral to Google's growth since, and to the services it provides (often for free) to its customers and is a good example from the buyers' side of why the M...arket isn't broken. The value of Android is another good example of how the Big Four have not been squelching competition. Their acquisitions actually have advanced competition. They have as Putz says, 'upped the competition in the space by upping their competition with each other\u2014often more than many realize.' He also points out that in 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram. This wasn't squelching. It was innovating. The acquisition 'revolutionized how people post to social media, providing advertisers an object lesson on new ways to tap into novel network effects.' Putz' conclusion, again, and in his words: '[C]apital markets for startups could shrink if the opportunity to be purchased by a big tech company is constrained. And exits via M...re as vital as ever to the health of the VC ecosystem, which is seeing unprecedented levels of investment.'

But in Google's case, it might just be met with a sigh of relief.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For more than a year, antitrust regulators at America's Department of Justice have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/\">circling the internet search giant</url>, and this summer they have been gradually closing in. Although three other big US tech companies-Apple, Amazon and Facebook-are in Washington's crosshairs, Google has long stood out as the most likely candidate for monopoly charges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The groundwork for building a case against the company has already been laid. Rivals such as Yelp have been griping about Google's control over its search engine and the internet's advertising infrastructure for years. The company has been dealt three competition-related fines in Europe, amounting to billions of euros (Google is appealing all three).</p><p>Legal experts believe Google has the biggest case to answer. Unlike Amazon, Apple and Facebook, which do not have such obviously dominant market positions, Google accounts for at least 80pc of worldwide internet searches. The web's second most popular search bar appears on YouTube, which is also owned by Google.</p><p>Last week, reports emerged that the Justice Department's long running antitrust investigation against Google was coming to a close. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/\">According to The New York Times</url>, US attorney general William Barr, the nation's chief prosecutor, has been pushing lawyers for a case against the company to be filed by the end of this month.</p><p>Even if this timeline slips, pursuing charges before November's presidential election is likely to be a priority. While Donald Trump is unlikely to see cracking down on Silicon Valley as much of a vote winner (tech companies remain largely popular, and barely register as political issues next to the pandemic, the economic crisis and social division), appearing to take action against Google will at least look like a proactive step.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, it would be a victory for Barr, who would be replaced in a Biden administration. But at the same time, the urgency to bring charges has led to fears it could be a hastily-prepared case. Several Justice Department lawyers have reportedly stepped away from the investigation or said they will refuse to endorse charges, fearing that they will not be strong enough to triumph in US courts. </p><p>State-level prosecutors, which have been separately investigating the company, are also said to be split along political lines as to whether to join the Justice Department. Stalling may be unwarranted. Lawyers are likely to ask for more time on just about anything, and regulators have had plenty of time to study Google's allegedly anti-competitive tactics.</p><p>But any suggestion that a case will have been hastily put together is likely to concern anyone who believes the company's power should be curtailed. Unlike the monopoly enforcement model typically employed in Europe, in which companies are fined and then have the option of a lengthy and laborious legal appeal, US prosecutors that are unable to settle an investigation must argue their case in court to secure punishment. And when they try, they can lose. </p><p>In August, a US judge <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/\">shot down claims from the Federal Trade Commission</url> that chipmaker Qualcomm had unfairly pushed out rival companies. Last year, the Justice Department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/23/us-launches-investigation-breaking-big-tech/\">failed to get a court</url> to undo a merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. A long history of US case law has made it exceedingly difficult for the government to win monopoly cases, especially when a service is provided for free to the consumer, as it is with Google.</p><p>All of this means that if the world's biggest search engine is to face competition charges in its home market, any case must be airtight. Lawyers abandoning the case because they fear it is being rushed does not suggest it will be. It is fair to say that Google would rather fight a hastily put together legal challenge now than a comprehensive one later. The picture that emerges is of a system that looks set up not to tame the tech giants, even if concerns about them are legitimate.</p><p>Even when taking action against Google has support from both parties, and prosecutors have no shortage of complaints to investigate, the prospects for a successful challenge against the company, let alone the break-up that some would advocate, are unclear. The same could be true for Amazon, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>The more likely path to US competition crackdowns against Silicon Valley could be new laws, a prospect that a Congressional committee is investigating, but which might prove difficult in today's gridlocked Washington. While taking action against the tech giants has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington, Republicans and Democrats want different things. One side claims Silicon Valley is censoring speech, the other that it is centralising power and amassing too much wealth. The proposed solutions differ, which partly explains why no significant tech regulation has come into force despite a widespread clamour for something to be done.</p><p>A new face in the White House may break that gridlock. But for now, Washington seems ill-equipped to take on Big Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65769744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SJ-KC11-JCJY-G17P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 7, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.</p><p> The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.</p><p> Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p> Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p> Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p> \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d</p><p> Pichai\u2019s opening remarks touted Google\u2019s value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p> But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p> Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.</p><p> As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p> In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p> \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Trump tweeted.</p><p> Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can\u2019t use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p> Trump\u2019s Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p> The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.</p><p> Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p> In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p> Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.</p><p> Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.</p><p> The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-6202897</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E11409139CCD3 NWBKNY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-PCK1-JBCN-43G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Times Herald-Record<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They promise action in the coming year on a host of issues: competition, online privacy, encryption and bias.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. tech companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon are girding themselves for more federal scrutiny.</p><p>\"As the internet companies matured without a lot of regulation, some issues have emerged where attention is needed,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat representing Silicon Valley since 1994 and who has introduced a national online privacy bill.</p><p>\"I think it's fair enough to examine what kind of rules should be set in certain elements of the tech economy,\" she said.</p><p>For years, Washington was enamored with the technology industry and its iconic companies that fueled economic growth.

Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is reportedly drafting a bill to toughen the country's rules about antitrust and competition.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly looking into stopping Facebook's further integration of Whatsapp and Instagram, in case it would one day see a need to break up the social network giant.</p><p>Washington seems to have woken up to the dangers of technology companies that have become the gatekeepers of communications and commerce, said Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, a research group that focuses on antitrust issues.</p><p>\"The traction has definitely really intensified over the last year,\" she said. \"There's also just a growing awareness that these companies are causing a wide range of harms, whether it's harms to our democracy, harms to innovation, harms to entrepreneurship.

Nicholas Fandos and Noah Weiland write: \"It may or may not be the report of the century, it may or may not be ready soon, and it may be only a few pages long. But it is unquestionably one of the capital's most anticipated documents since the Starr Report.\"</p><p>So is this the week? I wish I knew. But The Times is right about the rumors and guessing games. And even if Mueller doesn't deliver anything, his probe is still making news on at least three fronts. There was a new update in the Michael Flynn case on Tuesday evening. Paul Manafort's final sentencing hearing is on Wednesday. And Roger Stone is back in court on Thursday.</p><p>The known unknowns</p><p>Chris Cuomo led Tuesday night's \"Primetime\" with these questions: \"Is Mueller making his last stand tomorrow with Manafort, or are more indictments coming, or are we really now on report watch?\" No matter what, \"the president's backers are preparing for war,\" he said before bringing in Rep. Matt Gaetz.</p><p>When Gaetz spun a conspiratorial web about the Mueller team's donations to Democrats, Cuomo stopped him and said \"Bob Mueller is more Republican than you've been on your best day.\" Watch...</p><p>Full of surprises?</p><p>Democrats have been fretting that Mueller's report might be \"a dud,\" as Wednesday's NYT story noted.</p><p>But what if Mueller's findings are full of surprises? As the NYT's Peter Baker said on MSNBC Tuesday afternoon, Mueller has done \"a remarkable job of holding his cards tight to the vest. His office does not leak, much to our frustration. We do not know things until he's ready for us to know them. It's very possible that when he finally shows those cards, he has a lot of things there that we don't know anything about.\"</p><p>Will transparency prevail?</p><p>On \"AC360\" Tuesday night, Carl Bernstein brought up the overarching principle that \"the American people be fully informed about the most important aspects of this investigation.\"</p><p>He said \"I can't imagine that the new Attorney General of the US, Mr. Barr, wants to end his public career by suppressing what the American people need to know...\"</p><p>Alex Trebek is still at work</p><p>Alex Trebek was at work on Tuesday, just as he said he would be, nearly one week after sharing his stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Tuesday was the first scheduled day of production at \"Jeopardy!\" since Trebek's announcement last Wednesday. \"We are taping today, and Alex is here and behind his lectern as scheduled,\" a spokeswoman for the beloved quiz show told me. The show normally has two production days a week.
