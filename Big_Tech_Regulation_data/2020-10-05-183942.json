President Trump does not believe that the EU's approach to what he refers to as 'monopolies' is the appropriate one, with the commander in chief stating that the U.S. Attorney General would look into the companies 'differently'. Leaders in the European countries view the situation as an easy way to make money lauded the efforts, the president claims but that doesn't mean it isn't something the U.S. shouldn't be doing. According to President Trump, there is a lot of money to be garnered by going after big tech and that's something the U.S. should be doing too. </p><p>Agreement across the aisle The president's comments come in the midst of impending investigations and ongoing probes into companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Those are generally centered around concerns of activity and practices that would violate antitrust regulations and law, withprobes split between the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) and the Justice Department. The FTC will look into Amazon and Facebook, while the Justice Department will looking into Apple and Google. Investigations and probes are ongoing with regard to other companies in the tech industry as well. Those are specifically aimed at Sprint and T-Mobile's proposed merger. Those follow questions about what impact the merger would have not just on consumers but on the wireless industry in the U.S. T-Mobile and Sprint have argued the move would be good for the rollout of 5G and for consumers. There seems to be a level of agreement on both sides of the political spectrum with regard to each of the ongoing investigations, with one exception. The president generally agrees that T-Mobile and Sprint should be brought together, spurring some discussion[2] about whether any interference between the White House and Justice Department might influence the decision -- expected sometime this month. Investigations into the other organizations have most notably been lauded by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), with calls from both sides of the U.S. political spectrum to break the largest of the country's tech companies up. Fueling the possible antitrust litigation that could follow from the probes, representatives have become increasingly concerned by the amount of influence top technology firms have. Chiefly, worries center around the fact that each of the tech giants has a massive influence across a broad swath of the tech industry, well outside of each companies' respective area of focus. For instance, Google's primary business is advertising but the company also holds a significant amount of sway in the autonomous vehicle, AI, and home IoT industries as well as in web browsing and search -- among other things. Each company currently being looked into[3] follows a similar pattern of influence. Breaking a stalemate? Political divides have generally been viewed as widening in the U.S. under the current administration and technology companies have played a key role in that divide. Primarily, that has been due to reports of interference in the election process leading to Donald Trump's presidency through misappropriation of the influence those companies hold over the populace. Conversely, some tension has remained because of alleged bias from the companies themselves against conservatives and the president. The two parties are, however, in agreement that technology[4] companies wield too much influence. Details about any plans the president may have to impose fines against the companies or otherwise bring an end to their 'monopolies' are not immediately clear. But this may ultimately become a rallying point that begins to close the gap between political opponents on either side of the aisle.

He calls them out over bias, and they rewrite policies making him the one exception to their rules, taking care never to punch back. But on Tuesday, Twitter slapped back for the first time ever, labeling two tweets as making false and misleading claims about mail-in voting.</p><p><br/>On Wednesday morning, predictably, Trump hit back. In a series of early morning tweets, the president said he would \"strongly regulate, or close [platforms] down\" before he allowed them to stifle conservative speech. Trump did not explain the ways in which the federal government could regulate or shutter social media companies in his Wednesday morning tweets, but the fresh threats are lighting a fire under the feet of conservatives who believe, unjustly, that social media companies silence conservative voices and views. Soon after his first set of tweets Wednesday, Trump said to expect a \"Big action to follow.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>It's not the first time the president has called out platforms for perceived bias against conservatives, and it certainly won't be the last. But all of Trump's past attempts to regulate social media platforms for ideological bias have fallen short, even as the scandals provoking them continue to escalate. The efforts have provided the Trump reelection campaign with a convenient foil in the Silicon Valley liberals and \"elites\" that supposedly control moderation systems. But the president has never followed through on his threats and used his considerable powers to place legal limits on how these companies operate. His fights with the tech companies last just long enough to generate headlines, but flame out before they can make a meaningful policy impact. And despite the wave of conservative anger currently raining down on Twitter, there's no reason to think this one will be any different.<br/>Those flameouts are most tangible in the courts. On the same day as Trump's tweets, the US Court of Appeals in Washington ruled against the nonprofit group Freedom Watch and fringe right figure Laura Loomer in a case purporting that Facebook, Google, and Twitter conspired to suppress conservative content online, according to Bloomberg. Whether it be Loomer or Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) fighting the bias battle, the courts have yet to rule in their favor.<br/>Those flameouts are most tangible in the courts<br/>Trump's own attempts to use his executive power to regulate social media platforms have also fallen short. Last fall, the Trump administration reportedly drafted an executive order titled \"Protecting Americans from Online Censorship\" that would empower the Federal Communications Commission with the ability to change how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is interpreted. Right now, that law ensures that platforms can't be sued over content posted by their users, provided they make a good faith effort to remove posts that violate the law. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has previously made remarks that social media companies have too much power over online speech, but agency officials argued that the administration's order was unconstitutional. The draft order went nowhere.<br/>Still, Republicans jumped at Trump's comments over social media bias to push legislation that would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Soon after Trump attacked Twitter on Tuesday, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) reinvoked the debate to change the law.<br/>\"The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers,\" Rubio tweeted Tuesday.<br/>\"Twitter is getting subsidized by the federal government for that interference [labeling Trump's tweets] in the form of special immunity worth billions,\" Hawley said. \"Time to end #BigTech sweetheart deal w/ government.\"<br/>Hawley has championed the conservative fight against Big Tech by introducing legislation to pare back Section 230, a fight that has gained him many fans on the anti-corporate left. Last year, he introduced a measure that would revoke 230's legal shield if a platform is proven by the Federal Trade Commission to act out of favor against conservative political views. But the bill never received a hearing, and most of his other efforts have failed to pick up broad support, even among Republicans. Even if his own party backed the proposal, it seems unlikely to get through the Democrat-led House of Representatives during campaign season. Hawley also sent a letter directly to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Wednesday questioning the platform's ability to fact-check Trump after \"choosing. to editorialize on President Trump's tweets.\"<br/>Even if the Trump administration and Congress can't address their bias concerns through policy and legislation, they'll likely continue to leverage the scandals through campaign advertising and fundraising. Earlier Wednesday, Trump's reelection campaign released a new ad \"to FIGHT BACK against\" the mainstream media and \"their biased coverage\" of the Trump administration. Replace CNN and MSNBC with Facebook and Twitter, and the Trump campaign has a set of brand-new liberal villains treating the president unfairly. The campaign has even gone out of its way to scapegoat Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, over a string of old tweets. That sort of attack is as damaging to Twitter as it is profitable for Trump - but if you're imagining this path will end in a new age of tech antitrust... you shouldn't hold your breath.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1072187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6042-MMR1-JBYT-H28P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As John Boehner, the former Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said: \"There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\" The faster the fur flies, the more secure Trump seems to be.</p><p>Trump's opponents once hoped that business leaders would stand up to him. But they have been compromised by the economic goodies, the tax breaks and deregulation, thrown their way by this <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.administration.No\">www.administration.No</url> group has a harder time dealing with Trump than the leaders of Silicon Valley. They live and work in one of the most culturally liberal corners of America. But they are capitalists red in tooth and claw. Many are richer than Trump but they hate his gaudy displays of wealth. Their companies may be headquartered in California but they are innately global, and many of their most talented employees are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. They have spoken out against Trump's most extreme statements, his attacks on black athletes, for example, or his equivocation when neo-Nazis and antifascists fought last year in Charlottesville, Virginia. But they have usually waited until a consensus has formed.</p><p>This week they were at it again, joining in the condemnation of the administration's separation of families at the Mexican border. But it's no example of political courage when you sneak into the back row of an already giant chorus led by four former First Ladies.</p><p>Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, said: \"It's heartbreaking to see the images and hear the sounds of the kids. Kids are the most vulnerable people in any society. I think what's happening is inhumane. It needs to stop.\" Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page that \"we need to stop this policy right now\" and encouraged donations to organisations helping immigrant families.</p><p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted: \"As a father, a citizen and an immigrant myself, the stories coming from our border break my heart. Families are the backbone of society. A policy that pulls them apart rather than building them up is immoral and just plain wrong.\" Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, used the hashtag #KeepFamiliesTogether.</p><p>Cook and Apple are in a particular bind. On tax, they couldn't be happier.</p><p>Trump has lowered corporate rates and made it much easier for US companies to bring home the cash they were keeping overseas. What Trump expects in return is more investment in American jobs and Apple has promised to invest $30 billion in the US over the next five years and create 20,000 new jobs.</p><p>On social issues, the Apple boss and the President are miles apart. Since succeeding Steve Jobs in 2011, Cook has slowly found his voice, as an advocate for LGBT rights and for immigrants. He has consistently attacked the administration's clampdown on immigration and said last year that \"Apple would not exist without diversity\".</p><p>But then there is China. For years, Apple has done most of its manufacturing in China, taking advantage of its low-cost, high-quality factories. More recently, China has become an important market. Apple's annual sales in China are now around \u00a337 billion, about a quarter of its total. Anything that gets in the way of making and exporting phones from China or selling them to the Chinese is going to be painful.</p><p>But as Trump ramps up his trade war with China, it is hard to see firms such as Apple escaping unscathed. Cook has been dashing between Washington and Beijing this year, building relationships and pleading with both governments.</p><p>Trump is reported to have assured Cook that iPhones assembled in China won't be among the $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on which he plans to raise tariffs. But depending on Trump's goodwill puts Apple on edge.</p><p>Every big tech firm faces a version of Apple's dilemma. Facebook is in hiding after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Google's leaders are allergic to publicity.

They love that he is doing what he promised during his campaign, tearing up trade agreements and clamping down on immigration. They love it when he stands in the middle of violent political crossfire over the separation of children and their parents arriving illegally from Mexico and says, as he did on Tuesday: \"You have to stand for something.\"</p><p>Steve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, said this week that Trump was a \"profile in courage\" for \"tripling down\" on his campaign vows.</p><p>Trump may have all the manners and sophistication of a monster truck but he is the Republicans' monster truck, fluorescent orange with 10-foot wheels, and they love him.</p><p>They can't get enough of stories such as one from the G7, where Trump, after reluctantly agreeing to sign the leaders' joint communiqu\u00e9, pulls a couple of Starbursts out of his pocket and throws one across the table to Angela Merkel, saying: \"Don't say I never give you anything.\" The whooping from the Rust Belt should have reached Berlin.</p><p>Traditional Republicans have become resigned to Trump's takeover of their party. As John Boehner, the former Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said: \"There is no . There's a Trump party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\" The faster the fur flies, the more secure Trump seems to be.</p><p>Trump's opponents once hoped that business leaders would stand up to him. But they have been compromised by the economic goodies, the tax breaks and deregulation, thrown their way by this administration.</p><p>No group has a harder time dealing with Trump than the leaders of . They live and work in one of the most culturally liberal corners of America. But they are capitalists red in tooth and claw. Many are richer than Trump but they hate his gaudy displays of wealth. Their companies may be headquartered in California but they are innately global, and many of their most talented employees are either immigrants or the children of immigrants.</p><p>They have spoken out against Trump's most extreme statements, his attacks on black athletes, for example, or his equivocation when neo-Nazis and anti-fascists fought last year in Charlottesville, Virginia. But they have usually waited until a consensus has formed.</p><p>This week they were at it again, joining in the condemnation of the administration's separation of families at the Mexican border. But it's no example of political courage when you sneak into the back row of an already giant chorus led by four former First Ladies.</p><p>\"As a father, a citizen and an immigrant myself, the stories coming from our border break my heart\"</p><p>UberCEO Dara Khosrowshahi</p><p>Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, said: \"It's heartbreaking to see the images and hear the sounds of the kids. Kids are the most vulnerable people in any society. I think what's happening is inhumane. It needs to stop.\" Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page that \"we need to stop this policy right now\" and encouraged donations to organisations helping immigrant families.</p><p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted: \"As a father, a citizen and an immigrant myself, the stories coming from our border break my heart. Families are the backbone of society. A policy that pulls them apart rather than building them up is immoral and just plain wrong.\" Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, used the hashtag #KeepFamiliesTogether.</p><p>Cook and Apple are in a particular bind. On tax, they couldn't be happier. Trump has lowered corporate rates and made it much easier for US companies to bring home the cash they were keeping overseas. What Trump expects in return is more investment in American jobs and Apple has promised to invest $30 billion in the US over the next five years and create 20,000 new jobs.</p><p>On social issues, the Apple boss and the President are miles apart. Since succeeding Steve Jobs in 2011, Cook has slowly found his voice, as an advocate for LGBT rights and for immigrants. He has consistently attacked the administration's clampdown on immigration and said last year that \"Apple would not exist without diversity\".</p><p>But then there is China. For years, Apple has done most of its manufacturing in China, taking advantage of its low-cost, high-quality factories. More recently, China has become an important market. Apple's annual sales in China are now around \u00a337 billion, about a quarter of its total. Anything that gets in the way of making and exporting phones from China or selling them to the Chinese is going to be painful.</p><p>But as Trump ramps up his trade war with China, it is hard to see firms such as Apple escaping unscathed. Cook has been dashing between Washington and Beijing this year, building relationships and pleading with both governments.</p><p>Trump is reported to have assured Cook that iPhones assembled in China won't be among the $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on which he plans to raise tariffs. But depending on Trump's goodwill puts Apple on edge.</p><p>Every big tech firm faces a version of Apple's dilemma. Facebook is in hiding after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Google's leaders are allergic to publicity. Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who also owns The Washington Post, refuses to respond to Trump's frequent taunts.</p><p>One technology leader who hasn't been cowed is Michael Bloomberg, who promised this week to spend $80 million helping Democrats gain the 23 seats they need to win back the House of Representatives. If he succeeds, the House could tie up Trump in impeachment proceedings for the rest of his term.

Republican/Conservative and Fair Media is shut out.</p><p> Illegal?\" he wrote.According to Trump, \"96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media.</p><p>\"Google strongly rejected any bias claims.\"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology,\" it said.</p><p>\"We continually work to improve Google search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"It was not immediately clear what, if any, measures Trump envisioned, but his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House that \"we're looking into it\" when asked about the claims on Google.</p><p>Last week, Trump tweeted that \"Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices\" and added \"we won't let that happen.\"- Free speech guarantees -The president's claims on Google appeared to be based on a report from the Trump-friendly news site PJ Media which relied on an analysis chart by conservative news host Sharyl Attkisson that categorized major news outlets such as the New York Times, CBS and CNN as \"left wing.</p><p>\"\"Google and others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good,\" Trump said.Google and other internet firms have long faced complaints about search results, which are based on algorithms that can take into account user browsing history, location and other factors.</p><p>But technology and media analysts say there is little evidence to suggest Google skews results for political reasons. And if they did, the president would have little recourse under the constitution's free speech protections.</p><p>\"Accusations of search engine 'bias' have existed as long as there have been search engines. Indeed, search engines are 'biased' in the sense that they privilege some information over others,\" said Eric Goldman, who heads Santa Clara University's High Tech Law Institute.</p><p>Goldman said that any government attempts to force search engines to display only good news would be a flagrant violation of the Constitution's First Amendment speech guarantees.\"Any effort by Trump to 'fix' search engine results will violate the First Amendment.</p><p> It's not even a close question,\" Goldman said.Democratic Representative Ted Lieu of California maintained that Trump's comments merely show he refuses to tolerate negative news coverage.</p><p>\"Instead of yet another @realDonaldTrump conspiracy theory, the simpler explanation is that when @POTUS behaves badly, such as by ripping kids from parents or disrespecting an American hero, most of the free press reports it,\" Lieu tweeted.- Pressure is 'worrisome' - Nuala O'Connor, president of the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology, said that while \"algorithmic bias\" is a legitimate question, there is no evidence of bias and that it would be worrisome if the government tried to step in with regulations.</p><p>\"It's deeply concerning that any government official would try to bring public pressure on a platform over news and information that is important to our democracy,\" O'Connor said.While there is little to suggest that internet firms actively suppress content for political reasons and many conservatives have large online followings, public perception is another matter.</p><p>A Pew Research Center survey released in June found 43 percent of Americans say major technology firms support the views of liberals over conservatives, and 72 percent say social media platforms actively censor opposing political views.Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 85 percent said social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints, according to Pew.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Republican/Conservative ...ir Media is shut out. Illegal?\" he wrote.According to Trump, \"96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media.\"Google strongly rejected any bias claims.\"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology,\" it said.\"We continually work to improve Google search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"It was not immediately clear what, if any, measures Trump envisioned, but his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House that \"we're looking into it\" when asked about the claims on Google.Last week, Trump tweeted that \"Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices\" and added \"we won't let that happen.\"- Free speech guarantees - The president's claims on Google appeared to be based on a report from the Trump-friendly news site PJ Media which relied on an analysis chart by conservative news host Sharyl Attkisson that categorized major news outlets such as the New York Times, CBS and CNN as \"left wing.\"\"Google ...hers are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good,\" Trump said.Google and other internet firms have long faced complaints about search results, which are based on algorithms that can take into account user browsing history, location and other factors.But technology and media analysts say there is little evidence to suggest Google skews results for political reasons. And if they did, the president would have little recourse under the constitution's free speech protections.\"Accusations of search engine 'bias' have existed as long as there have been search engines. Indeed, search engines are 'biased' in the sense that they privilege some information over others,\" said Eric Goldman, who heads Santa Clara University's High Tech Law Institute.Goldman said that any government attempts to force search engines to display only good news would be a flagrant violation of the Constitution's First Amendment speech guarantees.\"Any effort by Trump to 'fix' search engine results will violate the First Amendment. It's not even a close question,\" Goldman said.Democratic Representative Ted Lieu of California maintained that Trump's comments merely show he refuses to tolerate negative news coverage.\"Instead of yet another @realDonaldTrump conspiracy theory, the simpler explanation is that when @POTUS behaves badly, such as by ripping kids from parents or disrespecting an American hero, most of the free press reports it,\" Lieu tweeted.- Pressure is 'worrisome' -  Nuala O'Connor, president of the Washington-based Center for Democracy ...chnology, said that while \"algorithmic bias\" is a legitimate question, there is no evidence of bias and that it would be worrisome if the government tried to step in with regulations.\"It's deeply concerning that any government official would try to bring public pressure on a platform over news and information that is important to our democracy,\" O'Connor said.While there is little to suggest that internet firms actively suppress content for political reasons and many conservatives have large online followings, public perception is another matter.A Pew Research Center survey released in June found 43 percent of Americans say major technology firms support the views of liberals over conservatives, and 72 percent say social media platforms actively censor opposing political views.Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 85 percent said social media sites intentionally censor political viewpoints, according to Pew. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031535504915853251764100178</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4S-18B1-F03R-N15S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><timeReceived>1:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 29, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Lawsuits, exposes etc have done nothing to stop them. It's time. From all of us who have been disappeared, censored, scrubbed from @Google, thank you Mr. President. </p><p>Big-tech firms are now a threat to democracy and our very way of life. They are managed by Left-wing totalitarians who are using their immense power to suppress freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and are now engaging in massive voter suppression. If the mainstream was interested in preserving democracy (which they are certainly not) they would be investigating how big-tech firms such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter are destroying our freedoms. President Trump must take immediate action. Anti-Trust legislation is urgently needed. We have been banned, blacklisted and terminated for years --I filed suit in 2016[1] \u2014 challenging Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) under the First Amendment. 'Section 230 provides immunity from lawsuits to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, thereby permitting these social media giants to engage in government-sanctioned censorship and discriminatory business practices free from legal challenge.' For years I have documented the outrageous bias of Facebook's speech policies. Notoriously one-sided, those who oppose jihad terror, support Israel and stand against the most brutal and extreme ideology on the face of the earth (sharia) have been systematically blocked and banned. White House Prepares Executive Action on Big Tech Bias By Allum Bokhari[2], August 9, 2019: The White House is preparing executive action to tackle big tech bias against conservatives and non-progressives, according to a report[3] by Politico.President Donald Trump has focused increased attention on the issue of Silicon Valley bias and discrimination in recent months, as numerous leaks and testimony from big tech insiders has shone a light on anti-conservative sentiment in the tech industry. Via Politico[4]: The White House is circulating drafts of a proposed executive order that would address allegations of anti-conservative bias by social media companies, according to a White House official and two other people familiar with the matter \u2014 a month after President Donald Trump pledged to explore 'all regulatory and legislative solutions' on the issue. None of the three would describe the contents of the order, which one person cautioned has already taken many different forms and remains in flux. But its existence, and the deliberations surrounding it, are evidence that the administration is taking a serious look at wielding the federal government's power against Silicon Valley. 'If the internet is going to be presented as this egalitarian platform and most of Twitter is liberal cesspools of venom, then at least the president wants some fairness in the system,' the White House official said. 'But look, we also think that social media plays a vital role. They have a vital role and an increasing responsibility to the culture that has helped make them so profitable and so prominent.' The news comes just days after President Trump blasted Google CEO Sundar Pichai[5] for his alleged false promises of political neutrality. Recent leaks have exposed Silicon Valley's bias against conservatives. Breitbart News has exposed widespread search manipulation by Google and YouTube, including deliberate manipulation of search results for political topics like 'abortion'[6] and 'Federal Reserve'[7] at the behest of left-wing journalists. Breitbart News also published leaked video footage of Google executives expressing dismay at the election of President Trump, and promising to make his populist movement a 'blip' or 'hiccup' in history.[8] Other tech companies have also been exposed \u2014 Facebook has put political figures on a list of potential 'hate agents' for censorship[9], while Twitter employees have been caught by Project Veritas admitting to censorship[10] of accounts that express an interest in 'God, guns and America.'

Plus, U.S. President Donald Trump steps up his attacks against the man leading the Russia investigation.  Well, Republican lawmakers are warning him to back off.  And four explosions and still no suspects, police in Texas say they're hunting a serial bomber.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, thank you for being with us.  I'm John Vause.  And you are now watching the third hour of Newsroom L.A.  Facebook and the data company Cambridge Analytica are the center of a growing scandal that has enormous political and economic ramifications.  Personal information is Facebook's currency and there are accusations that it's not protecting user data from misuse, specifically during the 2016 Presidential campaign. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's raising deep concerns, both here in the U.S. as well as Britain.  Isa Suarez reports. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ISA SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I first met the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, nine days before the U.S. Presidential Election in 2016.  A man confident he can get inside the mind of American voters by predicting and then attempting to alter their behavior.  </p><p>ALEXANDER NIX, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA CEO:  I think the data is extremely robust and proven to be so time and again. </p><p>SUAREZ:  His data helped this man win, U.S. President Donald Trump who paid multi-million dollars for them to work their magic.  But behind their winning method is more than just data-crunching.  It's a massive data grab, so says their former contractor now turned whistleblower, Chris Wiley.  </p><p>CHRIS WILEY, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA FORMER EMPLOYEE:  We spent almost $1 million doing this.  It wasn't some tiny pilot project.  It was the core of what Cambridge Analytica became.  It allowed us to move in to the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before.   SUAREZ:  And this is what Wiley says they did, Cambridge Analytica received data from a third-party, a Professor Alexander Cogan based at the University of Cambridge, who was able to gather data on tens of millions of Americans through Facebook and then using a survey placed on Facebook.  They ask users to take a personality test. </p><p>The answers group people on the personality types.  They combined it with voter history, what they buy, where they shop, and what they watch on TV.  And that enabled them to predict the personality of every adult in the United States, and then target them with specific political ads.  But it goes further, by opting into these Facebook surveys.  Each user was actually giving not just their data but many of the Facebook friends. </p><p>WILEY:  It was a grossly, I have to call it experiment, because you're playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.  </p><p>SUAREZ:  Speaking to the U.K. Parliament Committee on data protection of fake news back in February, Cambridge Analytica denied they have violated Facebook's terms.  </p><p>NIX:  They worked with Facebook data.  We don't have Facebook data. We do use Facebook as a platform to advertise as do all brands, many and most agencies or all agencies I should say.  And we use Facebook as a means to gather data.</p><p>SUAREZ:  The attention now turns to Facebook and how it reportedly allowed a data breach on this scale.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT:  As I have said from the beginning...</p><p>SUAREZ:  And more importantly, how it was used to reach and influence voters ahead of the 2016 Presidential election.  In a statement, Facebook says it claimed that this is a data breach is completely false, and that those involved certify they had destroyed the data. Meanwhile, it says it's suspending the accounts of Chris Wiley, Cambridge Analytica, as well as Professor Alexander Cogan, who did not respond to our request for comment. </p><p>If anything, it has shined the light on the dark heart of political advertising.  Isa Suarez, CNN London. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  Facebook has hired independent forensic (inaudible) to help out in their investigation.  So for more on this, joining us now CNN's Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong, and in Oakland, California, Jacob Ward, a fellow of the Center for the Advanced Study of Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.  Jacob, let's start with you.  </p><p>The shock and anger that Cambridge Analytica would plunder the accumulated data of millions of Facebook users for political purposes, why, I do not know.  The shock and anger that Facebook allowed this to happen, again, why, I do not know.  But here is an old clip from Onion TV.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  After years of secretly monitoring the public, we were astounded.  So many people would willingly publicize where they live, their religious and political views, an alphabetized list of all their friends, personal email addresses, phone numbers, hundreds of photos of themselves, </p><p>[02:05:00] - and even status updates about what they were doing moment to moment.  It is truly a dream come true for the CIA.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  It's funny because it's true.  This is the end result is involuntarily giving all of your private information.  </p><p>JACOB WARD, POPULAR SCIENCE, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  That's absolutely correct.  John, we're living -- certainly Cambridge Analytica is sort of a cartoonish bad guy in this in the story.  But the amazing this is that it is happening because that's exactly what Facebook is built for.  Certainly, Cambridge Analytica used it in a way that it didn't give the company permission to use but used it exactly as Facebook is intended to, to micro target people. </p><p>It's what Facebook is for as a business, and when you put that also in the context, as that Onion clip points out of us living in a world in which people are inviting companies to listen in on our conversations in our living rooms.  Not only that, we're paying money to companies to put listing devices in our living rooms, to hand over pictures of our children that is being fed through facial recognition, algorithms. </p><p>The incredible range of things that we volunteer on a daily basis to these companies, frankly, I'm sort of glad that Cambridge Analytica is such a cartoonish bad guy so that people can sort of wake up, look around, and go oh, this isn't just about this sort of cute baby pictures I get from my neighbors.  This is about the future of truth and democracy and free exchange of information. </p><p>That feels like maybe a positive, a silver lining to an otherwise pretty scary story. </p><p>VAUSE:  By sort of you know ripping the lid of all of this.  It has cost Facebook.  And Andrew, to you, Facebook had a pretty big fall in its share price on Monday.  It bought the market down with it.  But that wasn't an effect from the big sell-off on Wall Street but it was the biggest. </p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly was biggest, John, the biggest fall of face for the employee is 36 billion wiped off their value.  And it wasn't just Facebook.  It was the FAANGs, which is an acronym for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.  These are the big companies and they are all being hit, Facebook more than the others by all of the same reason, and that is this alleged breach of security on personal data.  What is that going to mean for the reaction by governments, how do they crackdown on these big, big tech to ensure the security, the privacy of personal data, which could come at a cost because if you think about it, that personal data is at the very core of these companies, advertising strategies.  That's where they their make money, in advertising. </p><p>So if that gets crimped a toll or significantly, certainly that is going to hit the bottom line for these companies and that is why things big soft.  </p><p>VAUSE:  And back to you, Jacob, because you know what Andrew was saying, the one who concerns for investors is actually the reverse for anyone who uses Facebook, you know for the company's and the social media companies.  There is a financial disincentive to give users more control over their own data, people will share less.  Facebook and other social networks, they'd make less money. </p><p>WARD:  That's absolutely correct.  I mean you know for Facebook to now turn and say, oh OK, we're going to be safeguarding regional clear and open communication between people, that we're going to encourage the rise of more positive news or more truthful news.  All of that runs against their business model, which we should all remember is simply keeping you on Facebook. </p><p>The more time you spend on Facebook, the more money they make.  And anything that gets in the way of that cuts into to their bottom line. And so on the one hand, I like to believe that a company like this would sort of take it seriously, that they are the number one medium of choice for more than a third of the planet.  I'd also like to point out that you know this isn't really a lot of money to be made in safeguarding democracy. </p><p>The way they make money is by keeping us on Facebook and they'll do anything to do that.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Andrew, just very quickly.  What sort of regulations lawmakers in Europe and the United States looking at or oversight or whatever. What can they do here? </p><p>STEVENS:  Well, at this state, they're investigating.  That's all they're saying.  They're investigating exactly.  Remember, they still report, John, so they are being investigated by some both sides of the Atlantic as to whether Facebook -- could this happened and what Facebook's culpability was and then they will take action. </p><p>But just to give you a sense of the European parliament is saying because this looks like a very clear breach of citizens' privacy, very, very clear breach.  And in Europe that is a very big deal.  So they are likely to clamp down hard on this.  Too early to say exactly what they would or would not do, but certainly there will be action.  </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  Jacob, we'll finish up with you because over the weekend, Cambridge Analytica hit Twitters and put a fairly robust defense of its reputation.  One point it made was this.  Advertising is not coercive.  People are smarter than that, really?  People are smarter than that? </p><p>WARD:  It drives me crazy.  That, of all the things that they put up publicly made me the angriest.  We are working.  I'm in the middle right now of a two-year documentary project, </p><p>[02:10:00] -- in which we have talked to Nobel prize-winning psychologists like Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel prize-winning economist Richard Thaler.  All of these people, dozens of them will tell you that that is total nonsense, that the human mind has a system by which it makes decisions.  They call thuristics, the short cuts by which you and I make decisions.  And those shortcuts it turns out are incredibly systematic across all cultures, even pre-modern cultures.  We make the same decisions the same ways. </p><p>Think of it as a programming language.  And so for all its talk about safeguarding democracy, Facebook and the rest of them are in the business of learning the programming language by which you and I make decisions so that they can help to influence them.  And so don't you know to say that advertising is not coercive, frankly, I don't think coercive is a strong enough word for the power that these companies are about to hold over us.</p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  Jacob, we are all out of time, but thank you so much. And also, Andrew, in Hong Kong, I appreciate you being with us.</p><p>All reporters from the U.K.'s ITNChannel 4 News met with Cambridge Analytica executives over a period of months.  They posed as potential clients who are interested in influencing the outcome of elections in Sri Lanka.  They used a hidden camera to record CEO Alexander Nix discussing ways to hypothetically in track a candidate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- thinking that you can do to make sure that the people know the true identity and secrets of these people. </p><p>NIX:  (inaudible) Well, someone new to us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  So you won't use a Sri-Lankan person.  </p><p>NIX:  No.  We'll have a wealthy developer come in posing as a wealthy developer.  I'm a master of disguise. Yes, they will offer a large amount of money to candidates, to finance the campaign in exchange for land, for instance.  We'll have the whole thing recorded on camera. We'll black out the face of our guy and then post it on the internet </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So on Facebook or YouTube or something like this. </p><p>NIX:  Send some girls to the candidate's house.  We have lots of history of things. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For example, you are saying you are using the girls to introduce to the local fellow and you're using the girls for seduction.  They're not local girls. </p><p>NIX:  -- on holiday with us, you know.  You know what I'm saying.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They are very beautiful Ukrainian girls. </p><p>NIX:  They are very beautiful.  I find that works very well. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, in another instance, they met with Managing Director Mark Turnbull who discussed playing on voters fear to sway an election. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK TURNBULL, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA MANAGING DIRECTOR:  The two fundamental human drivers when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious.  You didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked a reaction from you. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right, right. </p><p>TURNBULL:  And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really deep seated, underlying fears, concerns.  It's no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  In a statement to CNN, Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations made in Channel 4's reporting.  It says the report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of the conversations that took place.  They say that their executives entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios.  CEO Alexander Nix said he is aware of how this looks but it is simply not the case. </p><p>When the reporter posing as a prospective client turned the conversation to entrapment and corruption, the executive left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again, according to the statement.  And Nix added I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment bribes, also called Honey Traps, and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose. </p><p>I didn't recognize where the perspective client was taping our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.  Could have, should have, OK.  U.S. President Donald Trump turns up the heat on the special counsel in the Russia investigation.  When we come back, one source is saying he set off the President's tweet storm against Robert Mueller.  </p><p>[02:15:00] Also, the Saudi Crown Prince comes to call the White House. And that's what he is unlikely to get any respect over Saudi's brutal military offensive in Yemen.  We'll explain why late in the hour. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, Donald Trump, he's back on the attack against the Russia investigation and he's targeting the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. On Monday he tweeted it's a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest.  The President lashed out on Mueller by name over the weekend, arguing his team is politically biased.  </p><p>Republicans in Congress warning the President to back-off his attacks on Mueller, but there is not much support, at least one Republican's legislation, which would prevent the President from firing the Special Counsel.  Well, for more on this, joining me now is California Talk Radio Host, Ethan Bearman and Republican Strategist, Chris Faulkner. Good to see you, guys, thank you for coming in. </p><p>OK, so we got an increasing number of these Republican lawmakers who are telling the President in no uncertain terms just simply to lay off.  Let's listen to a couple. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How would Republicans react if you fired Mueller?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That would be the stupidest thing the President could do is fire him.  Yeah, he could do that but he's not going to do that.  And he shouldn't do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  You know Chris, over the weekend, Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump was to fire Mueller, it would be the beginning of his end of Presidency.  There has been a lot of talk.  But essentially, they're doing nothing to protect this Special Counsel.  There is legislation, which is long hold before Congress to protect Mueller and they say it's not needed. </p><p>CHRIS FAULKNER, SENIOR NATIONAL STRATEGIST:  If you look at just the basic self interest, most people can agree it's a bipartisan issue the most elected officials have.  If the Republicans in Congress actually fought, the President was going to jeopardize the majority in the House and the Senate by firing Mueller, it would pass legislation tomorrow.  They don't believe so therefore, there is no need to pass a law if there is not a need to do something. </p><p>VAUSE:  One piece to the idea that he started on it before...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER:  It's a fundamental Republican principle about it. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VAUSE:  I get it.  Every politician you know is out for themselves. That's agreed on.  But what is the indication that the President has no interest in firing Robert Mueller?  I mean every indication that it's to the contrary, it seems. </p><p>FAULKNER:  Every indication other than he hasn't done it.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Yet.  FAULKNER:  Right.  Yes, you can say yet about almost everything the President has said.  He hasn't done it yet.  If he was going to fire Mueller, he already would have done it.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Ethan. </p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, CALIFORNIA TALK RADIO HOST:  Wow.  So a couple things here, first off, President Trump just last year said he would sit down and testify with Robert Mueller.  He said he would do that in the beginning of January.  Thank you.  And he has not done that and then he goes on the attack.  This is an effort to undermine the Mueller investigation.  So when something comes out, he can say this whole thing is bias. </p><p>The whole thing is terrible.  None of it sticks.  None of it matters. That's what's going on here.  The Republicans for shame that really it's up to Rob Rosenstein to fire Robert Mueller and whether he's saying he's not going to do that under the current circumstances.  </p><p>VAUSE:  So we have a lot of leaks and a lot of friendly fire. </p><p>BEARMAN:  Yeah, right the Saturday Night Massacre that happened.  </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So after -- what was it eight days ago, I think the President tweeted that there would be no changes to his legal team. He is very happy with the team that was in place.  There has been a new lawyer added to the President's personal legal team, a new attorney who seems to audition for the role by appearing on Fox News. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton, and if she didn't win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime.  Everything that we have seen from these texts, and from all the facts developing shows that the FBI and senior DOJ officials conspired to violate the law and to deny Donald Trump's his civil rights. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So the general will probably play the role of pitbull. He won't take the lead but he will be the attack guy.  So I guess, Chris that means there is next to no chance the President might be laying off Robert Mueller.  </p><p>FAULKNER:  The President is putting together his personal legal events team.  Of course, he's going to have somebody who is aggressive personally defending him.  Anybody should be surprised by that.  If you're a high profile individual, then you can afford to have a high profile legal defense team, you're going to hire someone who is going to aggressively pursue your case and aggressively make sure that you have the best possible defense team you should get. </p><p>VAUSE:  Ethan, aggressively defending is one thing, trading in conspiracy theories I guess is... BEARMAN:  I don't understand what happened to the Republican Party, that suddenly it has become the home of conspiracy theories. Everybody is out to get him.  Everything is dangerous.  Everything -- Hillary Clinton -- everything is undermining democracy around the world.  Where is this coming from?  But interestingly enough, that is a page where he was just doing right on the book of Roy Cohn, which you know that's the trainer of Donald Trump originally.</p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So where is this coming from?  Well, part of a -- a reporting from the Washington Post which may explain why the President believes that the Mueller investigation is a partisan witch hunt. Trump is not consulting with top advisers, including Chief of Staff John Kelly and Chief White House lawyer, Don McGahn on his Russian legal choices or his comments about the probe. </p><p>According to one person with knowledge of his actions, its better with anonymity, blah, blah, blah.  </p><p>[02:22:14]  He has been said watching television and calling friends. Chris, if watching television -- this report means you know you're watching Fox News.  Of course, he thinks it's a witch hunt ordered by President Hillary Clinton, overseen by the U.N. National Government.  </p><p>FAULKNER:  Yeah, we can get to speculate on what the President watches or doesn't watch.  Clearly, someone is going to go and link this information and put it in the worst possible light because there is a continuing narrative that we're also to promote in the media the President is this doofus who sits around watching the news all day. </p><p>VAUSE:  No one said doofus.  </p><p>FAULKNER:  The inference is clearly there.  It continues to be a pattern that everyone wants say well, the President's doing this because he's watching TV and throwing things at the television like he's Archie Bunker or something like that.  Clearly, it's not the case. </p><p>VAUSE:  But this is sort of the bubble in which the President chooses to live.  You know he goes from the campaign rally.  He very rarely leaves the White House.  That kind of stuff -- you know he watches Fox News...</p><p>FAULKNER:  Most Presidents' don't leave the White House. </p><p>VAUSE:  But at least they read the PDB and they listen to their advisers and they get outside advice.  I mean this is a President who chooses what he watches and what he reads very carefully.  </p><p>BEARMAN:  Yeah, and it's all a reality game show for him as well.  If I'm going to pit one side against the other and see who wins the battle of the wit.  It's a Survivor/Apprentice happening in the White House.  And he's doing that with his legal team now too, is what this is evidence of.  It's a level of instability that we have never seen in our lifetimes coming out of Washington D.C.  And it is a very dangerous precedent.   By the way, and what's going to happen next when Mueller asks to sit down with President Trump, what is this -- this is going to be something that's battled all the way to the Supreme Court and is going done in the ugliest way possible to further divide America.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Well, we have a bit of an idea of what the Mueller team will be asking or they lied to us, the President because there has been a face-to-face meeting, another one between lawyers for Trump and the Special Counsel to talk about topics part of our reporting.  Mueller's team added granularity to the topics which will be discussed with the defense team months ago. </p><p>Excuse me.  But the firing of FBI Director James Comey, according to all of our sources, this time around for instance the prosecutor said they would ask about Attorney General Jeff Sessions' involvement in the Comey dismissal and what Trump knew about National Security Advisor Michael Flint's phone calls with then Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in late December 2016.  </p><p>Again, Chris if everything is above board -- basic question why do you have such a cranky Commander In Chief and this all seems to indicate that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up by Thanksgiving. It's not wrapping up by Christmas.  It's not wrapping up by Easter. It's not wrapping up for a while.</p><p>FAULKNER:  I think most Americans, myself included, we really want give Bob Mueller the benefit of the doubt.  Long, long career in public service, as a public servant is, no indication to think that he would somehow be a bad actor in this or overly partisan.  But again, you just literally read from leaked testimony, leaked documents.  </p><p>This special counsel, the special investigative process has been a nonstop leak fest of things the President supposedly said or didn't say, and at some point, they're eroding their own credibility to cripple the investigation if they continue to leak things to the press and continue to involve attorneys that are clearly partisan hacks for the Democratic Party.  </p><p>Fortunately, Andrew McCabe is now no longer involved.  And hopefully we won't see anymore of that.  But this continual process of leaking and separation and constant talk about things that are supposed to be in confidence in terms of the discussion of the President's attorneys is undermining their credibility to do their job.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Yeah.  Although, Ethan, you know a lot of leaks have turned out to be true.  </p><p>BEARMAN:  Yeah they have.  And by the way who else complained the loudest about leaks was President Richard Nixon, if I recall.  And so this is typically -- there is a lot of smoke happening here.  There clearly are things that they're worried about being guilty of. President Trump by the way, the one thing that I will give his legal team at all is that they're trying to protect him to stop them from actually talking to Robert Moeller, because as we now know the President in his own words just makes things up when he talks to world leaders so he will probably do the same with Robert Mueller.  VAUSE:  He has an interesting relationship with the truth at times, Chris and Ethan, good to see you both. </p><p>FAULKNER:  You as well.</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, it's been almost a year since President Trump posed for this unforgettable picture in Saudi Arabia.  Just ahead, we'll see if the eight ball's prediction is coming true, as the Saudi Crown Prince visits the White House. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Thanks for staying with us.  You're watching CNN Newsroom live from Los Angeles.  I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour. Facebook has hired independent forensic auditors to investigate how the data firm Cambridge Analytica used personal information in the 2016 President election.  Facebook is under fire for not protecting its user's data. </p><p>U.S. and European lawmakers are calling for hearings and possible new regulations.  In a major step forward, the U.K. has reached a joint draft agreement with the European Union on the legal terms of Brexit. It allows Britain to make trade deals using 20 month transition after leaving the E.U. next March, but Ireland's borders with Northern Ireland, still one issue that could unravel the agreement.  </p><p>The lawyers of Donald Trump are discussing specific topics for a potential interview with the Special Counsel in the Russia investigation.  Sources say the two sides met face to face for the first time last week.  On Monday, the U.S. President once again called the investigation a witch hunt.  The defected leader of Saudi Arabia will meet with the U.S. President in Washington in the coming hours. </p><p>Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman already has a close relationship with Donald Trump.  He made the unusual choice of Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip as President, a trip which will forever be remembered for this one image.  </p><p>[02:30:00]</p><p>Egypt's President, the Saudi King and Mr. Trump, all three placing hands on a glowing orb.  Their faces lift with evil sorcerer on effect.  One issue which many aid groups and human rights activist hope would be high on the agenda is the Kingdom's war in Yemen which U.N. says has triggered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Over the weekend, the Crown Prince defended the three-year long military offensive during a rare television interview with \"60 MINUTES\" on CBS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA (through translator):  The Iranian ideology penetrated some parts of Yemen. During that time, this militia was conducting military maneuvers right next to our borders and positioning missiles at our borders.  It is truly very painful, and I hope that this militia seizes using the humanitarian situation to their advantage in order to draw sympathy from the international community.  They block humanitarian aid in order to create famine and humanitarian crisis.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  Kimberly Dozier is CNN's Global Affairs Analyst.  She joins us now from Washington.  Kimberly, thank you for being with us.</p><p>KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Good to be here.</p><p>VAUSE:  I guess the activists can hope what they want for some pushback from the White House when it comes to Yemen, but that's unlikely to happen especially when we just heard from the Crown Prince that he's framing this war as part of this wider conflict with Iran.</p><p>DOZIER:  Well, we got a little bit of a preview today with a briefing from a senior administration official from the Trump White House, explaining that they frequently ask the Saudis to keep humanitarian roots open, that they do ask them to be careful with airstrikes.  But U.S. Military officials are a little bit defensive, they say, we're providing them intelligence, we are providing them with refueling, but we don't watch where every single day jet drops its ordinates.  That is for the Saudis to police, and we're helping them, but it's basically up to them.  The Saudis for their part are very defensive about this, they insist that they follow regular U.S. military procedure and they're targeting that they do have investigations when something goes awry, and that they do publish the results of those investigations.</p><p>One of the biggest problems for us as journalists is it's really hard to get in to Yemen to test these assertions.  So, you are left with taking their word for it versus the humanitarian groups versus the combatants on the ground, and that's pretty unsatisfying when you're trying to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes, you mentioned how the U.S. military says it's providing the Saudis with intelligence but the U.S. is also providing the Saudis with a lot of the weapons they're using in this military conflict. And that's bringing some concern among U.S. lawmakers.  Listen to the Republican Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  So, we supply the Saudis with arms, they create havoc in refugees in Yemen, then what's the answer?  I think we are elevating an arms race in the Middle East, and I don't think it's good for America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  Yes, in the bigger context here, though, is it important for the Saudis to have Congress on the side or is this simply about the relationship with the President?</p><p>DOZIER:  Well, they are going to work on it.  There are meetings scheduled, I understand, between the Crown Prince and some lawmakers, but pretty much, he needs to keep the U.S. President on the side, and they've already met several times.  They have a good relationship. And also, the Pentagon is pushing back against this move in the Senate, a resolution that's being considered to limit U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia for the Yemen conflict.  So, I think on Capitol Hill, they're going to make a lot of noise, but I don't see them picking up enough support to actually block U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia for this purpose.</p><p>VAUSE:  That's an interesting point because protests are expected when the Crown Prince arrives at the White House.  One of the organizers told the Financial Times, this is a very extensive propaganda campaign to portray Prince Mohammad as a reformer while he is really a heavy- handed bully who's responsible for bombing and starving Yemenis, gunning for a war with Iran and who has pulled off one of the most spectacular power grabs in history.  That may be overstating it a little bit because to be fair, he is slowly pulling the kingdom out of the dark ages, but is that all being overshadowed, you know, by the situation in Yemen by the power grab, by you know, stashing his mother away from his father so he can continue to consolidate his power?</p><p>DOZIER:  Well, I have to say in the United States, mostly they're focusing on the latest drama about the Mueller investigation.  It's very hard to get a look in on this kind of issue.  The Yemeni war is something that just doesn't much reach the American consciousness. So, as tragic and horrible as it is, without U.S. troops on the ground, it doesn't get that much attention.</p><p>[02:35:05] And that is part of the secret of this relationship, the secret of success for Donald Trump, is Saudi Arabia is waging a war in a place that houses Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, one of the deadliest terrorist groups that was taking a lot of U.S. Special Operations and intelligence bandwidth to fight.  Now, U.S. Intelligence Special Operations are still helping but it's mostly Saudi and UAE jets and troops that are fighting them on the ground. And that means Trump doesn't have to deal with as much of attention to it or focus on it from the American public back home.  And for that, they're very grateful to Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>That's one of the things that has cemented this relationship.  And I think you're going to see it in the coming days, possibly some new announcements in terms of trade deals.  You can even see that Saudi Arabia is pushing hard for some exceptions to getting new nuclear power.  It wants to be able to enrich Uranium which usually, if you're a third-party country asking the United States to build a nuclear power plants on your soil, you don't get to also enrich Uranium. Saudi Arabia is pushing for those kind of exceptions.  And there are some officials I've spoken to who are worried that they might get their way.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes, because of the Crown Prince famously answered the question that if the Iranians had nuclear as in military capability then they would want it as well.  Kimberly, thank you, good to see you.</p><p>DOZIER:  Thank you. VAUSE:  Well, speaking of attacks, you know, Texas City takes an even more frightening turn.  Police detect a serial bomber is to blame and they worry attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  (INAUDIBLE) to CNN.  The world's last male northern white rhino has died.  Sudan was 45 years old, he was euthanized at a conservation park in Kenya after battling infections and health issues because of all they ate.  Last year, the Park put Sudan on a dating app Cinder to try and awareness about his plight, also racing money for speeches from going extinct.  Now Sudan left two female northern white rhinos but they were unable to breed.</p><p>Uber has taken its self-driving cars off the roads after what's believed to be the first death involving a driverless car.  Police in Tempe, Arizona said an autonomous SUV start to kill a woman as she walks her bicycle across the street.  The vehicle was traveling about five miles over the speed limit and had a back-up driver behind the wheel.  Uber says it will cooperate with the investigation.  The county attorney's office will determine whether charges will be filed.</p><p>And police in Austin, Texas are confirming what many there have feared.  A suspected serial bomber is on the loose.</p><p>[02:40:01] In the past two weeks, four bombs have exploded killing two people and ruling for others.  Brian Todd reports the latest explosion just this past Sunday, make use of a complicated system involving a trip wire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Austin is a city on edge as police say they are now on the hunt for what they believe is a serial bomber. The latest blast happened Sunday night injuring two men who set off a hidden trip wire triggering an explosion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We got trip wires there in the grass.</p><p>TODD:  Investigators say they see similarities in all four bombs that have exploded in the city since March 2nd.  But following Sunday's intent, they now see something even more chilling.</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN TEXAS POLICE CHIEF:  The belief that we are now dealing with someone who is using trip wires shows a higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill.</p><p>TODD:  Unlike the previous bombs which were stuff inside packages apparently placed by the bomber at the homes of people of color.  Two African-American men were killed and a Hispanic woman was injured. But police and the FBI say the trip wire bomb on Sunday night did not appear to target anyone specific.  It was hidden near a fence in a predominantly White neighborhood and the two people injured are both white men.  Still police are not ruling out the possibility that the previous bombings could have been hate crimes.  A former FBI profiler says the trip wire bomb might have been an attempt to throw investigators off the trail.</p><p>MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER FBI PROFILER:  Previous victims may have been targeted and now he wants to put time and distance between the targeted victims and make it appear that he's out just to randomly victimize anyone.  So it could be a game-playing technique on the bomber's part.  </p><p>TODD:  No matter the motive, investigators say their most urgent concern now is the bomber's change in tactics because the bomb Sunday night was not easily noticed.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER COMBS, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, FBI'S SAN ANTONIO DIVISION:  We're very concerned that with trip wires a child could be walking down the sidewalk and hit something.</p><p>TODD:  Police warned residents using a reverse 911 call system and a school near the site of the bombing was temporarily shut down. According to Mary Ellen O'Toole who profiled the unabomber for the FBI.  The fear of random terror in Austin is exactly what the killer wants.  She says she thinks the bomber's most likely a man who is arrogant and reveling in a sense of power.</p><p>O'TOOLE:  This is someone that appear to be having enjoying -- some kind -- type of enjoyment over what he is doing holding the City of Austin in a fixated state of fear.  They're scared, they're upset.</p><p>TODD:  Police are now appealing for help from the killer himself.</p><p>MANLEY:  We ask him to contact us and give him phone numbers to contact us at.  And again, we won't understand what the motive might be behind this or the reason behind this until we have an opportunity to talk to the suspect or suspects that are involved. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>TODD:  Police and FBI officials in Austin meanwhile are appealing for the public's help saying they need anyone with surveillance video, other video or images of any suspicious activity to come forward. Police say they have persons of interest in this case but so far no suspects.  Brian Todd, CNN Washington.</p><p>VAUSE:  Thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause.  Please stay with us.  \"WORLD SPORT\" starts after a short break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:45:02] KATE RILEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ANCHOR:  Welcome along to WORLD SPORT.  I'm Kate Riley, at CNN Center.</p><p>The countdown to The Masters is now officially on.  We are just a few weeks away now until the opening of men's major of the year.  Just he will walk away with that infamous green jacket, Sergio Garcia will be defending his crown after winning last year on the four-time Masters Champion.  Tiger Woods will be back making his first appearance since 2015.  And recently, Tiger fans has been getting rather excited of the America was tied to second at the Valspar Championship.  And then, at the weekend, the former world number one was once a stroke of the leader at once say.  He shoot the Arnold Palmer Invitational, (INAUDIBLE) the Northern Irish Rory McIlroy.</p><p>He will heads into Augusta as a (INAUDIBLE) favorite to win it.  This time around, well, speaking of which, let see how he won't say as the winner this weekend at Bay Hill in Florida.  It's actually, his first PGA Tour title since September 2016.  Well, Sunday, saw him -- his at final round of 64 and ever hold the overnight leader Henrik Stenson, a huge final par from the 18th.</p><p>How make him the new favorite to win The Masters next month?  And afterwards, he said, he never actually given up hope after (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RORY MCILROY, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: I always believe in myself and I know that me being 100 percent healthy is good enough to not just win on the PGA Tour but win a lot.  And I guess that's what can't be going -- you know, I wanted to get back to 100 percent fitness which I have. And that allows me to practice as much as I want.  Go about my business, do everything that I need to do to feel 100 percent prepared to play golf tournaments.</p><p>So, I never lost belief.  I mean, I know that I've -- I know that I've got to get for this game and I know that if I put that the time and I can -- I can make a lot of it, and I guess that's what's get me going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RILEY:  Yes, great stuff from McIlroy, there.  But what about Tiger Woods?  How good is he looking ahead of The Masters?  Well, have to multiple back surgery.  He is back, as expands he'd missed seeing the side of him wearing red on Sunday.</p><p>In the last few weeks, he finished 12 Honda Classic, tied for 2nd at the Valspar championship, as I mentioned earlier.  And then, he was tied for 5th at Bay Hill on Sunday.  Earlier, CNN's Don Riddell spoke with the leading sports physical therapist.  He started by asking him, \"What concerns him about Tiger, considering the spinal fusion surgery? What the goal for underwent?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DALE YAKE, FOUNDER, PHYSICAL THERAPY SOLUTIONS:  When his on the uneven lives, maybe hitting up against the leap in a -- in a sand trap, or in the trees.  He hit the tree last week, in the roots.  It's those things that I worried about that probably, maybe lead to a little tweak, and that little tweak leads to more pain.  So, we've got to manage, I mean, I know, Steve's done a great job for doing that up to this point. DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR:  He has been in contention of the last couple of weeks.  There is an awful of an excitement of the ranking going into The Masters coming up in April.</p><p>YAKE:  Yes.</p><p>RIDDELL:  If he wins that if he just wins any event on a PGA Tour. Where would that ranking the -- in the pantheon of great sporting comebacks from such desperate serve physical dilemmas?</p><p>YAKE:  Don, I cannot think of anyone that maybe withdraw a parallel to this.  There's been a -- athletes overcome a lot of things.  The only one that I can think of this, if Ryan chase here from the Pittsburg Steelers, and NFL comes back from his spot to entry to play football again.  May rank up there where Tiger was playing golf again at this level.  But I can't take of an individual that's contributed to a sport, and the craziness and the following is just -- it's amazing this year it all happened.  I didn't take it and I didn't expect it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RILEY:  Coming up on the show, they say, three is the magic number. But superstar strikers across the globe sort of they're be differently this weekend.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02 51:23] RILEY:  Welcome back.  They say, things come in three, but to some of the world's best football players, they ignored that old cliche.  In fact, of the scoring (INAUDIBLE) for that team this weekend, they went on and scored have both as four goals.  So, where exactly are we talking about?</p><p>Well, for starter, Christiano Ronaldo, has now scored 50th hat-tricks. And our friends, at least, report put together this bit of fun, his closest routing with Susan Air Force. And on Sunday, on the pitch, Real Madrid, this around a four -- six to really impact in La Liga. Sea of seven, getting four goals in that one, Real new got for third in this table just four points behind across seat revival.  Now, Isco, the striker has now got 17 goals on 8 games.  So, take above for that one.</p><p>Get them masterpiece something in the air this weekend, Ronaldo wasn't the only one to score for honor.  Mauro Icardi also netted four for Inter Milan in Syria before the game.  It was worth on noting, he have a four for three months.  But one of this charges, they couldn't stop in kitty.  He drove at hat-trick in by 14 minutes.  That's not of the only milestone, though.  He found for 100 times in Syria, as well.</p><p>OK, we're not done there either.  What about the major talking point from Liverpool's game on Saturday?  The Reds at rushing Watford's in the English Premier League, and the match belongs to the Egyptian international, Mohamed Salah, by scoring four goals, he got his first hat-trick in Liverpool shots.  That's now 36 goals to his name and becomes the highest goal scorer for a Red's play in their first season and until.  He is the leading scorer right now in the EPL, and we just can't wait to see how he does at the World Cup this summer for Egypt.</p><p>So, it was a pretty special weekend for goal scorers but it wasn't just limited to Europe.  Getting much less attention is the Chinese wing up Wu Lei, he scored four in Shanghai SIPG's win against Guangzhou R &amp; F in the timing symphony.  And they needed him as well, Shanghai were too down, until their all-time goal scorer found the right gear on five ever made 12-minute hat-trick.</p><p>You may recognize some of the supporting characters here, the former Chelsea midfielder, Oscar.  He also set up his first two goals, and another Brazilian Star hawk made the last one.  The result was more important to Shanghai, they maintain a perfect start for the new season, three wins from three games.</p><p>Staying with football now in a touching story for you.  The serial club, Fiorentina have continue to pay tribute to their former captain, Davide Astori.  The club is now renaming their training ground after defender, the Italian international died earlier this month before his team were due to play Udinese.  A first motif found he died from cardiac arrest.  A few weeks ago is a mark of respect, the club also retired Astori's number 13 shirt.</p><p>The world of tennis is about, listen, as it were when Naomi Osaka won her first ever WTA Tour title.  Winning at Indian Wells this weekend. The Japanese star in the making beat the Russian, Daria Kasatkina, in straight sets.  For both of them, it will be a final that will be remembered forever.  It was their first top three final for the pair.</p><p>Believe it or not, Osaka was actually on seated in this tournament, but those familiar with the sport.  Who knows she has a great ball striking ability and she definitely show their own route to the title. She thorough two former world number one, Maria Sharapova and Karolina Pliskova, as one of the current number one, Simona Halep.  A fighting time for rest of the youngster that's for sure.</p><p>Well, Osaka is a mix of culture, born in Japan to a Haitian father and a Japanese mother.  She then moved to Florida when she was just three years old.  She plays on the Japanese flag but cannot speak the language.  But his head tennis is doing all the talking right now and take good carry her a very long way indeed.</p><p>Elsewhere, and we got to see another side of Roger Federer, side that we already seen.  The Swiss caught unusually angry during the men's final Indian Wells.  And there's Juan Martin del Potro, and it's so rare to see him allege the umpire in this manner.  Well, in the end, we saw him lose and that was his first defeat for him.  It seems that it ended his match doing a shrink of 17.  In fact, that was actually the best start with (INAUDIBLE) he has ever has.</p><p>All right, that's it from us before we go, Juan Martin del Potro, bravely came back from several wrist injury.

Plus, U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>steps up his attacks against the man leading the Russia investigation. Well, Republican lawmakers are warning him to back off. And four explosions and still no suspects, police in Texas say they're hunting a serial bomber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, thank you for being with us. I'm John Vause. And you are now watching the third hour of Newsroom L.A. Facebookand the data company Cambridge Analytica are the center of a growing scandal that has enormous political and economic ramifications. Personal information is Facebook's currency and there are accusations that it's not protecting user data from misuse, specifically during the 2016 Presidential campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's raising deep concerns, both here in the U.S. as well as Britain. Isa Suarez reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ISA SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I first met the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, nine days before the U.S. Presidential Election in 2016. A man confident he can get inside the mind of American voters by predicting and then attempting to alter their behavior.</p><p>ALEXANDER NIX, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA CEO: I think the data is extremely robust and proven to be so time and again.</p><p>SUAREZ: His data helped this man win, U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>who paid multi-million dollars for them to work their magic. But behind their winning method is more than just data-crunching. It's a massive data grab, so says their former contractor now turned whistleblower, Chris Wiley.</p><p>CHRIS WILEY, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA FORMER EMPLOYEE: We spent almost $1 million doing this. It wasn't some tiny pilot project. It was the core of what Cambridge Analytica became. It allowed us to move in to the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that had never been done before. SUAREZ: And this is what Wiley says they did, Cambridge Analytica received data from a third-party, a Professor Alexander Cogan based at the University of Cambridge, who was able to gather data on tens of millions of Americans through Facebookand then using a survey placed on Facebook. They ask users to take a personality test.</p><p>The answers group people on the personality types. They combined it with voter history, what they buy, where they shop, and what they watch on TV. And that enabled them to predict the personality of every adult in the United States, and then target them with specific political ads. But it goes further, by opting into these Facebooksurveys. Each user was actually giving not just their data but many of the Facebookfriends.</p><p>WILEY: It was a grossly, I have to call it experiment, because you're playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.</p><p>SUAREZ: Speaking to the U.K. Parliament Committee on data protection of fake news back in February, Cambridge Analytica denied they have violated Facebook's terms.</p><p>NIX: They worked with Facebookdata. We don't have Facebookdata. We do use Facebookas a platform to advertise as do all brands, many and most agencies or all agencies I should say. And we use Facebookas a means to gather data.</p><p>SUAREZ: The attention now turns to Facebookand how it reportedly allowed a data breach on this scale.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: As I have said from the beginning...</p><p>SUAREZ: And more importantly, how it was used to reach and influence voters ahead of the 2016 Presidential election. In a statement, Facebooksays it claimed that this is a data breach is completely false, and that those involved certify they had destroyed the data. Meanwhile, it says it's suspending the accounts of Chris Wiley, Cambridge Analytica, as well as Professor Alexander Cogan, who did not respond to our request for comment.</p><p>If anything, it has shined the light on the dark heart of political advertising. Isa Suarez, CNN London.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Facebookhas hired independent forensic (inaudible) to help out in their investigation. So for more on this, joining us now CNN's Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong, and in Oakland, California, Jacob Ward, a fellow of the Center for the Advanced Study of Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. Jacob, let's start with you.</p><p>The shock and anger that Cambridge Analytica would plunder the accumulated data of millions of Facebookusers for political purposes, why, I do not know. The shock and anger that Facebookallowed this to happen, again, why, I do not know. But here is an old clip from Onion TV. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: After years of secretly monitoring the public, we were astounded. So many people would willingly publicize where they live, their religious and political views, an alphabetized list of all their friends, personal email addresses, phone numbers, hundreds of photos of themselves,</p><p>[02:05:00] - and even status updates about what they were doing moment to moment. It is truly a dream come true for the CIA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: It's funny because it's true. This is the end result is involuntarily giving all of your private information.</p><p>JACOB WARD, POPULAR SCIENCE, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: That's absolutely correct. John, we're living -- certainly Cambridge Analytica is sort of a cartoonish bad guy in this in the story. But the amazing this is that it is happening because that's exactly what Facebookis built for. Certainly, Cambridge Analytica used it in a way that it didn't give the company permission to use but used it exactly as Facebookis intended to, to micro target people.</p><p>It's what Facebookis for as a business, and when you put that also in the context, as that Onion clip points out of us living in a world in which people are inviting companies to listen in on our conversations in our living rooms. Not only that, we're paying money to companies to put listing devices in our living rooms, to hand over pictures of our children that is being fed through facial recognition, algorithms.</p><p>The incredible range of things that we volunteer on a daily basis to these companies, frankly, I'm sort of glad that Cambridge Analytica is such a cartoonish bad guy so that people can sort of wake up, look around, and go oh, this isn't just about this sort of cute baby pictures I get from my neighbors. This is about the future of truth and democracy and free exchange of information.</p><p>That feels like maybe a positive, a silver lining to an otherwise pretty scary story.</p><p>VAUSE: By sort of you know ripping the lid of all of this. It has cost Facebook. And Andrew, to you, Facebookhad a pretty big fall in its share price on Monday. It bought the market down with it. But that wasn't an effect from the big sell-off on Wall Street but it was the biggest.</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It certainly was biggest, John, the biggest fall of face for the employee is 36 billion wiped off their value. And it wasn't just Facebook. It was the FAANGs, which is an acronym for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. These are the big companies and they are all being hit, Facebookmore than the others by all of the same reason, and that is this alleged breach of security on personal data. What is that going to mean for the reaction by governments, how do they crackdown on these big, big tech to ensure the security, the privacy of personal data, which could come at a cost because if you think about it, that personal data is at the very core of these companies, advertising strategies. That's where they their make money, in advertising.</p><p>So if that gets crimped a toll or significantly, certainly that is going to hit the bottom line for these companies and that is why things big soft.</p><p>VAUSE: And back to you, Jacob, because you know what Andrew was saying, the one who concerns for investors is actually the reverse for anyone who uses Facebook, you know for the company's and the social media companies. There is a financial disincentive to give users more control over their own data, people will share less. Facebookand other social networks, they'd make less money.</p><p>WARD: That's absolutely correct. I mean you know for Facebookto now turn and say, oh OK, we're going to be safeguarding regional clear and open communication between people, that we're going to encourage the rise of more positive news or more truthful news. All of that runs against their business model, which we should all remember is simply keeping you on Facebook.</p><p>The more time you spend on Facebook, the more money they make. And anything that gets in the way of that cuts into to their bottom line. And so on the one hand, I like to believe that a company like this would sort of take it seriously, that they are the number one medium of choice for more than a third of the planet. I'd also like to point out that you know this isn't really a lot of money to be made in safeguarding democracy.</p><p>The way they make money is by keeping us on Facebookand they'll do anything to do that.</p><p>VAUSE: Andrew, just very quickly. What sort of regulations lawmakers in Europe and the United States looking at or oversight or whatever. What can they do here?</p><p>STEVENS: Well, at this state, they're investigating. That's all they're saying. They're investigating exactly. Remember, they still report, John, so they are being investigated by some both sides of the Atlantic as to whether Facebook-- could this happened and what Facebook's culpability was and then they will take action.</p><p>But just to give you a sense of the European parliament is saying because this looks like a very clear breach of citizens' privacy, very, very clear breach. And in Europe that is a very big deal. So they are likely to clamp down hard on this. Too early to say exactly what they would or would not do, but certainly there will be action.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Jacob, we'll finish up with you because over the weekend, Cambridge Analytica hit Twitters and put a fairly robust defense of its reputation. One point it made was this. Advertising is not coercive. People are smarter than that, really? People are smarter than that?</p><p>WARD: It drives me crazy. That, of all the things that they put up publicly made me the angriest. We are working. I'm in the middle right now of a two-year documentary project,</p><p>[02:10:00] -- in which we have talked to Nobel prize-winning psychologists like Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel prize-winning economist Richard Thaler. All of these people, dozens of them will tell you that that is total nonsense, that the human mind has a system by which it makes decisions. They call thuristics, the short cuts by which you and I make decisions. And those shortcuts it turns out are incredibly systematic across all cultures, even pre-modern cultures. We make the same decisions the same ways.</p><p>Think of it as a programming language. And so for all its talk about safeguarding democracy, Facebookand the rest of them are in the business of learning the programming language by which you and I make decisions so that they can help to influence them. And so don't you know to say that advertising is not coercive, frankly, I don't think coercive is a strong enough word for the power that these companies are about to hold over us.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Jacob, we are all out of time, but thank you so much. And also, Andrew, in Hong Kong, I appreciate you being with us.</p><p>All reporters from the U.K.'s ITNChannel 4 News met with Cambridge Analytica executives over a period of months. They posed as potential clients who are interested in influencing the outcome of elections in Sri Lanka. They used a hidden camera to record CEO Alexander Nix discussing ways to hypothetically in track a candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- thinking that you can do to make sure that the people know the true identity and secrets of these people.</p><p>NIX: (inaudible) Well, someone new to us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. So you won't use a Sri-Lankan person.</p><p>NIX: No. We'll have a wealthy developer come in posing as a wealthy developer. I'm a master of disguise. Yes, they will offer a large amount of money to candidates, to finance the campaign in exchange for land, for instance. We'll have the whole thing recorded on camera. We'll black out the face of our guy and then post it on the internet</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So on Facebookor YouTube or something like this.</p><p>NIX: Send some girls to the candidate's house. We have lots of history of things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For example, you are saying you are using the girls to introduce to the local fellow and you're using the girls for seduction. They're not local girls.</p><p>NIX: -- on holiday with us, you know. You know what I'm saying. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are very beautiful Ukrainian girls.</p><p>NIX: They are very beautiful. I find that works very well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, in another instance, they met with Managing Director Mark Turnbull who discussed playing on voters fear to sway an election.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK TURNBULL, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA MANAGING DIRECTOR: The two fundamental human drivers when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked a reaction from you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right, right.</p><p>TURNBULL: And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really deep seated, underlying fears, concerns. It's no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: In a statement to CNN, Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations made in Channel 4's reporting. It says the report is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of the conversations that took place. They say that their executives entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. CEO Alexander Nix said he is aware of how this looks but it is simply not the case.</p><p>When the reporter posing as a prospective client turned the conversation to entrapment and corruption, the executive left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again, according to the statement. And Nix added I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment bribes, also called Honey Traps, and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose.</p><p>I didn't recognize where the perspective client was taping our conversations and ended the relationship sooner. Could have, should have, OK. U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>turns up the heat on the special counsel in the Russia investigation. When we come back, one source is saying he set off the President's tweet storm against Robert Mueller.</p><p>[02:15:00] Also, the Saudi Crown Prince comes to call the White House. And that's what he is unlikely to get any respect over Saudi's brutal military offensive in Yemen. We'll explain why late in the hour.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>he's back on the attack against the Russia investigation and he's targeting the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. On Monday he tweeted it's a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest. The President lashed out on Mueller by name over the weekend, arguing his team is politically biased.</p><p>Republicans in Congress warning the President to back-off his attacks on Mueller, but there is not much support, at least one Republican's legislation, which would prevent the President from firing the Special Counsel. Well, for more on this, joining me now is California Talk Radio Host, Ethan Bearman and Republican Strategist, Chris Faulkner. Good to see you, guys, thank you for coming in.</p><p>OK, so we got an increasing number of these Republican lawmakers who are telling the President in no uncertain terms just simply to lay off. Let's listen to a couple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How would Republicans react if you fired Mueller?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That would be the stupidest thing the President could do is fire him. Yeah, he could do that but he's not going to do that. And he shouldn't do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know Chris, over the weekend, Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump was to fire Mueller, it would be the beginning of his end of Presidency. There has been a lot of talk. But essentially, they're doing nothing to protect this Special Counsel. There is legislation, which is long hold before Congress to protect Mueller and they say it's not needed.</p><p>CHRIS FAULKNER, SENIOR NATIONAL STRATEGIST: If you look at just the basic self interest, most people can agree it's a bipartisan issue the most elected officials have. If the Republicans in Congress actually fought, the President was going to jeopardize the majority in the House and the Senate by firing Mueller, it would pass legislation tomorrow. They don't believe so therefore, there is no need to pass a law if there is not a need to do something.</p><p>VAUSE: One piece to the idea that he started on it before...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: It's a fundamental Republican principle about it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: I get it. Every politician you know is out for themselves. That's agreed on. But what is the indication that the President has no interest in firing Robert Mueller? I mean every indication that it's to the contrary, it seems.</p><p>FAULKNER: Every indication other than he hasn't done it.</p><p>VAUSE: Yet. FAULKNER: Right. Yes, you can say yet about almost everything the President has said. He hasn't done it yet. If he was going to fire Mueller, he already would have done it.</p><p>VAUSE: Ethan.</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, CALIFORNIA TALK RADIO HOST: Wow. So a couple things here, first off, President Trump just last year said he would sit down and testify with Robert Mueller. He said he would do that in the beginning of January. Thank you. And he has not done that and then he goes on the attack. This is an effort to undermine the Mueller investigation. So when something comes out, he can say this whole thing is bias.</p><p>The whole thing is terrible. None of it sticks. None of it matters. That's what's going on here. The Republicans for shame that really it's up to Rob Rosenstein to fire Robert Mueller and whether he's saying he's not going to do that under the current circumstances.</p><p>VAUSE: So we have a lot of leaks and a lot of friendly fire.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yeah, right the Saturday Night Massacre that happened.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So after -- what was it eight days ago, I think the President tweeted that there would be no changes to his legal team. He is very happy with the team that was in place. There has been a new lawyer added to the President's personal legal team, a new attorney who seems to audition for the role by appearing on Fox News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton, and if she didn't win the election, to then frame <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>with a falsely created crime. Everything that we have seen from these texts, and from all the facts developing shows that the FBI and senior DOJ officials conspired to violate the law and to deny <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>his civil rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So the general will probably play the role of pitbull. He won't take the lead but he will be the attack guy. So I guess, Chris that means there is next to no chance the President might be laying off Robert Mueller.</p><p>FAULKNER: The President is putting together his personal legal events team. Of course, he's going to have somebody who is aggressive personally defending him. Anybody should be surprised by that. If you're a high profile individual, then you can afford to have a high profile legal defense team, you're going to hire someone who is going to aggressively pursue your case and aggressively make sure that you have the best possible defense team you should get.</p><p>VAUSE: Ethan, aggressively defending is one thing, trading in conspiracy theories I guess is... BEARMAN: I don't understand what happened to the Republican Party, that suddenly it has become the home of conspiracy theories. Everybody is out to get him. Everything is dangerous. Everything -- Hillary Clinton -- everything is undermining democracy around the world. Where is this coming from? But interestingly enough, that is a page where he was just doing right on the book of Roy Cohn, which you know that's the trainer of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>originally.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So where is this coming from? Well, part of a -- a reporting from the Washington Post which may explain why the President believes that the Mueller investigation is a partisan witch hunt. Trump is not consulting with top advisers, including Chief of Staff John Kelly and Chief White House lawyer, Don McGahn on his Russian legal choices or his comments about the probe.</p><p>According to one person with knowledge of his actions, its better with anonymity, blah, blah, blah.</p><p>[02:22:14] He has been said watching television and calling friends. Chris, if watching television -- this report means you know you're watching Fox News. Of course, he thinks it's a witch hunt ordered by President Hillary Clinton, overseen by the U.N. National Government.</p><p>FAULKNER: Yeah, we can get to speculate on what the President watches or doesn't watch. Clearly, someone is going to go and link this information and put it in the worst possible light because there is a continuing narrative that we're also to promote in the media the President is this doofus who sits around watching the news all day.</p><p>VAUSE: No one said doofus.</p><p>FAULKNER: The inference is clearly there. It continues to be a pattern that everyone wants say well, the President's doing this because he's watching TV and throwing things at the television like he's Archie Bunker or something like that. Clearly, it's not the case.</p><p>VAUSE: But this is sort of the bubble in which the President chooses to live. You know he goes from the campaign rally. He very rarely leaves the White House. That kind of stuff -- you know he watches Fox News...</p><p>FAULKNER: Most Presidents' don't leave the White House.</p><p>VAUSE: But at least they read the PDB and they listen to their advisers and they get outside advice. I mean this is a President who chooses what he watches and what he reads very carefully.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yeah, and it's all a reality game show for him as well. If I'm going to pit one side against the other and see who wins the battle of the wit. It's a Survivor/Apprentice happening in the White House. And he's doing that with his legal team now too, is what this is evidence of. It's a level of instability that we have never seen in our lifetimes coming out of Washington D.C. And it is a very dangerous precedent. By the way, and what's going to happen next when Mueller asks to sit down with President Trump, what is this -- this is going to be something that's battled all the way to the Supreme Court and is going done in the ugliest way possible to further divide America.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, we have a bit of an idea of what the Mueller team will be asking or they lied to us, the President because there has been a face-to-face meeting, another one between lawyers for Trump and the Special Counsel to talk about topics part of our reporting. Mueller's team added granularity to the topics which will be discussed with the defense team months ago.</p><p>Excuse me. But the firing of FBI Director James Comey, according to all of our sources, this time around for instance the prosecutor said they would ask about Attorney General Jeff Sessions' involvement in the Comey dismissal and what Trump knew about National Security Advisor Michael Flint's phone calls with then Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in late December 2016.</p><p>Again, Chris if everything is above board -- basic question why do you have such a cranky Commander In Chief and this all seems to indicate that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up by Thanksgiving. It's not wrapping up by Christmas. It's not wrapping up by Easter. It's not wrapping up for a while.</p><p>FAULKNER: I think most Americans, myself included, we really want give Bob Mueller the benefit of the doubt. Long, long career in public service, as a public servant is, no indication to think that he would somehow be a bad actor in this or overly partisan. But again, you just literally read from leaked testimony, leaked documents.</p><p>This special counsel, the special investigative process has been a nonstop leak fest of things the President supposedly said or didn't say, and at some point, they're eroding their own credibility to cripple the investigation if they continue to leak things to the press and continue to involve attorneys that are clearly partisan hacks for the Democratic Party.</p><p>Fortunately, Andrew McCabe is now no longer involved. And hopefully we won't see anymore of that. But this continual process of leaking and separation and constant talk about things that are supposed to be in confidence in terms of the discussion of the President's attorneys is undermining their credibility to do their job.</p><p>VAUSE: Yeah. Although, Ethan, you know a lot of leaks have turned out to be true.</p><p>BEARMAN: Yeah they have. And by the way who else complained the loudest about leaks was President Richard Nixon, if I recall. And so this is typically -- there is a lot of smoke happening here. There clearly are things that they're worried about being guilty of. President Trump by the way, the one thing that I will give his legal team at all is that they're trying to protect him to stop them from actually talking to Robert Moeller, because as we now know the President in his own words just makes things up when he talks to world leaders so he will probably do the same with Robert Mueller. VAUSE: He has an interesting relationship with the truth at times, Chris and Ethan, good to see you both.</p><p>FAULKNER: You as well.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, it's been almost a year since President Trump posed for this unforgettable picture in Saudi Arabia. Just ahead, we'll see if the eight ball's prediction is coming true, as the Saudi Crown Prince visits the White House.</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks for staying with us. You're watching CNN Newsroom live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour. Facebookhas hired independent forensic auditors to investigate how the data firm Cambridge Analytica used personal information in the 2016 President election. Facebookis under fire for not protecting its user's data.</p><p>U.S. and European lawmakers are calling for hearings and possible new regulations. In a major step forward, the U.K. has reached a joint draft agreement with the European Union on the legal terms of Brexit. It allows Britain to make trade deals using 20 month transition after leaving the E.U. next March, but Ireland's borders with Northern Ireland, still one issue that could unravel the agreement.</p><p>The lawyers of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>are discussing specific topics for a potential interview with the Special Counsel in the Russia investigation. Sources say the two sides met face to face for the first time last week. On Monday, the U.S. President once again called the investigation a witch hunt. The defected leader of Saudi Arabia will meet with the U.S. President in Washington in the coming hours.</p><p>Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman already has a close relationship with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>He made the unusual choice of Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip as President, a trip which will forever be remembered for this one image.</p><p>[02:30:00]</p><p>Egypt's President, the Saudi King and Mr. Trump, all three placing hands on a glowing orb. Their faces lift with evil sorcerer on effect. One issue which many aid groups and human rights activist hope would be high on the agenda is the Kingdom's war in Yemen which U.N. says has triggered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Over the weekend, the Crown Prince defended the three-year long military offensive during a rare television interview with \"60 MINUTES\" on CBS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA (through translator): The Iranian ideology penetrated some parts of Yemen. During that time, this militia was conducting military maneuvers right next to our borders and positioning missiles at our borders. It is truly very painful, and I hope that this militia seizes using the humanitarian situation to their advantage in order to draw sympathy from the international community. They block humanitarian aid in order to create famine and humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Kimberly Dozier is CNN's Global Affairs Analyst. She joins us now from Washington. Kimberly, thank you for being with us.</p><p>KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Good to be here.</p><p>VAUSE: I guess the activists can hope what they want for some pushback from the White House when it comes to Yemen, but that's unlikely to happen especially when we just heard from the Crown Prince that he's framing this war as part of this wider conflict with Iran.</p><p>DOZIER: Well, we got a little bit of a preview today with a briefing from a senior administration official from the Trump White House, explaining that they frequently ask the Saudis to keep humanitarian roots open, that they do ask them to be careful with airstrikes. But U.S. Military officials are a little bit defensive, they say, we're providing them intelligence, we are providing them with refueling, but we don't watch where every single day jet drops its ordinates. That is for the Saudis to police, and we're helping them, but it's basically up to them. The Saudis for their part are very defensive about this, they insist that they follow regular U.S. military procedure and they're targeting that they do have investigations when something goes awry, and that they do publish the results of those investigations.</p><p>One of the biggest problems for us as journalists is it's really hard to get in to Yemen to test these assertions. So, you are left with taking their word for it versus the humanitarian groups versus the combatants on the ground, and that's pretty unsatisfying when you're trying to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, you mentioned how the U.S. military says it's providing the Saudis with intelligence but the U.S. is also providing the Saudis with a lot of the weapons they're using in this military conflict. And that's bringing some concern among U.S. lawmakers. Listen to the Republican Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: So, we supply the Saudis with arms, they create havoc in refugees in Yemen, then what's the answer? I think we are elevating an arms race in the Middle East, and I don't think it's good for America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, in the bigger context here, though, is it important for the Saudis to have Congress on the side or is this simply about the relationship with the President?</p><p>DOZIER: Well, they are going to work on it. There are meetings scheduled, I understand, between the Crown Prince and some lawmakers, but pretty much, he needs to keep the U.S. President on the side, and they've already met several times. They have a good relationship. And also, the Pentagon is pushing back against this move in the Senate, a resolution that's being considered to limit U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia for the Yemen conflict. So, I think on Capitol Hill, they're going to make a lot of noise, but I don't see them picking up enough support to actually block U.S. military aid to Saudi Arabia for this purpose.</p><p>VAUSE: That's an interesting point because protests are expected when the Crown Prince arrives at the White House. One of the organizers told the Financial Times, this is a very extensive propaganda campaign to portray Prince Mohammad as a reformer while he is really a heavy- handed bully who's responsible for bombing and starving Yemenis, gunning for a war with Iran and who has pulled off one of the most spectacular power grabs in history. That may be overstating it a little bit because to be fair, he is slowly pulling the kingdom out of the dark ages, but is that all being overshadowed, you know, by the situation in Yemen by the power grab, by you know, stashing his mother away from his father so he can continue to consolidate his power?</p><p>DOZIER: Well, I have to say in the United States, mostly they're focusing on the latest drama about the Mueller investigation. It's very hard to get a look in on this kind of issue. The Yemeni war is something that just doesn't much reach the American consciousness. So, as tragic and horrible as it is, without U.S. troops on the ground, it doesn't get that much attention.</p><p>[02:35:05] And that is part of the secret of this relationship, the secret of success for <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>is Saudi Arabia is waging a war in a place that houses Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, one of the deadliest terrorist groups that was taking a lot of U.S. Special Operations and intelligence bandwidth to fight. Now, U.S. Intelligence Special Operations are still helping but it's mostly Saudi and UAE jets and troops that are fighting them on the ground. And that means Trump doesn't have to deal with as much of attention to it or focus on it from the American public back home. And for that, they're very grateful to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>That's one of the things that has cemented this relationship. And I think you're going to see it in the coming days, possibly some new announcements in terms of trade deals. You can even see that Saudi Arabia is pushing hard for some exceptions to getting new nuclear power. It wants to be able to enrich Uranium which usually, if you're a third-party country asking the United States to build a nuclear power plants on your soil, you don't get to also enrich Uranium. Saudi Arabia is pushing for those kind of exceptions. And there are some officials I've spoken to who are worried that they might get their way.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, because of the Crown Prince famously answered the question that if the Iranians had nuclear as in military capability then they would want it as well. Kimberly, thank you, good to see you.</p><p>DOZIER: Thank you. VAUSE: Well, speaking of attacks, you know, Texas City takes an even more frightening turn. Police detect a serial bomber is to blame and they worry attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated.</p><p>VAUSE: (INAUDIBLE) to CNN. The world's last male northern white rhino has died.

Police in Tempe, Arizona said an autonomous SUV start to kill a woman as she walks her bicycle across the street.

The county attorney's office will determine whether charges will be filed.</p><p>And police in Austin, Texas are confirming what many there have feared. A suspected serial bomber is on the loose.</p><p>[02:40:01] In the past two weeks, four bombs have exploded killing two people and ruling for others. Brian Todd reports the latest explosion just this past Sunday, make use of a complicated system involving a trip wire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Austin is a city on edge as police say they are now on the hunt for what they believe is a serial bomber. The latest blast happened Sunday night injuring two men who set off a hidden trip wire triggering an explosion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got trip wires there in the grass.</p><p>TODD: Investigators say they see similarities in all four bombs that have exploded in the city since March 2nd. But following Sunday's intent, they now see something even more chilling.</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN TEXAS POLICE CHIEF: The belief that we are now dealing with someone who is using trip wires shows a higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill.</p><p>TODD: Unlike the previous bombs which were stuff inside packages apparently placed by the bomber at the homes of people of color. Two African-American men were killed and a Hispanic woman was injured. But police and the FBI say the trip wire bomb on Sunday night did not appear to target anyone specific. It was hidden near a fence in a predominantly White neighborhood and the two people injured are both white men. Still police are not ruling out the possibility that the previous bombings could have been hate crimes. A former FBI profiler says the trip wire bomb might have been an attempt to throw investigators off the trail.</p><p>MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER FBI PROFILER: Previous victims may have been targeted and now he wants to put time and distance between the targeted victims and make it appear that he's out just to randomly victimize anyone. So it could be a game-playing technique on the bomber's part.</p><p>TODD: No matter the motive, investigators say their most urgent concern now is the bomber's change in tactics because the bomb Sunday night was not easily noticed.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER COMBS, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, FBI'S SAN ANTONIO DIVISION: We're very concerned that with trip wires a child could be walking down the sidewalk and hit something.</p><p>TODD: Police warned residents using a reverse 911 call system and a school near the site of the bombing was temporarily shut down. According to Mary Ellen O'Toole who profiled the unabomber for the FBI. The fear of random terror in Austin is exactly what the killer wants. She says she thinks the bomber's most likely a man who is arrogant and reveling in a sense of power.</p><p>O'TOOLE: This is someone that appear to be having enjoying -- some kind -- type of enjoyment over what he is doing holding the City of Austin in a fixated state of fear. They're scared, they're upset.</p><p>TODD: Police are now appealing for help from the killer himself.</p><p>MANLEY: We ask him to contact us and give him phone numbers to contact us at. And again, we won't understand what the motive might be behind this or the reason behind this until we have an opportunity to talk to the suspect or suspects that are involved.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: Police and FBI officials in Austin meanwhile are appealing for the public's help saying they need anyone with surveillance video, other video or images of any suspicious activity to come forward. Police say they have persons of interest in this case but so far no suspects. Brian Todd, CNN Washington.</p><p>VAUSE: Thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause.

And then, at the weekend, the former world number one was once a stroke of the leader at once say. He shoot the Arnold Palmer Invitational, (INAUDIBLE) the Northern Irish Rory McIlroy.</p><p>He will heads into Augusta as a (INAUDIBLE) favorite to win it. This time around, well, speaking of which, let see how he won't say as the winner this weekend at Bay Hill in Florida. It's actually, his first PGA Tour title since September 2016. Well, Sunday, saw him -- his at final round of 64 and ever hold the overnight leader Henrik Stenson, a huge final par from the 18th.</p><p>How make him the new favorite to win The Masters next month? And afterwards, he said, he never actually given up hope after (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RORY MCILROY, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: I always believe in myself and I know that me being 100 percent healthy is good enough to not just win on the PGA Tour but win a lot. And I guess that's what can't be going -- you know, I wanted to get back to 100 percent fitness which I have. And that allows me to practice as much as I want. Go about my business, do everything that I need to do to feel 100 percent prepared to play golf tournaments.</p><p>So, I never lost belief. I mean, I know that I've -- I know that I've got to get for this game and I know that if I put that the time and I can -- I can make a lot of it, and I guess that's what's get me going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RILEY: Yes, great stuff from McIlroy, there. But what about <person><nameText>Tiger Woods? </nameText></person>How good is he looking ahead of The Masters? Well, have to multiple back surgery. He is back, as expands he'd missed seeing the side of him wearing red on Sunday.</p><p>In the last few weeks, he finished 12 Honda Classic, tied for 2nd at the Valspar championship, as I mentioned earlier. And then, he was tied for 5th at Bay Hill on Sunday. Earlier, CNN's Don Riddell spoke with the leading sports physical therapist. He started by asking him, \"What concerns him about Tiger, considering the spinal fusion surgery? What the goal for underwent?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DALE YAKE, FOUNDER, PHYSICAL THERAPY SOLUTIONS: When his on the uneven lives, maybe hitting up against the leap in a -- in a sand trap, or in the trees. He hit the tree last week, in the roots. It's those things that I worried about that probably, maybe lead to a little tweak, and that little tweak leads to more pain. So, we've got to manage, I mean, I know, Steve's done a great job for doing that up to this point. DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: He has been in contention of the last couple of weeks. There is an awful of an excitement of the ranking going into The Masters coming up in April.</p><p>YAKE: Yes.</p><p>RIDDELL: If he wins that if he just wins any event on a PGA Tour. Where would that ranking the -- in the pantheon of great sporting comebacks from such desperate serve physical dilemmas?</p><p>YAKE: Don, I cannot think of anyone that maybe withdraw a parallel to this. There's been a -- athletes overcome a lot of things. The only one that I can think of this, if Ryan chase here from the Pittsburg Steelers, and NFL comes back from his spot to entry to play football again. May rank up there where Tiger was playing golf again at this level. But I can't take of an individual that's contributed to a sport, and the craziness and the following is just -- it's amazing this year it all happened. I didn't take it and I didn't expect it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RILEY: Coming up on the show, they say, three is the magic number. But superstar strikers across the globe sort of they're be differently this weekend.</p><p>[02 51:23] RILEY: Welcome back. They say, things come in three, but to some of the world's best football players, they ignored that old cliche. In fact, of the scoring (INAUDIBLE) for that team this weekend, they went on and scored have both as four goals. So, where exactly are we talking about?</p><p>Well, for starter, Christiano Ronaldo, has now scored 50th hat-tricks. And our friends, at least, report put together this bit of fun, his closest routing with Susan Air Force. And on Sunday, on the pitch, Real Madrid, this around a four -- six to really impact in La Liga. Sea of seven, getting four goals in that one, Real new got for third in this table just four points behind across seat revival. Now, Isco, the striker has now got 17 goals on 8 games. So, take above for that one.</p><p>Get them masterpiece something in the air this weekend, Ronaldo wasn't the only one to score for honor. Mauro Icardi also netted four for Inter Milan in Syria before the game. It was worth on noting, he have a four for three months. But one of this charges, they couldn't stop in kitty. He drove at hat-trick in by 14 minutes. That's not of the only milestone, though. He found for 100 times in Syria, as well.</p><p>OK, we're not done there either. What about the major talking point from Liverpool's game on Saturday? The Reds at rushing Watford's in the English Premier League, and the match belongs to the Egyptian international, Mohamed Salah, by scoring four goals, he got his first hat-trick in Liverpool shots. That's now 36 goals to his name and becomes the highest goal scorer for a Red's play in their first season and until. He is the leading scorer right now in the EPL, and we just can't wait to see how he does at the World Cup this summer for Egypt.</p><p>So, it was a pretty special weekend for goal scorers but it wasn't just limited to Europe. Getting much less attention is the Chinese wing up Wu Lei, he scored four in Shanghai SIPG's win against Guangzhou R &amp; F in the timing symphony. And they needed him as well, Shanghai were too down, until their all-time goal scorer found the right gear on five ever made 12-minute hat-trick.</p><p>You may recognize some of the supporting characters here, the former Chelsea midfielder, Oscar. He also set up his first two goals, and another Brazilian Star hawk made the last one. The result was more important to Shanghai, they maintain a perfect start for the new season, three wins from three games.</p><p>Staying with football now in a touching story for you. The serial club, Fiorentina have continue to pay tribute to their former captain, Davide Astori. The club is now renaming their training ground after defender, the Italian international died earlier this month before his team were due to play Udinese. A first motif found he died from cardiac arrest. A few weeks ago is a mark of respect, the club also retired Astori's number 13 shirt.</p><p>The world of tennis is about, listen, as it were when Naomi Osaka won her first ever WTA Tour title. Winning at Indian Wells this weekend. The Japanese star in the making beat the Russian, Daria Kasatkina, in straight sets. For both of them, it will be a final that will be remembered forever. It was their first top three final for the pair.</p><p>Believe it or not, Osaka was actually on seated in this tournament, but those familiar with the sport. Who knows she has a great ball striking ability and she definitely show their own route to the title. She thorough two former world number one, Maria Sharapova and Karolina Pliskova, as one of the current number one, Simona Halep. A fighting time for rest of the youngster that's for sure.</p><p>Well, Osaka is a mix of culture, born in Japan to a Haitian father and a Japanese mother. She then moved to Florida when she was just three years old. She plays on the Japanese flag but cannot speak the language. But his head tennis is doing all the talking right now and take good carry her a very long way indeed.</p><p>Elsewhere, and we got to see another side of <person><nameText>Roger Federer, </nameText></person>side that we already seen.

The Trump administration and O'Rielly's office didn't comment. The agency declined to comment.</p><p>O'Rielly's nomination had been seen to be on hold until at least September due to a hold from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and opposition from several Senate Commerce Committee Democrats over an FCC order approving Ligado's L-band plan (see 2007310001). Until now, however, there hadn't been any public indication that the renomination wouldn't move forward.</p><p>People across the political spectrum saw the move as possibly linked to O'Rielly's criticisms of regulation of social media platforms' content policies (see 2007290039), although the GOP commissioner has said those concerns aren't related to the White House. NTIA petitioned the FCC at Trump's order for clarification on Communications Decency Act Section 230.</p><p>\"This is a surprising development with considerable consequences,\" emailed Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society Senior Counselor Andrew Schwartzman. \"In the short term it means that Trump can't possibly get favorable action on the Section 230 petition unless and until he is reelected and then gets a compliant replacement.\" Schwartzman said the move could also mean that Chairman Ajit Pai is \"off the hook\" from having to decide whether to support the petition.</p><p>The withdrawal could be a message to Pai about Ligado, Schwartzman said. The nomination was seemingly pulled because O'Rielly, \"wasn't supportive of Trump's illegal &amp; unconstitutional request that @FCC interpret #Section 230,\" Georgetown Law fellow Gigi Sohn tweeted. \"Give Mike props -- he stuck to his principles even as it may have cost him another term as Commissioner.\"</p><p>TechFreedom Senior Fellow Berin Szoka tweeted that O'Rielly had \"the courage to (oh so gently) remind his fellow Republicans that the First Amendment bars the FCC from policing speech online (no matter how much Trump whines about \"Big Tech censorship\") and the White House retaliated.\" Technology Policy Institute President Scott Wallsten tweeted, \"Major props to Mike for supporting 1A and staying true to his convictions despite personal cost. Few people pass that test if they face it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HY-8041-JC8G-817P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 04, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In his proudest moments, he resembles something like a theorist of transformation, decline and creation. In his lowest, he is more like a speaking canary, prone to prophecy, a game with losing odds. His attempts at optimism are framed as counterintuitive, faring little better, in predictive terms, than his lapses into pessimism. He teeters hazardously between implicating his audience and merely giving their anxieties a name. He -- and it is almost always a he -- is the critical equivalent of an unreliable narrator, unable to write about technology without also writing about himself. Occasionally, he is right: about what is happening, about what should happen, and about what it means. And so he carries on, and his audience with him. </p><p>  Franklin Foer, thankfully, recognizes these pitfalls even if he can't always avoid them. Who can? The melodramatically titled ''World Without Mind,'' Foer's compact attempt at a broad technological polemic -- which identifies the stupendous successes of Amazon, Google and Facebook, among others, as an ''existential threat'' to the individual and to society -- begins with a disclaimer. Foer's tumultuous stint editing The New Republic under the ownership of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes ended with mass resignations and public acrimony. ''There's no doubt that this experience informs the argument of this book,'' he writes. He is likewise entangled through his proximity to publishing: The author's friends, colleagues and immediate family members -- including his brother, the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer -- depend to different degrees on the industry Amazon consumed first. The book is dedicated to his father, Bert, a crusading antitrust lawyer.</p><p>  In this slightly crouched posture, and with a hint of healthy self-doubt, Foer proceeds quickly. We, the consuming public, have failed to properly understand the new tech superpowers, he suggests, leaving little hope for stodgy and reluctant American regulators. The scope of their influence is obscured by the sheer number of things they do and sell, or problems they purport to be solving, and by our outdated sense of what constitutes a monopoly. To that end, Foer promotes the concept of the ''knowledge monopoly,'' which he qualifies with a mischievous grin. ''My hope is that we revive 'monopoly' as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers,'' he says, rather than as a ''technical'' term referring to one company cornerning a market. (His new monopolists, after all, aren't raising prices. They're giving things away free).</p><p>  For much of the book, readers are parachuted into various moments in the history of computing, the internet, media and philosophy. Character introductions arrive rapidly, with a casualness that can slip into absurdity: Descartes ''enjoyed his sleep''; Mark Zuckerberg ''is a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty''; Alan Turing was an ''atheist and a loner,'' while Ray Kurzweil, the prophet of an artificial-intelligence-driven singularity, is driven by his inability to escape ''the biggest fear of them all.'' (Death.) The effect is slightly delirious but genuinely enjoyable. Readers are flung through a highly selective history of the philosophy of mind, landing squarely on their feet in Google's A.I. laboratories. The 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's stubborn and total belief that knowledge could be reduced to mathematical computation leads surprisingly seamlessly into a perceptive assessment of Zuckerberg's fraught and inconsistent public relationship with the concept of the algorithm, his mission to connect the world and the billions of meaningful decisions made by Facebook's software every day.</p><p>  As Foer's book veers into advocacy, readers are treated to a similarly energetic and cleareyed view of the modern ''knowledge monopoly'' giants. Jeff Bezos' techno-populist suggestion that he can ''see the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere'' is contrasted with his personal purchase of The Washington Post and his stewardship over Amazon, which is a massive, diverse and participatory marketplace, but one under the control of a single private company with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong-arm negotiation tactics. ''Old gatekeepers might not always have been worthy of praise,'' Foer writes, ''but at least there were a lot of them.''</p><p>  His best assessment of what has happened to media in general in the last decade is tucked in an aside about what Facebook, Google and Amazon all offer, or threaten: They are the ''primary bundlers'' of commercial media, whether it's books, articles or video. ''They are the ones that create a usable, coherent product from its disparate parts. Their business model is infinitely better than the one it displaced.'' More broadly, truly ambitious tech companies are in the business of creating markets, not competing in them; of wrapping themselves around industries, not merely disrupting them.</p><p>  The New Republic, of which Foer was editor twice -- Hughes invited him back in 2012 partly as a demonstration of good faith for a skeptical staff -- appears intermittently in ''World Without Mind.'' Foer doesn't share gossip or indulge much in the way of bitterness. He is generous in his only slightly condescending description of the magazine's young tech-rich owner and in his minimally insulting account of working with the company's data-obsessed C.E.O., whose arrival plainly portended Foer's departure and the subsequent resignation of a majority of its masthead. What happened at The New Republic is more useful to Foer as an entry point for describing the news media's state of utter upheaval at the time. Here, again, he becomes the knowingly unreliable narrator: His obvious loathing of the social-media-driven news coverage pursued in recent years by most media organizations does capture the fatalistic mood of the industry, but betrays a sense of nostalgia for a better era that can be hard to locate anywhere outside of Foer's own memory. He also reveals a lack of interest in new modes of media production that were rising as his magazine fell.</p><p>  Foer's other concession to nostalgia, in the form of an inoffensive command to return to the ''sustaining nourishment of the contemplative life and the deep commitment to text,'' is overshadowed by a vigorous and novel call for regulatory intervention. He reminds us that the issue of monopoly dominated our politics for generations, even as the companies in the crosshairs changed in form and ambition. Though he makes no radical or provocative case to, say, nationalize Facebook, or to break up Google, he does suggest creating a Data Protection Authority, in the mold of Elizabeth Warren's post-financial-crisis Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and calling for government to protect privacy as it (in theory) protects the environment.</p><p>  Is this idealistic, plain crazy, or just impotent? The armchair technology critic -- roused by Foer's sneakily persuasive manifesto -- might ask in response, with a mixture of satisfaction and despair: What does it mean that it could be all three?</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A protest outside Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., in January.

While sales of the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers have all stagnated, Apple's services arm, which is powered by the App Store, has exploded.</p><p>Morgan Stanley expects the division to bring in $52bn ((EURO)47bn) next year, up from $24bn in 2016.</p><p>The surge is largely due to the 30% levy that Apple charges for in-app purchases or subscriptions to content services such as Hulu, the video streaming giant.</p><p>Spotify filed suit in Europe this year over Apple's 30% take, which the company waives for Apple Music - a direct Spotify rival - to give it a huge price edge.</p><p>Apple also prohibits Spotify from putting a link in the app to a sign-up page outside Apple's system.</p><p>Siri, Apple's voice assistant, will not play music via Spotify.

Antitrust scholars see it as the last significant victory for government trust-busters.</p><p>Since then, a steady drip of court cases have narrowed the scope of the existing law - the Sherman Act - to such a degree it is almost unrecognisable.</p><p>Michael Kades, director for markets and competition policy at the Washington Centre for Equitable Growth, said: \"The courts have eviscerated the Sherman Act.</p><p>Forty years of conservative legal interpretations mean it is not clear that, given the exact same AT&amp;T case, the government would win.\"</p><p>As Washington gears up for an almighty fight with Silicon Valley, the government's least worst option, said Kades, is for a divided Congress to pass new antitrust laws that make clear what companies can and cannot do. If it doesn't, Apple and the rest can argue that they are working entirely within the letter of the law.</p><p>Microsoft got into hot water in the 1990s for forcing computer-makers to bundle its Internet Explorer browser into their machines. It fought the government for 29 years. A decision to break up the company was overturned.

The Facebook founder wined and dined members of Congress and had a private meeting with Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The visit was the billionaire's attempt to shape the wave of regulation ahead and - he hopes - to stave off a break-up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, Google and Amazon have all been hit this month with demands by the US Department of Justice to produce emails and internal documents as the government digs into the question of whether they have used their heft to squash competition illegally. None of the targets in the great tech crackdown of 2019, claims one critic, is as vulnerable as the fourth company in Washington's sights - Apple.</p><p>\"The App Store is the most blatant example of antitrust violation in tech,\" said Ben Thompson, the tech commentator and founder of Stratechery. \"It is textbook anticompetitive, and is kind of amazing in its brazenness.\"</p><p>The App Store is an online bazaar of 2m-plus free and paid-for apps, offered on the 900m iPhones around the world. While iPhone sales have fallen, Apple's services arm, which is powered by the App Store, has exploded. Morgan Stanley expects the division to bring in $58bn (\u00a346bn) next year, up from $24bn in 2016.</p><p>The surge is largely due to the 30% levy that Apple charges for in-app purchases or subscriptions to content services such as Hulu, the video streaming giant.</p><p>Spotify started legal action in Europe this year over Apple's 30% take (which drops to 15% after the first year). Apple waives the fees for Apple Music - a direct Spotify rival - giving it a price edge. Apple also prohibits Spotify from putting a link in the app to a sign-up page outside Apple's system.</p><p>Siri, Apple's voice assistant, will not play music via Spotify. A recent New York Times investigation found that Apple's search algorithm prioritised its own apps over those of rivals; the company swiftly \"improved\" the function. Thompson said: \"At some point, the smartphone crosses the line to something that's so meaningful to daily life, that you have to take more concern, and there's more responsibilities that come with the App Store.\"</p><p>Apple said that 84% of apps in its store are free, so produce no income for Apple, and that it has only 44 of its own apps competing with third parties.</p><p>In 1984, America broke up AT&amp;T's monopoly on local phone services, creating seven smaller companies and unleashing a wave of innovation. Antitrust scholars see it as the last significant victory for government trustbusters. Since then, a steady drip of court cases has narrowed the scope of the existing law - the Sherman Act - to such a degree it is almost unrecognisable.</p><p>Michael Kades, director for markets and competition policy at the Washington Centre for Equitable Growth, said: \"The courts have eviscerated the Sherman Act. Forty years of conservative legal interpretations mean it is not clear that, given the exact same AT&amp;T case, the government would win.\"</p><p>As Washington gears up for an almighty fight with Silicon Valley, the government's least worst option, said Kades, is for a divided Congress to pass new antitrust laws that make clear what companies can and cannot do. If it doesn't, Apple and the rest can argue that they are working entirely to the letter of the law.</p><p>Microsoft, which got into hot water in the 1990s for forcing computer-makers to bundle its Internet Explorer browser into their machines, fought the government for 29 years. It fended off a break-up and today is worth more than $1 trillion.</p><p>Microsoft's transgressions were \"small fry\" compared to Apple's leveraging of its dominance in smartphones, Thompson said. He added: \"Simply by virtue of having created a platform, you get to take 30% for basically everyone on Earth? We already decided, both in Europe and the US, that that was not OK.\"</p><p>However, Washington's scope to bring Big Tech to heel is weaker than ever.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-153151649</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3P-VNV1-DYTY-C45D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The Facebook founder wined and dined members of Congress and had a private meeting with Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The visit was the billionaire's attempt to shape the wave of regulation ahead and - he hopes   to stave off a break-up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, Google and Amazon have all been hit this month with demands by the US Department of Justice to produce emails and internal documents as the government digs into the question of whether they have used their heft to squash competition illegally. None of the targets in the great tech crackdown of 2019, claims one critic, is as vulnerable as the fourth company in Washington's sights - Apple.</p><p>\"The App Store is the most blatant example of antitrust violation in tech,\" said Ben Thompson, the tech commentator and founder of Stratechery. \"It is textbook anticompetitive, and is kind of amazing in its brazenness.\"</p><p>The App Store is an online bazaar of 2m-plus free and paid-for apps, offered on the 900m iPhones around the world. While iPhone sales have fallen, Apple's services arm, which is powered by the App Store, has exploded. Morgan Stanley expects the division to bring in $58bn (\u00a346bn) next year, up from $24bn in 2016.</p><p>The surge is largely due to the 30% levy that Apple charges for in-app purchases or subscriptions to content services such as Hulu, the video streaming giant.</p><p>Spotify started legal action in Europe this year over Apple's 30% take (which drops to 15% after the first year). Apple waives the fees for Apple Music - a direct Spotify rival - giving it a price edge. Apple also prohibits Spotify from putting a link in the app to a sign-up page outside Apple's system.</p><p>Siri, Apple's voice assistant, will not play music via Spotify. A recent New York Times investigation found that Apple's search algorithm prioritised its own apps over those of rivals; the company swiftly \"improved\" the function. Thompson said: \"At some point, the smartphone crosses the line to something that's so meaningful to daily life, that you have to take more concern, and there's more responsibilities that come with the App Store.\"</p><p>Apple said that 84% of apps in its store are free, so produce no income for Apple, and that it has only 44 of its own apps competing with third parties.</p><p>In 1984, America broke up AT&amp;T's monopoly on local phone services, creating seven smaller companies and unleashing a wave of innovation. Antitrust scholars see it as the last significant victory for government trustbusters. Since then, a steady drip of court cases has narrowed the scope of the existing law - the Sherman Act - to such a degree it is almost unrecognisable.</p><p>Michael Kades, director for markets and competition policy at the Washington Centre for Equitable Growth, said: \"The courts have eviscerated the Sherman Act. Forty years of conservative legal interpretations mean it is not clear that, given the exact same AT&amp;T case, the government would win.\"</p><p>As Washington gears up for an almighty fight with Silicon Valley, the government's least worst option, said Kades, is for a divided Congress to pass new antitrust laws that make clear what companies can and cannot do. If it doesn't, Apple and the rest can argue that they are working entirely to the letter of the law.</p><p>Microsoft, which got into hot water in the 1990s for forcing computer-makers to bundle its Internet Explorer browser into their machines, fought the government for 29 years. It fended off a break-up and today is worth more than $1 trillion.</p><p>Microsoft's transgressions were \"small fry\" compared to Apple's leveraging of its dominance in smartphones, Thompson said. He added: \"Simply by virtue of having created a platform, you get to take 30% for basically everyone on Earth? We already decided, both in Europe and the US, that that was not OK.\"</p><p>However, Washington's scope to bring Big Tech to heel is weaker than ever.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-153158469</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3P-VNV1-DYTY-C48J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Federal regulators broke up Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil monopoly, kept DuPont from dominating military supply, and broke Ma Bell into what\u2019s now Verizon and other pieces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it\u2019s been popular, since the Nixon-Reagan-Clinton trade deals, to neglect old ways of measuring monopoly. If IBM, Exxon, GM, and DuPont have to compete with government-backed Chinese and European companies at home and abroad, does it make sense to punish them if some of their products are extra popular with U.S. buyers?</p><p>Break up JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, and you just invite government-backed Chinese banks to run the financial world, as its CEO, Jamie Dimon, argued in this space last week.</p><p>And scholars led by Robert Bork argued that big, dominating businesses are Not bad if their prices are low for consumers (corrected). Sometimes big companies are the most efficient, cheapest suppliers. Even if their inefficient small-business rivals get crushed.</p><p>But as trust-busters napped -- and the Obama Justice Department closed antitrust offices in Philadelphia and other towns -- it should be no surprise there are now very few American suppliers of some basic products, such as insulin for diabetes, balloon helium, or bread and breakfast-cereal grains -- and their rich owners are jacking up prices and reaping fat profits at consumers\u2019 expense.</p><p>The Trump administration has vowed to do something about monopoly power -- at least in the case of the big West Coast tech giants, whom the president and some of his supporters accuse of pandering to Democrats and liberals.</p><p>So Makan Delrahim, Justice\u2019s antitrust chief (who formerly advised Apple and other big companies), and Joe Simons, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, met last month -- at an antitrust conference in Cartagena, Colombia, Bloomberg reports -- to divide the four top tech players and investigate them.</p><p>Justice is looking at the smartphone-maker and music-retailer Apple and the search-shop-advertise heavyweight Google, both of which have been slapped hard by antitrust enforcers from the European Union. Those blows include $9 billion in fines against Google for its exclusionary Android, shopping, and ad policies, and ongoing probes of Apple\u2019s music and publishing market control.</p><p>Meanwhile, the FTC is reviewing the digital-shipping giant Amazon and social-media leader Facebook, and how they may \u201cmisuse their massive market power,\u201d as Reuters put it last week, helping send their shares lower on the stock market.</p><p>The president has made a crude popular case for this crusade, alleging that Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s customer-exclusion policies have been used to punish conservatives. Trump has also complained about the close (and mutually profitable, both sides claim) package-delivery business relationship between the Postal Service and Amazon, whose boss, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, famous for its scrutiny of presidents and government spending. Leftists make similar complaints that they are disproportionately targeted.</p><p>And why shouldn\u2019t Big Tech be able to drop some folks? As privately owned communications networks and publishers, digital services aren\u2019t subject to the common-carrier rules that force turnpikes, railroads, and landline phone systems to take all customers. They have a right to refuse your business for many reasons -- and legal duties to refuse some. Don\u2019t like their system? Choose another. Or build one.</p><p>But if these big private services have really become so powerful there are no effective alternatives, that\u2019s something the government can address. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have held hearings and are actively investigating digital markets and Big Tech dominance. News publishers have lately asked Congress for special powers so they can gang up to win a better split of Google and Facebook ad revenues for our stories, which have so far enriched Big Tech at our expense.</p><p>\u201cThere is lots of pent-up demand, on both sides of the aisle, to investigate,\" says Michael Carrier, a scholar of competition and antitrust law at Rutgers Camden Law School. He says European cases punish giants who crush small competitors and business customers. It was the European Commission that two years ago forced Wilmington-based DuPont to sell pesticide labs and factories to Philadelphia-based FMC before joining with Dow Chemical to form farm-sales giant Corteva.</p><p>Successful U.S. antitrust cases tend to focus more directly on harm to consumers. So Justice and the FTC may investigate freely, but they are only likely to bring cases founded on solid legal arguments, Carrier concludes: \u201cThey won\u2019t break companies up just because they are big.\u201d</p><p>A Wharton School report last week warned that digital giants and the control and privacy issues they raise \u201cdon\u2019t fall neatly under existing U.S. laws.\u201d</p><p>Wharton information-management professor Eric K. Clemons sees a \u201cvery strong\u201d case against Google, whose effective control of online search-and-buy, he told Knowledge at Wharton, has become so great that the company can charge retailers up to half the price of online-sales items for linking search keywords to their products.</p><p>Amazon is going further, \u201csystematically dropping\u201d small-business customers from its marketplace so it can better compete for their customers, Clemons added. \u201cThe abuse of small sellers does violate existing U.S. law, and that\u2019s a concern.\u201d</p><p>He also says Amazon\u2019s Alexa digital home assistant can easily default to order from Amazon\u2019s favored vendors (like Amazon\u2019s own Whole Foods), giving the company an unfair edge.</p><p>There are downsides to aggressive monopoly-busting. Breaking up Big Tech could boost the price of services that companies like Google give away. It could allow those rival, government-backed, foreign companies to step fast into the vacuum, gaining dominant share in global communications, data, sales, advertising.</p><p>But a lot might be gained, if regulators can get big businesses to ensure U.S. start-ups and competitors fair access to crucial communications, data, and payment networks, so they can grow for the next generation.</p><p>___ (c)2019 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.philly.com\">www.philly.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20190617-PHI-TRUST-BUSTERS-WHOSE-FOREBEARS-BROKE-UP-AT-T-WEIGH-617-20190617PHI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Philly.com KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC3-Y6P1-DYNS-30MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 </copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Philly.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 17, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

If you wonder why, consider this statement he gave us today on anti-trust efforts: \"In today's political climate, no entrepreneur looking to grow his or her business should ever consider voting Republican. The GOP's pro-oligarchy agenda has rigged the American economy against both workers and the majority of business owners. A handful of multi-national corporation and Wall Street investment firms are seeing enormous gains, while everyday entrepreneurs are being hung out to dry. </p><p>Now that the GOP controls Congress and the White House, it's no wonder so many corporations are driving up prices, lowering wages, and shipping jobs overseas. The greatest threat to American innovation, small business, and a resilient economy is the monopolization of industries. Democrats must lead the fight to break apart monopolies and big banks, and build a future economy that leaves no one behind.\" The other day, in the post about the undrained, fetid Trump Swamp[2], we included two lists of the worst Wall Street bribe takers in Congress. Although Ryan led the House list with $10,955,550 and McCain led the Senate list with $39,398,887, the Democrats who were taking the most in Wall Street bribes were virtually all influential party leaders. McCain was at the top of the list primarily because he ran for president. Exclude him and the biggest crook in Wall Street bribe congressional history-- excluding presidential candidates-- is Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer ($26,628,675), who gobbled up more than the Senate's two top Republicans-- McConnell ($12,149,201) and Cornyn ($8,649,666)-- combined! The top 5 crooks in the House were all Republicans but the 4 of the 5 Democratic crooks run the congressional party: \u2022 <person><nameText>Joe Crowley, </nameText></person>the heir apparent- $6,491,559 \u2022 Steny Hoyer, the Whip- $6,094,848 \u2022 Jim Himes, head of the New Dems- $5,773,452 \u2022 Nancy Pelosi, top dog- $3,650,387 To understand how internal party power is won and maintained, you have to understand the money flows from the banksters to the corrupt politicians, who lead each of the political parties. For example, it's important to understand the depth of Democratic Party corruption to fully understand the import of Danny Vinik's story about the new monopoly-busting[3]. <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc_ga_1Lm4o/Wb8xGxKQgII/AAAAAAABRaI/d6GHJvRhFQMdQO7pkXinmAu0YJ7tfe7tQCLcBGAs/s1600/google-monopoly.top.jpgAnti-trust\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc_ga_1Lm4o/Wb8xGxKQgII/AAAAAAABRaI/d6GHJvRhFQMdQO7pkXinmAu0YJ7tfe7tQCLcBGAs/s1600/google-monopoly.top.jpgAnti-trust</url> crusader Barry Lynn and his operation, Open Markets, \"has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it's time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.\"The problem, of course, is that Google and other tech giants-- and their multimillionaire executives-- are underwriting the Democratic Party and the careers of many of its leaders. Last cycle alone, computer software companies, for example, gave $10,438,708 to candidates for Congress-- $6,970,066 to Democrats and $3,354,067. Electronics manufacturing and equipment (which includes companies like Oracle, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Cisco Systems, Apple, Intel, IBM. Hewlett-Packard and other tech giants) contributed $26,349,245-- $16,837,279 to Democrats and $9,292,413 to Republicans. Among the biggest winners in the House were party leaders who did not have contests races but who always appreciate the help with building their power: \u2022 Paul Ryan (R-WI), Speaker- $236,065 \u2022 Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Majority Leader- $153,550 \u2022 Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Minority Leader- $91,187 \u2022 Steny Hoyer (D-MD)- Minority Whip- $75,400In 2016, Google's company PAC spent $2,178,015 on candidates, although more on Republicans than on Democrats. Candidates they maxed out to ($10,000 each) included committee chairmen and party leaders like Ryan (R), McCarthy (R), Pelosi (D), Hoyer (D), Jim Clyburn (D), Steve Scalise (R) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R). And they gave $30,000 each to the DCCC, the DSCC, the NRCC and the NRSC, as well as $10,000 pops to the corrupt leadership PAC run by criminal elements like Wasserman Schultz, the Blue Dog PAC, the New Dem PAC, Hoyer's PAC and so on. Lynn, a former journalist, has spent years building a public case that corporate monopoly is a growing threat, hiring like-minded thinkers and writers to advance the cause. The rest of his team has become increasingly high-profile, including Lina Khan, who earlier this year wrote an influential law-journal article[4] attacking Amazon as the new shape of anticompetitive corporate behavior; Matt Stoller, a prolific Twitter warrior who communicates weekly with lawmakers like Ro Khanna, the Silicon Valley-based congressman. Zephyr Teachout, the New York law professor and darling of the progressive left, will chair the board of the Open Markets Institute.Open war with a powerhouse like Google, risky as it sounds, is typical of Lynn's team, which is making a name for itself going after the largest possible targets in the Democratic universe. Khan's article spent 40,000 words targeting one of the biggest names in the Democrat-friendly tech industry. Stoller, who frequently trades barbs with leaders of the Democratic establishment, is known for frequent attacks on Barack Obama himself, who he has called a 'bad president' who is 'ideologically averse to democracy' and whose policies 'entrenched fraud and monopoly as the guiding principles in our commercial system[5].' At a time when Obama might be the only figure with some unifying power among Democrats, that amounts to something of a frontal attack on the very identity of the national party.'[Barry has] been fearless and persistent in pushing these issues,' said Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust lawyer at Paul Weiss. 'It's hard to think of somebody more central to the discussion than Barry and Open Markets.'Lynn and his team argue that the concentration of money and power in a small number of companies is a huge danger to our economy and politics, and that Washington's main weapon to combat it, antitrust law, has become rusty from lack of use. They want to revive the New Deal antitrust regime that prioritized competition and worried about the political power of large companies\u2014a reform that would represent a reboot of antitrust thinking for the new tech age and the kind of new political rallying point that Democrats have been looking for.Politically, it's novel territory: A populist philosophy that rejects both the technocratic approach of the Obama and Clinton administrations and the centralization at the heart of Bernie Sanders-style democratic socialism. Lynn and his team see themselves as essentially pro-competition and pro-business, creating new openings for smaller companies being boxed out by giants. At a time when the new Bernie-bro energy seems to be pulling the party toward its left fringe, they see this philosophy as offering a middle way, a populist agenda that can bring in independent-- maybe even Republican-- voters, appealing to a farmer in Des Moines, a small businessman in Dallas and a single mother in Detroit....[F]or all the Democratic Party's renewed interest in antitrust, it has still not adopted the more ambitious and controversial aspects of Open Markets' broader political philosophy. Notably, none of the new plans target Amazon, Google, Facebook or the other big tech firms that Open Markets believes are becoming the biggest threats to commercial freedom-- but are big political allies of the Democrats....In theory, Washington had a tool to deal with this problem in the form of antitrust law, which was once used to break up immense monopolies like Standard Oil. But in practice, that no longer happened. In 2006, in a much-discussed article for Harper's, he called for the break-up of Walmart, saying that the retail giant had too much power over its suppliers and workers. That eventually turned into his second book, Cornered, which came out in 2010 and traces the rise of modern-day antitrust policy. Since the New Deal, policymakers had looked skeptically on large firms, preventing mergers that would create huge corporations and breaking up companies that grew too big. But in 1978, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork published 'The Antitrust Paradox,' a nearly 500-page book that argued that antitrust policy should be concerned only with 'consumer welfare,' generally measured by consumer prices, and should not concern itself with the structure of markets. If prices were low, he argued, the market was working. Bork's consumer-focused approach gained the support of prominent liberal economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, and under President Ronald Reagan it became national policy. The \"consumer welfare\" framework has driven antitrust policy under both Democratic and Republican administrations ever since.Lynn argued that this approach was far too narrow and that it left the government powerless to fight some of the most damaging effects of corporate concentration. A monopolist can keep prices down and still cause harm-- by underpaying workers, for example, or influencing the political system. Lynn considers himself a deep believer in free market competition, a difference between the new antitrust movement and leftists, but he believes the government needs to play an active role in keeping those markets competitive. This philosophy dates back to the country's founding, when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argued that the government must protect individual citizens from monopolies; it was later reinvigorated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. (For that reason, the new antitrust movement is sometimes called the 'New Brandeis' movement; Stoller prefers Jeffersonian Democrats.)If that sounds grandly historical, Lynn has never been shy about the import of what he's doing. 'We are resurrecting a lost language of political economics,' said Lynn. 'The word 'political' has been lopped off from the word economics. We've been taught to see economics as an entirely technical sphere. We have these experts who study problems, like doctors studying a body, and they tell us what to do. The traditional political economics is all about the engineering of power.' In this view, the shape of markets is inherently a political decision, but for decades it has been depoliticized under the guise of economics. 'When the technocrats tell you it's science, that's bunk.''It is the extension of checks and balances into the political economy,' he added. 'Competition policy determines how individual citizens compete with one another. It is the way that we make our society. It touches on absolutely everything.'The Open Markets view is that government should use its antitrust powers broadly, to structure industries to meet societal goals. That structure would look different depending on the industry; industries that mass manufacture goods-- chemicals, cars, metals, for instance-- should be allowed to vertically integrate as long as they have real competitors, said Lynn. For farming, retail and services, antitrust would promote individual ownership, so that 'people who want to be an independent farmer or insurance agent or restaurateur, if they had the wherewithal to do so, could run their business without facing giant, super-capitalized predators.'In 2011, Lynn launched the Open Markets program at New America, an effort to take the ideas he developed in 'Cornered' and bring them to a wider, more influential audience. Lynn's first hire, Lina Khan, spent significant time out West, interviewing farmers and telling stories about their run-ins with the big meatpackers, like Tyson and Perdue. But more recently, Open Markets has become especially focused on the tech industry. The Silicon Valley behemoths, in this view, pose something of an existential threat not just to the economy but to democracy itself. 'We see these institutions as incredible, powerful and very useful,' said Stoller, 'but as concentrations of power that are dangerous.'The argument runs like this: By exerting such near-total dominance of their own channels-- Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social sharing-- the tech firms have become 21st century informational gatekeepers, controlling unprecedented quantities of data and building giant-- if unseen-- entry barriers that make it impossible for anyone to challenge them. But because these dangers are posed by companies offering consumers totally free services, or very low prices, they fly under the radar of current antitrust policy....Over the past two years, Open Markets' influence has grown quickly: The Obama administration warned last year about corporate concentration; Hillary Clinton issued a fact sheet calling for aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws; Democrats adopted an antitrust plank in their 2016 platform; and Democrats prioritized antitrust in their 'Better Deal' agenda. Open Markets has been involved in all these plans.Open Markets doesn't operate like a typical Washington think tank, spitting out an endless supply of white papers and policy memos and jamming them into the hands of congressional aides. In fact, it publishes very few papers at all. Instead, it focuses on conducting original research and writing articles for mainstream publications (including Politico, where Khan argued for significant reforms to the FTC). 'With a few exceptions, there's no reason to write up a policy paper and then convince a journalist to mention it someplace,' Lynn said. 'We can vertically integrate and do the writing ourselves.' The Washington Monthly, a left-leaning magazine founded in 1969, has become a frequent place to find work by Open Markets scholars; recent stories have focused on concentration in the airline and poultry industries and blamed monopolies for the decline in black-owned businesses and the rise in regional inequality.Lynn has also proven adept at managing and developing outside relationships, building a movement that extends beyond Washington. Joe Maxwell, a former lieutenant governor of Missouri and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, which focuses on antitrust and trade policy in the agricultural industry, first met Lynn a decade ago at the OCM's annual convention. Antitrust looms large in the agricultural world, in which many industries are dominated by a couple of major companies. Lynn has worked hard at building relationships with farmers like Maxwell and, importantly, bringing them together to form a more powerful political force. 'The central conduit was Barry Lynn,' said Maxwell. 'We discovered that there were more and more of us who thought the same way.'In early 2016, Lynn and a few colleagues had dinner with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had read some stories by Open Markets scholars and wanted to learn more about rising corporate concentration and the new antitrust movement. Soon after, a Warren aide contacted Lynn to say that the Massachusetts senator wanted to give a speech on antitrust. That speech, held in June and sponsored by Open Markets, marked a pivotal moment for the antitrust movement. 'I love markets,' Warren exclaimed to a packed room. 'Strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong, healthy America.' She went on to refute the Bork framework on antitrust and lamented that 'competition is dying.'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eSy22wx2Crk/Wb8xMXDQDSI/AAAAAAABRaM/gLHqFuFjhNYvxPsfaTsM4toXtmTviGNUQCLcBGAs/s1600/antitrust.jpgIn\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eSy22wx2Crk/Wb8xMXDQDSI/AAAAAAABRaM/gLHqFuFjhNYvxPsfaTsM4toXtmTviGNUQCLcBGAs/s1600/antitrust.jpgIn</url> a speech in October, Hillary Clinton delivered her own criticism of rising concentration and released a fact sheet on antitrust. Amid the numerous distractions in the presidential election, Clinton's commitment to stronger antitrust enforcement went largely unnoticed. But to the Open Markets team the message was clear: Mainstream Democrats had finally awoken to the problems of rising corporate concentration. It had been nearly two decades since the earthquake struck Taiwan and launched Lynn's interest in antitrust, but finally Washington was listening.But as Open Markets has begun to name names and push the envelope on what kinds of companies should count as a monopoly, it has run into some of the most powerful groups in Washington. During the drafting of the antitrust plank of the Democratic platform, Lynn and his colleagues pushed for language that would have directly targeted major technology companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. But each time they added that language to the platform, it would get removed; ultimately, it was dropped altogether. Likewise, the Democrats' 'Better Deal' agenda called out the airline, beer and eyeglasses industries-- but it doesn't mention the tech industry.Lynn is still thrilled with the platform and 'Better Deal' agenda; that antitrust policy has become a top priority for the Democrats is clearly a big victory for him. But the refusal to target the big tech firms is the clearest signal that Democrats aren't ready to jettison the consumer welfare framework and haven't yet totally bought into Open Markets' philosophy.'They've made a major step forward,' Lynn said. '[But] the difference is bigger than they realize.''We've seen that academic thinking can filter into policymaking. That's what Bork did,' said Representative Khanna. 'My hope is that Lina Khan's work will reorient antitrust to a concern on jobs and communities and concentration of power and move away from an absolutism about consumer prices.'To the new antitrust movement, the tech firms are something of a litmus test for the Democratic Party's commitment to the Brandeis and Jeffersonian vision of antitrust policy. To Stoller and Lynn, Obama clearly failed that test. The Obama administration largely embraced the tech companies, with a revolving door to the industry: Numerous tech workers, especially from Google, temporarily joined the administration. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe left politics to become Uber's top lobbyist, and now has a senior role at the private foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. More broadly, Democrats draw on Silicon Valley both for money and expertise. If Democrats were really to target these firms-- by calling for utility-like regulation, for instance-- the political consequences could be severe.Philosophically, it's hard for the Democrats to let go of the centrist dream of the 1990s, one that Bill Clinton rode to such success\u2014that good technocratic governance is perfectly compatible with staying friendly to big global corporations. That technocratic approach achieved a lot of good, Democrats argue, and blowing it up-- whether for the sake of principle, or to chase a new populist coalition-- is unnecessarily risky. And it may not be a turnkey solution to today's economic problems and the party's political issues. 'Antitrust is a critical part of this,' said Neera Tanden, the former Obama adviser who now runs the Center for American Progress. 'It's not the only issue that progressives need to address.'For Open Markets, this philosophy is not just about antitrust. It's about structuring markets to promote competition. Stoller draws a direct line from the Bork revolution to the election of Donald Trump. Rising concentration, in this view, has led to a litany of economic and social ills, enabling corporations to amass huge amounts of power over working Americans and fostering a deep-seated anger at the political establishment. 'The New Dealers were very worried about autocracy and financial autocracy,' he said. 'They would've understood that Trump is a result of a society that has lost control of its ability to manage its commercial institutions.'He added, 'We're trying to bring this tradition back.\"Orlando Democrat Alan Grayson explained why he sees this kind of antitrust action as important in the current political climate: \"The secret ingredient to capitalism is competition.\u00a0Without competition, capitalism doesn't work.\u00a0Monopolies and oligopolies grow larger and larger, and wealth and power accumulate in a small number of small hands.\u00a0That threatens democracy, and impels us toward a Soviet-style economy and polity.\" Even a Republican should be able to understand this and see the dangerous implications.It wasn't that long ago that Congress had an effective and powerful spokesperson for economic populism from the state of North Carolina-- Brad Miller. As soon as the Republicans gained control of the state legislature and governor's mansion they set about to gerrymander Miller out of his seat-- which they did in 2012. We still harbor hopes that he'll get back into elective politics at some point. Anti-trust and monopoly issues are part of his bailiwick and we asked him to comment about the politics behind the effort. His response is very much worth reading: This is now the fault line between the establishment and reform wings of the Democratic Party. Voters may not be antitrust policy wonks, but they get the problem with the concentration of power. Internet and cable providers are always high on the list of the most hated companies in America. It will not be hard to persuade voters that the problem there, the reason Americans have the crappiest and most expensive internet service in the developed world, is lack of competition. And that because economic power has become so concentrated, competition in many industries has been smothered in the crib. They know that the companies with monopoly economic power have way, way too much political power, and that they get screwed as a result.This was a big issue in the behind-the-scenes jostling between the establishment and reform wings over the expected Clinton transition. Reformers were not going to accept nominees for antitrust policy spots on the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice who went to good schools and did well and then went to work for prestigious law firms, but thought we just needed to restore the economic status quo that we had before the financial crisis. We wanted people who had a credible commitment to bring back antitrust.I polled in my own district the legislation to break up the big banks. I figured since I'd introduced it, I should probably figure out if voters liked it, although I had a pretty good idea. The two reasons I gave in the poll question for the bill was that we shouldn't ever have to bail the big banks out again, and because they had too much power. It was wildly popular.The problem in the poll and in politics generally is that people are pretty skeptical now of what politicians say. There was a pretty good-sized chunk of voters who liked the bill, but didn't really believed I'd introduced it, or thought there was some catch. They certainly didn't think it was something that really made me different from other Democrats.Voters now think that whatever politicians say in public, something else happens when the doors close in Washington and the real decisions are made. And they're right about that.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometerTim\">https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometerTim</url> Canova is a Florida law professor who has been fighting these kinds of battles against big money interests for many years. Now it's spilled into politics as he takes on one of the most craven ands corrupt protectors of corporate dominance: Debbie Wasserman Schultz. \"Democrats have been far too complicit for far too long in the gutting of antitrust enforcement and the rise of monopolies and cartels that gouge consumers, exploit workers, and corrupt our political system,\" time told us this morning. \"In addition to renewed antitrust enforcement to prevent mega mergers and break up huge concentrations of corporate power, we need to reform the board rooms of giant corporations as well. As long as corporate CEOs effectively handpick board members, the gains from their cartels will flow mainly to top management and the wealthiest shareholders. If publicly-traded corporations were required to include representatives of workers, environmentalists, and taxpayers on their boards, there would likely be more effective oversight of management, less systematic frauds on consumers, and less damage to the environment. None of these needed reforms are possible as long as we keep electing career politicians who are taking huge campaign contributions from big corporate interests. That's why we need campaign finance reform, publicly financed elections, free TV and cable airtime for federal candidates, and much higher progressive tax rates on the super-wealthy to prevent them from corrupting the political process with huge campaign contributions.\" Play Video[6] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sb_-wfmJnHA\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sb_-wfmJnHA</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://downwithtyranny.blogspot.com/2017/09/no-one-in-history-has-ever-presided.html\">https://downwithtyranny.blogspot.com/2017/09/no-one-in-history-has-ever-presided.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/17/open-markets-google-antitrust-barry-lynn-000523\">http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/17/open-markets-google-antitrust-barry-lynn-000523</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/885937869487042560\">https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/885937869487042560</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/icxwiUbH6cg\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/icxwiUbH6cg</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DOWT1093081505840928868251762100188</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOWT-7597</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHG-Y341-F03R-N49F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4292\"/><timeReceived>5:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>DownWithTyranny</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 19, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>anti-trust</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brad Miller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>monopolies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kaniela Ing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alan Grayson</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tim Canova</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ro Khanna</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X84</classCode><className>US STATE GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>State &amp;

Federal regulators broke up Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly, kept DuPont from dominating military supply, and broke Ma Bell into what's now Verizon and other pieces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it's been popular, since the Nixon-Reagan-Clinton trade deals, to neglect old ways of measuring monopoly. If IBM, Exxon, GM, and DuPont have to compete with government-backed Chinese and European companies at home and abroad, does it make sense to punish them if some of their products are extra popular with U.S. buyers?</p><p>Break up JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, and you just invite government-backed Chinese banks to run the financial world, as its CEO, Jamie Dimon, argued in this space last week.</p><p>And scholars led by Robert Bork argued that big businesses are bad if their prices are low for consumers. Sometimes big companies are the most efficient, cheapest suppliers. Even if their inefficient small-business rivals get crushed.</p><p>But as trustbusters napped - and the Obama Justice Department closed antitrust offices in Philadelphia and other towns - it should be no surprise there are now very few American suppliers of some basic products, such as insulin for diabetes, balloon helium, or bread and breakfast-cereal grains - and their rich owners are jacking up prices and reaping fat profits at consumers' expense.</p><p>The Trump administration has vowed to do something about monopoly power - at least in the case of the big West Coast tech giants, whom the president and some of his supporters accuse of pandering to Democrats and liberals.</p><p>So Makan Delrahim, Justice's antitrust chief (who formerly advised Apple and other big companies), and Joe Simons, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, met last month - at an antitrust conference in Cartagena, Colombia, Bloomberg reports - to divide the four top tech players and investigate them.</p><p>Justice is looking at the smartphone-maker and music-retailer Apple and the search-shop-advertise heavyweight Google, both of which have been slapped hard by antitrust enforcers from the European Union. Those blows include $9 billion in fines against Google for its exclusionary Android, shopping, and ad policies, and ongoing probes of Apple's music and publishing market control.</p><p>Meanwhile, the FTC is reviewing the digital-shipping giant Amazon and social-media leader Facebook, and how they may \"misuse their massive market power,\" as Reuters put it last week, helping send their shares lower on the stock market.</p><p>The president has made a crude popular case for this crusade, alleging that Facebook's and Twitter's customer-exclusion policies have been used to punish conservatives. Trump has also complained about the close (and mutually profitable, both sides claim) package-delivery business relationship between the Postal Service and Amazon, whose boss, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, famous for its scrutiny of presidents and government spending. Leftists make similar complaints that they are disproportionately targeted.</p><p>And why shouldn't Big Tech be able to drop some folks? As privately owned communications networks and publishers, digital services aren't subject to the common-carrier rules that force turnpikes, railroads, and landline phone systems to take all customers. They have a right to refuse your business for many reasons - and legal duties to refuse some. Don't like their system? Choose another. Or build one.</p><p>But if these big private services have really become so powerful there are no effective alternatives, that's something the government can address. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have held hearings and are actively investigating digital markets and Big Tech dominance. News publishers have lately asked Congress for special powers so they can gang up to win a better split of Google and Facebook ad revenues for our stories, which have so far enriched Big Tech at our expense.</p><p>\"There is lots of pent-up demand, on both sides of the aisle, to investigate,\" says Michael Carrier, a scholar of competition and antitrust law at Rutgers Camden Law School. He says European cases punish giants who crush small competitors and business customers. It was the European Commission that two years ago forced Wilmington-based DuPont to sell pesticide labs and factories to Philadelphia-based FMC before joining with Dow Chemical to form farm-sales giant Corteva.</p><p>Successful U.S. antitrust cases tend to focus more directly on harm to consumers. So Justice and the FTC may investigate freely, but they are only likely to bring cases founded on solid legal arguments, Carrier concludes: \"They won't break companies up just because they are big.\"</p><p>A Wharton School report last week warned that digital giants and the control and privacy issues they raise \"don't fall neatly under existing U.S. laws.\"</p><p>Wharton information-management professor Eric K. Clemons sees a \"very strong\" case against Google, whose effective control of online search-and-buy, he told Knowledge at Wharton, has become so great that the company can charge retailers up to half the price of online-sales items for linking search keywords to their products.</p><p>Amazon is going further, \"systematically dropping\" small-business customers from its marketplace so it can better compete for their customers, Clemons added. \"The abuse of small sellers does violate existing U.S. law, and that's a concern.\"</p><p>He also says Amazon's Alexa digital home assistant can easily default to order from Amazon's favored vendors (like Amazon's own Whole Foods), giving the company an unfair edge.</p><p>There are downsides to aggressive monopoly-busting. Breaking up Big Tech could boost the price of services that companies like Google give away. It could allow those rival, government-backed, foreign companies to step fast into the vacuum, gaining dominant share in global communications, data, sales, advertising.</p><p>But a lot might be gained, if regulators can get big businesses to ensure U.S. start-ups and competitors fair access to crucial communications, data, and payment networks, so they can grow for the next generation.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:JoeD@inquirer.com\">JoeD@inquirer.com</email></p><p>215-854-5194 PhillyJoeD</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20190616Ar04400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC2-MKX1-JC3R-B20P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 16, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

There have been many subsequent laws implemented since the Sherman Act at both the state and federal level\u2014commonly referred to as the United States Antitrust Laws\u2014with the sole purpose of regulating the market to ensure fair competition. But with President Trump's threat to use antitrust laws against Amazon and other tech giants in an interview with Axios on November 6, it's now clearer than ever that our antitrust laws are antiquated and useless. </p><p>Beyond that, they're often merely a ploy the government uses to cover up the cronyism that leads to the creation of monopolistic giants in the first place. Still, during this conversation with Axios, Trump claimed that companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook are monopolies and threatened to use antitrust laws to break them up, asserting[1] that his administration is '...looking at [antitrust] very seriously:'The Monopoly That Isn'tWhile Facebook and Google both bring in large sums of annual revenue, they do not have a hold on the market. But are these companies even monopolies? Let's look at Amazon, for instance. According to Jodi Seth, Amazon's Head of Policy Communications, Amazon only controls 5 percent[2] of the US retail market and only 1 percent of the global economy. While Amazon is certainly a large company and has experienced rapid success, they are hardly a monopoly. A monopoly has complete control over a service or good and is able to prevent other businesses from competing. Amazon does not fit into this description\u2014and neither do Facebook or Google, for that matter. While Facebook and Google both bring in large sums of annual revenue, they do not have a hold on the market. Competitors exist\u2014whether it's Twitter taking users from Facebook or Bing as an alternative to Google's search engine. Many falsely equate monetary success with monopoly behavior, but it's simply not true. A monopoly isn't about dollars, it's about exclusive control. The mischaracterization of tech giants as monopolies is not unique to President Trump, as ever since the implementation[3] of the Sherman Act there has been great confusion over what actually constitutes a monopoly and monopolistic behavior. This confusion eventually led to further antitrust laws. What was meant to protect the economy was used as nothing more than a virtue signal. Despite what was written into law, the government used antitrust legislation to choose between good businesses and bad businesses. For example, the tobacco industry was deemed a bad business despite their fair pricing. This interference would thus create monopolies in industries that might not have ever become one in the first place (Think AT...nd the US Postal Service). What was meant to protect the economy was used as nothing more than a virtue signal.The Industrial Technological RevolutionWhen the Sherman Act was first introduced, America was experiencing rapid economic growth on one hand and striking poverty on the other. It makes sense why\u2014at the time\u2014antitrust legislation would be comforting. It was meant to protect people from big businesses that create concentrated wealth and take away opportunities from the poor. But history has taught us that this was only true in theory. We are now in an entirely different period of history where technological advances are creating opportunities for all Americans like never before. One might even go so far as to claim we are in a technological revolution. Despite these rapid changes that have strengthened our economy, many argue there are still economic disparities. Does this mean we should use legislation to prohibit economic growth overall? According to President Trump and other 'trust-busters,' the answer is yes. Microsoft did not use coercion with their consumers, nor did they prevent consumers from going anywhere else. While Trump's motives may be different, using antitrust laws to regulate big businesses actually harms the economy by taking down businesses that employ thousands of people and interfering with the free market. Microsoft was a victim of exactly this. In 1998, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Microsoft[4] after accusing the company of being a monopoly in an effort to get consumers to use their products. The DOJ argued that by giving away their software for free through bundling, Microsoft was prohibiting consumer choice and thereby preventing other companies from competing. Many looked down on this practice; however, it does not qualify as monopoly behavior. Microsoft did not use coercion with their consumers, nor did they prevent consumers from going anywhere else\u2014they simply gave products out for free. Clearly, consumers weren't exactly suffering under this 'monopoly behavior.' Despite this, the DOJ won the lawsuit, and Microsoft took a major financial hit. The government used antitrust legislation to put Microsoft in its place instead of allowing consumers to determine who should get their business. Unfortunately, Trump's approach is no different. Instead of thinking about ways to increase competition against tech giants, Trump is relying on intimidation and threats. Not all tech giants are monopolies, and their existence alone does not warrant government interference. It's true that there are many issues with tech platforms that we must deal with as a society. However, history has proven time and time again that often, 'trust-busting' creates more problems than solutions. For decades now, antitrust laws have been tools for the government to control the market as they see fit and have produced no real results for consumers. The Trump administration should not look for ways to control highly successful businesses. Rather, our government should allow the market to sort itself out. After all, the customer knows best.

The most recent example is contained in a 70-page pamphlet issued by Bill Galston, a former <person><nameText>Bill Clinton </nameText></person>aide and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Bill Kristol, founder and editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard. With their newly incorporated non-profit The New Center, they hope to refocus political dialogue. </p><p>The pamphlet includes seven 'Ideas to Re-center America.'[1] Idea number 1 offered by the authors challenges the Titans of Technology. Galston and Kristol point out that 'America's five largest technology companies\u2014Apple, Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014dominate the economy and their respective markets like few businesses in the modern era.' Examples: Facebook controls the social feed of 2 billion active monthly users, nearly one-quarter of the world's population; Alphabet (Google) owns 81% of the search engine market; one out of every two dollars spent online goes through Amazon. While the authors recognize the companies for their success, they raise a warning flag of concentrated power that leads to monopolistic behavior. Similar monopoly situations have met legislative and regulatory actions in the past. Unlike companies like Standard Oil, which controlled a commodity, the tech companies control 'unprecedented amount of data, the most valuable asset in the world today,' Galston and Kristol write. The threat of a dominating and a domineering Silicon Valley has been long understood by Joel Kotkin, Presidential Fellow in Urban Futures at Chapman University and a recognized authority on economic, political and social trends. He has written extensively[2]\u00a0about what he terms the 'oligarchs' of Silicon Valley. 'The tech moguls have morphed from exemplary entrepreneurs to something closer to the rent-seeking oligarchs in Russia. They pose a huge threat to competition and perhaps the middle class in a way not seen since the gilded age,' Kotkin wrote. Kotkin notes that the tech titans became wealthy the same way John D. Rockefeller became rich: control of markets. He warns the big tech companies can 'morph into conglomerates buy their way into what were once seen as unrelated markets.' Galston and Kristol argue that unlike during the age of the so-called robber barons, there is little widespread anger against big tech because the public views the companies favorably. But that attitude may be changing across the political spectrum as this report in Politico suggests[3]. Kotkin bluntly says of the Silicon Valley tech leaders, 'They have bought off the progressives with contributions and by endorsing their social liberal and environmental agenda.' But Kotkin also thinks the 'oligarchs are losing their popularity pretty rapidly.' For Galston and Kristol, the solution to deal with the tech titans is to stiffen the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890, used by Teddy Roosevelt to break up monopolies[4].\u00a0Galston and Kristol propose new laws to: Address the ways that digital companies are using network effects to crowd out potential competitors; Redefine and crack down on predatory pricing practices; Toughen scrutiny of mergers that threaten competition within sectors; Take seriously the anti-competitive effects of vertical integration; Enact new rules and procedures to speed antitrust litigation, which sometimes drags on for a decade or more; Explore the use of free services to disguise monopolistic advertising practices Silicon Valley and other tech titans will resist a move to crack down on their ever-growing power. Yet, history could repeat. Teddy Roosevelt believed it was not the government but the people speaking through the government[5]\u00a0that demanded regulation of all-powerful companies. The voices are getting louder.

The most recent example is contained in a 70-page pamphlet issued by Bill Galston, a former <person><nameText>Bill Clinton </nameText></person>aide and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Bill Kristol, founder and editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard. With their newly incorporated non-profit The New Center, they hope to refocus political dialogue. </p><p>The pamphlet includes seven 'Ideas to Re-center America.'[1] Idea number 1 offered by the authors challenges the Titans of Technology. Galston and Kristol point out that 'America's five largest technology companies Apple, Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft dominate the economy and their respective markets like few businesses in the modern era.' Examples: Facebook controls the social feed of 2 billion active monthly users, nearly one-quarter of the world's population; Alphabet (Google) owns 81% of the search engine market; one out of every two dollars spent online goes through Amazon. While the authors recognize the companies for their success, they raise a warning flag of concentrated power that leads to monopolistic behavior. Similar monopoly situations have met legislative and regulatory actions in the past. Unlike companies like Standard Oil, which controlled a commodity, the tech companies control 'unprecedented amount of data, the most valuable asset in the world today,' Galston and Kristol write. The threat of a dominating and a domineering Silicon Valley has been long understood by Joel Kotkin, Presidential Fellow in Urban Futures at Chapman University and a recognized authority on economic, political and social trends. He has written extensively[2]\u00a0about what he terms the 'oligarchs' of Silicon Valley. 'The tech moguls have morphed from exemplary entrepreneurs to something closer to the rent-seeking oligarchs in Russia. They pose a huge threat to competition and perhaps the middle class in a way not seen since the gilded age,' Kotkin wrote. Kotkin notes that the tech titans became wealthy the same way John D. Rockefeller became rich: control of markets. He warns the big tech companies can 'morph into conglomerates buy their way into what were once seen as unrelated markets.' Galston and Kristol argue that unlike during the age of the so-called robber barons, there is little widespread anger against big tech because the public views the companies favorably. But that attitude may be changing across the political spectrum as this report in Politico suggests[3]. Kotkin bluntly says of the Silicon Valley tech leaders, 'They have bought off the progressives with contributions and by endorsing their social liberal and environmental agenda.' But Kotkin also thinks the 'oligarchs are losing their popularity pretty rapidly.' For Galston and Kristol, the solution to deal with the tech titans is to stiffen the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890, used by Teddy Roosevelt to break up monopolies[4].\u00a0Galston and Kristol propose new laws to: Address the ways that digital companies are using network effects to crowd out potential competitors; Redefine and crack down on predatory pricing practices; Toughen scrutiny of mergers that threaten competition within sectors; Take seriously the anti-competitive effects of vertical integration; Enact new rules and procedures to speed antitrust litigation, which sometimes drags on for a decade or more; Explore the use of free services to disguise monopolistic advertising practices Silicon Valley and other tech titans will resist a move to crack down on their ever-growing power. Yet, history could repeat. Teddy Roosevelt believed it was not the government but the people speaking through the government[5]\u00a0that demanded regulation of all-powerful companies. The voices are getting louder.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren's Friday proposal to break up big tech companies bears out my warning on this site[1] from last September that tech companies' actions are setting the stage for a return to Teddy Roosevelt type trust-busting. </p><p>In her post explaining her plans[2] to break up the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon, Warren referred to the trust busting efforts of the early 20thcentury. She argues that now, like a hundred years ago, monopolies are bad and competition is good. The growing tech giants that gobble up competitors wipe out the competition that is needed to make companies better and stymies innovation. Wonder if she applies that same philosophy to government monopolies that attempt to thwart competition in the field of education? But I digress. Months ago, the U.S. Justice Department gave notice that it too was looking into the growing concern that big tech was hurting competition and stifling the free exchange of ideas. The concern I raised last September that social media platforms could be declared public utilities is a plan Warren embraced as something called 'platform utilities.' Warren wrote: 'These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.' How will the Valley respond? Days before Warren's announcement, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg declared a new 'privacy manifesto' to reassure users about Facebook's concern over privacy issues. Big tech is feeling heat. However, the offered solutions won't turn down the flame. Both the New York Times[3]and the Wall Street Journal[4] panned Zuckerberg's proposal. Be careful of all the regulators Warren plans to send out across the Internet to force the break-ups and the post break-up adherences to whatever rules are created. There is also a danger to innovation and entrepreneurship from a swarming locust of regulators. At the end of my trust busting column last September I asked: 'Is it too hard to imagine that either political party, sensing public frustration with the dominance of the Internet mega companies, could pull out Teddy Roosevelt's big stick and attempt to re-create some form of trust busting for the modern era?' Now, Warren has introduced the idea into the presidential contest, which begs the question, what will be the political repercussions? Silicon Valley has had a cozy relationship with Democrats, sending large portions of political donations to Democrats. Will Republicans stand up for these businesses with the possible payoff of Silicon Valley donors switching sides? Or will vote counters find that the trust busting appeals to the public and Republicans will come up with their own version of tech break-ups, presumably with fewer regulators? And, how will Kamala Harris respond? The California senator has good relationships in the Silicon Valley and counted on her friends there to support her presidential bid. Keeping a distance from the Warren proposals could strengthen her ties with Valley leaders at the risk of offending progressive voters who want to take big business down.

Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the tech industry \u2014 which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world\u2019s knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button \u2014 has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that\u2019s just the beginning of the list.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>the Massachusetts senator who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">released proposals this month</url> that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, \u201cWe have a major monopoly problem.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Ms. Warren\u2019s and Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s ideas was surprisingly receptive.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to break these guys apart,\u201d Ms. Warren said in an interview on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters.</p><p>\u201cA billionaire, right?\u201d Ms. Warren noted.</p><p>For decades, a politician who mentioned \u201cantitrust\u201d was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. \u201cAntitrust\u201d was relegated to the shelf with \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201cwealth inequality\u201d and \u201chigher taxes for higher incomes.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that what could be called \u201cmaximum antitrust\u201d \u2014 when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up \u2014 has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/19/business/microsoft-on-trial-the-overview-microsoft-goes-to-court.html\">case against Microsoft</url> in 2001. Only AT&amp;T, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government\u2019s point of view.</p><p>The political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what\u2019s best for America. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cozy relationship.</p><p>\u201cSomething has definitely changed,\u201d said Geoffrey A. Manne, the founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. \u201cMost voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there\u2019s also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and AT&amp;T, eviscerated Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp <url normalizedValue=\"https://truthonthemarket.com/2019/03/09/warren-wants-to-turn-facebook-into-a-literal-sewer-service/\">in a recent blog post</url>. They wrote that the senator\u2019s plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated \u201cplatform utilities\u201d would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak.</p><p>And yet, Mr. Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come.</p><p>\u201cThere is a long history in America \u2014 just not a recent one \u2014 of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may be at that moment again.\u201d</p><p>The financial firms were predatory last decade, exploiting weak spots in the mortgage markets in a way that undermined their viability. Google and Facebook, by contrast, offer their services for free, while Amazon built its reputation on selling as cheaply as possible. That makes it hard to regulate them by the antitrust consensus, which for a couple of decades has held that there is no injury unless consumers directly suffer by paying higher prices.</p><p>Nothing is ever really free, of course, and there has been a dawning realization among some consumers that they are paying for these services with information about themselves. How most users feel about this seems up in the air, as evidenced by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/surveymonkey-axios-poll-privacy-deep-dive/\">a new SurveyMonkey poll</url> done for the news site Axios.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/a-growing-majority-now-views-our-online-privacy-as-a-crisis-1552080369-94146f05-332d-465d-a136-4414f9cdf9ce.html\">headline finding</url> was that \u201ca growing majority now views our online privacy as a crisis.\u201d But deeper in the survey was the revelation that more than half the respondents said they were unwilling to pay to keep from being tracked by a service they were using. Twenty-one percent said they would pay less than $1 a month, and no more, for the right.</p><p>Users, it seems, want it both ways: privacy and free services. This is the contradiction at the heart of the internet.</p><p>Daniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal might be a hard sell to voters. \u201cThe median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,\u201d he said.</p><p>But Mr. Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies\u2019 worries. \u201cA likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected,\u201d he said. \u201cEven just the rhetoric can complicate their lives and put pressure going forward.\u201d</p><p>That is already happening. One of the anti-competitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere. That prevented a new platform from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edge.</p><p>Amazon ended this practice in Europe six years ago, but it continued in the United States. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, asked for regulators to investigate in December. Last week, Amazon confirmed that it had dropped the requirement.</p><p>Antitrust talk emboldens competitors as well. Google controls much of the market for online ads in Australia, just as it does elsewhere. That presents a big problem for News Corporation, which owns eight of the 10 largest papers in the country.</p><p>The Rupert Murdoch-controlled media conglomerate asked Australian regulators last week to take the \u201cvery serious step\u201d of breaking up Google in the country because of the \u201cunparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alike.\u201d</p><p>In this new environment, winning can soon look a lot like losing.</p><p>Amazon opposed a proposal in Seattle last spring for a corporate tax to help the homeless, and succeeded in getting it cut in half. Then the retailer decided it just couldn\u2019t live with the measure at all. A repeal effort began. The City Council <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/technology/seattle-tax-amazon.html\">killed the tax</url> just as it was going into effect.</p><p>At the time, that looked like another triumph for Amazon. But in the months since, even some of those who thought the tax was a bad idea have found their views evolving.</p><p>\u201cMy feelings about Amazon have changed, and not in a good way,\u201d said Julie Shapiro, a Seattle University professor of family law. \u201cI think they want the ability to be a bully and, once they have it, they\u2019re quite willing to use it.\u201d</p><p>That is the crux of the issue: Can a company be dominant without coming off as a bully? It is no accident that the company that was the subject of the biggest antitrust action in the last quarter-century \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 had a terrible reputation in the tech community. Voters love innovation, convenience and entrepreneurs.

Not all listings go badly, but too often it seems companies go public to create a windfall for existing stakeholders, rather than genuinely to raise money for expansion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overall, including successful IPOs, research by Merian Global Investors shows expected growth rates for the first two years after listing are typically around 50 per cent of those achieved in the two years pre-IPO. Such disparity raises concern investors in public markets are missing out, especially as companies in emerging industries such as fintech show a propensity to stay private for longer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On average, the time between new companies' date of incorporation and when they IPO has risen from five to 11 years, a trend underpinned by the multitude of financing options available to businesses. With cost of capital suppressed by low interest rates and competition to invest in their equity, innovators can eschew the short-term focus on earnings that comes with a public listing and work with patient investors who back their vision.</p><p>                     Closed ended funds open venture capital and private equity opportunities                   </p><p>Investment companies are one of the few ways retail investors can access growth opportunities off exchange. Unlisted investments have no guaranteed price discovery mechanism of their own, so being able to publicly trade the shares of holding investment companies adds a layer of liquidity. The caveat is investment companies' share prices fall in periods when it is hard to realise value on underlying portfolios. Yet, given the problems open-ended funds have faced liquidating unquoted assets to meet redemptions (another issue highlighted in the Woodford saga), closed-end structures are a more attractive option.</p><p>For investors who can afford to sit tight during economic uncertainty, a wealth of opportunity in venture capital and private equity is unlocked. Historically, start-ups would have been considered the domain of venture capital, with private equity more likely to target management buy-outs and spin-offs of corporate divisions. Nowadays, the trend in companies staying private and the prominence of tech and tech-enabled disruptors creates cross-over and competition for equity in these businesses. That said, asset managers exist in a variety of structures and investment companies specialise in different industry sectors and stages of funding, so there is great diversity in exposure and management style.</p><p>                     Path to profitability crucial for technology                    </p><p>Haunting memories of the dotcom bubble encourage scrutiny of technology businesses, especially those yet to turn a profit. Some investors will baulk at entrusting money off exchange, where there is less official requirement for visibility, but specialist fund managers are well placed to assess companies' progress towards sustainable earnings growth and cash generation.</p><p>Augmentum Fintech (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">AUGM</url>) holdings include digital investment platform Interactive Investor; pan-European challenger banking service Monese; providers of banking services to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) like Tide and Iwoca; and Zopa, the world's first peer-to-peer lending platform. Some of these brands are gathering prominence but the key to Augmentum's approach, described by chief executive Tim Levene, is \"not being seduced by the sizzle, but by the substance\" of opportunities. He also stresses the importance of board representation (and therefore full information rights) and a manageable sized portfolio of investments: \"You can't spray and pray your cash hoping for rocket ships\".</p><p>If a business isn't yet profitable, Mr Levene lists acquisition costs, break-even points, retention rates and the expected lifetime value of customers as key performance indicators, and evidence of a scalable addressable market is crucial. What would make him nervous by contrast is \"a business blindly building a customer base, where there is no certainty of long-term viability because [customer] unit economics aren't compelling\".</p><p>                     Finding a niche, adding value and economic moats                   </p><p>Augmentum invests as a straightforward investment company, although its approach to stewardship has plenty in common with private equity firms that take great interest in helping businesses appoint experienced non-exec directors, recruit talented senior staff and manage capital structure. Adding value during the holding period means a profit on exiting the investment is more assured than just relying on continued froth in capital markets to drive up the price.</p><p>One drawback of investing off exchange is the competition for quality assets bids up prices to an extent that creates significant valuation risk. Global private equity monitor Preqin estimated at second quarter's end 2019, private equity funds globally had $1.54 trillion cash not invested (referred to as \"dry powder\" by the industry).  Combined with demand from sovereign funds, corporate M&amp;A activity, pension and endowment funds, upward pressure on prices is inevitable.</p><p>There is, however, enormous variation between fund strategies. Just as Augmentum specialises in providing venture capital to fintech firms, private equity groups with a niche are better placed to meet the challenge posed by valuations. Oakley Capital, which is a limited liability partnership (LLP), has a series of funds that invest in unquoted equity, with a specialty in European businesses founded by entrepreneurs. </p><p>In private equity partnerships, the general partners (GPs) manage the investments in the funds, that are made with capital raised from limited partners (LPs), which can include large institutional funds or family offices and, in the case of Oakley Capital, its listed closed-end investment company Oakley Capital Investments (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">OCI</url>). As well as stakes in the Oakley Capital managed funds, OCI has some direct co-investments in private equity, that are managed by Oakley Capital.</p><p>                      The acquisition of a controlling stake in German e-gift card business Seven Miles in August 2019 added a business to the portfolio that is well placed to take advantage of a market expected to grow at 15 per cent a year                    </p><p>Recent deals by the managed funds have demonstrated a flair for merger and acquisition activity and a focus on buying into businesses with proven cash flows, scalability and barriers to entry. In May 2019, the acquisitions of maritime e-learning businesses Videotel and Seagull, were combined in a deal described by Partner Rebecca Gibson as representing \"the sweet spot\" of Oakley's investing strategy. Synergies were identified to cut overheads and improve technologies that provide mariners with safety training that is required both by government regulators and insurers - so future revenue streams are very stable. On valuation, Ms Gibson emphasises discipline in bidding for assets to ensure Oakley maximises upside from the benefits it brings to businesses: \"[we] don't pay for the synergies up front\". </p><p>The partnership's overall portfolio is split across three main areas - TMT (technology, media and telecoms), education and consumer. The acquisition of a controlling stake in German e-gift card business Seven Miles in August 2019 added a business to the portfolio that is well placed to take advantage of a market expected to grow at 15 per cent a year. Seven Miles offers digital gift vouchers that can be redeemed at multiple retailers. Its technology is difficult to replicate, and 80 per cent adoption by German retail partners provides another barrier to competition.</p><p>Much is owed to a network of entrepreneurs, which Ms Gibson cites as a key differentiator, \"[these types of] opportunities don't often cross the desks of other groups\". Operating in this segment of the private equity space has helped Oakley add value and, as a common exit strategy has been to sell assets on to other private equity or strategic corporate buyers, arguably it has turned demand for quality to its advantage.</p><p>                     Diversification across the private equity universe                   </p><p>Broader investing strategies manage the challenges of private equity valuations differently. Pantheon International (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">PIN</url>), is the oldest PE fund-of-funds listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Since inception in 1987, it has achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 12 per cent in terms of net asset value (NAV), and share price gains have been at a rate of 11.5 per cent a year.</p><p>The investment company is referred to as PIP (although the ticker is PIN) and it invests across the private equity universe, diversifying exposure across geographies, industries and managers - including fund maturity and the stage of investment they specialise in. Although the portfolio is exposed to dozens of different funds and companies, there is a rigorous methodology behind risk allocations. Primary funds, where the managers have initiated a private equity investment, make up 27 per cent of the portfolio; 40 per cent of the portfolio is allocated to secondary funds (that acquire interests in private equity); and 33 per cent is co-investment in businesses alongside PE managers.</p><p>Although the investment universe is broad, Partner Helen Steers says PIP is very actively managed, with flexibility to tilt the portfolio between sectors. Close attention is paid to the liquidity profile of the portfolio as well as generating cash to reinvest in the vehicle. Recognising large buy-outs as a funding stage where multiples are inflated, 60 per cent of the portfolio is focused on small- and mid-sized buyouts and growth strategies. There is enormous dispersion of returns in the PE sector and Ms Steers emphasises there is 2,000 basis points difference between the top and third quartile of PE funds' performance.</p><p>Getting manager selection right is a balance of qualitative and quantitative factors. \"On the quant side, we look at track record in terms of creating value and identifying sustainable cash flows, patterns where money has been made and the size of deals.\" In making qualitative judgements, Ms Steers is also an advocate of managers being represented on boards of companies they invest in and being sure they \"have a deep bench of [industry] experts around them\".</p><p>                     Being on the right side of IPO                   </p><p>The thriving private capital eco-system incentivises companies to tap public markets at a later stage in their development, although thanks to appetite for growing businesses, companies can raise significant capital cheaply when they do choose to list. The UK government has proposed changing listing rules to help tech start-ups but, as the Merian Global Investors data shows, for investors there is huge value to be had getting exposure before listing takes place and profiting from IPO as an exit strategy.</p><p>MGI'S Merian Chrysalis (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">MERI</url>) investment company was launched in November 2018 to invest in a pipeline of companies in stages of pre-IPO funding. Chrysalis benefits from the group's wider experience buying into successful IPOs such as Boohoo (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">BOO</url>) and Fevertree Drinks (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">FEVR</url>) via its open-ended funds. Fund Manager Richard Watts also says, having invested in companies such as Rightmove (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">RMV</url>) and AutoTrader (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AML:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">AUTO</url>) at the point of IPO, they understand how the market will value tech-enabled businesses at IPO.</p><p>'Unicorn' has several uses in digital vernacular, one was coined in the US to describe tech businesses valued at $1 billion or more just prior to, or after, IPO. Profits realised on Nasdaq listings have heightened interest in Europe and, interestingly, research from Dealroom.co shows it is mainly American and Asian money leading the way.</p><p>The UK has been a particularly fertile breeding ground with 57 realised unicorns (ie, that have gone public) and 18 unrealised (that might decide to IPO, be taken over or simply continue to grow as private businesses). Unrealised off-exchange unicorns include food delivery business Deliveroo, fintech vanguards such as neo-banks Monzo and Revolut and companies such as BenevolentAI (which is developing artificial intelligence). Some of these brands are increasingly well known, exactly the sort of businesses that attract a high price on floatation.</p><p>Chrysalis has stakes in Graphcore, a semi-conductor business and Klarna, Europe's most valuable fintech unicorn. Co-investors include a variety of leading institutions, which helps develop liquidity. The unicorn definition is now used broadly to include tech-enabled as well as core technology businesses, and Chrysalis holdings with potential to attain unicorn status include discount luxury travel business Secret Escapes and Starling bank - a pure fintech play.</p><p>With low cost bases and scalable marketing plans to access cheap retail deposit funding, Mr Watts is bullish on the potential of digital neo-banks to disrupt incumbents. He argues that although retail banks are investing heavily in technology, they are too slow and bureaucratic to out-run the nimble inroads neo-banks can make into their customer base. Starling is tantalisingly on the threshold of 1m customers and the landmark of \u00a31bn in retail deposits is predicted to be passed soon afterwards.  </p><p>Starling won't be the only successful disruptor. Unlike search engine businesses at the end of the 1990s, Mr Watts doesn't think one winner will take all in digital banking, although \"early mover advantage will be with the likes of Starling, Monzo, N26 and Revolut [that have already raised significant capital], rather than later entrants\".</p><p>                     Rising interest in off-exchange, but does PE have an image problem?                    </p><p>Investors seem to have bought into the Chrysalis philosophy, and the fund has made successful capital raises. Morningstar data has the MERI share price trading at a 5 per cent premium to its last published NAV - at the end of June - reflecting confidence that it will continue to find attractive deals to put funds to use. Interest in fintech has also seen Augmentum's share price closely track NAV, but it is still a cheaper way to back innovation than shares in Big Tech.</p><p>By contrast, the private equity vehicles are trading at a deep discount, with OCI shares at around 30 per cent and PIN shares about 20 per cent of NAV, respectively. Admittedly, OCI did score an own goal in January 2017 issuing shares at below NAV - a move poorly received by existing investors. Oakley's head of investor relations, Steven Tredget, says the company has no plans to repeat such a move but argues the wider issue for the PE industry is negative perceptions after the financial crisis of 2007-09, when companies that used massive leverage to fund buyouts became unstuck. He says PE companies are now far more conservative, and across the industry net debt is at a far lower multiple of ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), compared with before the crisis.</p><p>Helen Steer at Pantheon agrees, she says PIP makes stress tests against crash scenarios. Managers they use \"remember what happened 10 years ago, and have scars on their backs. They aren't just out of business school with a bright idea.\"</p><p>Fundamentally, the risk of less liquidity in underlying assets and the longer-term premium for investments to come good needs to be rewarded. This means the projected profits of businesses held, and the price paid for them, needs to imply a degree of upside above that of more liquid investments. Companies such as Augmentum and Merian Chrysalis that invest at the vanguard of new industries are not on a discount but they remain considerably cheaper than big tech disruptors.</p><p>In the case of PE vehicles such as PIP and OCI, investors may be waiting to see how resilient investments are in the next crisis before they reappraise the asset class. That said, with underlying investments that have many hallmarks of quality businesses, the discounts on offer now imply an incentive to take that chance earlier, at least with a portion of capital that can be committed for longer.</p><p>                     For all the features in our Investment Trust special, click below:                   </p><p>Go global for income</p><p>Trusting in fast-growing unlisteds</p><p>IC investment trust income portfolios: 12 months on</p><p>Investment trusts: professional picks 2019</p><p>Around the world in 8 investment trusts</p><p>Plus: Win \u00a35,000 to invest in an investment company</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-57851412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH3-S4J1-F021-61H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2783\"/><timeReceived>6:21 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Not all listings go badly, but too often it seems companies go public to create a windfall for existing stakeholders, rather than genuinely to raise money for expansion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Research by Merian Global Investors shows that, overall - including successful IPOs - expected growth rates for the first two years after listing are typically around 50 per cent of those achieved in the two years pre-IPO. Such disparity raises concern that investors in public markets are missing out, especially as companies in emerging industries such as fintech have a tendency to stay private for longer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On average, the time between new companies' date of incorporation and when they IPO has risen from five to 11 years, a trend underpinned by the multitude of financing options available to businesses.</p><p>Closed-ended funds open venture capital and private equity opportunities Investment companies are one of the few ways retail investors can access growth opportunities offexchange. Unlisted investments have no guaranteed price discovery mechanism of their own, so being able to publicly trade the shares of holding investment companies adds a layer of liquidity. The caveat is investment companies' share prices fall in periods when it is hard to realise value on underlying portfolios. Yet, given the problems open-ended funds have faced with liquidating unquoted assets to meet redemptions (another issue highlighted in the Woodford saga), closed-end structures are a more attractive option.</p><p>For investors who can afford to sit tight during economic uncertainty, a wealth of opportunity in venture capital and private equity is unlocked. Historically, start-ups would have been considered the domain of venture capital, with private equity more likely to target management buyouts and spin-offs of corporate divisions. Nowadays, the trend in companies staying private and the prominence of tech and tech-enabled disruptors creates cross-over and competition for equity in these businesses. That said, asset managers exist in a variety of structures and investment companies specialise in different industry sectors and stages of funding, so there is great diversity in exposure and management style.</p><p>Path to profitability crucial for technology Memories of the dotcom crash may give rise to scepticism about technology businesses, especially those yet to turn a profit. Augmentum Fintech (AUGM) chief executive Tim Levene stresses the importance of \"not being seduced by the sizzle, but by the substance\" of opportunities. He also advocates keeping to a manageable-sized portfolio and board representation at investee companies: \"You can't spray and pray your cash hoping for rocket ships.\"</p><p>Businesses the fund is backing include neo-banks such as Monese and specialist business lenders Iwoca and Tide. It also has a significant holding in Zopa, which was the world's first peer-to-peer lending platform. Board representation ensures full information rights, which helps assess key-performance indicators like customer acquisition costs, retention rates and lifetime value.</p><p>Finding a niche, adding value and economic moats Augmentum invests as a straightforward investment company, although its approach to stewardship has plenty in common with private equity firms that take great interest in helping businesses appoint experienced non-exec directors, recruit talented senior staffand manage capital structure. Adding value during the holding period means a profit on exiting the investment is more assured than just relying on continued froth in capital markets to drive up the price.</p><p>One drawback of investing offexchange is that the competition for quality assets bids up prices to an extent that creates significant valuation risk. Global private equity monitor Preqin estimated at the end of the second quarter of 2019 that private equity funds globally had $1.54 trillion cash not invested (referred to as 'dry powder' by the industry). Combined with demand from sovereign funds, corporate M&amp;A activity, pension and endowment funds, upward pressure on prices is inevitable.</p><p>There is, however, enormous variation between fund strategies. Just as Augmentum specialises in providing venture capital to fintech companies, private equity groups with a niche are better placed to meet the challenge posed by valuations. Oakley Capital, which is a limited liability partnership (LLP), has a series of funds that invest in unquoted equity, with a specialty in European businesses founded by entrepreneurs.</p><p>In private equity partnerships, the general partners manage the investments in the funds, which are made with capital raised from limited partners, which can include large institutional funds or family offices and, in the case of Oakley Capital, its listed closed-end investment company Oakley Capital Investments (OCI). As well as stakes in the Oakley Capital managed funds, OCI has some direct co-investments in private equity, which are managed by Oakley Capital.</p><p>THETIME INCORPORATION IPO HAS FIVETO Recent deals by the managed funds have demonstrated a flair for merger and acquisition activity and a focus on buying into businesses with proven cash flows, scalability and barriers to entry. In May 2019, the acquisitions of maritime e-learning businesses Videotel and Seagull, were combined in a deal described by partner Rebecca Gibson as representing \"the sweet spot\" of Oakley's investing strategy. Synergies were identified to cut overheads and improve technologies that provide mariners with safety training, which is required both by government regulators and insurers - so future revenue streams are very stable. On valuation, Ms Gibson emphasises discipline in bidding for assets to ensure Oakley maximises upside from the benefits it brings to businesses: \"[we] don't pay for the synergies up front\".</p><p>The partnership's overall portfolio is split across three main areas - TMT (technology, media and telecoms), education and consumer. The acquisition of a controlling stake in German e-gift card business Seven Miles in August 2019 added a business to the portfolio that is well placed to take advantage of a market expected to grow at 15 per cent a year. Seven Miles offers digital gift vouchers that can be redeemed at multiple retailers. Its technology is difficult to replicate, and 80 per cent adoption by German retail partners provides another barrier to competition.</p><p>Much is owed to a network of entrepreneurs, which Ms Gibson cites as a key differentiator, \"[these types of] opportunities don't often cross the desks of other groups\".</p><p>Diversification across the private equity universe Broader investing strategies manage the challenges of private equity valuations differently. Pantheon International (PIN) is the oldest private equity fundof-funds listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Since inception in 1987, it has achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 12 per cent in terms of net asset value (NAV), and share price gains have been at a rate of 11.5 per cent a year.</p><p>The investment company is referred to as PIP (although the ticker is PIN) and it invests across the private equity universe, diversifying exposure across geographies, industries and managers - including fund maturity and the stage of investment they specialise in. Although the portfolio is exposed to dozens of different funds and companies, there is a rigorous methodology behind risk allocations. Primary funds, where the managers have initiated a private equity investment, make up 27 per cent of the portfolio; 40 per cent of the portfolio is allocated to secondary funds (that acquire interests in private equity); and 33 per cent is co-investment in businesses alongside PE managers.</p><p>11 BETWEEN NEWCOMPANIES' AND RISEN FROM 11YEARS Although the investment universe is broad, Partner Helen Steers says PIP is very actively managed, with flexibility to tilt the portfolio between sectors. Close attention is paid to the liquidity profile of the portfolio, as well as generating cash to reinvest in the vehicle. Recognising large buyouts as a funding stage where multiples are inflated, 60 per cent of the portfolio is focused on small-and mid-sized buyouts and growth strategies. There is enormous dispersion of returns in the private equity sector with 2,000 basis points difference between the top and third quartile of private equity funds' performance.</p><p>Getting manager selection right is a balance of qualitative and quantitative factors. \"On the quant side, we look at track record in terms of creating value and identifying sustainable cash flows, patterns where money has been made and the size of deals.\" In making qualitative judgements, Ms Steers is also an advocate of managers being represented on boards of companies they invest in and being sure they \"have a deep bench of [industry] experts around them\".</p><p>Being on the right side of IPO The thriving private capital eco-system incentivises companies to tap public markets at a later stage in their development, although thanks to appetite for growing businesses, companies can raise significant capital cheaply when they do choose to list. The UK government has proposed changing listing rules to help tech start-ups but, as the Merian data shows, there is huge value to be had from getting exposure before listing takes place.</p><p>Merian Global Investors' Merian Chrysalis (MERI) investment company was launched in November 2018 to invest in a pipeline of companies in stages of pre-IPO funding. Chrysalis benefits from the group's wider experience of buying into successful IPOs such as Boohoo (BOO) and Fevertree Drinks (FEVR) via its open-ended funds. Fund Manager Richard Watts also says, having invested in companies such as Rightmove (RMV) and Auto Trader (AUTO) at the point of IPO, they understand how the market will value tech-enabled businesses at IPO.</p><p>'Unicorn' has several uses in digital vernacular; one was coined in the US to describe tech businesses valued at $1bn or more just prior to, or after, IPO. Profits realised on Nasdaq listings have heightened interest in Europe and, interestingly, research from Dealroom.co shows it is mainly American and Asian money leading the way.</p><p>The UK has been a particularly fertile breeding ground with 57 realised unicorns (ie, that have gone public) and 18 unrealised (that might decide to IPO, be taken over or simply continue to grow as private businesses). Unrealised off-exchange unicorns include food delivery business Deliveroo, fintech vanguards such as neo-banks Monzo and Revolut and companies such as BenevolentAI (which is developing artificial intelligence). Some of these brands are increasingly well known, exactly the sort of businesses that attract a high price on flotation.</p><p>Chrysalis has stakes in Graphcore, a semi-conductor business, and Klarna, Europe's most valuable fintech unicorn. Co-investors include a variety of leading institutions, which helps develop liquidity. The unicorn definition is now used broadly to include tech-enabled as well as core technology businesses, and Chrysalis holdings with potential to attain unicorn status include discount luxury travel business Secret Escapes and Starling bank - a pure fintech play.</p><p>With low cost bases and scalable marketing plans to access cheap retail deposit funding, Mr Watts is bullish on the potential of digital neo-banks to disrupt incumbents. He argues that although retail banks are investing heavily in technology, they are too slow and bureaucratic to out-run the nimble inroads neo-banks can make into their customer base. Starling is tantalisingly on the threshold of 1m customers and the landmark of \u00a31bn in retail deposits is predicted to be passed soon afterwards.</p><p>Starling won't be the only successful disruptor.</p><p>Unlike search engine businesses at the end of the 1990s, Mr Watts doesn't think one winner will take all in digital banking, although \"early mover advantage will be with the likes of Starling, Monzo, N26 and Rising interest in off-exchange, but does private equity have an image problem? Investors seem to have bought into the Chrysalis philosophy, and the fund has made successful capital raises. Morningstar data has the MERI share price trading at a 5 per cent premium to its last published NAV - at the end of June - reflecting confidence that it will continue to find attractive deals to put funds to use. Interest in fintech has also seen Augmentum's share price closely track NAV, but it is still a cheaper way to back innovation than shares in Big Tech.</p><p>By contrast, the private equity vehicles are trading at a deep discount, with OCI shares at around 30 per cent and PIN shares about 20 per cent of NAV, respectively. Admittedly, OCI did score an own goal in January 2017 issuing shares at below NAV - a move poorly received by existing investors. Oakley's head of investor relations, Steven Tredget, says the company has no plans to repeat such a move, but argues that the wider issue for the private equity industry is negative perceptions after the financial crisis of 2007-09, when companies that used massive leverage to fund buyouts became unstuck. He says private equity companies are now far more conservative, and across the industry net debt is at a far lower multiple of Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), compared with before the crisis.</p><p>Helen Steer at Pantheon agrees, she says PIP makes stress tests against crash scenarios. Managers they use \"remember what happened 10 years ago, and have scars on their backs. They aren't just out of business school with a bright idea\".</p><p>In the case of private equity vehicles such as PIP and OCI, investors may be waiting to see how resilient investments are in the next crisis before they reappraise the asset class. That said, with underlying investments that have many hallmarks of quality businesses, the discounts on offer now imply an incentive to take that chance earlier, at least with a portion of capital that can be committed for longer.</p><p>'Investment companies specialise in different industry sectors and stages of funding, so there is great diversity in exposure and style'  ;

I'm Neil Cavuto. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And America, we have a problem - a trust problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now, across the nation, we're seeing a loss of faith in all our  institutions among all political types.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors burned by the financial crash staying out of the stock market.   Home buyers singed by the real estate meltdown staying out of the housing  market.  A generation of kids exposed to both showing little interest in  either.  Their trust in institutions down.  Their faith in marriage itself  at an all-time low.  Parents who've lost confidence at a public school  system that fails their kids despite the government pouring billions of  dollars into a system that fails to raise their test scores.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, it would be one thing if the media pounced on government's clear  failures but more inclined to stay in government's hip pocket, convinced  that the government isn't the problem, how much we are giving it is.</p><p>So a collective media call to doubledown on the spending that has yet to  work.  A weird trust in repeating the same mistakes only this time, with  pricier mistakes and desperately hoping for a different result.</p><p>So you needn't be Einstein to figure that I'm right or left.  This is just  stupid - just an average American taxpayer whose gut says this has got to  stop.</p><p>So tonight, we stop and we step back - way back.  We're going to get to the  bottom of why America keeps coming up short and it keeps coming back to  trust.  </p><p>So we've decided to give this issue (INAUDIBLE) the whole show because this  isn't about the spending deficit or real estate deficit or a market deficit  or faith deficit.  This, my friends, is about America's trust deficit.</p><p>We begin with Washington's deficit.</p><p>Taxpayers are seeing lots of their tax money spent but what are they  getting for all that spending?  Now, more than half of Americans think that  more government means more problems.</p><p>Steve Moore says taxpayers are tired of Washington spending (INAUDIBLE)  after bad.  Lizzie MacDonald says that at least the coverage of that isn't  getting the proper coverage.  And Basil Smikle says right now, this  taxpayer trust is something that both parties need to address.</p><p>All right.  So, Steve, first to you.  How bad is this?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION VISITING FELLOW:  Well, it's really bad.   I mean, I was thinking, Neil, when you asked me to do this show about how  much Washington has changed in just the last 25 or 30 years I've been here.   When I came to Washington, the federal government was spending about a  trillion dollars.  Now, Neil, it's going to - next year, it'll be spending  $4 trillion.  And even adjusted for inflation, that's more than doubling up  the cost of government.  And then you ask people, \"Do you think government  is better today than it was 30 or 40 years ago?\"  And people say, \"I don't  know.\"  One other example, if I may, Neil, you mentioned schools.  If you  look at what's happened to per capita spending per pupil spending in the  schools versus - let's say - the 1950s or 60s when schools were a lot  better, we're spending about three times as much as we used to.  So I think  people are saying, \"Wait a minute.\"  Throwing more money at these problems  as a lot of liberals (INAUDIBLE) after what happened in Baltimore if we  just spent more money, people are saying, \"You're crazy.  That's the source  of the problem.  It's not going to solve the crisis.\"</p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you think, Liz?</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Well, I think Steve is exactly  right and as for one, the media doesn't really cover it correctly.  John  (INAUDIBLE), the economist put out a great story and here's the thing,  Neil.  When the government spends money, that is added to GDP.  So when the  government doesn't spend money, politicians are afraid, \"Oh, GDP is going  to go down.\"  So you could see the vicious circle that's in there.  Also,  we do have severe crony capitalism, of course.  Watch this.  Inspector  General who oversees Medicare said, \"Hey, wait a second.\"  Medicare is not  even negotiating drug rebates with drug manufacturers while Medicaid is.   And so why?  Because their laws written there says, \"You know what?  You're  not allowed to - you can't interfere with the negotiation between drug  companies and the federal government.\"  What is that about?  I'm not sure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What's even more alarming to me is when you talk to kids of all  political stripes, party-affiliation, it's (INAUDIBLE) maybe it's just  their blaming it on the parents or blaming it on the prior generations.   They have an inherent distrust of Washington, an inherent distrust of  institutions, an inherent distrust of any one of authority to get anything  done.  </p><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  They do and that's unfortunate.   Look, I am a person that doesn't necessarily believe that government is the  answer to all of our problems but there is a sort of minimum that I think  government sets where the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, have we gone beyond the minimum? </p><p>SMIKLE:  I don't think we've gone beyond the minimum but I think we've -  there may be sort of a dearth of ideas.  I think we need some better ideas,  some (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But to Lizzie's point, do you think the dearth of ideas is that we  just go back to the same old idea?  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE:  Listen, Neil, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Let him finish.</p><p>SMIKLE:  I go back to - I go back to a point when David Dinkins was mayor  of New York City and asked the state to increase taxes to put more cops on  the street.  It was during his administration that you started to see a  decline in crime here in New York City and a lot of it is pegged to an  increase in taxation.  So when I think when (INAUDIBLE) legislators  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Weird that you would mention David Dinkins, although with the  present mayor, now Dinkins looks like Winston Churchill.</p><p>SMIKLE:  Listen, it started - it started during his administration.   Giuliani takes credit for it but that's OK.  But.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE:  --the thing is if you point - if you point directly to the  expenditure and the outcome then I think you will think (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, but Steve, my big fear with this is that we're going to go  back to the same well and say, \"Well, more money\" or maybe we get a better  idea how to spend that money better, but it's always going to be more,  more, more.  That's what worries me.</p><p>MOORE:  Yes.  I think the problem with this analysis that \"Gee, if we only  had more government\", I think that the problem is this, Neil, that the  government has gotten away from the core functions that it is supposed to  do.  It's supposed to educate our kids.  It's supposed to build good roads  and highways.  It's supposed to defend us.  It's not to allow things like  what happened in Benghazi.  And I would simply respond to this point that  the government's not doing much.  I think the reason the government is  failing in the fundamental things it's supposed to be doing is because it's  doing too much.  I mean, a good example of this with young people because  these polls show that young people are the ones who have lost the most  confidence in government.  And when I talk to my kids who are completely  non-ideological - they don't listen to any of this political stuff.  But  you know what they don't get?  They don't get how the federal government  can't run a website for the healthcare system.  They're like, \"Wait a  minute.  A seventh-grader can do that.\"</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.  But we're (INAUDIBLE).  But the thing is - here's the  thing.  Why raise taxes when the government is wasting so much money?  More  than a trillion dollars.</p><p>MOORE:  Right, exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  --worth of vacant federal office buildings littering the  landscape.  $200 billion in overlap and duplication in the federal  government.  And you have an incompetent health reform website that is just  sucking up money right and left, that is really not working and it's all  loaded on Medicaid whose budget is getting blown out right there.</p><p>SMIKLE:  Yes, we're talking about - I mean, we don't need to be talking  about a website here.  What I think we need to be talking about are how  government can help - help - solve problems but not be the conclusion.  And  even the president has said that.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But think about (INAUDIBLE) - but why do you think that right  after Baltimore, the immediate inclination was \"We need more money\", \"We  need more money\", \"We need more money.\"  Baltimore in a per capita on a per  student basis gets almost as much money as New York City students do.   Number two to them.  Neither are exactly breaking the mental walls down.   So why is there a feeling that if in doubt, throw more money at it?</p><p>SMIKLE:  Well, it's not the fact that you're throwing more money at it.   It's how that money gets spent.  And if you're - if you're - but if you're  questioning (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they're not even fine-tuning it.  They're saying it  (INAUDIBLE) a matter they haven't (INAUDIBLE) enough money.</p><p>SMIKLE:  I think it's important to be able to track where that money goes  and make sure the outcomes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they don't.  They don't.</p><p>SMIKLE:  --make sure the outcomes (INAUDIBLE).  No, I think that's  happening.  That happened here in New York.  It's happening in many other  cities where you can actually see that additional.</p><p>CAVUTO:  We spent trillions on a war on poverty and all that has yet to  move the poverty needle.</p><p>SMIKLE:  I think it's moved the needle quite significantly.  But what.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Three percent.  Three percent.</p><p>SMIKLE:  --but that's significant.  What I do think is problematic though.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It is?</p><p>CAVUTO:  (INAUDIBLE) trillion dollars?</p><p>SMIKLE:  If you talk to the people who came who.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Three percent since the 60s?  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE:  --(INAUDIBLE) - if you - if you talk about the people who came out  of poverty, that's significant for them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Listen, we all - right.  But we all want to help the poor.  You  know what helps the poor is a job, because then they become emotionally and  literally invested in their area.  They don't want to destroy their job or  destroy the area around them.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, do you think that's it?  The trust - we don't trust the  government to know that?  Whether you like it or not, we don't trust them  to do the right thing.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We know we don't trust them because we've thrown so much money  out already and it hasn't really worked.</p><p>SMIKLE:  But I don't think - I also don't think that they're - I also don't  think that anyone - whether either Democratic side or the Republican side,  you all speak for that - but I certainly don't think any Democrat is  saying, \"Just throw money at the problem.\"  That is not the solution.   (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Actually, last week, they were.  But by the way, (INAUDIBLE).   You're right to say that both parties have failed in this regard because  they do think even Republicans with defense, \"Throw more money out.  Throw  more money out.\"  But, Steve, what do you think of that - where we stand  with the trust issue because when it comes to government, we don't stand  too well here.</p><p>MOORE:  Well, we don't.  And I'll just give you one example of what you  guys were talking about.  I just had a piece in the \"Wall Street Journal\"  this week about how we've got a D.C. voucher program that is educating kids  in inner cities by allowing them to go in other schools.  And here's the  amazing thing about that program.  It is educating kids, Neil, giving them  a quality education for one-half of what it costs in the public schools and  we can't get the liberals to support the program and it's helping a lot of  kids.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, there are lot of - there are a lot of players not measuring  up here.  </p><p>But, guys, I want to thank you all.  (INAUDIBLE).  You do this very, very  well.  </p><p>In the meantime, fastfood giant Andy Puzder says businesses shouldn't trust  Washington either and either Republicans offering them help or Democrats  because tax bills, red tape just seem to pile up and Uncle Sam just keeps  piling on. </p><p>So Andy, how do you get businesses to believe that Washington has their  back.  'Cause you've argued for many years now, they have a sense that it  does not.</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, HARDEE'S &amp; CARL'S JR CEO:  Well, it did help in 2010 when the  Republicans took over the House and then again in '12 when they - in '14  when they took over the Senate because at least businesses knew nothing  disastrous like Dodd-Frank or Obamacare was going to come down the pike.   But we've still got the NLRB out there and trying to inflict the joint  employer standard on franchise businesses which would be a disaster.   They're talking about ambush elections.  We've got an administration that  refuses to implement fixes to Obamacare like the 40-hour work week.  We've  got President Obama last year expanding, telling the Department of Labor to  expand the class of employees that are entitled to overtime so people will  be compensated for time spent rather than (INAUDIBLE) spent.  And then  you've got state and federal governments trying to come down with a minimum  wage increases, what - at some point, and it really is about the $10, $12  point, you've got employees being paid more than they contribute to the  profitability of the business.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Then what do you do?  I mean, in that - in that - in that  environment, Andy, I mean, what do you do to get businesses feeling that  Washington can have their back rather than stab them in the back because  they have all this money - not necessarily small or medium-size businesses  but the larger ones - have a lot of money abroad.  $2 trillion that's just  sitting offshore and it's not coming back because it's going to be double- taxed or taxed at a high rate so businesses keep it there including some  very politically-correct names like Apple.  How do you win that money back?</p><p>PUZDER:  Well, there's really - really, the only way is to elect government  - to elect politicians who are committed to seeing the economy grow, who  are not committed to seeing the government grow.  We've elected a president  - now, he's been president six years - President Obama who's committed to  big government.  And if you're committed to big government, you're going to  scare businesses.  Until you get that commitment to economic growth, to  getting people jobs, to creating opportunity and reducing poverty by  creating jobs, by creating economic growth, until the government gets that  kind of focus, the businesses aren't going to trust the government.  You're  always looking forward to additional and added expenses and the higher your  expenses are, the lower your profits are.  The lower your projected  profits, the less like you are to expand, the less like you are to build a  new business, are to open a new business, and the less like you are to  create jobs.  So until this big government attitude begins to decline.   Look, we spent last year, the National Association of Manufacturers and the  Small Business Administration estimated that we're spending about $2  trillion.  American businesses are spending $2 trillion in compliance costs  with the current - in the current regulatory environment.  Now, my buddy,  Steve More was just mentioning that the government spends $4 trillion.   Well, half of that amount - you could take half of that amount and you'd  increase the amount that businesses are on tap for by $2 trillion which is  what they have to pay in regulatory compliance costs.  I mean, it's a very  bad situation.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Imagine.  That's the equivalent of the money they have - they have  offshore.  It is a very interesting fact.  </p><p>Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p>PUZDER:  Well, nobody's going to bring the money back unless you get  (INAUDIBLE) if you're going to have to pay more taxes on it.  And the bad  thing is when foreign companies bring that money back, they don't have to  pay tax on it.  So.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, I love you to death, Andy, but I don't trust you in this  sense that you are a fastfood executive and you're thin.  So that doesn't  jive with me.  I've told you this many, many times.  So it takes away all  your credibility.</p><p>But I kid you.  But, Andy, as always, a pleasure.  And I love the piece you  wrote about Scott Walker keeping in mind the numbers are not what the  mainstream media says, it's just how they play with those numbers. </p><p>But, Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p>PUZDER:  Thank you.  I appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much.  Andy Puzder.</p><p>Well, we've heard of \"The Young and the Restless\", right?  But young and  investless?  Because when it comes to stocks, most young folks want nothing  to do with them.</p><p>Next, why Charles Payne says trust him, you'll regret sitting this one out,  guys.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, here's why they often call this market a stealth rally.  So  many aren't even participating in it.  In fact, more than half of Americans  don't own any stock at all after this incredible run-up because they don't  trust this run-up.  They don't trust stocks.  When things go south,  investors run scared.  </p><p>Just look at what happened on October 19, 1987.  I was there for the scare.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO (VOICEOVER):  Suddenly, it was a freefall.  A better than 22 percent  (INAUDIBLE) in the Dow and nervous traders were looking over their  shoulders.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What they don't know and in fact readily worry about is how far  down that correction really has to go, how long it will take, and exactly  how many more people will be hurt in the process before the market does  decide - if it decides - to turn around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you'll be happy to know that markets did come back and  puberty did kick in.  And now you know the rest of the story.  </p><p>I hate when my staff does this to remind me, same Lego hair then, same Lego  hair now.</p><p>Anyway, after the 2008 meltdown, just when people thought stocks couldn't  get any lower, they did bounce back to record highs.  </p><p>Charles Payne says now, lots of investors are kicking themselves for  missing both opportunities. </p><p>But it happens a lot.  You can understand in the moment, they're frantic.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Oh, sure.  Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But here's where I think it's different with this one, Charles, is  that once, twice burned, whatever, a lot of young people in particular, \"I  don't want anything to do with it.\"</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  There's no doubt about it.  And there's a lot of young people  who have sort of watched it from afar as they were growing up.  And you see  your parents like, \"Golly, we lost it all.\"  And a few years later, \"Golly,  we lost it all.\"  And so - then of course, say, \"Well, you know what?   We're real estate investors now.  Golly, we lost it all.\"  So now you hear  that they'd rather just have experiences that the - that the big F.O.M.O. -  the fear of missing out - isn't on making a lot of money but missing the  fun things in life.  So you put it all off - family formation, investing -  all that stuff, put it off because you might as well live in the moment,  have fun while you're young because you don't know what's right around the  corner.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is it their parents' experiences singed them or what?</p><p>PAYNE:  I think it has.  But I also think - what I find really interesting  is that we're starting now to see this group come out of it, not come out  of it but starting to emerge as entrepreneurs, family formation.  They're  still renters above buyers and I think you're going to start seeing them  invest in things because they're in the midst of all the excitement that  the WhatsApps, the Periscopes, all these things that seem to pop up  overnight, they're the ones that are making it happen.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And they're gravitating those (INAUDIBLE) for jobs because they  think they're still interested in getting money, it's just they don't want  to get at the means in the market or whatever.</p><p>PAYNE:  They love spending it.  Right?  I mean, just like YOLO - \"You Only  Live Once\", right, so yes, it's good.  They love spending it, particularly  their parents.  But the sooner - at some point, \"like I scratched the  room\", yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  So but you say to what - to kids in general, young  people in general, millennials, let's say for want of a better definition,  the 18-29, 30-year-olds who are saying, \"I don't trust that (INAUDIBLE).\"  </p><p>PAYNE:  They've got all their - they've got too much money in cash.  Cash  goes nowhere - deteriorates every single day in worth and what it can buy.   And I think they're going to (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But when the George Soros's, the Druckermillers - all these guys  start talking about, \"Hey, this is getting a little long in the tooth\", do  you blame them?</p><p>PAYNE:  It is a little long in the tooth that - but I mean, I don't know  that they should try to play the market timing thing because you  (INAUDIBLE) - you'd started this whole thing off the right way.  When we  are in the midst of a crash, everyone's running.  Very few people have the  wherewithal to buy.  If you can't buy now, you really think you're going to  buy in the middle of a crash?  But if you're 23.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, what do you tell them, Charles?</p><p>PAYNE:  --well, if you're 25-years-old, if you're lucky, you'll probably go  through another 10 crashes.  I personally hope I live through at least  another five major crashes.  That means I'll be 90-years-old.  And - but at  the end of the day, when the smoke clears, usually what happens over the  last 20 years, the markets at a new all-time high.  What they have to do is  don't trust Wall Street, trust the things you like.  You love Under Armour  clothes, own Under Armour.  Go with what you do trust.  You're right.   There's a lot of shenanigans on Wall Street, there's a lot of knuckleheads  and there's a lot of thievery.  I'd be the first to admit that.  But only a  great company over a long period of time, normally you should do pretty  well.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But a lot of people feel young, they don't market (INAUDIBLE)  we're close to what - the fifth anniversary of the flash.</p><p>PAYNE:  Sure.  Sure.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  A lot of people say, \"See, that's what happens.  Just when you get  in, some idiot does it.\"</p><p>PAYNE:  There's no doubt about it.  Listen, high-frequency trading isn't  illegal but it makes the market more volatile.  And there's always -  there's too much money.  Govenrment and Wall Street.  There will always be  theft.  There's just too much money sloshing around.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So what do you tell people who said, let's say, they like Nike or  they like Apple and they say, \"Gee, Charles, I agree.  Buy what you like.   Like what you buy.  Know what you're buying.\"  But if the stocks  (INAUDIBLE) already very rich.\"</p><p>PAYNE:  It's just hard to say.  They could be rich temporarily.  In other  words, sometimes the valuation can get ahead of the actual fundamentals.   But they - the fundamentals are also improving.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And they were saying that about Apple at $50, at $60 a share.</p><p>PAYNE:  Trying to pick the top is a tough game. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you just say, \"Hold tight\"? </p><p>PAYNE:  Because you're not going to pick the bottom.  You're not going to  pick the bottom.  So if you're going to be in it and that you're 25, start  to nibble.  You know it's great.  You're making (INAUDIBLE) great.  These  young people know more than anybody on Wall Street.  They know the greatest  things going on right now.  If they can just put their money with what they  know, connect those two dots, they'll have an amazing life.  They can have  the fear of missing out for the rest of their lives and have a fun youth, a  fun middle age, and an amazing golden age.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I just find that they whine a lot.  Just shut up, right?</p><p>All right.  Thank you very, very much.</p><p>PAYNE:  But that whining gets them what they want.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  \"Get off my lawn!\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a quick quiz.  If Americans trust the government the least, who  do you think is - well - next to least?  The president, the media, big  business, or Charles Payne?  </p><p>No.  The answer right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The government does this.  The government can do that.  </p><p>Is the media simply too busy kissing up to the government to objectively  cover the government?  Because the media itself is now one of the least  trusted institutions, second only to Congress.  </p><p>That's according to at least one recent poll.  </p><p>Media watchers, Brent Bozell, Lauren Ashburn say that the fourth estate  stopped being the government's watchdog decades ago.</p><p>Well, Brent, it's very interesting to me that despite all of that, it's  like the media wants to doubledown on this faith in government and question  those who would dare question government.</p><p>BRENT BOZELL, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Isn't it incredible  that their response to be marginalized is to be even more marginalized.   They've become so radicalized.  We've seen something in the last two years  that I frankly hadn't seen before.  This - since 2008, I should say, this  commitment, this deliberate commitment not to report news if it harms the  narrative of the left.  This is not one example.  This is not two examples.   I can give you 20 examples.  As a matter of fact, you and I have talked  about this many times on your show.  They are deliberately not reporting  news.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Lauren, to what end though?  I mean, they must know that they hurt  their own brand.  We've seen it happen in print.  We've seen it happen with  one newspaper or another whether they hop online or not.  The content is  what people are getting turned off to.</p><p>LAUREN ASHBURN, THE HILL CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's true.  I do need to  respond to what Brent just said because I think.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Let Lauren respond.  Go ahead.</p><p>ASHBURN:  --that he's - because I think he's wrong, coming up especially  with Hillary Clinton, you had the New York Times breaking the email  scandal.  You had all of the mainstream news organizations hopping on this  latest scandal with the Clinton Foundation.  So.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I'm talking about government itself.  We're talking about  whether faith in government can fix problems.</p><p>ASHBURN:  No, I understand.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Go ahead.</p><p>ASHBURN:  I understand.  But I think that there are also a lot of  journalists who do put their heads down and do the hard work.  The FOIA  requests are very important in order to find out exactly what is happening  and you can't marginalized those.  They are about this many reporters who  are doing it.  But I think that it's very important to know that if you get  the right news source.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But that's the problem.  That - see, Lauren, that's the problem.   If only this many are reporting it or whatever, this signifies small  percentage - the others are saying especially after Baltimore last week,  well, the issue is we're not spending enough.  We're not - the government  isn't doing enough, in other words, that the government can fix it.  That's  what worries me.  </p><p>Brent?</p><p>BOZELL:  Look, with all due respect.  Lauren, what you just said is just  pure nonsense.  They have not gotten to the bottom of a single one of the  Obama scandals.  They did not get to the bottom of a single one of the  Clinton scandals.  Just think about their coverage of Watergate and Nixon  where they would not let go 'til they got to the bottom of it.  Now, look  at the IRS.  Look at Benghazi.  Look at the VA.  Look at so many scandals  they've been dropped.  This one - this Clinton one - will be dropped as  well.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But let's go back to the government, guys.  I can argue how  zealous the media is when reporting on the Clinton issues, whatever, but I  think back to this idea that if we have problems, the government can fix  them.  Lauren, do you think that is a media issue to address, that they're  not really looking at anything more creative than that?</p><p>ASHBURN:  Well, I mean, I think that's a very left - right - way of looking  at the world.  If there are problems then the government can fix them.  I  think that if you're looking at news coverage of that specific issue,  you're not going to find it because I think a lot of the people who do  report think that exactly that - that the government can fix issues.   However, you did have the reporting on the VA scandal, right, where there  was complete mismanagement and you did see the media latch onto that and  paint the VA as villains.  I'm not here to defend all of the terrible  journalism that's going on right now and there is a lot of it because it's  certainly a lot easier right now to pontificate and to spout off than it is  to actually take a big 30,000 foot view and take a look at what the  government is actually doing with our dollars.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, Brent, though, only (INAUDIBLE) and I've raised this with  Republicans too who find that a $600 billion defense budget isn't cutting  it.  If you're digging a hole, it's best to put the spending shovel down or  the big government shovel down.  What do you think?</p><p>BOZELL:  Well, here's - I think - a real direct answer to your question.   If you look at a problem - a perceived problem - you will never hear on the  networks the idea (INAUDIBLE) \"Leave it alone.  Leave people alone.  Let  people (INAUDIBLE). Let people show some personal responsibility.  Get  government out of the equation.\"  You'll never hear that.  Instead, you'll  hear a discussion about how much the government needs to do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys.  I wish we had more time 'cause I don't - I wish  you guys could have actually come to blows but you're two locations.  It  makes it very, very hard to do.  But next time.  Next time.   </p><p>Guys, thank you both very much.  Well, burn if you're in, burn more if  you're out.  Next, the housing pro says keeping the housing faith will pay  off big time, but you got to give it time.</p><p>It's one thing to not trust the education system, but quite another to  rebel against it.  Coming up, how parents are revolting with an education  system they think's revolting.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I get the idea that trusting big institution is fleeting.  In this  hour, we're digging into exactly why?  A big reason, of course, goes back  to the 2007 housing bubble.

Too much money, I'm never going to  have that much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I can't afford to buy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't think I'm mature enough yet for it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you buy a house, you have to stay there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why buy a house if you are going to sail on it and ruin  your credit ratings.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Renting is easier.  Things have taken care of for  you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And probably because we are too poor.  We have no  money.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO:  As you can see, a lot of millennials are simply opting to rent  rather than buy, but former Fannie Mae executive, Tim Rood, says that is a  big mistake.  They are missing on a moment to make a good investment and  make a good return.</p><p>But if you think about it, a lot of these kids are saying, I haven't seen  that return.  My parents haven't seen that return, what do you say?</p><p>TIM ROOD, FORMER FANNIE MAE EXECUTIVE:  Thanks, Neil.  So you just saw or  made the reference to the housing home ownership rates dropping to 63  percent.  When you think about these numbers in the aggregate or the  abstract, they don't mean a lot.</p><p>But there is a lot of financial implications when you think about every 1  percent of that drop is actually one million households that aren't owning  a home.  That's one million households paying 30 percent more a month for  their living expenses.  There are one million households -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  They figure they are saving on the hassle and the risk of another  meltdown.  That's what they say, you say what?</p><p>ROOD:  Absolutely.  Look, there's always going to be some casualties in the  housing.  If you can get 95 percent success rate, which means 5 percent are  going to lose home to foreclosure.  Obviously, it's a cautionary tale.</p><p>That's 95 percent of folks who see the wealth appreciation of home  ownership which it's important to remember, the household net worth of a  renter is $5,000 in this country.</p><p>The household net worth of a home owner is $150,000.  But Neil, the big  picture was accidentally exposed recently on boomers.  They showed seniors  when they passed away, how much financial net worth was in their house, and  it turns out only 20 percent of these seniors when they passed away had any  financial net worth beyond the home equity in their house.</p><p>So you can imagine during the most prosperous time, that's the end result.   We've got to focus on how to get more folks into housing today.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, but there are a lot of people in the last seven, eight- year period since the meltdown who would not have that appreciation at all  so they would not have the housing component of that wealth, right?</p><p>ROOD:  Well, I think people talk like that, but in real terms, you've seen  about $3 trillion of appreciation in housing over the last three years.  It  bottomed out in 2012, but it is rallying and we are still about 15 percent  from the highs.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So you say give it time and have faith that in time things come  back?</p><p>ROOD:  Well, there's a huge demand push.  Americans are funny.  At no point  in history have been more Americans that have a desire to live indoors.  I  mean, we keep growing the population and ultimately 65 percent historically  are going to want to buy a house.</p><p>You've seen people who have lost their house to foreclosure.  There is 6  million, 9 million of these people, who have lost their house to  foreclosure.  That when polled they still say that -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  And they want back in.</p><p>ROOD:  They want back in.  It's a good investment.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you, Tim, very, very much.  Good to seeing you.</p><p>Well, to people that have a right to not trust the housing market or to  Tim's point, they going way too far and being way too jaded?  Banks are  trying to tempt them in, but are they really doing too much here offering  as little as 3 percent down mortgages.</p><p>Well, real estate analyst, Katrina Campins, said this is the kind of thing  that worries here that some of the banks and institutions are sucking them  back in, to be slaughtered.</p><p>KATRINA CAMPINS, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" CONTESTANT:  Right, and I believe that  the concern is twofold.  First, I think a lot of these borrowers are not  aware that they run the risk of their house actually being worth less than  they owe if the market for some reason declines, which historically it may.</p><p>And with these small down payments, borrowers are also not aware they'll  get a higher interest rate and the cost of the loan in the long run will be  higher than if they put more of a down payment down, not to mention  mortgage insurance.</p><p>I think also the lenders run a risk of these borrowers walking away because  they don't have enough skin in the game.  So I think it's extremely  dangerous and you know, God knows that I love people buying real estate.   That's what I do for a living. </p><p>However, I'm also concerned that maybe these banks are giving people too  much without enough skin in the game.  And without educating them that  through the life of the loan, it may seem like an opportunity to appreciate  and to buy into the American dream without enough money down, but in the  long run, I think that it's a mistake.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, Katrina, the argument for letting these low money down  loans go through is most young people since it's targeted largely at young  people, do have the financial discipline to stick with the mortgage, grow  with the mortgage as they grow with their jobs.</p><p>If you don't do something like this, it will only be a rich man/rich  woman's market and we'll never see housing stabilize.  What do you make of  that argument?</p><p>CAMPINS:  Well, I think it comes down to employment as well.  You know, the  unemployment rate with the younger generation just isn't rising at the rate  that we need it in order for them to build this wealth.</p><p>I think one other point which is not realized is that now the banks are  actually allowing these younger generation to get down payment from family  members, which again, if you don't earn it, I'm a firm believer, if you  earn it, you value it more.</p><p>A family member is actually putting that down payment for you then you're  more inclined to walk away than if you worked hard for it.  I think part of  the American dream is working really hard to be able to attain it.</p><p>So I'm a firm believer that again, you have to work for it, and in the end,  the housing market will do better because of it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, unless you have a rich uncle who doesn't seem to care.   Katrina, thank you very, very much.  Good seeing you again.</p><p>CAMPINS:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, from the reaction we got on the street, the things you don't  trust the most are the things you apparently use the most?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm on Facebook.  I'm on Twitter.  All our information  is out there, anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you try to get rid of your page, it's like always  there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They definitely have the technology to see everything  everybody does.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm getting pop-ups, advertisements and things I've  searched in the past.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Every day I think why am I still doing this?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Trust in technology is fading, but are we the problem it is still  a big thing?  Well, Americans don't want their data in the hands of big  tech companies or the government for that matter or both.  They're more  addicted to it than ever before.</p><p>To cybersecurity experts, David Kennedy and Kurt Knutsson, who says this  technology that we may not like, we apparently still love.  It is weird,  right?  It's like a double-edged sword.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, \"KURT THE CYBER GUY\":  Most people don't know when they're  using Cloud storage, when your information is stored on various servers,  they think it's up in an atmosphere, but no, it's giant farms of servers in  various parts of the world.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And they don't care or they don't know the details like making hot  dogs.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  Here's when you care, the moment you care is when you took  something that is really important to you and you're working on it, like a  book you are writing, and you store it on a service that isn't your own  computer or device, and all of a sudden one day, poof!   It's gone.</p><p>What the heck happened?  This thing that's shared on all of your devices  available anywhere and you have to revert to a copy stored six months ago.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And then it becomes a nightmare.  You know, David, I've always  remembered the former Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said if you want  your privacy, it is gone, the technology and convenience obviously has some  intrusions on privacy.  But its benefits outweigh whatever annoyances you  encounter.  Do you agree with that?</p><p>DAVID KENNEDY, TRUSTEDSEC FOUNDER:  Well, I still think there is a fine  balance between privacy and the types of information you put online, but  the problem is that.  I mean, you are integrating technology into  everything that you do on a regular basis.</p><p>I mean, with your Android phones, iPhones, with Macs, all of those have  call backs and stored data on these Cloud infrastructures that store this  type of information.</p><p>So to put it short, our privacy is pretty much gone when it comes to the  amount of information that we do on these pieces of technology, but we  still have to be cautious about the types of information we put up there.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  David, I would jump in and say cautious is the easy word.  You  have to be stupid to store something critical in your life.  Do not put a  will, medical records, personal data, nothing that would -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  But medical data, that is getting online.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  Well, you may not have a choice.   You are not the one who is  control of that so perhaps -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  So let's say you are doing everything right, but someone else is  deciding to take that data.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  One little leak in the faucet from one point to the next point  is what goes wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I got a guy like you, when is the last time you wrote a paper  check, you do everything probably online?</p><p>KNUTSSON:  I mean, you and I probably -- because I lose them.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You have people who do that.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  It's not about that.  When I do it, I lose.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What is a smart move?  The convenience of it this is such and you  can do it so quickly dictates this new world.  Even though we know in our  back of our minds, there is a risk of something going wrong, we like the  convenience.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Listen, we want to be able to have as much convenience as  possible.  We want to be able to order our groceries and then go pick them  up at the store.  You have toilets you can control from the smartphones  now.  Convenience is huge.</p><p>The problem is it's not just consumers that are doing this as well.  It's  businesses and that's completely out of our control.  Businesses are  putting medical data, Social Security number, sensitive data, financial  records in these Cloud infrastructures, which are not protected.</p><p>So it's a much wider issue than just the consumer themselves.  It's wider  on the business front as well, and that's why you are seeing a lot of these  breaches occur.  It's going to be a problem to come and something we face  directly in the next two years.</p><p>CAVUTO:  We love technology, but don't think it is going to be there for  us.</p><p>KENNEDY:  I like my smart toilet.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who doesn't?  But it's a family show.  Look at the time.  I want  you to look at this chart.  With education spending like, this you would  think test scores would be off the charts.  News flash, they're not.  No  wonder where a lot of parents are flat-out serious over all this flat  lining.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, to all these skeptical parents and kids about our  schools, 31 percent of just parents do not trust the government's handling  of all of this.</p><p>Students aren't getting results, even as taxpayer dollars are being thrown  again, billion after billion after billion into school systems.</p><p>To Ashley Pratte and a former New York school superintendent, Carole  Hankin, on if there is a way to fix, what many think, is now a broken  educational system.  Ashley, what do you think?</p><p>ASHLEY PRATTE, FP1 STRATEGIES VP OF COMMUNICATIONS:  I think that the whole  idea of throwing money at a problem as a solution is not a solution, and I  think that's the real issue here.  We look at accountability of schools and  test scores and everything and they're just plummeting and failing our  students.</p><p>And parents and students deserve options and they deserve choice.  That's  why I think the school choice movement is so important.  Students shouldn't  be relegated to a school based on zip code.  Students learn in different  environments.</p><p>I think that, you know, an age where technology is rampant and we have  choice at our fingertips, it should be the same way for education, and  students should have that option as well as parents to say if my student is  not thriving in this environment and I know that they can thrive elsewhere,  that's where they are going to go school.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think what she's saying, Carole, is she's pro-choice on  education.</p><p>PRATTE:  That's a good way of putting it on that issue.</p><p>DR. CAROLE HANKIN, FORMER NEW YORK SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT:  I don't think  pro-choice is the problem or the solution.  I think that we have so many  schools in this country, and just saying that students can go to other  schools won't work every place.  I do believe -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Works in a lot of places, Carole.</p><p>HANKIN:  Well, small amounts of students and what happen to the ones who  can't get out?  I think we need to fix the schools, but I absolutely agree  that throwing more money is not the answer.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, wouldn't competition would help?</p><p>HANKIN:  I think competition helps in every single field, yes, but I also  think that we need to do something with the schools that are broken.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you make of that, Ashley?  That if it's a matter of just  the same existing system, challenging that that existing system with a  competitors, does put a little bit of kick in your step.</p><p>PRATTE:  Yes, and I'm all for competition, I think that's what's important  with the rise of teachers unions, and I'm not bashing teachers here.  My  sister is one, and it's noble work she's doing.</p><p>This is why I wonder where the money is going, Neil?  Because she has to  take money out of her pocket to buy supplies for students in her classroom  so you know, with all the money funnelled in, and you look at schools in  Baltimore because that's been in the news recently.  You see $15,000 per  student.</p><p>Where is all of that money going?  Is it going to the betterment of the  students?  When teachers have to take money out of their own pocketbooks or  checkbooks to pay for supplies for their students that makes me wonder  where exactly is the money being funnelled to?</p><p>Is it helping the students?  I don't think so and it's definitely not  helping the teachers.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, I want to thank you guys very much.  By now you get it,  America has big trust issues, but next, rocker, Andrew W.K., one of the  more optimistic guys I know here to build trust facts for the middle-aged,  the young, the old, you name it.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, this hour we have laid out eight out of ten millennials  don't even trust other people even other young people.  To the guy a lot of  you who call the philosopher of partying because he just takes all the  tension and brings it down a notch.  Rocker, Andrew W.K., on if Americans  can ever start trusting each other again.</p><p>Andrew, it's always good to have you, but I think that's the heart of the  problem here, forget institutions, it's inherent thing, we don't trust or  actually flip over each other.  What's the problem?</p><p>ANDREW W.K., \"PHILOSOPHER OF PARTYING\":  Well, this is a puzzling and  perplexing issue but, fortunately, it is as simple as trusting one's self.   Most of these societal issues come down to an individual point of view and  what's inside.  If you can't trust your own self, of course you're not  going to trust other people.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, when you perform, song writer, entertainer -- it's  always very uplifting, I'm told.  I know that your whole approach is very  positive, positive energy, and it's contagious.</p><p>I always tell young people, younger than you, I don't thinker than --  younger than my own kids that the bottom line is you are the vibe you let  off.</p><p>And if you're negative, all that's going to be contagious.  If you're  positive, that too will be contagious.  I think it starts there, but I  could be simplistic.  What do you think?</p><p>ANDREW W.K.:  No, I agree with that.  It's a code of ethics really that  starts in your own behavior.  It can seem rather trivial to imagine that  how you interact with people throughout your day could actually have a  global impact or at least even in your own community, but it really does.</p><p>If you don't have these strengths, if I don't have the strength to be  polite to that stranger or have that trust, that kind of faith that  humanity isn't bad, then how would I believe that the rest of the world -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  You can't blame a lot of people young or old, right, Andrew?  I  tried to give the benefit of the doubt to the government, let me down,  markets, let me down, housing let me down.  Again, and again, my trust was  broken like a bad relationship, no more.</p><p>ANDREW W.K.:  Well, a bad relationship is a very good example because if  we're going on dates with someone and we have bad experiences, it's easy to  want to cast aside all of romance, all of love, all relationships because  you don't want to get hurt.</p><p>But we also don't want to live in a world where we don't have love or  relationships or hold out hope for something more.  Idealism is  challenging.  It's much easier to become cynical, but we don't want to live  in that kind of world.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Speak for yourself, young man.  Andrew W.K., it is attitudinal, we  are bigger than the problems that seem to confront us.  I hope that helps  everybody, and I want you to return next week bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and  feeling we can conquer the world.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And America, we have a problem - a trust problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now, across the nation, we're seeing a loss of faith in all our institutions among all political types.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors burned by the financial crash staying out of the stock market. Home buyers singed by the real estate meltdown staying out of the housing market. A generation of kids exposed to both showing little interest in either. Their trust in institutions down. Their faith in marriage itself at an all-time low. Parents who've lost confidence at a public school system that fails their kids despite the government pouring billions of dollars into a system that fails to raise their test scores.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, it would be one thing if the media pounced on government's clear failures but more inclined to stay in government's hip pocket, convinced that the government isn't the problem, how much we are giving it is.</p><p>So a collective media call to doubledown on the spending that has yet to work. A weird trust in repeating the same mistakes only this time, with pricier mistakes and desperately hoping for a different result.</p><p>So you needn't be Einstein to figure that I'm right or left. This is just stupid - just an average American taxpayer whose gut says this has got to stop.</p><p>So tonight, we stop and we step back - way back. We're going to get to the bottom of why America keeps coming up short and it keeps coming back to trust.</p><p>So we've decided to give this issue (INAUDIBLE) the whole show because this isn't about the spending deficit or real estate deficit or a market deficit or faith deficit. This, my friends, is about America's trust deficit.</p><p>We begin with Washington's deficit.</p><p>Taxpayers are seeing lots of their tax money spent but what are they getting for all that spending? Now, more than half of Americans think that more government means more problems.</p><p>Steve Moore says taxpayers are tired of Washington spending (INAUDIBLE) after bad. Lizzie MacDonald says that at least the coverage of that isn't getting the proper coverage. And Basil Smikle says right now, this taxpayer trust is something that both parties need to address.</p><p>All right. So, Steve, first to you. How bad is this?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION VISITING FELLOW: Well, it's really bad. I mean, I was thinking, Neil, when you asked me to do this show about how much Washington has changed in just the last 25 or 30 years I've been here. When I came to Washington, the federal government was spending about a trillion dollars. Now, Neil, it's going to - next year, it'll be spending $4 trillion. And even adjusted for inflation, that's more than doubling up the cost of government. And then you ask people, \"Do you think government is better today than it was 30 or 40 years ago?\" And people say, \"I don't know.\" One other example, if I may, Neil, you mentioned schools. If you look at what's happened to per capita spending per pupil spending in the schools versus - let's say - the 1950s or 60s when schools were a lot better, we're spending about three times as much as we used to. So I think people are saying, \"Wait a minute.\" Throwing more money at these problems as a lot of liberals (INAUDIBLE) after what happened in Baltimore if we just spent more money, people are saying, \"You're crazy. That's the source of the problem. It's not going to solve the crisis.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think, Liz?</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Well, I think Steve is exactly right and as for one, the media doesn't really cover it correctly. John (INAUDIBLE), the economist put out a great story and here's the thing, Neil. When the government spends money, that is added to GDP. So when the government doesn't spend money, politicians are afraid, \"Oh, GDP is going to go down.\" So you could see the vicious circle that's in there. Also, we do have severe crony capitalism, of course. Watch this. Inspector General who oversees Medicare said, \"Hey, wait a second.\" Medicare is not even negotiating drug rebates with drug manufacturers while Medicaid is. And so why? Because their laws written there says, \"You know what? You're not allowed to - you can't interfere with the negotiation between drug companies and the federal government.\" What is that about? I'm not sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: What's even more alarming to me is when you talk to kids of all political stripes, party-affiliation, it's (INAUDIBLE) maybe it's just their blaming it on the parents or blaming it on the prior generations. They have an inherent distrust of Washington, an inherent distrust of institutions, an inherent distrust of any one of authority to get anything done.</p><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: They do and that's unfortunate. Look, I am a person that doesn't necessarily believe that government is the answer to all of our problems but there is a sort of minimum that I think government sets where the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, have we gone beyond the minimum?</p><p>SMIKLE: I don't think we've gone beyond the minimum but I think we've - there may be sort of a dearth of ideas. I think we need some better ideas, some (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But to Lizzie's point, do you think the dearth of ideas is that we just go back to the same old idea? (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: Listen, Neil, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Let him finish.</p><p>SMIKLE: I go back to - I go back to a point when David Dinkins was mayor of New York City and asked the state to increase taxes to put more cops on the street. It was during his administration that you started to see a decline in crime here in New York City and a lot of it is pegged to an increase in taxation. So when I think when (INAUDIBLE) legislators (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Weird that you would mention David Dinkins, although with the present mayor, now Dinkins looks like Winston Churchill.</p><p>SMIKLE: Listen, it started - it started during his administration. Giuliani takes credit for it but that's OK. But.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: --the thing is if you point - if you point directly to the expenditure and the outcome then I think you will think (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, but Steve, my big fear with this is that we're going to go back to the same well and say, \"Well, more money\" or maybe we get a better idea how to spend that money better, but it's always going to be more, more, more. That's what worries me.</p><p>MOORE: Yes. I think the problem with this analysis that \"Gee, if we only had more government\", I think that the problem is this, Neil, that the government has gotten away from the core functions that it is supposed to do. It's supposed to educate our kids. It's supposed to build good roads and highways. It's supposed to defend us. It's not to allow things like what happened in Benghazi. And I would simply respond to this point that the government's not doing much. I think the reason the government is failing in the fundamental things it's supposed to be doing is because it's doing too much. I mean, a good example of this with young people because these polls show that young people are the ones who have lost the most confidence in government. And when I talk to my kids who are completely non-ideological - they don't listen to any of this political stuff. But you know what they don't get? They don't get how the federal government can't run a website for the healthcare system. They're like, \"Wait a minute. A seventh-grader can do that.\"</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. But we're (INAUDIBLE). But the thing is - here's the thing. Why raise taxes when the government is wasting so much money? More than a trillion dollars.</p><p>MOORE: Right, exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD: --worth of vacant federal office buildings littering the landscape. $200 billion in overlap and duplication in the federal government. And you have an incompetent health reform website that is just sucking up money right and left, that is really not working and it's all loaded on Medicaid whose budget is getting blown out right there.</p><p>SMIKLE: Yes, we're talking about - I mean, we don't need to be talking about a website here. What I think we need to be talking about are how government can help - help - solve problems but not be the conclusion. And even the president has said that.</p><p>CAVUTO: But think about (INAUDIBLE) - but why do you think that right after Baltimore, the immediate inclination was \"We need more money\", \"We need more money\", \"We need more money.\" Baltimore in a per capita on a per student basis gets almost as much money as New York City students do. Number two to them. Neither are exactly breaking the mental walls down. So why is there a feeling that if in doubt, throw more money at it?</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, it's not the fact that you're throwing more money at it. It's how that money gets spent. And if you're - if you're - but if you're questioning (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But they're not even fine-tuning it. They're saying it (INAUDIBLE) a matter they haven't (INAUDIBLE) enough money.</p><p>SMIKLE: I think it's important to be able to track where that money goes and make sure the outcomes.</p><p>CAVUTO: But they don't. They don't.</p><p>SMIKLE: --make sure the outcomes (INAUDIBLE). No, I think that's happening. That happened here in New York. It's happening in many other cities where you can actually see that additional.</p><p>CAVUTO: We spent trillions on a war on poverty and all that has yet to move the poverty needle.</p><p>SMIKLE: I think it's moved the needle quite significantly. But what.</p><p>CAVUTO: Three percent. Three percent.</p><p>SMIKLE: --but that's significant. What I do think is problematic though.</p><p>MACDONALD: It is?</p><p>CAVUTO: (INAUDIBLE) trillion dollars?</p><p>SMIKLE: If you talk to the people who came who.</p><p>MACDONALD: Three percent since the 60s? (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: --(INAUDIBLE) - if you - if you talk about the people who came out of poverty, that's significant for them.</p><p>MACDONALD: Listen, we all - right. But we all want to help the poor. You know what helps the poor is a job, because then they become emotionally and literally invested in their area. They don't want to destroy their job or destroy the area around them.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, do you think that's it? The trust - we don't trust the government to know that? Whether you like it or not, we don't trust them to do the right thing.</p><p>MACDONALD: We know we don't trust them because we've thrown so much money out already and it hasn't really worked.</p><p>SMIKLE: But I don't think - I also don't think that they're - I also don't think that anyone - whether either Democratic side or the Republican side, you all speak for that - but I certainly don't think any Democrat is saying, \"Just throw money at the problem.\" That is not the solution. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Actually, last week, they were. But by the way, (INAUDIBLE). You're right to say that both parties have failed in this regard because they do think even Republicans with defense, \"Throw more money out. Throw more money out.\" But, Steve, what do you think of that - where we stand with the trust issue because when it comes to government, we don't stand too well here.</p><p>MOORE: Well, we don't. And I'll just give you one example of what you guys were talking about. I just had a piece in the \"Wall Street Journal\" this week about how we've got a D.C. voucher program that is educating kids in inner cities by allowing them to go in other schools. And here's the amazing thing about that program. It is educating kids, Neil, giving them a quality education for one-half of what it costs in the public schools and we can't get the liberals to support the program and it's helping a lot of kids.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there are lot of - there are a lot of players not measuring up here.</p><p>But, guys, I want to thank you all. (INAUDIBLE). You do this very, very well.</p><p>In the meantime, fastfood giant Andy Puzder says businesses shouldn't trust Washington either and either Republicans offering them help or Democrats because tax bills, red tape just seem to pile up and Uncle Sam just keeps piling on.</p><p>So Andy, how do you get businesses to believe that Washington has their back. 'Cause you've argued for many years now, they have a sense that it does not.</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, HARDEE'S &amp; CARL'S JR CEO: Well, it did help in 2010 when the Republicans took over the House and then again in '12 when they - in '14 when they took over the Senate because at least businesses knew nothing disastrous like Dodd-Frank or Obamacare was going to come down the pike. But we've still got the NLRB out there and trying to inflict the joint employer standard on franchise businesses which would be a disaster. They're talking about ambush elections. We've got an administration that refuses to implement fixes to Obamacare like the 40-hour work week. We've got President Obama last year expanding, telling the Department of Labor to expand the class of employees that are entitled to overtime so people will be compensated for time spent rather than (INAUDIBLE) spent. And then you've got state and federal governments trying to come down with a minimum wage increases, what - at some point, and it really is about the $10, $12 point, you've got employees being paid more than they contribute to the profitability of the business.</p><p>CAVUTO: Then what do you do? I mean, in that - in that - in that environment, Andy, I mean, what do you do to get businesses feeling that Washington can have their back rather than stab them in the back because they have all this money - not necessarily small or medium-size businesses but the larger ones - have a lot of money abroad. $2 trillion that's just sitting offshore and it's not coming back because it's going to be double- taxed or taxed at a high rate so businesses keep it there including some very politically-correct names like Apple. How do you win that money back?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, there's really - really, the only way is to elect government - to elect politicians who are committed to seeing the economy grow, who are not committed to seeing the government grow. We've elected a president - now, he's been president six years - President Obama who's committed to big government. And if you're committed to big government, you're going to scare businesses. Until you get that commitment to economic growth, to getting people jobs, to creating opportunity and reducing poverty by creating jobs, by creating economic growth, until the government gets that kind of focus, the businesses aren't going to trust the government. You're always looking forward to additional and added expenses and the higher your expenses are, the lower your profits are. The lower your projected profits, the less like you are to expand, the less like you are to build a new business, are to open a new business, and the less like you are to create jobs. So until this big government attitude begins to decline. Look, we spent last year, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Small Business Administration estimated that we're spending about $2 trillion. American businesses are spending $2 trillion in compliance costs with the current - in the current regulatory environment. Now, my buddy, Steve More was just mentioning that the government spends $4 trillion. Well, half of that amount - you could take half of that amount and you'd increase the amount that businesses are on tap for by $2 trillion which is what they have to pay in regulatory compliance costs. I mean, it's a very bad situation.</p><p>CAVUTO: Imagine. That's the equivalent of the money they have - they have offshore. It is a very interesting fact.</p><p>Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p>PUZDER: Well, nobody's going to bring the money back unless you get (INAUDIBLE) if you're going to have to pay more taxes on it. And the bad thing is when foreign companies bring that money back, they don't have to pay tax on it. So.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, I love you to death, Andy, but I don't trust you in this sense that you are a fastfood executive and you're thin. So that doesn't jive with me. I've told you this many, many times. So it takes away all your credibility.</p><p>But I kid you. But, Andy, as always, a pleasure. And I love the piece you wrote about Scott Walker keeping in mind the numbers are not what the mainstream media says, it's just how they play with those numbers.</p><p>But, Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p>PUZDER: Thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very, very much. Andy Puzder.</p><p>Well, we've heard of \"The Young and the Restless\", right? But young and investless? Because when it comes to stocks, most young folks want nothing to do with them.</p><p>Next, why Charles Payne says trust him, you'll regret sitting this one out, guys.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, here's why they often call this market a stealth rally. So many aren't even participating in it. In fact, more than half of Americans don't own any stock at all after this incredible run-up because they don't trust this run-up. They don't trust stocks. When things go south, investors run scared.</p><p>Just look at what happened on October 19, 1987. I was there for the scare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO (VOICEOVER): Suddenly, it was a freefall. A better than 22 percent (INAUDIBLE) in the Dow and nervous traders were looking over their shoulders.</p><p>CAVUTO: What they don't know and in fact readily worry about is how far down that correction really has to go, how long it will take, and exactly how many more people will be hurt in the process before the market does decide - if it decides - to turn around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you'll be happy to know that markets did come back and puberty did kick in. And now you know the rest of the story.</p><p>I hate when my staff does this to remind me, same Lego hair then, same Lego hair now.</p><p>Anyway, after the 2008 meltdown, just when people thought stocks couldn't get any lower, they did bounce back to record highs.</p><p>Charles Payne says now, lots of investors are kicking themselves for missing both opportunities.</p><p>But it happens a lot. You can understand in the moment, they're frantic.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh, sure. Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: But here's where I think it's different with this one, Charles, is that once, twice burned, whatever, a lot of young people in particular, \"I don't want anything to do with it.\"</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. There's no doubt about it. And there's a lot of young people who have sort of watched it from afar as they were growing up. And you see your parents like, \"Golly, we lost it all.\" And a few years later, \"Golly, we lost it all.\" And so - then of course, say, \"Well, you know what? We're real estate investors now. Golly, we lost it all.\" So now you hear that they'd rather just have experiences that the - that the big F.O.M.O. - the fear of missing out - isn't on making a lot of money but missing the fun things in life. So you put it all off - family formation, investing - all that stuff, put it off because you might as well live in the moment, have fun while you're young because you don't know what's right around the corner.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is it their parents' experiences singed them or what?</p><p>PAYNE: I think it has. But I also think - what I find really interesting is that we're starting now to see this group come out of it, not come out of it but starting to emerge as entrepreneurs, family formation. They're still renters above buyers and I think you're going to start seeing them invest in things because they're in the midst of all the excitement that the WhatsApps, the Periscopes, all these things that seem to pop up overnight, they're the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they're gravitating those (INAUDIBLE) for jobs because they think they're still interested in getting money, it's just they don't want to get at the means in the market or whatever.</p><p>PAYNE: They love spending it. Right? I mean, just like YOLO - \"You Only Live Once\", right, so yes, it's good. They love spending it, particularly their parents. But the sooner - at some point, \"like I scratched the room\", yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So but you say to what - to kids in general, young people in general, millennials, let's say for want of a better definition, the 18-29, 30-year-olds who are saying, \"I don't trust that (INAUDIBLE).\"</p><p>PAYNE: They've got all their - they've got too much money in cash. Cash goes nowhere - deteriorates every single day in worth and what it can buy. And I think they're going to (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But when the George Soros's, the Druckermillers - all these guys start talking about, \"Hey, this is getting a little long in the tooth\", do you blame them?</p><p>PAYNE: It is a little long in the tooth that - but I mean, I don't know that they should try to play the market timing thing because you (INAUDIBLE) - you'd started this whole thing off the right way. When we are in the midst of a crash, everyone's running. Very few people have the wherewithal to buy. If you can't buy now, you really think you're going to buy in the middle of a crash? But if you're 23.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, what do you tell them, Charles?</p><p>PAYNE: --well, if you're 25-years-old, if you're lucky, you'll probably go through another 10 crashes. I personally hope I live through at least another five major crashes. That means I'll be 90-years-old. And - but at the end of the day, when the smoke clears, usually what happens over the last 20 years, the markets at a new all-time high. What they have to do is don't trust Wall Street, trust the things you like. You love Under Armour clothes, own Under Armour. Go with what you do trust. You're right. There's a lot of shenanigans on Wall Street, there's a lot of knuckleheads and there's a lot of thievery. I'd be the first to admit that. But only a great company over a long period of time, normally you should do pretty well.</p><p>CAVUTO: But a lot of people feel young, they don't market (INAUDIBLE) we're close to what - the fifth anniversary of the flash.</p><p>PAYNE: Sure. Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of people say, \"See, that's what happens. Just when you get in, some idiot does it.\"</p><p>PAYNE: There's no doubt about it. Listen, high-frequency trading isn't illegal but it makes the market more volatile. And there's always - there's too much money. Govenrment and Wall Street. There will always be theft. There's just too much money sloshing around.</p><p>CAVUTO: So what do you tell people who said, let's say, they like Nike or they like Apple and they say, \"Gee, Charles, I agree. Buy what you like. Like what you buy. Know what you're buying.\" But if the stocks (INAUDIBLE) already very rich.\"</p><p>PAYNE: It's just hard to say. They could be rich temporarily. In other words, sometimes the valuation can get ahead of the actual fundamentals. But they - the fundamentals are also improving.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they were saying that about Apple at $50, at $60 a share.</p><p>PAYNE: Trying to pick the top is a tough game.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you just say, \"Hold tight\"?</p><p>PAYNE: Because you're not going to pick the bottom. You're not going to pick the bottom. So if you're going to be in it and that you're 25, start to nibble. You know it's great. You're making (INAUDIBLE) great. These young people know more than anybody on Wall Street. They know the greatest things going on right now. If they can just put their money with what they know, connect those two dots, they'll have an amazing life. They can have the fear of missing out for the rest of their lives and have a fun youth, a fun middle age, and an amazing golden age.</p><p>CAVUTO: I just find that they whine a lot. Just shut up, right?</p><p>All right. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>PAYNE: But that whining gets them what they want.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. \"Get off my lawn!\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a quick quiz. If Americans trust the government the least, who do you think is - well - next to least? The president, the media, big business, or Charles Payne?</p><p>No. The answer right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: The government does this. The government can do that.</p><p>Is the media simply too busy kissing up to the government to objectively cover the government? Because the media itself is now one of the least trusted institutions, second only to Congress.</p><p>That's according to at least one recent poll.</p><p>Media watchers, Brent Bozell, Lauren Ashburn say that the fourth estate stopped being the government's watchdog decades ago.</p><p>Well, Brent, it's very interesting to me that despite all of that, it's like the media wants to doubledown on this faith in government and question those who would dare question government.</p><p>BRENT BOZELL, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER PRESIDENT: Yes. Isn't it incredible that their response to be marginalized is to be even more marginalized. They've become so radicalized. We've seen something in the last two years that I frankly hadn't seen before. This - since 2008, I should say, this commitment, this deliberate commitment not to report news if it harms the narrative of the left. This is not one example. This is not two examples. I can give you 20 examples. As a matter of fact, you and I have talked about this many times on your show. They are deliberately not reporting news.</p><p>CAVUTO: Lauren, to what end though? I mean, they must know that they hurt their own brand. We've seen it happen in print. We've seen it happen with one newspaper or another whether they hop online or not. The content is what people are getting turned off to.</p><p>LAUREN ASHBURN, THE HILL CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's true. I do need to respond to what Brent just said because I think.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let Lauren respond. Go ahead.</p><p>ASHBURN: --that he's - because I think he's wrong, coming up especially with Hillary Clinton, you had the New York Times breaking the email scandal. You had all of the mainstream news organizations hopping on this latest scandal with the Clinton Foundation. So.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I'm talking about government itself. We're talking about whether faith in government can fix problems.</p><p>ASHBURN: No, I understand.</p><p>CAVUTO: Go ahead.</p><p>ASHBURN: I understand. But I think that there are also a lot of journalists who do put their heads down and do the hard work. The FOIA requests are very important in order to find out exactly what is happening and you can't marginalized those. They are about this many reporters who are doing it. But I think that it's very important to know that if you get the right news source.</p><p>CAVUTO: But that's the problem. That - see, Lauren, that's the problem. If only this many are reporting it or whatever, this signifies small percentage - the others are saying especially after Baltimore last week, well, the issue is we're not spending enough. We're not - the government isn't doing enough, in other words, that the government can fix it. That's what worries me.</p><p>Brent?</p><p>BOZELL: Look, with all due respect. Lauren, what you just said is just pure nonsense. They have not gotten to the bottom of a single one of the Obama scandals. They did not get to the bottom of a single one of the Clinton scandals. Just think about their coverage of Watergate and Nixon where they would not let go 'til they got to the bottom of it. Now, look at the IRS. Look at Benghazi. Look at the VA. Look at so many scandals they've been dropped. This one - this Clinton one - will be dropped as well.</p><p>CAVUTO: But let's go back to the government, guys. I can argue how zealous the media is when reporting on the Clinton issues, whatever, but I think back to this idea that if we have problems, the government can fix them. Lauren, do you think that is a media issue to address, that they're not really looking at anything more creative than that?</p><p>ASHBURN: Well, I mean, I think that's a very left - right - way of looking at the world. If there are problems then the government can fix them. I think that if you're looking at news coverage of that specific issue, you're not going to find it because I think a lot of the people who do report think that exactly that - that the government can fix issues. However, you did have the reporting on the VA scandal, right, where there was complete mismanagement and you did see the media latch onto that and paint the VA as villains. I'm not here to defend all of the terrible journalism that's going on right now and there is a lot of it because it's certainly a lot easier right now to pontificate and to spout off than it is to actually take a big 30,000 foot view and take a look at what the government is actually doing with our dollars.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Brent, though, only (INAUDIBLE) and I've raised this with Republicans too who find that a $600 billion defense budget isn't cutting it. If you're digging a hole, it's best to put the spending shovel down or the big government shovel down. What do you think?</p><p>BOZELL: Well, here's - I think - a real direct answer to your question. If you look at a problem - a perceived problem - you will never hear on the networks the idea (INAUDIBLE) \"Leave it alone. Leave people alone. Let people (INAUDIBLE). Let people show some personal responsibility. Get government out of the equation.\" You'll never hear that. Instead, you'll hear a discussion about how much the government needs to do.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys. I wish we had more time 'cause I don't - I wish you guys could have actually come to blows but you're two locations. It makes it very, very hard to do. But next time. Next time.</p><p>Guys, thank you both very much. Well, burn if you're in, burn more if you're out. Next, the housing pro says keeping the housing faith will pay off big time, but you got to give it time.</p><p>It's one thing to not trust the education system, but quite another to rebel against it. Coming up, how parents are revolting with an education system they think's revolting.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I get the idea that trusting big institution is fleeting. In this hour, we're digging into exactly why? A big reason, of course, goes back to the 2007 housing bubble. Once the housing market crashed, however, confidence in real estate itself crashed along with it.</p><p>And now home ownership is at a better than quarter century low, as Americans are pulling a 180 on this big American dream.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't have the money to buy a house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Move too much. Too much money, I'm never going to have that much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't afford to buy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think I'm mature enough yet for it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you buy a house, you have to stay there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why buy a house if you are going to sail on it and ruin your credit ratings.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Renting is easier. Things have taken care of for you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And probably because we are too poor. We have no money.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: As you can see, a lot of millennials are simply opting to rent rather than buy, but former Fannie Mae executive, Tim Rood, says that is a big mistake. They are missing on a moment to make a good investment and make a good return.</p><p>But if you think about it, a lot of these kids are saying, I haven't seen that return. My parents haven't seen that return, what do you say?</p><p>TIM ROOD, FORMER FANNIE MAE EXECUTIVE: Thanks, Neil. So you just saw or made the reference to the housing home ownership rates dropping to 63 percent. When you think about these numbers in the aggregate or the abstract, they don't mean a lot.</p><p>But there is a lot of financial implications when you think about every 1 percent of that drop is actually one million households that aren't owning a home. That's one million households paying 30 percent more a month for their living expenses. There are one million households --</p><p>CAVUTO: They figure they are saving on the hassle and the risk of another meltdown. That's what they say, you say what?</p><p>ROOD: Absolutely. Look, there's always going to be some casualties in the housing. If you can get 95 percent success rate, which means 5 percent are going to lose home to foreclosure. Obviously, it's a cautionary tale.</p><p>That's 95 percent of folks who see the wealth appreciation of home ownership which it's important to remember, the household net worth of a renter is $5,000 in this country.</p><p>The household net worth of a home owner is $150,000. But Neil, the big picture was accidentally exposed recently on boomers. They showed seniors when they passed away, how much financial net worth was in their house, and it turns out only 20 percent of these seniors when they passed away had any financial net worth beyond the home equity in their house.</p><p>So you can imagine during the most prosperous time, that's the end result. We've got to focus on how to get more folks into housing today.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but there are a lot of people in the last seven, eight- year period since the meltdown who would not have that appreciation at all so they would not have the housing component of that wealth, right?</p><p>ROOD: Well, I think people talk like that, but in real terms, you've seen about $3 trillion of appreciation in housing over the last three years. It bottomed out in 2012, but it is rallying and we are still about 15 percent from the highs.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you say give it time and have faith that in time things come back?</p><p>ROOD: Well, there's a huge demand push. Americans are funny. At no point in history have been more Americans that have a desire to live indoors. I mean, we keep growing the population and ultimately 65 percent historically are going to want to buy a house.</p><p>You've seen people who have lost their house to foreclosure. There is 6 million, 9 million of these people, who have lost their house to foreclosure. That when polled they still say that --</p><p>CAVUTO: And they want back in.</p><p>ROOD: They want back in. It's a good investment.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you, Tim, very, very much. Good to seeing you.</p><p>Well, to people that have a right to not trust the housing market or to Tim's point, they going way too far and being way too jaded? Banks are trying to tempt them in, but are they really doing too much here offering as little as 3 percent down mortgages.</p><p>Well, real estate analyst, Katrina Campins, said this is the kind of thing that worries here that some of the banks and institutions are sucking them back in, to be slaughtered.</p><p>KATRINA CAMPINS, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" CONTESTANT: Right, and I believe that the concern is twofold. First, I think a lot of these borrowers are not aware that they run the risk of their house actually being worth less than they owe if the market for some reason declines, which historically it may.</p><p>And with these small down payments, borrowers are also not aware they'll get a higher interest rate and the cost of the loan in the long run will be higher than if they put more of a down payment down, not to mention mortgage insurance.</p><p>I think also the lenders run a risk of these borrowers walking away because they don't have enough skin in the game. So I think it's extremely dangerous and you know, God knows that I love people buying real estate. That's what I do for a living.</p><p>However, I'm also concerned that maybe these banks are giving people too much without enough skin in the game. And without educating them that through the life of the loan, it may seem like an opportunity to appreciate and to buy into the American dream without enough money down, but in the long run, I think that it's a mistake.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Katrina, the argument for letting these low money down loans go through is most young people since it's targeted largely at young people, do have the financial discipline to stick with the mortgage, grow with the mortgage as they grow with their jobs.</p><p>If you don't do something like this, it will only be a rich man/rich woman's market and we'll never see housing stabilize. What do you make of that argument?</p><p>CAMPINS: Well, I think it comes down to employment as well. You know, the unemployment rate with the younger generation just isn't rising at the rate that we need it in order for them to build this wealth.</p><p>I think one other point which is not realized is that now the banks are actually allowing these younger generation to get down payment from family members, which again, if you don't earn it, I'm a firm believer, if you earn it, you value it more.</p><p>A family member is actually putting that down payment for you then you're more inclined to walk away than if you worked hard for it. I think part of the American dream is working really hard to be able to attain it.</p><p>So I'm a firm believer that again, you have to work for it, and in the end, the housing market will do better because of it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, unless you have a rich uncle who doesn't seem to care. Katrina, thank you very, very much. Good seeing you again.</p><p>CAMPINS: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, from the reaction we got on the street, the things you don't trust the most are the things you apparently use the most?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm on Facebook. I'm on Twitter. All our information is out there, anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you try to get rid of your page, it's like always there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They definitely have the technology to see everything everybody does.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm getting pop-ups, advertisements and things I've searched in the past.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Every day I think why am I still doing this?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Trust in technology is fading, but are we the problem it is still a big thing? Well, Americans don't want their data in the hands of big tech companies or the government for that matter or both. They're more addicted to it than ever before.</p><p>To cybersecurity experts, David Kennedy and Kurt Knutsson, who says this technology that we may not like, we apparently still love. It is weird, right? It's like a double-edged sword.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, \"KURT THE CYBER GUY\": Most people don't know when they're using Cloud storage, when your information is stored on various servers, they think it's up in an atmosphere, but no, it's giant farms of servers in various parts of the world.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they don't care or they don't know the details like making hot dogs.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Here's when you care, the moment you care is when you took something that is really important to you and you're working on it, like a book you are writing, and you store it on a service that isn't your own computer or device, and all of a sudden one day, poof! It's gone.</p><p>What the heck happened? This thing that's shared on all of your devices available anywhere and you have to revert to a copy stored six months ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: And then it becomes a nightmare. You know, David, I've always remembered the former Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said if you want your privacy, it is gone, the technology and convenience obviously has some intrusions on privacy. But its benefits outweigh whatever annoyances you encounter. Do you agree with that?</p><p>DAVID KENNEDY, TRUSTEDSEC FOUNDER: Well, I still think there is a fine balance between privacy and the types of information you put online, but the problem is that. I mean, you are integrating technology into everything that you do on a regular basis.</p><p>I mean, with your Android phones, iPhones, with Macs, all of those have call backs and stored data on these Cloud infrastructures that store this type of information.</p><p>So to put it short, our privacy is pretty much gone when it comes to the amount of information that we do on these pieces of technology, but we still have to be cautious about the types of information we put up there.</p><p>KNUTSSON: David, I would jump in and say cautious is the easy word. You have to be stupid to store something critical in your life. Do not put a will, medical records, personal data, nothing that would --</p><p>CAVUTO: But medical data, that is getting online.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Well, you may not have a choice. You are not the one who is control of that so perhaps --</p><p>CAVUTO: So let's say you are doing everything right, but someone else is deciding to take that data.</p><p>KNUTSSON: One little leak in the faucet from one point to the next point is what goes wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO: I got a guy like you, when is the last time you wrote a paper check, you do everything probably online?</p><p>KNUTSSON: I mean, you and I probably -- because I lose them.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have people who do that.</p><p>KNUTSSON: It's not about that. When I do it, I lose.</p><p>CAVUTO: What is a smart move? The convenience of it this is such and you can do it so quickly dictates this new world. Even though we know in our back of our minds, there is a risk of something going wrong, we like the convenience.</p><p>KENNEDY: Listen, we want to be able to have as much convenience as possible. We want to be able to order our groceries and then go pick them up at the store. You have toilets you can control from the smartphones now. Convenience is huge.</p><p>The problem is it's not just consumers that are doing this as well. It's businesses and that's completely out of our control. Businesses are putting medical data, Social Security number, sensitive data, financial records in these Cloud infrastructures, which are not protected.</p><p>So it's a much wider issue than just the consumer themselves. It's wider on the business front as well, and that's why you are seeing a lot of these breaches occur. It's going to be a problem to come and something we face directly in the next two years.</p><p>CAVUTO: We love technology, but don't think it is going to be there for us.</p><p>KENNEDY: I like my smart toilet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Who doesn't? But it's a family show. Look at the time. I want you to look at this chart. With education spending like, this you would think test scores would be off the charts. News flash, they're not. No wonder where a lot of parents are flat-out serious over all this flat lining.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, to all these skeptical parents and kids about our schools, 31 percent of just parents do not trust the government's handling of all of this.</p><p>Students aren't getting results, even as taxpayer dollars are being thrown again, billion after billion after billion into school systems.</p><p>To Ashley Pratte and a former New York school superintendent, Carole Hankin, on if there is a way to fix, what many think, is now a broken educational system. Ashley, what do you think?</p><p>ASHLEY PRATTE, FP1 STRATEGIES VP OF COMMUNICATIONS: I think that the whole idea of throwing money at a problem as a solution is not a solution, and I think that's the real issue here. We look at accountability of schools and test scores and everything and they're just plummeting and failing our students.</p><p>And parents and students deserve options and they deserve choice. That's why I think the school choice movement is so important. Students shouldn't be relegated to a school based on zip code. Students learn in different environments.</p><p>I think that, you know, an age where technology is rampant and we have choice at our fingertips, it should be the same way for education, and students should have that option as well as parents to say if my student is not thriving in this environment and I know that they can thrive elsewhere, that's where they are going to go school.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think what she's saying, Carole, is she's pro-choice on education.</p><p>PRATTE: That's a good way of putting it on that issue.</p><p>DR. CAROLE HANKIN, FORMER NEW YORK SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT: I don't think pro-choice is the problem or the solution. I think that we have so many schools in this country, and just saying that students can go to other schools won't work every place. I do believe --</p><p>CAVUTO: Works in a lot of places, Carole.</p><p>HANKIN: Well, small amounts of students and what happen to the ones who can't get out? I think we need to fix the schools, but I absolutely agree that throwing more money is not the answer.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, wouldn't competition would help?</p><p>HANKIN: I think competition helps in every single field, yes, but I also think that we need to do something with the schools that are broken.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you make of that, Ashley? That if it's a matter of just the same existing system, challenging that that existing system with a competitors, does put a little bit of kick in your step.</p><p>PRATTE: Yes, and I'm all for competition, I think that's what's important with the rise of teachers unions, and I'm not bashing teachers here. My sister is one, and it's noble work she's doing.</p><p>This is why I wonder where the money is going, Neil? Because she has to take money out of her pocket to buy supplies for students in her classroom so you know, with all the money funnelled in, and you look at schools in Baltimore because that's been in the news recently. You see $15,000 per student.</p><p>Where is all of that money going? Is it going to the betterment of the students? When teachers have to take money out of their own pocketbooks or checkbooks to pay for supplies for their students that makes me wonder where exactly is the money being funnelled to?</p><p>Is it helping the students? I don't think so and it's definitely not helping the teachers.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, I want to thank you guys very much. By now you get it, America has big trust issues, but next, rocker, Andrew W.K., one of the more optimistic guys I know here to build trust facts for the middle-aged, the young, the old, you name it. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, this hour we have laid out eight out of ten millennials don't even trust other people even other young people. To the guy a lot of you who call the philosopher of partying because he just takes all the tension and brings it down a notch. Rocker, Andrew W.K., on if Americans can ever start trusting each other again.</p><p>Andrew, it's always good to have you, but I think that's the heart of the problem here, forget institutions, it's inherent thing, we don't trust or actually flip over each other. What's the problem?</p><p>ANDREW W.K., \"PHILOSOPHER OF PARTYING\": Well, this is a puzzling and perplexing issue but, fortunately, it is as simple as trusting one's self. Most of these societal issues come down to an individual point of view and what's inside. If you can't trust your own self, of course you're not going to trust other people.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, when you perform, song writer, entertainer -- it's always very uplifting, I'm told. I know that your whole approach is very positive, positive energy, and it's contagious.</p><p>I always tell young people, younger than you, I don't thinker than -- younger than my own kids that the bottom line is you are the vibe you let off.</p><p>And if you're negative, all that's going to be contagious. If you're positive, that too will be contagious. I think it starts there, but I could be simplistic. What do you think?</p><p>ANDREW W.K.: No, I agree with that. It's a code of ethics really that starts in your own behavior. It can seem rather trivial to imagine that how you interact with people throughout your day could actually have a global impact or at least even in your own community, but it really does.</p><p>If you don't have these strengths, if I don't have the strength to be polite to that stranger or have that trust, that kind of faith that humanity isn't bad, then how would I believe that the rest of the world --</p><p>CAVUTO: You can't blame a lot of people young or old, right, Andrew? I tried to give the benefit of the doubt to the government, let me down, markets, let me down, housing let me down. Again, and again, my trust was broken like a bad relationship, no more.</p><p>ANDREW W.K.: Well, a bad relationship is a very good example because if we're going on dates with someone and we have bad experiences, it's easy to want to cast aside all of romance, all of love, all relationships because you don't want to get hurt.</p><p>But we also don't want to live in a world where we don't have love or relationships or hold out hope for something more. Idealism is challenging. It's much easier to become cynical, but we don't want to live in that kind of world.</p><p>CAVUTO: Speak for yourself, young man. Andrew W.K., it is attitudinal, we are bigger than the problems that seem to confront us. I hope that helps everybody, and I want you to return next week bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and feeling we can conquer the world.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Neil Cavuto. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And America, we have a problem - a trust problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Right now, across the nation, we're seeing a loss of faith in all our  institutions among all political types.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Investors burned by the financial crash staying out of the stock market.   Home buyers singed by the real estate meltdown staying out of the housing  market.  A generation of kids exposed to both showing little interest in  either.  Their trust in institutions down.  Their faith in marriage itself  at an all-time low.  Parents who've lost confidence at a public school  system that fails their kids despite the government pouring billions of  dollars into a system that fails to raise their test scores.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now, it would be one thing if the media pounced on government's clear  failures but more inclined to stay in government's hip pocket, convinced  that the government isn't the problem, how much we are giving it is.</p><p> So a collective media call to doubledown on the spending that has yet to  work.  A weird trust in repeating the same mistakes only this time, with  pricier mistakes and desperately hoping for a different result.</p><p> So you needn't be Einstein to figure that I'm right or left.  This is just  stupid - just an average American taxpayer whose gut says this has got to  stop.</p><p> So tonight, we stop and we step back - way back.  We're going to get to the  bottom of why America keeps coming up short and it keeps coming back to  trust.  </p><p> So we've decided to give this issue (INAUDIBLE) the whole show because this  isn't about the spending deficit or real estate deficit or a market deficit  or faith deficit.  This, my friends, is about America's trust deficit.</p><p> We begin with Washington's deficit.</p><p> Taxpayers are seeing lots of their tax money spent but what are they  getting for all that spending?  Now, more than half of Americans think that  more government means more problems.</p><p> Steve Moore says taxpayers are tired of Washington spending (INAUDIBLE)  after bad.  Lizzie MacDonald says that at least the coverage of that isn't  getting the proper coverage.  And Basil Smikle says right now, this  taxpayer trust is something that both parties need to address.</p><p> All right.  So, Steve, first to you.  How bad is this?</p><p> STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION VISITING FELLOW:  Well, it's really bad.   I mean, I was thinking, Neil, when you asked me to do this show about how  much Washington has changed in just the last 25 or 30 years I've been here.   When I came to Washington, the federal government was spending about a  trillion dollars.  Now, Neil, it's going to - next year, it'll be spending  $4 trillion.  And even adjusted for inflation, that's more than doubling up  the cost of government.  And then you ask people, \"Do you think government  is better today than it was 30 or 40 years ago?\"  And people say, \"I don't  know.\"  One other example, if I may, Neil, you mentioned schools.  If you  look at what's happened to per capita spending per pupil spending in the  schools versus - let's say - the 1950s or 60s when schools were a lot  better, we're spending about three times as much as we used to.  So I think  people are saying, \"Wait a minute.\"  Throwing more money at these problems  as a lot of liberals (INAUDIBLE) after what happened in Baltimore if we  just spent more money, people are saying, \"You're crazy.  That's the source  of the problem.  It's not going to solve the crisis.\"</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you think, Liz?</p><p> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Well, I think Steve is exactly  right and as for one, the media doesn't really cover it correctly.  John  (INAUDIBLE), the economist put out a great story and here's the thing,  Neil.  When the government spends money, that is added to GDP.  So when the  government doesn't spend money, politicians are afraid, \"Oh, GDP is going  to go down.\"  So you could see the vicious circle that's in there.  Also,  we do have severe crony capitalism, of course.  Watch this.  Inspector  General who oversees Medicare said, \"Hey, wait a second.\"  Medicare is not  even negotiating drug rebates with drug manufacturers while Medicaid is.   And so why?  Because their laws written there says, \"You know what?  You're  not allowed to - you can't interfere with the negotiation between drug  companies and the federal government.\"  What is that about?  I'm not sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What's even more alarming to me is when you talk to kids of all  political stripes, party-affiliation, it's (INAUDIBLE) maybe it's just  their blaming it on the parents or blaming it on the prior generations.   They have an inherent distrust of Washington, an inherent distrust of  institutions, an inherent distrust of any one of authority to get anything  done.  </p><p> BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  They do and that's unfortunate.   Look, I am a person that doesn't necessarily believe that government is the  answer to all of our problems but there is a sort of minimum that I think  government sets where the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, have we gone beyond the minimum? </p><p> SMIKLE:  I don't think we've gone beyond the minimum but I think we've -  there may be sort of a dearth of ideas.  I think we need some better ideas,  some (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  But to Lizzie's point, do you think the dearth of ideas is that we  just go back to the same old idea?  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> SMIKLE:  Listen, Neil, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Let him finish.</p><p> SMIKLE:  I go back to - I go back to a point when David Dinkins was mayor  of New York City and asked the state to increase taxes to put more cops on  the street.  It was during his administration that you started to see a  decline in crime here in New York City and a lot of it is pegged to an  increase in taxation.  So when I think when (INAUDIBLE) legislators  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Weird that you would mention David Dinkins, although with the  present mayor, now Dinkins looks like Winston Churchill.</p><p> SMIKLE:  Listen, it started - it started during his administration.   Giuliani takes credit for it but that's OK.  But.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Well, that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> SMIKLE:  --the thing is if you point - if you point directly to the  expenditure and the outcome then I think you will think (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, but Steve, my big fear with this is that we're going to go  back to the same well and say, \"Well, more money\" or maybe we get a better  idea how to spend that money better, but it's always going to be more,  more, more.  That's what worries me.</p><p> MOORE:  Yes.  I think the problem with this analysis that \"Gee, if we only  had more government\", I think that the problem is this, Neil, that the  government has gotten away from the core functions that it is supposed to  do.  It's supposed to educate our kids.  It's supposed to build good roads  and highways.  It's supposed to defend us.  It's not to allow things like  what happened in Benghazi.  And I would simply respond to this point that  the government's not doing much.  I think the reason the government is  failing in the fundamental things it's supposed to be doing is because it's  doing too much.  I mean, a good example of this with young people because  these polls show that young people are the ones who have lost the most  confidence in government.  And when I talk to my kids who are completely  non-ideological - they don't listen to any of this political stuff.  But  you know what they don't get?  They don't get how the federal government  can't run a website for the healthcare system.  They're like, \"Wait a  minute.  A seventh-grader can do that.\"</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.  But we're (INAUDIBLE).  But the thing is - here's the  thing.  Why raise taxes when the government is wasting so much money?  More  than a trillion dollars.</p><p> MOORE:  Right, exactly.</p><p> MACDONALD:  --worth of vacant federal office buildings littering the  landscape.  $200 billion in overlap and duplication in the federal  government.  And you have an incompetent health reform website that is just  sucking up money right and left, that is really not working and it's all  loaded on Medicaid whose budget is getting blown out right there.</p><p> SMIKLE:  Yes, we're talking about - I mean, we don't need to be talking  about a website here.  What I think we need to be talking about are how  government can help - help - solve problems but not be the conclusion.  And  even the president has said that.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But think about (INAUDIBLE) - but why do you think that right  after Baltimore, the immediate inclination was \"We need more money\", \"We  need more money\", \"We need more money.\"  Baltimore in a per capita on a per  student basis gets almost as much money as New York City students do.   Number two to them.  Neither are exactly breaking the mental walls down.   So why is there a feeling that if in doubt, throw more money at it?</p><p> SMIKLE:  Well, it's not the fact that you're throwing more money at it.   It's how that money gets spent.  And if you're - if you're - but if you're  questioning (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  But they're not even fine-tuning it.  They're saying it  (INAUDIBLE) a matter they haven't (INAUDIBLE) enough money.</p><p> SMIKLE:  I think it's important to be able to track where that money goes  and make sure the outcomes.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But they don't.  They don't.</p><p> SMIKLE:  --make sure the outcomes (INAUDIBLE).  No, I think that's  happening.  That happened here in New York.  It's happening in many other  cities where you can actually see that additional.</p><p> CAVUTO:  We spent trillions on a war on poverty and all that has yet to  move the poverty needle.</p><p> SMIKLE:  I think it's moved the needle quite significantly.  But what.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Three percent.  Three percent.</p><p> SMIKLE:  --but that's significant.  What I do think is problematic though.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It is?</p><p> CAVUTO:  (INAUDIBLE) trillion dollars?</p><p> SMIKLE:  If you talk to the people who came who.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Three percent since the 60s?  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> SMIKLE:  --(INAUDIBLE) - if you - if you talk about the people who came out  of poverty, that's significant for them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Listen, we all - right.  But we all want to help the poor.  You  know what helps the poor is a job, because then they become emotionally and  literally invested in their area.  They don't want to destroy their job or  destroy the area around them.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, do you think that's it?  The trust - we don't trust the  government to know that?  Whether you like it or not, we don't trust them  to do the right thing.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We know we don't trust them because we've thrown so much money  out already and it hasn't really worked.</p><p> SMIKLE:  But I don't think - I also don't think that they're - I also don't  think that anyone - whether either Democratic side or the Republican side,  you all speak for that - but I certainly don't think any Democrat is  saying, \"Just throw money at the problem.\"  That is not the solution.   (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Actually, last week, they were.  But by the way, (INAUDIBLE).   You're right to say that both parties have failed in this regard because  they do think even Republicans with defense, \"Throw more money out.  Throw  more money out.\"  But, Steve, what do you think of that - where we stand  with the trust issue because when it comes to government, we don't stand  too well here.</p><p> MOORE:  Well, we don't.  And I'll just give you one example of what you  guys were talking about.  I just had a piece in the \"Wall Street Journal\"  this week about how we've got a D.C. voucher program that is educating kids  in inner cities by allowing them to go in other schools.  And here's the  amazing thing about that program.  It is educating kids, Neil, giving them  a quality education for one-half of what it costs in the public schools and  we can't get the liberals to support the program and it's helping a lot of  kids.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, there are lot of - there are a lot of players not measuring  up here.  </p><p> But, guys, I want to thank you all.  (INAUDIBLE).  You do this very, very  well.  </p><p> In the meantime, fastfood giant Andy Puzder says businesses shouldn't trust  Washington either and either Republicans offering them help or Democrats  because tax bills, red tape just seem to pile up and Uncle Sam just keeps  piling on. </p><p> So Andy, how do you get businesses to believe that Washington has their  back.  'Cause you've argued for many years now, they have a sense that it  does not.</p><p> ANDY PUZDER, HARDEE'S &amp; CARL'S JR CEO:  Well, it did help in 2010 when the  Republicans took over the House and then again in '12 when they - in '14  when they took over the Senate because at least businesses knew nothing  disastrous like Dodd-Frank or Obamacare was going to come down the pike.   But we've still got the NLRB out there and trying to inflict the joint  employer standard on franchise businesses which would be a disaster.   They're talking about ambush elections.  We've got an administration that  refuses to implement fixes to Obamacare like the 40-hour work week.  We've  got President Obama last year expanding, telling the Department of Labor to  expand the class of employees that are entitled to overtime so people will  be compensated for time spent rather than (INAUDIBLE) spent.  And then  you've got state and federal governments trying to come down with a minimum  wage increases, what - at some point, and it really is about the $10, $12  point, you've got employees being paid more than they contribute to the  profitability of the business.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Then what do you do?  I mean, in that - in that - in that  environment, Andy, I mean, what do you do to get businesses feeling that  Washington can have their back rather than stab them in the back because  they have all this money - not necessarily small or medium-size businesses  but the larger ones - have a lot of money abroad.  $2 trillion that's just  sitting offshore and it's not coming back because it's going to be double- taxed or taxed at a high rate so businesses keep it there including some  very politically-correct names like Apple.  How do you win that money back?</p><p> PUZDER:  Well, there's really - really, the only way is to elect government  - to elect politicians who are committed to seeing the economy grow, who  are not committed to seeing the government grow.  We've elected a president  - now, he's been president six years - President Obama who's committed to  big government.  And if you're committed to big government, you're going to  scare businesses.  Until you get that commitment to economic growth, to  getting people jobs, to creating opportunity and reducing poverty by  creating jobs, by creating economic growth, until the government gets that  kind of focus, the businesses aren't going to trust the government.  You're  always looking forward to additional and added expenses and the higher your  expenses are, the lower your profits are.  The lower your projected  profits, the less like you are to expand, the less like you are to build a  new business, are to open a new business, and the less like you are to  create jobs.  So until this big government attitude begins to decline.   Look, we spent last year, the National Association of Manufacturers and the  Small Business Administration estimated that we're spending about $2  trillion.  American businesses are spending $2 trillion in compliance costs  with the current - in the current regulatory environment.  Now, my buddy,  Steve More was just mentioning that the government spends $4 trillion.   Well, half of that amount - you could take half of that amount and you'd  increase the amount that businesses are on tap for by $2 trillion which is  what they have to pay in regulatory compliance costs.  I mean, it's a very  bad situation.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Imagine.  That's the equivalent of the money they have - they have  offshore.  It is a very interesting fact.  </p><p> Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p> PUZDER:  Well, nobody's going to bring the money back unless you get  (INAUDIBLE) if you're going to have to pay more taxes on it.  And the bad  thing is when foreign companies bring that money back, they don't have to  pay tax on it.  So.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, I love you to death, Andy, but I don't trust you in this  sense that you are a fastfood executive and you're thin.  So that doesn't  jive with me.  I've told you this many, many times.  So it takes away all  your credibility.</p><p> But I kid you.  But, Andy, as always, a pleasure.  And I love the piece you  wrote about Scott Walker keeping in mind the numbers are not what the  mainstream media says, it's just how they play with those numbers. </p><p> But, Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p> PUZDER:  Thank you.  I appreciate it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very, very much.  Andy Puzder.</p><p> Well, we've heard of \"The Young and the Restless\", right?  But young and  investless?  Because when it comes to stocks, most young folks want nothing  to do with them.</p><p> Next, why Charles Payne says trust him, you'll regret sitting this one out,  guys.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, here's why they often call this market a stealth rally.  So  many aren't even participating in it.  In fact, more than half of Americans  don't own any stock at all after this incredible run-up because they don't  trust this run-up.  They don't trust stocks.  When things go south,  investors run scared.  </p><p> Just look at what happened on October 19, 1987.  I was there for the scare.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO (VOICEOVER):  Suddenly, it was a freefall.  A better than 22 percent  (INAUDIBLE) in the Dow and nervous traders were looking over their  shoulders.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What they don't know and in fact readily worry about is how far  down that correction really has to go, how long it will take, and exactly  how many more people will be hurt in the process before the market does  decide - if it decides - to turn around.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, you'll be happy to know that markets did come back and  puberty did kick in.  And now you know the rest of the story.  </p><p> I hate when my staff does this to remind me, same Lego hair then, same Lego  hair now.</p><p> Anyway, after the 2008 meltdown, just when people thought stocks couldn't  get any lower, they did bounce back to record highs.  </p><p> Charles Payne says now, lots of investors are kicking themselves for  missing both opportunities. </p><p> But it happens a lot.  You can understand in the moment, they're frantic.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Oh, sure.  Sure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But here's where I think it's different with this one, Charles, is  that once, twice burned, whatever, a lot of young people in particular, \"I  don't want anything to do with it.\"</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  There's no doubt about it.  And there's a lot of young people  who have sort of watched it from afar as they were growing up.  And you see  your parents like, \"Golly, we lost it all.\"  And a few years later, \"Golly,  we lost it all.\"  And so - then of course, say, \"Well, you know what?   We're real estate investors now.  Golly, we lost it all.\"  So now you hear  that they'd rather just have experiences that the - that the big F.O.M.O. -  the fear of missing out - isn't on making a lot of money but missing the  fun things in life.  So you put it all off - family formation, investing -  all that stuff, put it off because you might as well live in the moment,  have fun while you're young because you don't know what's right around the  corner.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it their parents' experiences singed them or what?</p><p> PAYNE:  I think it has.  But I also think - what I find really interesting  is that we're starting now to see this group come out of it, not come out  of it but starting to emerge as entrepreneurs, family formation.  They're  still renters above buyers and I think you're going to start seeing them  invest in things because they're in the midst of all the excitement that  the WhatsApps, the Periscopes, all these things that seem to pop up  overnight, they're the ones that are making it happen.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And they're gravitating those (INAUDIBLE) for jobs because they  think they're still interested in getting money, it's just they don't want  to get at the means in the market or whatever.</p><p> PAYNE:  They love spending it.  Right?  I mean, just like YOLO - \"You Only  Live Once\", right, so yes, it's good.  They love spending it, particularly  their parents.  But the sooner - at some point, \"like I scratched the  room\", yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  So but you say to what - to kids in general, young  people in general, millennials, let's say for want of a better definition,  the 18-29, 30-year-olds who are saying, \"I don't trust that (INAUDIBLE).\"  </p><p> PAYNE:  They've got all their - they've got too much money in cash.  Cash  goes nowhere - deteriorates every single day in worth and what it can buy.   And I think they're going to (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  But when the George Soros's, the Druckermillers - all these guys  start talking about, \"Hey, this is getting a little long in the tooth\", do  you blame them?</p><p> PAYNE:  It is a little long in the tooth that - but I mean, I don't know  that they should try to play the market timing thing because you  (INAUDIBLE) - you'd started this whole thing off the right way.  When we  are in the midst of a crash, everyone's running.  Very few people have the  wherewithal to buy.  If you can't buy now, you really think you're going to  buy in the middle of a crash?  But if you're 23.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, what do you tell them, Charles?</p><p> PAYNE:  --well, if you're 25-years-old, if you're lucky, you'll probably go  through another 10 crashes.  I personally hope I live through at least  another five major crashes.  That means I'll be 90-years-old.  And - but at  the end of the day, when the smoke clears, usually what happens over the  last 20 years, the markets at a new all-time high.  What they have to do is  don't trust Wall Street, trust the things you like.  You love Under Armour  clothes, own Under Armour.  Go with what you do trust.  You're right.   There's a lot of shenanigans on Wall Street, there's a lot of knuckleheads  and there's a lot of thievery.  I'd be the first to admit that.  But only a  great company over a long period of time, normally you should do pretty  well.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But a lot of people feel young, they don't market (INAUDIBLE)  we're close to what - the fifth anniversary of the flash.</p><p> PAYNE:  Sure.  Sure.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  A lot of people say, \"See, that's what happens.  Just when you get  in, some idiot does it.\"</p><p> PAYNE:  There's no doubt about it.  Listen, high-frequency trading isn't  illegal but it makes the market more volatile.  And there's always -  there's too much money.  Govenrment and Wall Street.  There will always be  theft.  There's just too much money sloshing around.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So what do you tell people who said, let's say, they like Nike or  they like Apple and they say, \"Gee, Charles, I agree.  Buy what you like.   Like what you buy.  Know what you're buying.\"  But if the stocks  (INAUDIBLE) already very rich.\"</p><p> PAYNE:  It's just hard to say.  They could be rich temporarily.  In other  words, sometimes the valuation can get ahead of the actual fundamentals.   But they - the fundamentals are also improving.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And they were saying that about Apple at $50, at $60 a share.</p><p> PAYNE:  Trying to pick the top is a tough game. </p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you just say, \"Hold tight\"? </p><p> PAYNE:  Because you're not going to pick the bottom.  You're not going to  pick the bottom.  So if you're going to be in it and that you're 25, start  to nibble.  You know it's great.  You're making (INAUDIBLE) great.  These  young people know more than anybody on Wall Street.  They know the greatest  things going on right now.  If they can just put their money with what they  know, connect those two dots, they'll have an amazing life.  They can have  the fear of missing out for the rest of their lives and have a fun youth, a  fun middle age, and an amazing golden age.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I just find that they whine a lot.  Just shut up, right?</p><p> All right.  Thank you very, very much.</p><p> PAYNE:  But that whining gets them what they want.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  \"Get off my lawn!\"</p><p> Meanwhile, a quick quiz.  If Americans trust the government the least, who  do you think is - well - next to least?  The president, the media, big  business, or Charles Payne?  </p><p> No.  The answer right after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The government does this.  The government can do that.  </p><p> Is the media simply too busy kissing up to the government to objectively  cover the government?  Because the media itself is now one of the least  trusted institutions, second only to Congress.  </p><p> That's according to at least one recent poll.  </p><p> Media watchers, Brent Bozell, Lauren Ashburn say that the fourth estate  stopped being the government's watchdog decades ago.</p><p> Well, Brent, it's very interesting to me that despite all of that, it's  like the media wants to doubledown on this faith in government and question  those who would dare question government.</p><p> BRENT BOZELL, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Isn't it incredible  that their response to be marginalized is to be even more marginalized.   They've become so radicalized.  We've seen something in the last two years  that I frankly hadn't seen before.  This - since 2008, I should say, this  commitment, this deliberate commitment not to report news if it harms the  narrative of the left.  This is not one example.  This is not two examples.   I can give you 20 examples.  As a matter of fact, you and I have talked  about this many times on your show.  They are deliberately not reporting  news.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Lauren, to what end though?  I mean, they must know that they hurt  their own brand.  We've seen it happen in print.  We've seen it happen with  one newspaper or another whether they hop online or not.  The content is  what people are getting turned off to.</p><p> LAUREN ASHBURN, THE HILL CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's true.  I do need to  respond to what Brent just said because I think.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Let Lauren respond.  Go ahead.</p><p> ASHBURN:  --that he's - because I think he's wrong, coming up especially  with Hillary Clinton, you had the New York Times breaking the email  scandal.  You had all of the mainstream news organizations hopping on this  latest scandal with the Clinton Foundation.  So.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But I'm talking about government itself.  We're talking about  whether faith in government can fix problems.</p><p> ASHBURN:  No, I understand.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Go ahead.</p><p> ASHBURN:  I understand.  But I think that there are also a lot of  journalists who do put their heads down and do the hard work.  The FOIA  requests are very important in order to find out exactly what is happening  and you can't marginalized those.  They are about this many reporters who  are doing it.  But I think that it's very important to know that if you get  the right news source.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But that's the problem.  That - see, Lauren, that's the problem.   If only this many are reporting it or whatever, this signifies small  percentage - the others are saying especially after Baltimore last week,  well, the issue is we're not spending enough.  We're not - the government  isn't doing enough, in other words, that the government can fix it.  That's  what worries me.  </p><p> Brent?</p><p> BOZELL:  Look, with all due respect.  Lauren, what you just said is just  pure nonsense.  They have not gotten to the bottom of a single one of the  Obama scandals.  They did not get to the bottom of a single one of the  Clinton scandals.  Just think about their coverage of Watergate and Nixon  where they would not let go 'til they got to the bottom of it.  Now, look  at the IRS.  Look at Benghazi.  Look at the VA.  Look at so many scandals  they've been dropped.  This one - this Clinton one - will be dropped as  well.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But let's go back to the government, guys.  I can argue how  zealous the media is when reporting on the Clinton issues, whatever, but I  think back to this idea that if we have problems, the government can fix  them.  Lauren, do you think that is a media issue to address, that they're  not really looking at anything more creative than that?</p><p> ASHBURN:  Well, I mean, I think that's a very left - right - way of looking  at the world.  If there are problems then the government can fix them.  I  think that if you're looking at news coverage of that specific issue,  you're not going to find it because I think a lot of the people who do  report think that exactly that - that the government can fix issues.   However, you did have the reporting on the VA scandal, right, where there  was complete mismanagement and you did see the media latch onto that and  paint the VA as villains.  I'm not here to defend all of the terrible  journalism that's going on right now and there is a lot of it because it's  certainly a lot easier right now to pontificate and to spout off than it is  to actually take a big 30,000 foot view and take a look at what the  government is actually doing with our dollars.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Brent, though, only (INAUDIBLE) and I've raised this with  Republicans too who find that a $600 billion defense budget isn't cutting  it.  If you're digging a hole, it's best to put the spending shovel down or  the big government shovel down.  What do you think?</p><p> BOZELL:  Well, here's - I think - a real direct answer to your question.   If you look at a problem - a perceived problem - you will never hear on the  networks the idea (INAUDIBLE) \"Leave it alone.  Leave people alone.  Let  people (INAUDIBLE). Let people show some personal responsibility.  Get  government out of the equation.\"  You'll never hear that.  Instead, you'll  hear a discussion about how much the government needs to do.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, guys.  I wish we had more time 'cause I don't - I wish  you guys could have actually come to blows but you're two locations.  It  makes it very, very hard to do.  But next time.  Next time.   </p><p> Guys, thank you both very much.  Well, burn if you're in, burn more if  you're out.  Next, the housing pro says keeping the housing faith will pay  off big time, but you got to give it time.</p><p> It's one thing to not trust the education system, but quite another to  rebel against it.  Coming up, how parents are revolting with an education  system they think's revolting.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I get the idea that trusting big institution is fleeting.  In this  hour, we're digging into exactly why?  A big reason, of course, goes back  to the 2007 housing bubble.  Once the housing market crashed, however,  confidence in real estate itself crashed along with it.</p><p> And now home ownership is at a better than quarter century low, as  Americans are pulling a 180 on this big American dream.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't have the money to buy a house.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Move too much.  Too much money, I'm never going to  have that much.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I can't afford to buy.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't think I'm mature enough yet for it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you buy a house, you have to stay there.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why buy a house if you are going to sail on it and ruin  your credit ratings.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Renting is easier.  Things have taken care of for  you.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And probably because we are too poor.  We have no  money.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CAVUTO:  As you can see, a lot of millennials are simply opting to rent  rather than buy, but former Fannie Mae executive, Tim Rood, says that is a  big mistake.  They are missing on a moment to make a good investment and  make a good return.</p><p> But if you think about it, a lot of these kids are saying, I haven't seen  that return.  My parents haven't seen that return, what do you say?</p><p> TIM ROOD, FORMER FANNIE MAE EXECUTIVE:  Thanks, Neil.  So you just saw or  made the reference to the housing home ownership rates dropping to 63  percent.  When you think about these numbers in the aggregate or the  abstract, they don't mean a lot.</p><p> But there is a lot of financial implications when you think about every 1  percent of that drop is actually one million households that aren't owning  a home.  That's one million households paying 30 percent more a month for  their living expenses.  There are one million households -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  They figure they are saving on the hassle and the risk of another  meltdown.  That's what they say, you say what?</p><p> ROOD:  Absolutely.  Look, there's always going to be some casualties in the  housing.  If you can get 95 percent success rate, which means 5 percent are  going to lose home to foreclosure.  Obviously, it's a cautionary tale.</p><p> That's 95 percent of folks who see the wealth appreciation of home  ownership which it's important to remember, the household net worth of a  renter is $5,000 in this country.</p><p> The household net worth of a home owner is $150,000.  But Neil, the big  picture was accidentally exposed recently on boomers.  They showed seniors  when they passed away, how much financial net worth was in their house, and  it turns out only 20 percent of these seniors when they passed away had any  financial net worth beyond the home equity in their house.</p><p> So you can imagine during the most prosperous time, that's the end result.   We've got to focus on how to get more folks into housing today.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, but there are a lot of people in the last seven, eight- year period since the meltdown who would not have that appreciation at all  so they would not have the housing component of that wealth, right?</p><p> ROOD:  Well, I think people talk like that, but in real terms, you've seen  about $3 trillion of appreciation in housing over the last three years.  It  bottomed out in 2012, but it is rallying and we are still about 15 percent  from the highs.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So you say give it time and have faith that in time things come  back?</p><p> ROOD:  Well, there's a huge demand push.  Americans are funny.  At no point  in history have been more Americans that have a desire to live indoors.  I  mean, we keep growing the population and ultimately 65 percent historically  are going to want to buy a house.</p><p> You've seen people who have lost their house to foreclosure.  There is 6  million, 9 million of these people, who have lost their house to  foreclosure.  That when polled they still say that -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  And they want back in.</p><p> ROOD:  They want back in.  It's a good investment.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you, Tim, very, very much.  Good to seeing you.</p><p> Well, to people that have a right to not trust the housing market or to  Tim's point, they going way too far and being way too jaded?  Banks are  trying to tempt them in, but are they really doing too much here offering  as little as 3 percent down mortgages.</p><p> Well, real estate analyst, Katrina Campins, said this is the kind of thing  that worries here that some of the banks and institutions are sucking them  back in, to be slaughtered.</p><p> KATRINA CAMPINS, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" CONTESTANT:  Right, and I believe that  the concern is twofold.  First, I think a lot of these borrowers are not  aware that they run the risk of their house actually being worth less than  they owe if the market for some reason declines, which historically it may.</p><p> And with these small down payments, borrowers are also not aware they'll  get a higher interest rate and the cost of the loan in the long run will be  higher than if they put more of a down payment down, not to mention  mortgage insurance.</p><p> I think also the lenders run a risk of these borrowers walking away because  they don't have enough skin in the game.  So I think it's extremely  dangerous and you know, God knows that I love people buying real estate.   That's what I do for a living. </p><p> However, I'm also concerned that maybe these banks are giving people too  much without enough skin in the game.  And without educating them that  through the life of the loan, it may seem like an opportunity to appreciate  and to buy into the American dream without enough money down, but in the  long run, I think that it's a mistake.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, Katrina, the argument for letting these low money down  loans go through is most young people since it's targeted largely at young  people, do have the financial discipline to stick with the mortgage, grow  with the mortgage as they grow with their jobs.</p><p> If you don't do something like this, it will only be a rich man/rich  woman's market and we'll never see housing stabilize.  What do you make of  that argument?</p><p> CAMPINS:  Well, I think it comes down to employment as well.  You know, the  unemployment rate with the younger generation just isn't rising at the rate  that we need it in order for them to build this wealth.</p><p> I think one other point which is not realized is that now the banks are  actually allowing these younger generation to get down payment from family  members, which again, if you don't earn it, I'm a firm believer, if you  earn it, you value it more.</p><p> A family member is actually putting that down payment for you then you're  more inclined to walk away than if you worked hard for it.  I think part of  the American dream is working really hard to be able to attain it.</p><p> So I'm a firm believer that again, you have to work for it, and in the end,  the housing market will do better because of it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, unless you have a rich uncle who doesn't seem to care.   Katrina, thank you very, very much.  Good seeing you again.</p><p> CAMPINS:  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, from the reaction we got on the street, the things you don't  trust the most are the things you apparently use the most?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm on Facebook.  I'm on Twitter.  All our information  is out there, anyway.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you try to get rid of your page, it's like always  there.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They definitely have the technology to see everything  everybody does.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm getting pop-ups, advertisements and things I've  searched in the past.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Every day I think why am I still doing this?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Trust in technology is fading, but are we the problem it is still  a big thing?  Well, Americans don't want their data in the hands of big  tech companies or the government for that matter or both.  They're more  addicted to it than ever before.</p><p> To cybersecurity experts, David Kennedy and Kurt Knutsson, who says this  technology that we may not like, we apparently still love.  It is weird,  right?  It's like a double-edged sword.</p><p> KURT KNUTSSON, \"KURT THE CYBER GUY\":  Most people don't know when they're  using Cloud storage, when your information is stored on various servers,  they think it's up in an atmosphere, but no, it's giant farms of servers in  various parts of the world.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And they don't care or they don't know the details like making hot  dogs.</p><p> KNUTSSON:  Here's when you care, the moment you care is when you took  something that is really important to you and you're working on it, like a  book you are writing, and you store it on a service that isn't your own  computer or device, and all of a sudden one day, poof!   It's gone.</p><p> What the heck happened?  This thing that's shared on all of your devices  available anywhere and you have to revert to a copy stored six months ago.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And then it becomes a nightmare.  You know, David, I've always  remembered the former Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said if you want  your privacy, it is gone, the technology and convenience obviously has some  intrusions on privacy.  But its benefits outweigh whatever annoyances you  encounter.  Do you agree with that?</p><p> DAVID KENNEDY, TRUSTEDSEC FOUNDER:  Well, I still think there is a fine  balance between privacy and the types of information you put online, but  the problem is that.  I mean, you are integrating technology into  everything that you do on a regular basis.</p><p> I mean, with your Android phones, iPhones, with Macs, all of those have  call backs and stored data on these Cloud infrastructures that store this  type of information.</p><p> So to put it short, our privacy is pretty much gone when it comes to the  amount of information that we do on these pieces of technology, but we  still have to be cautious about the types of information we put up there.</p><p> KNUTSSON:  David, I would jump in and say cautious is the easy word.  You  have to be stupid to store something critical in your life.  Do not put a  will, medical records, personal data, nothing that would -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  But medical data, that is getting online.</p><p> KNUTSSON:  Well, you may not have a choice.   You are not the one who is  control of that so perhaps -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  So let's say you are doing everything right, but someone else is  deciding to take that data.</p><p> KNUTSSON:  One little leak in the faucet from one point to the next point  is what goes wrong.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I got a guy like you, when is the last time you wrote a paper  check, you do everything probably online?</p><p> KNUTSSON:  I mean, you and I probably -- because I lose them.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have people who do that.</p><p> KNUTSSON:  It's not about that.  When I do it, I lose.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What is a smart move?  The convenience of it this is such and you  can do it so quickly dictates this new world.  Even though we know in our  back of our minds, there is a risk of something going wrong, we like the  convenience.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Listen, we want to be able to have as much convenience as  possible.  We want to be able to order our groceries and then go pick them  up at the store.  You have toilets you can control from the smartphones  now.  Convenience is huge.</p><p> The problem is it's not just consumers that are doing this as well.  It's  businesses and that's completely out of our control.  Businesses are  putting medical data, Social Security number, sensitive data, financial  records in these Cloud infrastructures, which are not protected.</p><p> So it's a much wider issue than just the consumer themselves.  It's wider  on the business front as well, and that's why you are seeing a lot of these  breaches occur.  It's going to be a problem to come and something we face  directly in the next two years.</p><p> CAVUTO:  We love technology, but don't think it is going to be there for  us.</p><p> KENNEDY:  I like my smart toilet.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Who doesn't?  But it's a family show.  Look at the time.  I want  you to look at this chart.  With education spending like, this you would  think test scores would be off the charts.  News flash, they're not.  No  wonder where a lot of parents are flat-out serious over all this flat  lining.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, to all these skeptical parents and kids about our  schools, 31 percent of just parents do not trust the government's handling  of all of this.</p><p> Students aren't getting results, even as taxpayer dollars are being thrown  again, billion after billion after billion into school systems.</p><p> To Ashley Pratte and a former New York school superintendent, Carole  Hankin, on if there is a way to fix, what many think, is now a broken  educational system.  Ashley, what do you think?</p><p> ASHLEY PRATTE, FP1 STRATEGIES VP OF COMMUNICATIONS:  I think that the whole  idea of throwing money at a problem as a solution is not a solution, and I  think that's the real issue here.  We look at accountability of schools and  test scores and everything and they're just plummeting and failing our  students.</p><p> And parents and students deserve options and they deserve choice.  That's  why I think the school choice movement is so important.  Students shouldn't  be relegated to a school based on zip code.  Students learn in different  environments.</p><p> I think that, you know, an age where technology is rampant and we have  choice at our fingertips, it should be the same way for education, and  students should have that option as well as parents to say if my student is  not thriving in this environment and I know that they can thrive elsewhere,  that's where they are going to go school.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think what she's saying, Carole, is she's pro-choice on  education.</p><p> PRATTE:  That's a good way of putting it on that issue.</p><p> DR. CAROLE HANKIN, FORMER NEW YORK SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT:  I don't think  pro-choice is the problem or the solution.  I think that we have so many  schools in this country, and just saying that students can go to other  schools won't work every place.  I do believe -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  Works in a lot of places, Carole.</p><p> HANKIN:  Well, small amounts of students and what happen to the ones who  can't get out?  I think we need to fix the schools, but I absolutely agree  that throwing more money is not the answer.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, wouldn't competition would help?</p><p> HANKIN:  I think competition helps in every single field, yes, but I also  think that we need to do something with the schools that are broken.</p><p> CAVUTO:  What do you make of that, Ashley?  That if it's a matter of just  the same existing system, challenging that that existing system with a  competitors, does put a little bit of kick in your step.</p><p> PRATTE:  Yes, and I'm all for competition, I think that's what's important  with the rise of teachers unions, and I'm not bashing teachers here.  My  sister is one, and it's noble work she's doing.</p><p> This is why I wonder where the money is going, Neil?  Because she has to  take money out of her pocket to buy supplies for students in her classroom  so you know, with all the money funnelled in, and you look at schools in  Baltimore because that's been in the news recently.  You see $15,000 per  student.</p><p> Where is all of that money going?  Is it going to the betterment of the  students?  When teachers have to take money out of their own pocketbooks or  checkbooks to pay for supplies for their students that makes me wonder  where exactly is the money being funnelled to?</p><p> Is it helping the students?  I don't think so and it's definitely not  helping the teachers.</p><p> CAVUTO:  OK, I want to thank you guys very much.  By now you get it,  America has big trust issues, but next, rocker, Andrew W.K., one of the  more optimistic guys I know here to build trust facts for the middle-aged,  the young, the old, you name it.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, this hour we have laid out eight out of ten millennials  don't even trust other people even other young people.  To the guy a lot of  you who call the philosopher of partying because he just takes all the  tension and brings it down a notch.  Rocker, Andrew W.K., on if Americans  can ever start trusting each other again.</p><p> Andrew, it's always good to have you, but I think that's the heart of the  problem here, forget institutions, it's inherent thing, we don't trust or  actually flip over each other.  What's the problem?</p><p> ANDREW W.K., \"PHILOSOPHER OF PARTYING\":  Well, this is a puzzling and  perplexing issue but, fortunately, it is as simple as trusting one's self.   Most of these societal issues come down to an individual point of view and  what's inside.  If you can't trust your own self, of course you're not  going to trust other people.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, when you perform, song writer, entertainer -- it's  always very uplifting, I'm told.  I know that your whole approach is very  positive, positive energy, and it's contagious.</p><p> I always tell young people, younger than you, I don't thinker than --  younger than my own kids that the bottom line is you are the vibe you let  off.</p><p> And if you're negative, all that's going to be contagious.  If you're  positive, that too will be contagious.  I think it starts there, but I  could be simplistic.  What do you think?</p><p> ANDREW W.K.:  No, I agree with that.  It's a code of ethics really that  starts in your own behavior.  It can seem rather trivial to imagine that  how you interact with people throughout your day could actually have a  global impact or at least even in your own community, but it really does.</p><p> If you don't have these strengths, if I don't have the strength to be  polite to that stranger or have that trust, that kind of faith that  humanity isn't bad, then how would I believe that the rest of the world -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  You can't blame a lot of people young or old, right, Andrew?  I  tried to give the benefit of the doubt to the government, let me down,  markets, let me down, housing let me down.  Again, and again, my trust was  broken like a bad relationship, no more.</p><p> ANDREW W.K.:  Well, a bad relationship is a very good example because if  we're going on dates with someone and we have bad experiences, it's easy to  want to cast aside all of romance, all of love, all relationships because  you don't want to get hurt.</p><p> But we also don't want to live in a world where we don't have love or  relationships or hold out hope for something more.  Idealism is  challenging.  It's much easier to become cynical, but we don't want to live  in that kind of world.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Speak for yourself, young man.  Andrew W.K., it is attitudinal, we  are bigger than the problems that seem to confront us.  I hope that helps  everybody, and I want you to return next week bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and  feeling we can conquer the world.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And America, we have a problem - a trust problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now, across the nation, we're seeing a loss of faith in all our institutions among all political types.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors burned by the financial crash staying out of the stock market. Home buyers singed by the real estate meltdown staying out of the housing market. A generation of kids exposed to both showing little interest in either. Their trust in institutions down. Their faith in marriage itself at an all-time low. Parents who've lost confidence at a public school system that fails their kids despite the government pouring billions of dollars into a system that fails to raise their test scores.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, it would be one thing if the media pounced on government's clear failures but more inclined to stay in government's hip pocket, convinced that the government isn't the problem, how much we are giving it is.</p><p>So a collective media call to doubledown on the spending that has yet to work. A weird trust in repeating the same mistakes only this time, with pricier mistakes and desperately hoping for a different result.</p><p>So you needn't be Einstein to figure that I'm right or left. This is just stupid - just an average American taxpayer whose gut says this has got to stop.</p><p>So tonight, we stop and we step back - way back. We're going to get to the bottom of why America keeps coming up short and it keeps coming back to trust.</p><p>So we've decided to give this issue (INAUDIBLE) the whole show because this isn't about the spending deficit or real estate deficit or a market deficit or faith deficit. This, my friends, is about America's trust deficit.</p><p>We begin with Washington's deficit.</p><p>Taxpayers are seeing lots of their tax money spent but what are they getting for all that spending? Now, more than half of Americans think that more government means more problems.</p><p>Steve Moore says taxpayers are tired of Washington spending (INAUDIBLE) after bad. Lizzie MacDonald says that at least the coverage of that isn't getting the proper coverage. And Basil Smikle says right now, this taxpayer trust is something that both parties need to address.</p><p>All right. So, Steve, first to you. How bad is this?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE FOUNDATION VISITING FELLOW: Well, it's really bad. I mean, I was thinking, Neil, when you asked me to do this show about how much Washington has changed in just the last 25 or 30 years I've been here. When I came to Washington, the federal government was spending about a trillion dollars. Now, Neil, it's going to - next year, it'll be spending $4 trillion. And even adjusted for inflation, that's more than doubling up the cost of government. And then you ask people, \"Do you think government is better today than it was 30 or 40 years ago?\" And people say, \"I don't know.\" One other example, if I may, Neil, you mentioned schools. If you look at what's happened to per capita spending per pupil spending in the schools versus - let's say - the 1950s or 60s when schools were a lot better, we're spending about three times as much as we used to. So I think people are saying, \"Wait a minute.\" Throwing more money at these problems as a lot of liberals (INAUDIBLE) after what happened in Baltimore if we just spent more money, people are saying, \"You're crazy. That's the source of the problem. It's not going to solve the crisis.\"</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think, Liz?</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Well, I think Steve is exactly right and as for one, the media doesn't really cover it correctly. John (INAUDIBLE), the economist put out a great story and here's the thing, Neil. When the government spends money, that is added to GDP. So when the government doesn't spend money, politicians are afraid, \"Oh, GDP is going to go down.\" So you could see the vicious circle that's in there. Also, we do have severe crony capitalism, of course. Watch this. Inspector General who oversees Medicare said, \"Hey, wait a second.\" Medicare is not even negotiating drug rebates with drug manufacturers while Medicaid is. And so why? Because their laws written there says, \"You know what? You're not allowed to - you can't interfere with the negotiation between drug companies and the federal government.\" What is that about? I'm not sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: What's even more alarming to me is when you talk to kids of all political stripes, party-affiliation, it's (INAUDIBLE) maybe it's just their blaming it on the parents or blaming it on the prior generations. They have an inherent distrust of Washington, an inherent distrust of institutions, an inherent distrust of any one of authority to get anything done.</p><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: They do and that's unfortunate. Look, I am a person that doesn't necessarily believe that government is the answer to all of our problems but there is a sort of minimum that I think government sets where the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, have we gone beyond the minimum?</p><p>SMIKLE: I don't think we've gone beyond the minimum but I think we've - there may be sort of a dearth of ideas. I think we need some better ideas, some (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But to Lizzie's point, do you think the dearth of ideas is that we just go back to the same old idea? (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: Listen, Neil, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Let him finish.</p><p>SMIKLE: I go back to - I go back to a point when David Dinkins was mayor of New York City and asked the state to increase taxes to put more cops on the street. It was during his administration that you started to see a decline in crime here in New York City and a lot of it is pegged to an increase in taxation. So when I think when (INAUDIBLE) legislators (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Weird that you would mention David Dinkins, although with the present mayor, now Dinkins looks like Winston Churchill.</p><p>SMIKLE: Listen, it started - it started during his administration. Giuliani takes credit for it but that's OK. But.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: --the thing is if you point - if you point directly to the expenditure and the outcome then I think you will think (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, but Steve, my big fear with this is that we're going to go back to the same well and say, \"Well, more money\" or maybe we get a better idea how to spend that money better, but it's always going to be more, more, more. That's what worries me.</p><p>MOORE: Yes. I think the problem with this analysis that \"Gee, if we only had more government\", I think that the problem is this, Neil, that the government has gotten away from the core functions that it is supposed to do. It's supposed to educate our kids. It's supposed to build good roads and highways. It's supposed to defend us. It's not to allow things like what happened in Benghazi. And I would simply respond to this point that the government's not doing much. I think the reason the government is failing in the fundamental things it's supposed to be doing is because it's doing too much. I mean, a good example of this with young people because these polls show that young people are the ones who have lost the most confidence in government. And when I talk to my kids who are completely non-ideological - they don't listen to any of this political stuff. But you know what they don't get? They don't get how the federal government can't run a website for the healthcare system. They're like, \"Wait a minute. A seventh-grader can do that.\"</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. But we're (INAUDIBLE). But the thing is - here's the thing. Why raise taxes when the government is wasting so much money? More than a trillion dollars.</p><p>MOORE: Right, exactly.</p><p>MACDONALD: --worth of vacant federal office buildings littering the landscape. $200 billion in overlap and duplication in the federal government. And you have an incompetent health reform website that is just sucking up money right and left, that is really not working and it's all loaded on Medicaid whose budget is getting blown out right there.</p><p>SMIKLE: Yes, we're talking about - I mean, we don't need to be talking about a website here. What I think we need to be talking about are how government can help - help - solve problems but not be the conclusion. And even the president has said that.</p><p>CAVUTO: But think about (INAUDIBLE) - but why do you think that right after Baltimore, the immediate inclination was \"We need more money\", \"We need more money\", \"We need more money.\" Baltimore in a per capita on a per student basis gets almost as much money as New York City students do. Number two to them. Neither are exactly breaking the mental walls down. So why is there a feeling that if in doubt, throw more money at it?</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, it's not the fact that you're throwing more money at it. It's how that money gets spent. And if you're - if you're - but if you're questioning (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But they're not even fine-tuning it. They're saying it (INAUDIBLE) a matter they haven't (INAUDIBLE) enough money.</p><p>SMIKLE: I think it's important to be able to track where that money goes and make sure the outcomes.</p><p>CAVUTO: But they don't. They don't.</p><p>SMIKLE: --make sure the outcomes (INAUDIBLE). No, I think that's happening. That happened here in New York. It's happening in many other cities where you can actually see that additional.</p><p>CAVUTO: We spent trillions on a war on poverty and all that has yet to move the poverty needle.</p><p>SMIKLE: I think it's moved the needle quite significantly. But what.</p><p>CAVUTO: Three percent. Three percent.</p><p>SMIKLE: --but that's significant. What I do think is problematic though.</p><p>MACDONALD: It is?</p><p>CAVUTO: (INAUDIBLE) trillion dollars?</p><p>SMIKLE: If you talk to the people who came who.</p><p>MACDONALD: Three percent since the 60s? (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: --(INAUDIBLE) - if you - if you talk about the people who came out of poverty, that's significant for them.</p><p>MACDONALD: Listen, we all - right. But we all want to help the poor. You know what helps the poor is a job, because then they become emotionally and literally invested in their area. They don't want to destroy their job or destroy the area around them.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, do you think that's it? The trust - we don't trust the government to know that? Whether you like it or not, we don't trust them to do the right thing.</p><p>MACDONALD: We know we don't trust them because we've thrown so much money out already and it hasn't really worked.</p><p>SMIKLE: But I don't think - I also don't think that they're - I also don't think that anyone - whether either Democratic side or the Republican side, you all speak for that - but I certainly don't think any Democrat is saying, \"Just throw money at the problem.\" That is not the solution. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Actually, last week, they were. But by the way, (INAUDIBLE). You're right to say that both parties have failed in this regard because they do think even Republicans with defense, \"Throw more money out. Throw more money out.\" But, Steve, what do you think of that - where we stand with the trust issue because when it comes to government, we don't stand too well here.</p><p>MOORE: Well, we don't. And I'll just give you one example of what you guys were talking about. I just had a piece in the \"Wall Street Journal\" this week about how we've got a D.C. voucher program that is educating kids in inner cities by allowing them to go in other schools. And here's the amazing thing about that program. It is educating kids, Neil, giving them a quality education for one-half of what it costs in the public schools and we can't get the liberals to support the program and it's helping a lot of kids.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there are lot of - there are a lot of players not measuring up here.</p><p>But, guys, I want to thank you all. (INAUDIBLE). You do this very, very well.</p><p>In the meantime, fastfood giant Andy Puzder says businesses shouldn't trust Washington either and either Republicans offering them help or Democrats because tax bills, red tape just seem to pile up and Uncle Sam just keeps piling on.</p><p>So Andy, how do you get businesses to believe that Washington has their back. 'Cause you've argued for many years now, they have a sense that it does not.</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, HARDEE'S &amp; CARL'S JR CEO: Well, it did help in 2010 when the Republicans took over the House and then again in '12 when they - in '14 when they took over the Senate because at least businesses knew nothing disastrous like Dodd-Frank or Obamacare was going to come down the pike. But we've still got the NLRB out there and trying to inflict the joint employer standard on franchise businesses which would be a disaster. They're talking about ambush elections. We've got an administration that refuses to implement fixes to Obamacare like the 40-hour work week. We've got President Obama last year expanding, telling the Department of Labor to expand the class of employees that are entitled to overtime so people will be compensated for time spent rather than (INAUDIBLE) spent. And then you've got state and federal governments trying to come down with a minimum wage increases, what - at some point, and it really is about the $10, $12 point, you've got employees being paid more than they contribute to the profitability of the business.</p><p>CAVUTO: Then what do you do? I mean, in that - in that - in that environment, Andy, I mean, what do you do to get businesses feeling that Washington can have their back rather than stab them in the back because they have all this money - not necessarily small or medium-size businesses but the larger ones - have a lot of money abroad. $2 trillion that's just sitting offshore and it's not coming back because it's going to be double- taxed or taxed at a high rate so businesses keep it there including some very politically-correct names like Apple. How do you win that money back?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, there's really - really, the only way is to elect government - to elect politicians who are committed to seeing the economy grow, who are not committed to seeing the government grow. We've elected a president - now, he's been president six years - President Obama who's committed to big government. And if you're committed to big government, you're going to scare businesses. Until you get that commitment to economic growth, to getting people jobs, to creating opportunity and reducing poverty by creating jobs, by creating economic growth, until the government gets that kind of focus, the businesses aren't going to trust the government. You're always looking forward to additional and added expenses and the higher your expenses are, the lower your profits are. The lower your projected profits, the less like you are to expand, the less like you are to build a new business, are to open a new business, and the less like you are to create jobs. So until this big government attitude begins to decline. Look, we spent last year, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Small Business Administration estimated that we're spending about $2 trillion. American businesses are spending $2 trillion in compliance costs with the current - in the current regulatory environment. Now, my buddy, Steve More was just mentioning that the government spends $4 trillion. Well, half of that amount - you could take half of that amount and you'd increase the amount that businesses are on tap for by $2 trillion which is what they have to pay in regulatory compliance costs. I mean, it's a very bad situation.</p><p>CAVUTO: Imagine. That's the equivalent of the money they have - they have offshore. It is a very interesting fact.</p><p>Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p>PUZDER: Well, nobody's going to bring the money back unless you get (INAUDIBLE) if you're going to have to pay more taxes on it. And the bad thing is when foreign companies bring that money back, they don't have to pay tax on it. So.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, I love you to death, Andy, but I don't trust you in this sense that you are a fastfood executive and you're thin. So that doesn't jive with me. I've told you this many, many times. So it takes away all your credibility.</p><p>But I kid you. But, Andy, as always, a pleasure. And I love the piece you wrote about Scott Walker keeping in mind the numbers are not what the mainstream media says, it's just how they play with those numbers.</p><p>But, Andy, always good seeing you.</p><p>PUZDER: Thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very, very much. Andy Puzder.</p><p>Well, we've heard of \"The Young and the Restless\", right? But young and investless? Because when it comes to stocks, most young folks want nothing to do with them.</p><p>Next, why Charles Payne says trust him, you'll regret sitting this one out, guys.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, here's why they often call this market a stealth rally. So many aren't even participating in it. In fact, more than half of Americans don't own any stock at all after this incredible run-up because they don't trust this run-up. They don't trust stocks. When things go south, investors run scared.</p><p>Just look at what happened on October 19, 1987. I was there for the scare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO (VOICEOVER): Suddenly, it was a freefall. A better than 22 percent (INAUDIBLE) in the Dow and nervous traders were looking over their shoulders.</p><p>CAVUTO: What they don't know and in fact readily worry about is how far down that correction really has to go, how long it will take, and exactly how many more people will be hurt in the process before the market does decide - if it decides - to turn around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you'll be happy to know that markets did come back and puberty did kick in. And now you know the rest of the story.</p><p>I hate when my staff does this to remind me, same Lego hair then, same Lego hair now.</p><p>Anyway, after the 2008 meltdown, just when people thought stocks couldn't get any lower, they did bounce back to record highs.</p><p>Charles Payne says now, lots of investors are kicking themselves for missing both opportunities.</p><p>But it happens a lot. You can understand in the moment, they're frantic.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh, sure. Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: But here's where I think it's different with this one, Charles, is that once, twice burned, whatever, a lot of young people in particular, \"I don't want anything to do with it.\"</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. There's no doubt about it. And there's a lot of young people who have sort of watched it from afar as they were growing up. And you see your parents like, \"Golly, we lost it all.\" And a few years later, \"Golly, we lost it all.\" And so - then of course, say, \"Well, you know what? We're real estate investors now. Golly, we lost it all.\" So now you hear that they'd rather just have experiences that the - that the big F.O.M.O. - the fear of missing out - isn't on making a lot of money but missing the fun things in life. So you put it all off - family formation, investing - all that stuff, put it off because you might as well live in the moment, have fun while you're young because you don't know what's right around the corner.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is it their parents' experiences singed them or what?</p><p>PAYNE: I think it has. But I also think - what I find really interesting is that we're starting now to see this group come out of it, not come out of it but starting to emerge as entrepreneurs, family formation. They're still renters above buyers and I think you're going to start seeing them invest in things because they're in the midst of all the excitement that the WhatsApps, the Periscopes, all these things that seem to pop up overnight, they're the ones that are making it happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they're gravitating those (INAUDIBLE) for jobs because they think they're still interested in getting money, it's just they don't want to get at the means in the market or whatever.</p><p>PAYNE: They love spending it. Right? I mean, just like YOLO - \"You Only Live Once\", right, so yes, it's good. They love spending it, particularly their parents. But the sooner - at some point, \"like I scratched the room\", yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So but you say to what - to kids in general, young people in general, millennials, let's say for want of a better definition, the 18-29, 30-year-olds who are saying, \"I don't trust that (INAUDIBLE).\"</p><p>PAYNE: They've got all their - they've got too much money in cash. Cash goes nowhere - deteriorates every single day in worth and what it can buy. And I think they're going to (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But when the George Soros's, the Druckermillers - all these guys start talking about, \"Hey, this is getting a little long in the tooth\", do you blame them?</p><p>PAYNE: It is a little long in the tooth that - but I mean, I don't know that they should try to play the market timing thing because you (INAUDIBLE) - you'd started this whole thing off the right way. When we are in the midst of a crash, everyone's running. Very few people have the wherewithal to buy. If you can't buy now, you really think you're going to buy in the middle of a crash? But if you're 23.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, what do you tell them, Charles?</p><p>PAYNE: --well, if you're 25-years-old, if you're lucky, you'll probably go through another 10 crashes. I personally hope I live through at least another five major crashes. That means I'll be 90-years-old. And - but at the end of the day, when the smoke clears, usually what happens over the last 20 years, the markets at a new all-time high. What they have to do is don't trust Wall Street, trust the things you like. You love Under Armour clothes, own Under Armour. Go with what you do trust. You're right. There's a lot of shenanigans on Wall Street, there's a lot of knuckleheads and there's a lot of thievery. I'd be the first to admit that. But only a great company over a long period of time, normally you should do pretty well.</p><p>CAVUTO: But a lot of people feel young, they don't market (INAUDIBLE) we're close to what - the fifth anniversary of the flash.</p><p>PAYNE: Sure. Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of people say, \"See, that's what happens. Just when you get in, some idiot does it.\"</p><p>PAYNE: There's no doubt about it. Listen, high-frequency trading isn't illegal but it makes the market more volatile. And there's always - there's too much money. Govenrment and Wall Street. There will always be theft. There's just too much money sloshing around.</p><p>CAVUTO: So what do you tell people who said, let's say, they like Nike or they like Apple and they say, \"Gee, Charles, I agree. Buy what you like. Like what you buy. Know what you're buying.\" But if the stocks (INAUDIBLE) already very rich.\"</p><p>PAYNE: It's just hard to say. They could be rich temporarily. In other words, sometimes the valuation can get ahead of the actual fundamentals. But they - the fundamentals are also improving.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they were saying that about Apple at $50, at $60 a share.</p><p>PAYNE: Trying to pick the top is a tough game.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you just say, \"Hold tight\"?</p><p>PAYNE: Because you're not going to pick the bottom. You're not going to pick the bottom. So if you're going to be in it and that you're 25, start to nibble. You know it's great. You're making (INAUDIBLE) great. These young people know more than anybody on Wall Street. They know the greatest things going on right now. If they can just put their money with what they know, connect those two dots, they'll have an amazing life. They can have the fear of missing out for the rest of their lives and have a fun youth, a fun middle age, and an amazing golden age.</p><p>CAVUTO: I just find that they whine a lot. Just shut up, right?</p><p>All right. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>PAYNE: But that whining gets them what they want.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. \"Get off my lawn!\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a quick quiz. If Americans trust the government the least, who do you think is - well - next to least? The president, the media, big business, or Charles Payne?</p><p>No. The answer right after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: The government does this. The government can do that.</p><p>Is the media simply too busy kissing up to the government to objectively cover the government? Because the media itself is now one of the least trusted institutions, second only to Congress.</p><p>That's according to at least one recent poll.</p><p>Media watchers, Brent Bozell, Lauren Ashburn say that the fourth estate stopped being the government's watchdog decades ago.</p><p>Well, Brent, it's very interesting to me that despite all of that, it's like the media wants to doubledown on this faith in government and question those who would dare question government.</p><p>BRENT BOZELL, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER PRESIDENT: Yes. Isn't it incredible that their response to be marginalized is to be even more marginalized. They've become so radicalized. We've seen something in the last two years that I frankly hadn't seen before. This - since 2008, I should say, this commitment, this deliberate commitment not to report news if it harms the narrative of the left. This is not one example. This is not two examples. I can give you 20 examples. As a matter of fact, you and I have talked about this many times on your show. They are deliberately not reporting news.</p><p>CAVUTO: Lauren, to what end though? I mean, they must know that they hurt their own brand. We've seen it happen in print. We've seen it happen with one newspaper or another whether they hop online or not. The content is what people are getting turned off to.</p><p>LAUREN ASHBURN, THE HILL CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's true. I do need to respond to what Brent just said because I think.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let Lauren respond. Go ahead.</p><p>ASHBURN: --that he's - because I think he's wrong, coming up especially with Hillary Clinton, you had the New York Times breaking the email scandal. You had all of the mainstream news organizations hopping on this latest scandal with the Clinton Foundation. So.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I'm talking about government itself. We're talking about whether faith in government can fix problems.</p><p>ASHBURN: No, I understand.</p><p>CAVUTO: Go ahead.</p><p>ASHBURN: I understand. But I think that there are also a lot of journalists who do put their heads down and do the hard work. The FOIA requests are very important in order to find out exactly what is happening and you can't marginalized those. They are about this many reporters who are doing it. But I think that it's very important to know that if you get the right news source.</p><p>CAVUTO: But that's the problem. That - see, Lauren, that's the problem. If only this many are reporting it or whatever, this signifies small percentage - the others are saying especially after Baltimore last week, well, the issue is we're not spending enough. We're not - the government isn't doing enough, in other words, that the government can fix it. That's what worries me.</p><p>Brent?</p><p>BOZELL: Look, with all due respect. Lauren, what you just said is just pure nonsense. They have not gotten to the bottom of a single one of the Obama scandals. They did not get to the bottom of a single one of the Clinton scandals. Just think about their coverage of Watergate and Nixon where they would not let go 'til they got to the bottom of it. Now, look at the IRS. Look at Benghazi. Look at the VA. Look at so many scandals they've been dropped. This one - this Clinton one - will be dropped as well.</p><p>CAVUTO: But let's go back to the government, guys. I can argue how zealous the media is when reporting on the Clinton issues, whatever, but I think back to this idea that if we have problems, the government can fix them. Lauren, do you think that is a media issue to address, that they're not really looking at anything more creative than that?</p><p>ASHBURN: Well, I mean, I think that's a very left - right - way of looking at the world. If there are problems then the government can fix them. I think that if you're looking at news coverage of that specific issue, you're not going to find it because I think a lot of the people who do report think that exactly that - that the government can fix issues. However, you did have the reporting on the VA scandal, right, where there was complete mismanagement and you did see the media latch onto that and paint the VA as villains. I'm not here to defend all of the terrible journalism that's going on right now and there is a lot of it because it's certainly a lot easier right now to pontificate and to spout off than it is to actually take a big 30,000 foot view and take a look at what the government is actually doing with our dollars.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Brent, though, only (INAUDIBLE) and I've raised this with Republicans too who find that a $600 billion defense budget isn't cutting it. If you're digging a hole, it's best to put the spending shovel down or the big government shovel down. What do you think?</p><p>BOZELL: Well, here's - I think - a real direct answer to your question. If you look at a problem - a perceived problem - you will never hear on the networks the idea (INAUDIBLE) \"Leave it alone. Leave people alone. Let people (INAUDIBLE). Let people show some personal responsibility. Get government out of the equation.\" You'll never hear that. Instead, you'll hear a discussion about how much the government needs to do.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys. I wish we had more time 'cause I don't - I wish you guys could have actually come to blows but you're two locations. It makes it very, very hard to do. But next time. Next time.</p><p>Guys, thank you both very much. Well, burn if you're in, burn more if you're out. Next, the housing pro says keeping the housing faith will pay off big time, but you got to give it time.</p><p>It's one thing to not trust the education system, but quite another to rebel against it. Coming up, how parents are revolting with an education system they think's revolting.</p><p>CAVUTO: I get the idea that trusting big institution is fleeting. In this hour, we're digging into exactly why? A big reason, of course, goes back to the 2007 housing bubble. Once the housing market crashed, however, confidence in real estate itself crashed along with it.</p><p>And now home ownership is at a better than quarter century low, as Americans are pulling a 180 on this big American dream.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't have the money to buy a house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Move too much. Too much money, I'm never going to have that much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't afford to buy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think I'm mature enough yet for it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you buy a house, you have to stay there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why buy a house if you are going to sail on it and ruin your credit ratings.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Renting is easier. Things have taken care of for you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And probably because we are too poor. We have no money.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: As you can see, a lot of millennials are simply opting to rent rather than buy, but former Fannie Mae executive, Tim Rood, says that is a big mistake. They are missing on a moment to make a good investment and make a good return.</p><p>But if you think about it, a lot of these kids are saying, I haven't seen that return. My parents haven't seen that return, what do you say?</p><p>TIM ROOD, FORMER FANNIE MAE EXECUTIVE: Thanks, Neil. So you just saw or made the reference to the housing home ownership rates dropping to 63 percent. When you think about these numbers in the aggregate or the abstract, they don't mean a lot.</p><p>But there is a lot of financial implications when you think about every 1 percent of that drop is actually one million households that aren't owning a home. That's one million households paying 30 percent more a month for their living expenses. There are one million households --</p><p>CAVUTO: They figure they are saving on the hassle and the risk of another meltdown. That's what they say, you say what?</p><p>ROOD: Absolutely. Look, there's always going to be some casualties in the housing. If you can get 95 percent success rate, which means 5 percent are going to lose home to foreclosure. Obviously, it's a cautionary tale.</p><p>That's 95 percent of folks who see the wealth appreciation of home ownership which it's important to remember, the household net worth of a renter is $5,000 in this country.</p><p>The household net worth of a home owner is $150,000. But Neil, the big picture was accidentally exposed recently on boomers. They showed seniors when they passed away, how much financial net worth was in their house, and it turns out only 20 percent of these seniors when they passed away had any financial net worth beyond the home equity in their house.</p><p>So you can imagine during the most prosperous time, that's the end result. We've got to focus on how to get more folks into housing today.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but there are a lot of people in the last seven, eight- year period since the meltdown who would not have that appreciation at all so they would not have the housing component of that wealth, right?</p><p>ROOD: Well, I think people talk like that, but in real terms, you've seen about $3 trillion of appreciation in housing over the last three years. It bottomed out in 2012, but it is rallying and we are still about 15 percent from the highs.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you say give it time and have faith that in time things come back?</p><p>ROOD: Well, there's a huge demand push. Americans are funny. At no point in history have been more Americans that have a desire to live indoors. I mean, we keep growing the population and ultimately 65 percent historically are going to want to buy a house.</p><p>You've seen people who have lost their house to foreclosure. There is 6 million, 9 million of these people, who have lost their house to foreclosure. That when polled they still say that --</p><p>CAVUTO: And they want back in.</p><p>ROOD: They want back in. It's a good investment.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you, Tim, very, very much. Good to seeing you.</p><p>Well, to people that have a right to not trust the housing market or to Tim's point, they going way too far and being way too jaded? Banks are trying to tempt them in, but are they really doing too much here offering as little as 3 percent down mortgages.</p><p>Well, real estate analyst, Katrina Campins, said this is the kind of thing that worries here that some of the banks and institutions are sucking them back in, to be slaughtered.</p><p>KATRINA CAMPINS, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" CONTESTANT: Right, and I believe that the concern is twofold. First, I think a lot of these borrowers are not aware that they run the risk of their house actually being worth less than they owe if the market for some reason declines, which historically it may.</p><p>And with these small down payments, borrowers are also not aware they'll get a higher interest rate and the cost of the loan in the long run will be higher than if they put more of a down payment down, not to mention mortgage insurance.</p><p>I think also the lenders run a risk of these borrowers walking away because they don't have enough skin in the game. So I think it's extremely dangerous and you know, God knows that I love people buying real estate. That's what I do for a living.</p><p>However, I'm also concerned that maybe these banks are giving people too much without enough skin in the game. And without educating them that through the life of the loan, it may seem like an opportunity to appreciate and to buy into the American dream without enough money down, but in the long run, I think that it's a mistake.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Katrina, the argument for letting these low money down loans go through is most young people since it's targeted largely at young people, do have the financial discipline to stick with the mortgage, grow with the mortgage as they grow with their jobs.</p><p>If you don't do something like this, it will only be a rich man/rich woman's market and we'll never see housing stabilize. What do you make of that argument?</p><p>CAMPINS: Well, I think it comes down to employment as well. You know, the unemployment rate with the younger generation just isn't rising at the rate that we need it in order for them to build this wealth.</p><p>I think one other point which is not realized is that now the banks are actually allowing these younger generation to get down payment from family members, which again, if you don't earn it, I'm a firm believer, if you earn it, you value it more.</p><p>A family member is actually putting that down payment for you then you're more inclined to walk away than if you worked hard for it. I think part of the American dream is working really hard to be able to attain it.</p><p>So I'm a firm believer that again, you have to work for it, and in the end, the housing market will do better because of it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, unless you have a rich uncle who doesn't seem to care. Katrina, thank you very, very much. Good seeing you again.</p><p>CAMPINS: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, from the reaction we got on the street, the things you don't trust the most are the things you apparently use the most?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm on Facebook. I'm on Twitter. All our information is out there, anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you try to get rid of your page, it's like always there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They definitely have the technology to see everything everybody does.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm getting pop-ups, advertisements and things I've searched in the past.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Every day I think why am I still doing this?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Trust in technology is fading, but are we the problem it is still a big thing? Well, Americans don't want their data in the hands of big tech companies or the government for that matter or both. They're more addicted to it than ever before.</p><p>To cybersecurity experts, David Kennedy and Kurt Knutsson, who says this technology that we may not like, we apparently still love. It is weird, right? It's like a double-edged sword.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, \"KURT THE CYBER GUY\": Most people don't know when they're using Cloud storage, when your information is stored on various servers, they think it's up in an atmosphere, but no, it's giant farms of servers in various parts of the world.</p><p>CAVUTO: And they don't care or they don't know the details like making hot dogs.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Here's when you care, the moment you care is when you took something that is really important to you and you're working on it, like a book you are writing, and you store it on a service that isn't your own computer or device, and all of a sudden one day, poof! It's gone.</p><p>What the heck happened? This thing that's shared on all of your devices available anywhere and you have to revert to a copy stored six months ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: And then it becomes a nightmare. You know, David, I've always remembered the former Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said if you want your privacy, it is gone, the technology and convenience obviously has some intrusions on privacy. But its benefits outweigh whatever annoyances you encounter. Do you agree with that?</p><p>DAVID KENNEDY, TRUSTEDSEC FOUNDER: Well, I still think there is a fine balance between privacy and the types of information you put online, but the problem is that. I mean, you are integrating technology into everything that you do on a regular basis.</p><p>I mean, with your Android phones, iPhones, with Macs, all of those have call backs and stored data on these Cloud infrastructures that store this type of information.</p><p>So to put it short, our privacy is pretty much gone when it comes to the amount of information that we do on these pieces of technology, but we still have to be cautious about the types of information we put up there.</p><p>KNUTSSON: David, I would jump in and say cautious is the easy word. You have to be stupid to store something critical in your life. Do not put a will, medical records, personal data, nothing that would --</p><p>CAVUTO: But medical data, that is getting online.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Well, you may not have a choice. You are not the one who is control of that so perhaps --</p><p>CAVUTO: So let's say you are doing everything right, but someone else is deciding to take that data.</p><p>KNUTSSON: One little leak in the faucet from one point to the next point is what goes wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO: I got a guy like you, when is the last time you wrote a paper check, you do everything probably online?</p><p>KNUTSSON: I mean, you and I probably -- because I lose them.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have people who do that.</p><p>KNUTSSON: It's not about that. When I do it, I lose.</p><p>CAVUTO: What is a smart move? The convenience of it this is such and you can do it so quickly dictates this new world. Even though we know in our back of our minds, there is a risk of something going wrong, we like the convenience.</p><p>KENNEDY: Listen, we want to be able to have as much convenience as possible. We want to be able to order our groceries and then go pick them up at the store. You have toilets you can control from the smartphones now. Convenience is huge.</p><p>The problem is it's not just consumers that are doing this as well. It's businesses and that's completely out of our control. Businesses are putting medical data, Social Security number, sensitive data, financial records in these Cloud infrastructures, which are not protected.</p><p>So it's a much wider issue than just the consumer themselves. It's wider on the business front as well, and that's why you are seeing a lot of these breaches occur. It's going to be a problem to come and something we face directly in the next two years.</p><p>CAVUTO: We love technology, but don't think it is going to be there for us.</p><p>KENNEDY: I like my smart toilet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Who doesn't? But it's a family show. Look at the time. I want you to look at this chart. With education spending like, this you would think test scores would be off the charts. News flash, they're not. No wonder where a lot of parents are flat-out serious over all this flat lining.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, to all these skeptical parents and kids about our schools, 31 percent of just parents do not trust the government's handling of all of this.</p><p>Students aren't getting results, even as taxpayer dollars are being thrown again, billion after billion after billion into school systems.</p><p>To Ashley Pratte and a former New York school superintendent, Carole Hankin, on if there is a way to fix, what many think, is now a broken educational system. Ashley, what do you think?</p><p>ASHLEY PRATTE, FP1 STRATEGIES VP OF COMMUNICATIONS: I think that the whole idea of throwing money at a problem as a solution is not a solution, and I think that's the real issue here. We look at accountability of schools and test scores and everything and they're just plummeting and failing our students.</p><p>And parents and students deserve options and they deserve choice. That's why I think the school choice movement is so important. Students shouldn't be relegated to a school based on zip code. Students learn in different environments.</p><p>I think that, you know, an age where technology is rampant and we have choice at our fingertips, it should be the same way for education, and students should have that option as well as parents to say if my student is not thriving in this environment and I know that they can thrive elsewhere, that's where they are going to go school.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think what she's saying, Carole, is she's pro-choice on education.</p><p>PRATTE: That's a good way of putting it on that issue.</p><p>DR. CAROLE HANKIN, FORMER NEW YORK SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT: I don't think pro-choice is the problem or the solution. I think that we have so many schools in this country, and just saying that students can go to other schools won't work every place. I do believe --</p><p>CAVUTO: Works in a lot of places, Carole.</p><p>HANKIN: Well, small amounts of students and what happen to the ones who can't get out? I think we need to fix the schools, but I absolutely agree that throwing more money is not the answer.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, wouldn't competition would help?</p><p>HANKIN: I think competition helps in every single field, yes, but I also think that we need to do something with the schools that are broken.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you make of that, Ashley? That if it's a matter of just the same existing system, challenging that that existing system with a competitors, does put a little bit of kick in your step.</p><p>PRATTE: Yes, and I'm all for competition, I think that's what's important with the rise of teachers unions, and I'm not bashing teachers here. My sister is one, and it's noble work she's doing.</p><p>This is why I wonder where the money is going, Neil? Because she has to take money out of her pocket to buy supplies for students in her classroom so you know, with all the money funnelled in, and you look at schools in Baltimore because that's been in the news recently. You see $15,000 per student.</p><p>Where is all of that money going? Is it going to the betterment of the students? When teachers have to take money out of their own pocketbooks or checkbooks to pay for supplies for their students that makes me wonder where exactly is the money being funnelled to?</p><p>Is it helping the students? I don't think so and it's definitely not helping the teachers.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, I want to thank you guys very much. By now you get it, America has big trust issues, but next, rocker, Andrew W.K., one of the more optimistic guys I know here to build trust facts for the middle-aged, the young, the old, you name it. That's next.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, this hour we have laid out eight out of ten millennials don't even trust other people even other young people. To the guy a lot of you who call the philosopher of partying because he just takes all the tension and brings it down a notch. Rocker, Andrew W.K., on if Americans can ever start trusting each other again.</p><p>Andrew, it's always good to have you, but I think that's the heart of the problem here, forget institutions, it's inherent thing, we don't trust or actually flip over each other. What's the problem?</p><p>ANDREW W.K., \"PHILOSOPHER OF PARTYING\": Well, this is a puzzling and perplexing issue but, fortunately, it is as simple as trusting one's self. Most of these societal issues come down to an individual point of view and what's inside. If you can't trust your own self, of course you're not going to trust other people.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, when you perform, song writer, entertainer -- it's always very uplifting, I'm told. I know that your whole approach is very positive, positive energy, and it's contagious.</p><p>I always tell young people, younger than you, I don't thinker than -- younger than my own kids that the bottom line is you are the vibe you let off.</p><p>And if you're negative, all that's going to be contagious. If you're positive, that too will be contagious. I think it starts there, but I could be simplistic. What do you think?</p><p>ANDREW W.K.: No, I agree with that. It's a code of ethics really that starts in your own behavior. It can seem rather trivial to imagine that how you interact with people throughout your day could actually have a global impact or at least even in your own community, but it really does.</p><p>If you don't have these strengths, if I don't have the strength to be polite to that stranger or have that trust, that kind of faith that humanity isn't bad, then how would I believe that the rest of the world --</p><p>CAVUTO: You can't blame a lot of people young or old, right, Andrew? I tried to give the benefit of the doubt to the government, let me down, markets, let me down, housing let me down. Again, and again, my trust was broken like a bad relationship, no more.</p><p>ANDREW W.K.: Well, a bad relationship is a very good example because if we're going on dates with someone and we have bad experiences, it's easy to want to cast aside all of romance, all of love, all relationships because you don't want to get hurt.</p><p>But we also don't want to live in a world where we don't have love or relationships or hold out hope for something more.

David Feinberg, the head of Google's health initiatives, said[1] the company is working towards building an 'intelligent suite of tools to help doctors, nurses, and other providers take better care of patients, leveraging our expertise in organizing information.' Last week, it emerged that Google had struck a partnership with the US' second largest health system Ascension[2]\u2014 called 'Project Nightingale' \u2014 to develop AI-based tools in exchange for moving all the patient data to its cloud infrastructure. The idea was to build a searchable, cloud-based platform to query patient data[3], which the company could then market to other healthcare providers. </p><p>Feinberg, who outlined this vision at the HLTH conference earlier this month, reiterated the company's plans for designing tools with an aim to make 'health records more useful, more accessible and more searchable by pulling them into a single, easy-to-use interface for doctors.' 'Ascension is the first partner where we are working with the frontline staff to pilot this tool,' Feinberg said[4]. Acknowledging the challenges involved in the effort, Google stated the agreement allows Ascension to share patient info under current healthcare privacy laws, provided said information is used only to help the entity meet its clinical functions. The search giant also emphasized that it's putting strict controls in place to ensure sensitive health care is handled properly: To configure, test, tune and maintain the service in a clinical setting, a limited number of screened and qualified Google staff may be exposed to real data. These staff undergo HIPAA and medical ethics training, and are individually and explicitly approved by Ascension for a limited time. This would also necessitate that adequate safeguards are in place to anonymize the information[5] before it could be used to develop machine learning models for personalized healthcare.Trading personal information for better healthcareFeinberg's response comes after the Congress raised concerns about the collaboration[6], calling it 'disturbing' in part because of Ascension's decision not to notify its patients before moving ahead with the partnership. As the big tech companies extend their reach to markets that transcend their original mission \u2014 Facebook is no longer just a social network[7], Google is no longer about search, and Amazon is not just a retail platform \u2014 they're increasingly battling trust issues[8], with people wondering what happens when a company that knows so much about them gets access to their financial and health data. Speaking to The Guardian[9], a purported whistleblower involved in the project[10] said: 'Most Americans would feel uncomfortable if they knew their data was being haphazardly transferred to Google without proper safeguards and security in place. This is a totally new way of doing things. Do you want your most personal information transferred to Google? I think a lot of people would say no.' It doesn't help that the company's own record with other healthcare projects[11] isn't exactly stellar.Yet, five out of six UK hospitals renewed their data sharing agreements[12] with the company back in September. Amnesty International, in a 60-page 'Surveillance Giants[13]' report published yesterday, came out strongly against Facebook and Google, criticizing that their surveillance-based business model is inherently incompatible with the right to privacy and threatens freedom of opinion and expression, while recommending tech companies to 'find ways to transition to a rights-respecting business model.' If anything, the development underscores the urgent need for developing data governance models[14] that ensure access to sensitive information is tightly regulated, transparent, and done the right way. Until then, the digital institutions will dowhatever it takes to advance their interests and profit from venturing into new territories \u2014 especially what with healthcare industry becoming a lucrative $3 trillion market in the US that's impossible to ignore. There's no doubting the transformative power technology in advancing healthcare, but in the wrong hands, it could easily result in major privacy violations, undermining consumer trust in the process.

These staff undergo HIPAA and medical ethics training, and are individually and explicitly approved by Ascension for a limited time.<br/>This endeavor to centralize patient information would also necessitate that adequate safeguards are in place to anonymize the information before it could be used to develop machine learning models for personalized healthcare.<br/>Trading personal information for better healthcareFeinberg's response comes after the Congress raised concerns about the collaboration,\u00a0calling it \"disturbing\" in part because of Ascension's decision not to notify its patients before moving ahead with the partnership.<br/>As the big tech companies extend their reach to markets that transcend their original mission - Facebook is no\u00a0longer just a social network, Google is no longer about search, and Amazon is not just a retail platform - they're increasingly battling trust issues, with people\u00a0wondering what happens when a company that knows so much about them gets access to their financial and health data.<br/>Speaking to The Guardian, a purported whistleblower involved in the project said: \"Most Americans would feel uncomfortable if they knew their data was being haphazardly transferred to Google without proper safeguards and security in place. This is a totally new way of doing things. Do you want your most personal information transferred to Google? I think a lot of people would say no.\"<br/>It doesn't help that the company's own record with other healthcare projects isn't exactly stellar.\u00a0Yet, five out of six UK hospitals renewed their data sharing agreements with the Mountain View-based tech giant back in\u00a0September.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Amnesty International, in a 60-page \"Surveillance Giants\" report published yesterday, came out strongly against Facebook and Google, criticizing that their surveillance-based business model is inherently incompatible with the right to privacy and threatens freedom of opinion and expression, while recommending tech companies to \"find ways to transition to a rights-respecting business model.\"<br/>If anything, the development underscores the urgent need for developing data governance models that ensure access to sensitive information is tightly regulated, transparent, and done the right way.<br/>Until that happens, the powerful digital institutions will do\u00a0whatever it takes to advance their interests and profit from venturing into new territories - especially what with the healthcare industry becoming a lucrative $3 trillion market in the US that's impossible to ignore.<br/>There's no doubting the transformative power technology in advancing healthcare, but in the wrong hands, it could easily result in major privacy violations, undermining consumer trust in the process.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-330111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJS-RFM1-DYDW-73R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook and Zuckerberg's reputation for truth and accountability are so far gone that the company is doing its best to drive this push for a financial services revolution without it looking too much like it is a Facebook thing.</p><p>The idea of a new global currency and blockchain-based payments network is fine, and Calibra/Libra has good potential in offering banking services to people in parts of the world where they have been lacking.</p><p>Kenya-founded M-Pesa has, of course, already been offering mobile phone based payments and banking services across 10 such countries since 2007, but anything that threatens to kill the banks' foreign exchange fee golden goose can't be 100 per cent bad.</p><p>However, the idea that should kill this all dead (or at least halt its immediate progress) is simply Facebook's involvement itself. Its leaders have to be dreaming if they think they deserve to be trusted with any involvement in people's finances.</p><p>Regulators around the world have already made it clear that this won't develop without significant scrutiny, and Facebook's lack of credibility should play a major part in any deliberations.</p><p>\"We feel that over the long run, if we can earn people's trust and if we can build a successful network with a lot of consumers on it, we can start offering all sorts of other financial services such as lending,\" David Marcus, the head of the Calibra digital wallet product, said.</p><p>Well, that is a very big \"if\". Facebook is so far in arrears on trust that its words are worth less than the thousands of dead or dying cryptocurrencies already rotting in cyberspace.</p><p>Marcus' words showed Calibra is just the first step in the eyes of Facebook's leadership, to worm its way into the financial heart of users' lives.</p><p>Though he insisted that Facebook will not have access to financial data on Calibra for advertising purposes, and that Zuckerberg was insistent on it being owned and controlled \"as a public good\", why on earth should anyone believe them?</p><p>Despite Facebook being just one of 26 companies in charge of the development of Libra, it is clearly the principal player.</p><p>The announcement seemed almost wilfully ignorant of the regulatory environment in which it was made. Regulators are wondering how to break up the outsized influence of big tech platforms, yet here is the worst behaving of the lot asking to be let loose in a whole new area of society.</p><p>Facebook has a storied history of doing the wrong thing by its users until it gets caught, and has done nothing to suggest it has ever learned a lesson.</p><p>It has shown contempt for accountability, by Zuckerberg's continual refusals to attend hearings with national governments that want to question him about Facebook's approach to privacy and its negative impact on democracy.</p><p>So despite the positive potential impacts and likely opportunities for fintech start-ups, it is impossible to view this as anything other than a big worry of a future privacy nightmare.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc75xggnp2fub1igmy7mm2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDK-1571-JD34-V0FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They point to evidence that Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube are staffed disproportionately by liberals, a fact that nobody seriously denies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a fascinating essay for the \"New Atlantis\", Adam White argues that there is a deep alignment between their corporate culture and the assumptions of modern liberalism. A nearly inevitable result, conservatives say, is that the companies are more likely to try to suppress conservative content as offensive: taking down tweets and posts from righties and directing traffic elsewhere.</p><p>The companies deny they have displayed bias, even as admit they have made occasional mistakes in content moderation. One school of conservatives argues that while the tech titans' decisions may be wrong and worthy of condemnation, it is not government's business to regulate their decisions because they are private companies.</p><p>According to this reasoning, people who are unhappy with Facebook's policies should condemn or boycott it. They should cajole Twitter into adopting better policies. Or they should try to start a rival site.</p><p>What these conservatives don't want is for government to force the companies to behave differently, beyond holding them to their own terms of service. Another group on the right thinks that the hands-off approach is dogma unsuited to the world we actually inhabit. The social-media companies are too large a part of our society, and host too much of our political debate, for the government to leave them alone.</p><p>A leading voice for this second group is Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. His criticisms of social-media companies are wide-ranging.</p><p>Political bias is among his main concerns. \"Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,\" he has said. \"They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell conservatives to sit down and shut up.\"</p><p>Soon after his election in 2018, Hawley argued that the big tech companies are benefiting from a government-granted privilege. He observed \u2014 on Twitter, naturally \u2014 that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives these companies immunity from liability for content that appears on their sites.</p><p>They get this immunity, he suggested, on the condition that they serve as forums for \"a true diversity of political discourse\". He called for congressional investigations to see if they were meeting that condition. Congress has subsequently held hearings on it.</p><p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz, questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, made the same point as Hawley: \"The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're a neutral public forum.\"</p><p>What they're saying: Facebook can be a message board with no responsibility for the messages tacked onto it. Or it can take an active role in shaping content, in which case it assumes legal responsibility for that content.</p><p>Those who fear government regulation in this area have pushed back against Hawley and Cruz. They point out that the law also gives the companies immunity for actions they take against obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable material.</p><p>We can split the difference on the question of what the law assumes. The CDA does not require companies to be neutral about the political content of messages they host in order to have immunity. It was, in fact, written to encourage them to police obscenity, which is why it's called the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>The law was enacted in 1996, after a web service provider, Prodigy, had been found to incur liability for postings because it had tried to make itself family-friendly and deleted some material it found to be offensive. Legislators thought it was unfair and undesirable to punish a company for trying to do the right thing.</p><p>But it's fair to say that back then there was a background assumption that the companies would not be tilting left or right. So what options does the government have to deal with the perceived problem?</p><p>Perhaps we should split the difference on the policy question, too. The companies are too important to ignore, but government regulation is full of dangers.</p><p>It does not seem like too much for Congress to ask that the immunity it has provided be conditioned on some more transparency from the companies about how they decide what content to promote, hide or suppress. One possibility would be to require the companies to disclose summary information about how they make these decisions; another, perhaps easier to administer, would be to require them to publish a database of content they have deleted.</p><p>Before we decide either to regulate the tech companies or leave them alone, let's find out if the anecdotes of bias are just anecdotes, or something more.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/19/155964602824.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/19/155964602824.jpeg</url></p><p>190316 social media<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-146017419</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-BJ01-JDJN-63RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

We hand it over willingly for free services. But the biggest economic windfall goes to tech giants such as Google and Facebook. Their corporate wealth is built on harvesting and commercializing the information supplied by the online multitudes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Imagine if General Motors did not pay for its steel, rubber or glass - its inputs,\" said Robert Shapiro, an economist who recently did an analysis of the value of data. \"That's what it's like for the big internet companies. It's a sweet deal.\"</p><p>But there is a growing collection of people seeking ways to alter that arrangement. As a disparate group of academics, economists, technologists and lawmakers, their politics range from moderately liberal to free-market conservative.</p><p>They are pursuing different paths. Some have done research to put a value on personal data, as a way to inform public debate on how to broker a better deal for the online proletariat. Others propose recognizing the data as a tradeable asset or as labour, to help create an efficient market for the data and return more digital wealth to individuals and society.</p><p>Last month, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner co-sponsored a bill that would require the big internet companies to regularly inform users of what personal data they collect and to disclose the value of that data.</p><p>\"I'm not sold on what the approach should be,\" said Warner, a former technology investor and a frequent critic of the tech giants. \"But the status quo - this massive imbalance of power - cannot stand.\"</p><p>The rising calls for a better data bargain come during an intensifying backlash against Big Tech and its handling of user data. Lawmakers and regulators in several countries are investigating the companies' market power, their role as gatekeepers of communication and their handling of data, especially in failing to protect users' privacy.</p><p>On Wednesday, Facebook agreed to new layers of oversight and a record fine to settle privacy violations. It also acknowledged that it was under investigation from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for antitrust concerns. And on Tuesday, the U.S Justice Department said that it would begin examining the internet giants' domination over the market to determine whether they had sought to stifle competition.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that free services paid for with advertising and data are a bad bargain for consumers. The consumer benefit from free internet services was estimated to be more than $100 billion (U.S.) in the United States alone, according to a 2012 paper co-written by Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management.</p><p>That figure would be far higher today, given the growth of online offerings. \"Consumers do get a huge amount of value from those services,\" Brynjolfsson said.</p><p>But the advocates for a new deal on data are gaining momentum as more is known about how the big internet companies use personal information.</p><p>Giving information to Google, Facebook or Amazon, for example, is not just a signal of interest or preference, but also the raw material for targeting ads, steering online behaviour and training artificial intelligence systems like facial recognition.</p><p>Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>A goal of the legislation introduced last month by Warner and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is \"to give consumers some sense of the value of the data they are giving up,\" Warner explained.</p><p>How much personal data is worth is a tricky calculation. Estimates vary widely, depending on assumptions. The recent study by Shapiro's consulting firm took several factors into account, including the falloff in online advertising efficiency when people opt out of data collection.</p><p>The study estimated that the corporate payoff - mainly to big tech companies - from collecting the personal data of Americans online was $76 billion in 2018 and that it would rise sharply in the future.</p><p>If the government collected a 50 per cent fee from companies using Americans' personal data, Shapiro said, it could contribute significantly to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure or supporting social safety net programs. If paid out to individual users, it would be a check for $122 a person last year.

We hand it over willingly for free services. But the biggest economic windfall goes to tech giants such as Google and Facebook. Their corporate wealth is built on harvesting and commercializing the information supplied by the online multitudes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Imagine if General Motors did not pay for its steel, rubber or glass - its inputs,\" said Robert Shapiro, an economist who recently did an analysis of the value of data. \"That's what it's like for the big internet companies. It's a sweet deal.\"</p><p>But there is a growing collection of people seeking ways to alter that arrangement. As a disparate group of academics, economists, technologists and lawmakers, their politics range from moderately liberal to free-market conservative.</p><p>They are pursuing different paths. Some have done research to put a value on personal data, as a way to inform public debate on how to broker a better deal for the online proletariat. Others propose recognizing the data as a tradable asset or as labour, to help create an efficient market for the data and return more digital wealth to individuals and society.</p><p>Last month, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner co-sponsored a bill that would require the big internet companies to regularly inform users of what personal data they collect and to disclose the value of that data.</p><p>\"I'm not sold on what the approach should be,\" said Warner, a former technology investor and a frequent critic of the tech giants. \"But the status quo - this massive imbalance of power - cannot stand.\"</p><p>The rising calls for a better data bargain come during an intensifying backlash against Big Tech and its handling of user data. Lawmakers and regulators in several countries are investigating the companies' market power, their role as gatekeepers of communication and their handling of data, especially in failing to protect users' privacy.</p><p>On Wednesday, Facebook agreed to new layers of oversight and a record fine to settle privacy violations. It also acknowledged that it was under investigation from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for antitrust concerns. And on Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said that it would begin examining the internet giants' domination over the market to determine whether they had sought to stifle competition.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that free services paid for with advertising and data are a bad bargain for consumers. The consumer benefit from free internet services was estimated to be more than US$100 billion in the United States alone, according to a 2012 paper co-written by Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management.</p><p>That figure would be far higher today, given the growth of online offerings. \"Consumers do get a huge amount of value from those services,\" Brynjolfsson said.</p><p>But the advocates for a new deal on data are gaining momentum as more is known about how the big internet companies use personal information. Giving information to Google, Facebook or Amazon, for example, is not just a signal of interest or preference, but also the raw material for targeting ads, steering online behaviour and training artificial intelligence systems like facial recognition.</p><p>Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>A goal of the legislation introduced last month by Warner and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is \"to give consumers some sense of the value of the data they are giving up,\" Warner explained.</p><p>How much personal data is worth is a tricky calculation. Estimates vary widely, depending on assumptions. The recent study by Shapiro's consulting firm took several factors into account, including the falloff in online advertising efficiency when people opt out of data collection.</p><p>The study estimated that the corporate payoff - mainly to big-tech companies - from collecting the personal data of Americans online was US$76 billion in 2018 and that it would rise sharply in the future.</p><p>If the government collected a 50 per cent fee from companies using Americans' personal data, Shapiro said, it could contribute significantly to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure or supporting social safety net. If paid out to individuals, it would be a cheque for $122 a person last year. The study was done for Future Majority, a research centre for the Democratic party.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019072755181429</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNK-7HC1-F103-342X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

We hand it over willingly for free services. But the biggest economic windfall goes to tech giants such as Google and Facebook. Their corporate wealth is built on harvesting and commercializing the information supplied by the online multitudes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Imagine if General Motors did not pay for its steel, rubber or glass - its inputs,\" said Robert Shapiro, an economist who recently did an analysis of the value of data. \"That's what it's like for the big internet companies. It's a sweet deal.\" But there is a growing collection of people seeking ways to alter that arrangement. As a disparate group of academics, economists, technologists and lawmakers, their politics range from moderately liberal to free-market conservative.</p><p>They are pursuing different paths. Some have done research to put a value on personal data, as a way to inform public debate on how to broker a better deal for the online proletariat. Others propose recognizing the data as a tradable asset or as labour, to help create an efficient market for the data and return more digital wealth to individuals and society.</p><p>Last month, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner co-sponsored a bill that would require the big internet companies to regularly inform users of what personal data they collect and to disclose the value of that data.</p><p>\"I'm not sold on what the approach should be,\" said Warner, a former technology investor and a frequent critic of the tech giants. \"But the status quo - this massive imbalance of power - cannot stand.\"</p><p>The rising calls for a better data bargain come during an intensifying backlash against Big Tech and its handling of user data. Lawmakers and regulators in several countries are investigating the companies' market power, their role as gatekeepers of communication and their handling of data, especially in failing to protect users' privacy.</p><p>On Wednesday, Facebook agreed to new layers of oversight and a record fine to settle privacy violations. It also acknowledged that it was under investigation from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for antitrust concerns. And on Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said that it would begin examining the internet giants' domination over the market to determine whether they had sought to stifle competition.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that free services paid for with advertising and data are a bad bargain for consumers. The consumer benefit from free internet services was estimated to be more than US$100 billion in the United States alone, according to a 2012 paper co-written by Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management.</p><p>That figure would be far higher today, given the growth of online offerings. \"Consumers do get a huge amount of value from those services,\" Brynjolfsson said.</p><p>But the advocates for a new deal on data are gaining momentum as more is known about how the big internet companies use personal information. Giving information to Google, Facebook or Amazon, for example, is not just a signal of interest or preference, but also the raw material for targeting ads, steering online behaviour and training artificial intelligence systems like facial recognition.</p><p>Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>A goal of the legislation introduced last month by Warner and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is \"to give consumers some sense of the value of the data they are giving up,\" Warner explained.</p><p>How much personal data is worth is a tricky calculation. Estimates vary widely, depending on assumptions. The recent study by Shapiro's consulting firm took several factors into account, including the falloff in online advertising efficiency when people opt out of data collection.</p><p>The study estimated that the corporate payoff - mainly to big-tech companies - from collecting the personal data of Americans online was US$76 billion in 2018 and that it would rise sharply in the future.</p><p>If the government collected a 50 per cent fee from companies using Americans' personal data, Shapiro said, it could contribute significantly to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure or supporting social safety net. If paid out to individuals, it would be a cheque for $122 a person last year. The study was done for Future Majority, a research centre for the Democratic Party.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2019072755181792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNK-7HC1-F103-3404-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Apple won one round of a complex legal battle with the European Commission to protect its use of low-tax jurisdictions. And Huawei lost out on UK business after the British government did a U-turn from its decision to allow limited Huawei participation in the UK 5G network. A perfect storm of Conservative backbench insurrection and US sanctions made the previous UK position untenable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These clashes are skirmishes in a much bigger war for dominance of the emerging digital world economy and the new, overlapping, technologies within it: artificial intelligence; 5G; big data; advanced semiconductors; and quantum computing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One aspect of this multifaceted conflict is between the \"big five\" American data giants - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (ieGoogle), Microsoft and Facebook - and various governments trying to impose rules regarding privacy, content, competition and tax. Another is the emergence of competition with these household names from China's lesser-known but enormous data companies - Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and others which have achieved global leadership in specific sectors like Huawei (telecommunications) and Daijang (drones).</p><p>Only the two economic superpowers, the US and China, now have the capacity in their companies and national infrastructure to compete seriously in this territory. That competition is rapidly degenerating into a polarised \"cold war\" between them.</p><p>Europe has not produced any of its own data giants and seems unlikely to do so. Instead, its markets are being fought over by US companies and increasingly the Chinese. The activities of the European Union have centred on consumers rather than producers, with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becoming a notable success in establishing a common standard for the protection of privacy across Europe. It is accepted beyond the EU's borders, including in Brexit Britain.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Commission is the only effective referee of the market, as the sole competition authority with sufficient heft and will to tackle, head-on, the immense power which resides in the data giants. This power derives from having near monopoly reach through a commonly used operating system as with Microsoft and MS-DOS in the Eighties and Nineties, Apple more recently with IoS and Google with Android. Conversely, internet platforms gain power as they gain users, with Amazon's online retail, Facebook's social media and Google's search engine now near-universal services. The monopolies are strengthened by numerous acquisitions of innovative companies and potential competitors, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Google's of YouTube and Spotify.</p><p>The only major counterweight is Margrethe Vestager, a Danish liberal, who as European competition commissionerhas a passion for free trade, open markets and consumer rights in the European liberal tradition. She is rumoured to have been the model for the fictional Birgitte Nyborg in the Danish political dramaBorgen. In the real world, she has been tenacious in challenging the data giants, albeit with mixed results.</p><p>In this field, proving monopoly abuse is difficult, not least because data giants provide their services free at the point of use, so do not obviously rip anyone off. Instead we pay indirectly through advertising and the data collected on what we click. We pay even more through lost revenue when big companies pick and choose where to pay their taxes, escaping billions in liabilities. In the complex task of demonstrating that abuse it taking place, the commission is painfully slow. Google for example managed to acquire 167 companies after an EU Commission inquiry commenced. It was, however, eventually fined for market abuse over competition between its search engine and price comparison sites.</p><p>Apple has been defter, successfully defeating the commission in the courts. It was accused of colluding with the Irish government to dodge state aid rules through a \"sweetheart\" deal which involved paying 1 per cent corporate tax. The second-highest court in the EU found for Ireland and the company, and the commission has low expectations of winning when the issue goes to the European Court of Justice. It is to the credit of Vestager that she keeps fighting. She is already bringing another case against Apple over the fees Spotify has to pay for using its payments system.</p><p>By comparison, the US takes virtually no action over big data companies. The \"trust-busting\" traditions - the break-up of the railway baronies, the Rockefeller oil empire and Bell Telephone - are long forgotten. Today's president sees data companies solely in terms of their political usefulness in promoting his message. Although a few radical legislators like Elizabeth Warren have called for the likes of Facebook to be broken up, the companies face far less challenge than in Europe.</p><p>The US authorities have so far had an additional reason for turning a blind eye to whatever market abuses the data companies get up to: superpower competition with China. To paraphrase a former US statesman challenged about his country's unsavoury allies: \"They may be bastards but they are our bastards\". With the big tech giants, and others in specialised applications - Netflix, PayPal, Uber, eBay - and many others the US is the only western country with the range of skills, the depth of capital markets, the entrepreneurial energy and the scale to be able to dominate and push ahead into new technologies.</p><p>Some of the big US data companies were never allowed to get a foothold in China (Google, Facebook), opening the way to Chinese alternatives, and Amazon has been marginalised there by a Chinese competitor, Alibaba. China has produced its own version of Uber (Didi) and hitherto unknown companies are colonising other areas.</p><p>The switch under Donald Trump and Xi Jinping from a recognition of interdependence and mutual interest to outright hostility and conflict has enormous implications for the digital world. In a few cases, notably Apple, there is heavy interdependence with China and interlocking supply chains. Companies like Huawei are genuinely global. Others like TikTok have become popular with western consumers. Newcomers like Zoom have a big research and development footprint in both the west and China.</p><p>The policy of delinking now apparently being pursued by the west will be seriously disruptive for some of these companies, but it will also deprive countries like Britain of state-of-the-art technology. In its latest act of self-harm, the UK has just accepted that it will go backwards for several years in ambitions for 5G connectivity, in return for pleasing Trump. Meanwhile, the timid challenge which Britain offered to the tech industry through a proposed digital tax is likely to be swept away as a condition for the US agreeing to a bilateral trade deal.</p><p>The long-term effect of American myopia over what should be recognisable mutual interest is unlikely to be China simply backing off and giving up. Instead, the Chinese will try even harder, using the country's immense capacity to mobilise talent, investment and hard work. In the long term, their ambition is not just to equal US power, but to exceed it and become number one. As these titans wage war against each other, more is the pity that the UK has walked away from the - limited - protection that a forceful European Competition Commission provides from the crossfire.</p><p>Vince Cable is the former leader of the Liberal Democrats</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-DMGTCHPDSTRY000041714755ARTICLETEXT1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DH-RX91-JCS0-D0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1272\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The further you bend toward one end of the spectrum, the more likely you are to engage in paralyzing confirmation bias. Rarely exposing yourself to different viewpoints. In fact, remember how much the president hated Fox News?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: If I watch Fox News, I wouldn't vote for me. If you watch Fox Newson a regular basis, it is a constant menu. They will find folks who make me mad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: He didn't stop at an observation because they just never do. He persisted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: All of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the internet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Leadership, meaning government. Go on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: It used to be, in the United States for example, we had three television stations and everybody watched Walter Cronkite or David Brinkley or whoever the chief anchor was. Everybody had a common set of facts, and so there might be conservatives and liberals, but people could generally agree on a baseline of reality.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, we only just had <person><nameText>Rachel Maddow. </nameText></person>Well, the problem is there are too many choices, and too many realities. Government has not done enough to confine and constrain the internet so people you disagree with are obviously dealing with a flawed set of facts. Fox Newsis bad, so its counterpart must be good.</p><p>Therefore, we should narrow our choices to only MSNBC and Salon. Yes, leadership should make sure we're all lapping up the same subjectivist dribble from a government-approved trough. Got it. That is so wrong. A proliferation of choices is not only a healthy sign of cultural success, it's how a postmodern world operates.</p><p>When you imply, choice should be limited, you're also implying free speech should be curtailed because different viewpoints don't rest within your accepted set of facts. Obama went on to criticize digital activism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: One of the things we want to do, I think, is as we're working with young people to build up platforms for social change, make sure that they don't think just sending out a hashtag in and of itself is bringing about change.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, yes, we'd never want to do that. Come on, man, it's been lonely just mocking Hillary. It's so good to Senor Si Si Puede back to kick around a little bit. Thanks, Obama. Welcome to the show. I'm Kennedy.</p><p>Well, the former president has been out of office for nearly a year, the candidate he supported lost. So why does he feel the need to keep dropping these pearls of wisdom all over us? Joining me now is the \"Townhall.com\" Political Editor and Fox NewsContributor, Guy Benson joins me once again. Hi, Guy.</p><p>GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: I'm also a pearl of wisdom dropper myself, Kennedy. So, it's good to be here.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, it's certainly good to have your pearls in my clutches. So, let's talk a little bit about the implied oppression of free speech, because I don't know if it's a generational thing or a statist thing, but what he was saying is the dangers of the internet are people can create their own reality, there are too many realities, and in the good old days we only have three choices. That sounds pretty limiting.</p><p>BENSON: Well, I certainly don't yearn for these so-called good old days when Americans had two newspapers and three anchors who told them what the news was and we all preceded from there. I think that more choices always is a good thing or are a good thing for the American people.</p><p>And he's right though, I'm going to just defend him a little bit that when people construct their own echo chamber where they only tune in and only read certain outlets and news organizations and commentators with whom they agree, they're susceptible to missing out on a lot of relevant perspectives and facts when it comes to national conversations.</p><p>And although I think you are criticizing Obama correctly for sort of being nostalgic about the bad old days in my view, he did stop well short of calling for regulation. He was in fact asked by Prince Harry, \"Do you think the government should step up and do more in terms of regulating the internet and regulating viewpoints or is it a matter of education?\"</p><p>And Obama correctly sided on the education side of that spectrum, which is the right thing to do. So credit there.</p><p>KENNEDY: I don't know, man. I disagree, I think the entire idea of net neutrality is a form of control and that's why libertarians have pushed against it and that's why the commissioner of the FCC is absolutely right in ending those Obama rules that would allow government to have more control over the internet. And that is ultimately --</p><p>BENSON: I agree.</p><p>KENNEDY: No matter what he says, that's ultimately what he wants and that's ultimately what the implication is. Now, another side of this, people are saying that he's overtly criticizing the president.</p><p>I think you have to read in between the lines. I think you're looking too deeply into what he said for an overt criticism of the sitting president. What do you think?</p><p>BENSON: It's not overt, it's oblique, but it's not that subtle, right? When he's talking about leaders who need to be responsible about how they engage on social media, I think that's pretty clearly a bit of a slap at Trump and it's probably a deserved slap. Right?</p><p>But one thing that did crack me up a little bit about Obama and sort of a lot of this pontificating that we heard in the Prince Harry interview, a number of the points that he made I thought were solid and good, but I'm also sitting there being like, dude, when you just pointed out when he's talking about, you know, hashtags onto themselves aren't enough.</p><p>It's like self-awareness, my friend. Like he was talking about how you can create these self-affirming hallelujah choruses where you totally miss an entire side of an issue. In the same interview, he's talking about his greatest accomplishment being Obamacare, and he played the sound by him saying it's working really well in the real world.</p><p>There are millions of Americans who have been actively harmed by that law that was built on lie upon lie who's called the affordable care act, not the give more people healthcare act and it's not affordable. The premiums have doubled on the individual market when it comes to Obamacare.</p><p>KENNEDY: And choices have shrunk. And again, you know, maybe that his ultimate goal and that is the goal of communism, that is the collective. That's having a few choices possible and the government telling you which choices you're left with.</p><p>BENSON: My point is though when says, oh, you can really just hear one side of an issue and not get a broader perspective in this dangerous new era of online demagoguery. He himself was a world class demagogue.</p><p>He was more sophisticated than President Trump is in his demagoguery, but he absolutely was part of the problem. And it's good that he recognizes the problem.</p><p>KENNEDY: He constantly criticized Fox Newswhich I find to be laughable because that happened to be --</p><p>BENSON: Tiresome.</p><p>KENNEDY: -- a collection of people with often times differing viewpoints. And you know what, that's OK. It doesn't matter if it's President Trump or <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>it's good to challenge our leaders. It's good to take their arguments apart. I am delighted to have your pearls in my jewelry case. Guy Benson, thanks again.</p><p>BENSON: Thanks, Kennedy.</p><p>KENNEDY: Always. Well, there's been another bunch of crazy twists in the investigation into President Trump's alleged ties to Russia.</p><p>A former Bush Administration ethic lawyer now calling on FBI Director <person><nameText>Christopher Wray </nameText></person>to tell President Trump and other Republicans to stop targeting his agency or resign. The Florida Republican Congressman Francis Rooney told the MSNBC that the head of agencies like the FBI and DOJ should \"purge\" employees they feel could be politically motivated.</p><p>The calls for resignation and purges come after President Trump yesterday, went on the offensive claiming the FBI was tainted, accusing the agency of using the infamous dirty dossier to discredit his campaign, and he alleged that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>was behind the whole thing. So, should the head of the FBI consider resigning?</p><p>What could this mean for the Mueller investigation? Let me bring in my nuclear powered party panel, from \"THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" where she operates as the correspondent, Kat Timpf is here tonight along with comedian Joe DeVito, and former State Department Spokesperson and Fox NewsContributor, Marie Harf also here. Welcome, everyone.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, CORRESPONDENT, THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW: Yay.</p><p>JOE DEVITO, COMEDIAN: Hello.</p><p>KENNEDY: So, Kat, I want to talk a little bit about this because a lot of people say that it's the deep state. If were, can people who burrow into government jobs for oftentimes decades? They're the most who are most problematic because the see the president as the biggest threat to their silent power.</p><p>TIMPF: Right. And he said in the interview that it was kind of the deep state, which I don't understand how you're kind of the deep state.</p><p>KENNEDY: You're talking about Congressman Rooney?</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. I don't really get it. It's like kind of a traitor.</p><p>KENNEDY: Or kind of pregnant.</p><p>TIMPF: Or kind of a pregnant, yes. But I think in general, you should kind of steer clear of using the phrase \"deep state\" because you basically place a tinfoil hat on your own head when you do so, even though there are legitimate concerns here.</p><p>I think the fact that, you know, Strzok was sending these messages proved that there was a bias. And the fact that he works in HR now is pretty hilarious, when he was sending text messages to his coworker/mistress that kind of prove his impartiality.</p><p>KENNEDY: Do you think he's telling people not to send certain text messages on --</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. He's probably like a how to get away with the HR guy. Like listen, use one of these secret messaging apps with your work lovers.</p><p>Yes, it's pretty ridiculous, but I think we can't take it too far in the other direction saying everybody's got to go, that Mueller has got to be fired or something like that. I think we need to take in on --</p><p>KENNEDY: I don't know, man. Joe DeVito says we got a clean house, he likes the purge.</p><p>DEVITO: You know a great app name for that would be? It would be traitor with none of the vowels in it, just TRTR.</p><p>TIMPF: They'll register it.</p><p>DEVITO: I will, I will. I think what we need to do is we do need a purge. We do need to clean out the Augean Stables and run all that water through there, clean all this crap out. These people have been accumulating there.</p><p>They're unaccountable, they're unelected, and there is a deep state that's monkeying around. Now, I'm not saying the president is certainly not above criticism, but we don't know what these people are doing.</p><p>KENNEDY: But who do you replace every one of the FBI and CIA with?</p><p>MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON AND FOX NEWSCONTRIBUTOR: If someone --</p><p>DEVITO: Let's start over.</p><p>HARF: Someone --</p><p>KENNEDY: How do you start over?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: I mean, they say the same thing about congress.</p><p>DEVITO: Complete destructive payoff.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, but who do you put in there, Roy Moore?</p><p>HARF: Well, I feel like someone who's never actually worked in government.</p><p>DEVITO: I have it and I'm proud of that.</p><p>HARF: I worked in the federal government for 10 years as part of that bureaucracy and bureaucracy does a lot of really good things like tracking terrorists, taking our enemies off of the battlefield, paying your Social Security checks.</p><p>KENNEDY: Spying on Americans.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes.</p><p>DEVITO: Yes.</p><p>HARF: So they take it to a negative place, but look --</p><p>KENNEDY: They'll take it to a realistic place.</p><p>HARF: But the word purge --</p><p>KENNEDY: It's not all sunshine and unicorns, Marie.</p><p>HARF: No, but it's also not all people out to destroy the president. And using words like purge are very loaded --</p><p>KENNEDY: Irresponsible, I agree.</p><p>HARF: It's very irresponsible, there are patriotic men and women who work at the FBI. A few bad apples should not taint the organization. I don't think that that's fair and --</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I'm going to come up with the compromise between you too and I'm going to use a phrase that Katie Pavlich used today when we were both outnumbered. It's boots versus suits. It's people who -- you know, the boots are the men and women who work hard, the investigators who do the day to day slog, who truly are patriotic, who worked their asses off.</p><p>In the military, they are the warriors, and the suits are the ones that very few in the highest echelons of these agencies who really get to scope the culture and the outcomes. And when those people are biased, that's when it's incredibly dangerous because that one, unfortunately, the trickle-down effect is really felt in every layer of the pyramid.</p><p>All right. Well now, meantime, a big political battle brewing for 2018 and it's pitting the two most powerful Republican lawmakers against each other. According to \"Politico\" House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have completed different views on entitlement reform.</p><p>Ryan reportedly wants to take an ax to federal programs like Medicaid, Medicare and welfare and he apparently feels he has the momentum to do just that after passing tax cuts. Mitch McConnell on the other hand reportedly said entitlement reform ain't happening during, it's too risky, in a midterm election year.</p><p>So will Washington ever have the courage to shrink the federal government? Kat, what I think is so incredibly necessary is for these legislators to operate as though they don't care if they are re-elected, and if they actually did that, it would certainly benefit the American people. Entitlements are so cumbersome to the point of actually being unfair to those they claim to help.</p><p>TIMPF: Right. They are not compassionate when there's a system that keeps you dependent on welfare rather than allowing for work opportunities. And I don't know what the Republican Party is anymore, I can't stand it. People say, yes, the Republican Party is a fiscally conservative party.</p><p>No, it isn't. Because even aside from all the overspending on defense, they're too afraid to cut spending even in domestic areas, they are more likely to pass this huge infrastructure spending bill than they are to actually cut entitlements. They just did tax cuts without spending cuts.</p><p>I will not be able to handle it if Mitch McConnell ever, ever, ever says anything about being fiscally conservative. If they don't care about the national debt, they don't care about budget, they just want to spend money just like democrats do.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, and they never give it to the people who really need it. That's the problem with these programs that claim to help people is those who are the most vulnerable or always the last ones in line when you allow too many people to line up.</p><p>DEVITO: Yes. Well, the government becomes the middle man that takes their vague out of it and these are not safety nets. These are spider webs. We're trapped in them.</p><p>They're not helping out the people who need the help, otherwise you wouldn't have generations of families on public assistance. And the problem is we keep arguing over what is the better way to spend money we don't have. And that's why you'd want the government be in charge of taking people's resources, in reality --</p><p>KENNEDY: All they're doing is buying votes. I mean that's the unfortunate reality. It may be jaded, but there is too much risk avoidance and there's not enough actual helping. All they're doing is beefing up programs in their own districts, going back and buying votes.</p><p>HARF: Well, I think that's a pretty cynical view and some of that may be true.</p><p>KENNEDY: Cynical or realistic?</p><p>HARF: Well, I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TIMPF: It's what it flat out said, you can't do it an election year (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, that's exactly the point.</p><p>TIMPF: That's what it says.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. No, but that's what it's saying, we can't lose races.</p><p>HARF: Well, of course though, it's not about buying votes.</p><p>KENNEDY: We have to promise people things we can afford, we have to buy everyone a pony so they like us.</p><p>HARF: Medicaid and Medicare is not buying people ponies, it's helping them get health insurance. They're not perfect programs and they need reform. But when we just say, throw the baby out with the bath water, that's also not a good strategy. You know, Kat is absolutely right. The Republican Party has no idea what it is.</p><p>It's the moment Paul Ryan wants to focus on entitlement, Mitch McConnell who will very soon, after Doug Jones get sworn in, had a very slim majority in the Senate. It will be hard for him to do anything. And the infrastructure bill is so shocking to me because there is no way to pay for it.</p><p>KENNEDY: That's absolutely right.</p><p>HARF: And they are proposing --</p><p>KENNEDY: Spoken like a true Republican.</p><p>HARF: And they're proposing this huge increase, you know, blowing through the budget --</p><p>KENNEDY: I am equally disgusted.</p><p>HARF: -- they put in place. It's stunning.</p><p>KENNEDY: It is stunning. No one has any sort of fiscal restraint. That's not cynical. That is the truth, and the trust hurt so good. All right. The party panel returns a little bit later.</p><p>First up, however, Christmas is the time for giving, but outspoken San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich says rich people don't give enough to charity. Ed Stringham proves why Coach Pop is all wrong. After the break. Stay tuned.</p><p>KENNEDY: Welcome back. One of the most of outspoken and successful coaches in the NBA has repeatedly criticize President Trump. He's Colin Kaepernick and recently called the USA an embarrassment to the world. Now he says rich people like him are a bunch of cheap skates when it comes to charity. And it turns out, he's dead wrong.</p><p>San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has five NBA titles to his name and he's made a ton of money in the process. Same goes for a lot of his players. But when a local reporter asked him why it's important to contribute to charity, he responded, \"Because we are rich as hell and we don't need it all, and other people need it.\"</p><p>He went on to say, you are an ass if you don't give. Well, guess what, pop, rich people do give to charity, especially rich Americans. According to the \"Almanac of American Philanthropy\", the top 1% of American income earners are responsible for all one third all donations made.</p><p>So, who is the real ass here, buddy? Joining me now, the president of the American Institute for Economic Research and Professor of Economics at trinity college, Ed Stringham joins me once again. Hi, Ed.</p><p>ED STRINGHAM, PRESIDENT, THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMIC RESEARCH: Hello, Kennedy. Nice to see you.</p><p>KENNEDY: So Gregg Popovich makes it sounds like rich people are lazy and selfish and they don't give a lot of money, but in fact --</p><p>STRINGHAM: It's actually wrong. So ever since the days of Andrew Carnegie who said, \"It is the duty of rich people to accumulate wealth and then give that away.\" People have been doing that.</p><p>Now I don't think it's their necessary duty to give it all away, but you can look around and all the top museums, the concert halls, Carnegie Hall, David Koch Theater.</p><p>KENNEDY: I was going to say the David Koch Theater.</p><p>STRINGHAM: These are paid for. All this money is coming from rich people. And I can go to those theaters without having to fork over the $50 million renovation price. And so every single time I go, I thank rich people for all the great work they're doing for society.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, when you see the ballet which is heavily subsidized by the wealthy or the opera or any number of the arts which are still alive and thriving this country is because of some of the benefactors who contribute to these programs.</p><p>But what I want to ask you is obviously the new tax bill that was signed into law sort of penalizes people who make charitable donations who have itemized those deductions in the past, and about $4,400 per household were deducted against income, but now only 5% of what used to be 30% of people will be able to do that. Doesn't that disincentivize giving?</p><p>STRINGHAM: Well, a little bit yes and no. I mean, there's higher standard deduction rate, so for most of people, they're not going to want to have to go through and say I gave $5 at my church yesterday. I gave $5 two weeks ago.</p><p>And so for most people, the amount of deductions are actually you're not going to have to worry about them. So that's going to be simplifying people's tax reform.</p><p>KENNEDY: So most people are going to take the double standard deduction and they don't itemize anyway.</p><p>STRINGHAM: Yes, if you want to, I mean, there's lots of things that people can do and they say, for high-income people, a lot of those people are going to be doing the itemize deduction. So, you know, I'm not an expert on all of the specifics of it, but it's basically going to be simplifying it.</p><p>Now there's a lot of charities who are saying, \"Well, you know, now that we're not itemizing each line, then we're not getting these special benefits for people.\" And that is true to some extent.</p><p>KENNEDY: Are charities going to feel the hit?</p><p>STRINGHAM: I mean, ideally they're going to be having to get people's money through, I would say, voluntary sector means and not getting these special privileges that we currently have.</p><p>So I think Americans should be able to decide if they want to give their money to charity or not give their money to charity. And I kind of question this whole approach that the government needs to be encouraging people to be doing more.</p><p>KENNEDY: Interesting.</p><p>STRINGHAM: So I'm totally happy when people get in line in these charities.</p><p>KENNEDY: I mean don't we press people to give their money away? I don't think we need government as a tool of force and oppression or hotheads like Gregg Popovich shaming people into giving money? I think are inherently good and I don't think rich people by virtue of their richness are bad.</p><p>STRINGHAM: I agree with that. So I'm happy if they give, but if they don't want to give, that's their choice. And so we need to allow people to voluntarily make this decision rather than having government to say you need to do this or we're going to encourage you to do that.</p><p>I think that's one of the great things about freedom that lets the person decide. Government shouldn't be deciding what percentage of your money goes to the opera. I happen to love the opera, but I'm not going to mandate that on other people.</p><p>So even the rich person who doesn't give to charity, I would say, that's their prerogative. That's their business. So, Steve Jobs, people criticize him sometimes, he didn't give enough to charity.</p><p>But if you look at all the wealth that he created, all the great jobs, all the great technology he created. Fantastic. Warren Buffett, he's eventually going to give his money to charity.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, billions. But the fact that he hasn't been so far, some people even criticize him. I said, no, great, look at all this wealth --</p><p>KENNEDY: I don't mind if billionaires criticize each other. Like I don't mind the Bill Gates. Like, come on, Warren, I'm giving away half of everything I have. Maybe even more than that. You should give your fortune away too.</p><p>STRINGHAM: It's one of these mindsets that a lot of people feel like they need to give their money away during their lifetime. And when they pass away --</p><p>KENNEDY: When you pass away, can I have your money?</p><p>STRINGHAM: All of the billions of it.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>STRINGHAM: I'm actually going to --</p><p>KENNEDY: I knew this job would be worthwhile. I'm going to be so Ed Stringham rich, I can't wait. Ed, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>STRINGHAM: Pleasure's mine.</p><p>KENNEDY: Always great to see you. Coming up, ISIS now threatening to kill innocent party-goers for celebrating the holiday like New Year's Eve. We'll talk about what police are doing to help keep all of you boozebags safe.</p><p>Plus, Disney changing security protocols at some of their resorts. Are you at risk of having a hotel employee walk in on you when you're stepping out of the shower? Maybe not alone. Party panel returns to explain, next.</p><p>KENNEDY: Middle name (INAUDIBLE) welcome back. The Islamic State released a new video this week urging followers to target large groups of intoxicated people as they celebrate the New Year.</p><p>This comes as an estimated one million people are set to descend upon Times Square to watch the ball drop Sunday night. I'm going to be there hosting All-American New Year with Jesse Watters on the Fox NewsChannel and I'm not too worried about my safety and I'll tell you why because the NYPD is amazing.</p><p>But after two weeks, the terror attacks right here in Gotham, officials are on high alert, there's going to be more security than ever.</p><p>My next guest knows a thing or two about keeping New York safe. He's former Homeland Security director for New York State, and he's here with me now, Michael Balboni. Welcome to the show.</p><p>MICHAEL BALBONI, FORMER DIRECTOR, NEW YORK HOMELAND SECURITY: Thank you, Kennedy.</p><p>KENNEDY: SO what is the NYPD doing this year differently in order to safeguard New Yorkers from some of these pointed ISIS treats?</p><p>BALBONI: So what they're really trying to do is focus on what the public perception at first is and that there have been a marked increase of attacks against civilians essentially we saw the attack on Halloween where an individual again used a car as a weapon just like what they've done in Europe.</p><p>And what we're seeing is that these types of attacks are done just on the spur of the moment against unarmed civilians and randomly.</p><p>And so the call to attack folks who are reveling in the New Year celebration perhaps are drunk, in an attempt to try to instill fear because remember what's happened, they've gone virtual. They don't have this caliphate that they wanted anymore. And so they're trying to inspire people. That's all gone.</p><p>KENNEDY: OK. So, I have a question about that because, you know, we've talked about how 90% of the ISIS territory has been taken back by the U.S. and our allies. So what happens to some of the 30,000 ISIS fighters who are no longer fighting in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan? Where do they go and should we be worried?</p><p>BALBONI: So there is a great concern in Europe that they are going to return. There are places as we have seen in Brussels where there are basically neighborhoods where a lot of folks come back and there have been -- there's evidence attacks have been planned from these places.</p><p>The Paris attack, the Brussels airport attack. So Europe is very concerned about folks coming back into Europe. But that's also something that could happen here in the United States. But what we've seen here are folks who really haven't gone overseas.</p><p>They've been right here at home. And like the San Bernardino attacks and they've gotten radicalize and they take just everyday items. Well, they take guns too and they try to do things with cars. And of course you had the Pulse Nightclub shooting.</p><p>So we've had instances where individuals who haven't been the warriors overseas, but are right here. And that's really what we mean by virtual caliphate.</p><p>KENNEDY: I mean, even the guy in the New York City port authority bus terminal in that subway tunnel who had a homemade bomb strapped to his chest to, you know, ended up burning himself.</p><p>He tried to kill a bunch of people, but wasn't successful. NYPD is obviously looking out for that. So ISIS says, they're targeting are on people. Should everyone stay sober this New Year's?</p><p>BALBONI: I think that -- first of all, let's go to New York City. You're going to be there and you're going to be really secure because New York City -- I've gotten a chance to be in their command center and, you know, New York City PD does this better than anybody else along with the FBI, New York State Troopers.</p><p>A whole bunch of great units who really understand not only what needs to be done but they have tremendous experience, and it's about controlling the movement of folks. Now folks standing in pens for hours and hours. In fact, I don't know why some people do it --</p><p>KENNEDY: Nine hours.</p><p>BALBONI: (INAUDIBLE) cold it's going to be.</p><p>KENNEDY: They open up those pens at 3:00 in the afternoon. People are going to be there for at least nine hours in a freezing cold.</p><p>I don't know, I mean, not to mention where you go tinkle potty. I don't know how people are going to keep from getting frostbite because temperatures are going to dip into the teeth.</p><p>BALBONI: But what does it also, it lowers, you know, some of the ability of people to really move around in a way where they could really provide a threat and that truly the key. You know where they should be --</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, they are closing all parking garages creating a bigger perimeter. They've got sand trucks, a lot of the main streets obviously are closed including the avenue.</p><p>So I feel good about it and I hope people feel good snuggling up and watching at home. Michael, thank you so much for your insights. I think people should feel good about this New Year's Eve because 2018 is going to be amazing.</p><p>BALBONI: I agree.</p><p>KENNEDY: Have a great night, thank you.</p><p>BALBONI: Yes.</p><p>KENNEDY: Now, speaking of security, Disney updating its policies that several resorts at Walt Disney World in Orlando which all three hotels are ditching the \"do not disturb\" sign and replacing them with room occupied signs.</p><p>Employees will be required to check inside rooms at least once a day. It's been reported the tighten security measure is response to the Las Vegas massacre where 58 people were killed earlier this year.</p><p>So Disney has yet to confirm that correlation, so does Mickey have our best interest at heart or is this an invasion of privacy just playing goofy. The party panel returns. Here they are, Kat Timpf, Joe DeVito and Marie Harf. Marie, is this the best way to handle security post Las Vegas tragedy?</p><p>HARF: Well, it's sort of seems like we're always trying to fight the last war, right? I mean, we take our shoes off at airports because one guy tried to light his shoe on fire and didn't even succeed.</p><p>KENNEDY: I take my underwear off at the airport because of the underwear bomber.</p><p>HARF: Well, that's a personal choice.</p><p>KENNEDY: Really?</p><p>HARF: But I'm sure TSA appreciates.</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, I thought that was --</p><p>HARF: But, you know, I think after Las Vegas, big hotels and resorts are trying to figure out ways they could have prevented it. I think this seems like possibly a good idea. There's a whole other host of things we should talk about like guns, but I'm not even going to go there today.</p><p>You know, I think it's an interesting way to try and get ahead of this problem. Someone shouldn't be able to hole up in a hotel room for two weeks, keep bringing in suitcases.</p><p>KENNEDY: With a cache of weapons. Nothing to see here. Are they going to go through our belongings? If I have a giant bag and they're worried that I might have something.</p><p>HARF: It's gun-shaped.</p><p>DEVITO: Your unmentionables, your fine washables?</p><p>KENNEDY: They're all at the airport.</p><p>DEVITO: I never stayed at a hotel where they honored the \"do not disturb\" sign. I have to put chairs up under it, like it's night of the living dead with them trying to come in, but I wanted -- I like the \"do not disturb\". I don't like to be bothered.</p><p>KENNEDY: I don't like to be bothered -- when I'm embalming in the bathtub, I don't need people --</p><p>HARF: Can you just lock the bolt though? And then --</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, I guess you could.</p><p>TIMPF: They could still see in there.</p><p>KENNEDY: They can. Absolutely. No, they've got all sorts of nudie vision.</p><p>TIMPF: I think this is the worst thing to ever happen. Because --</p><p>KENNEDY: Ever?</p><p>TIMPF: Disneyland is already so bad, they got to worry about Mickey just busting into your room whenever he damn well pleased.</p><p>KENNEDY: True, even perverts too.</p><p>TIMPF: Even if they were dressed like Mickey, maybe they could --</p><p>KENNEDY: That would be kind of hot. It's terrible.</p><p>TIMPF: And maybe that'll be the next place like Disney Vegas. That will be an add-on.</p><p>HARF: This is not going to make anyone any safer either. Securities either. If anyone has a bunch of guns anyways, and they're like a monster maniac with a bunch of guns, I don't think this is going to stop them.</p><p>KENNEDY: Speaking of maniacs, if you're an iPhone user and you want to throw it off a cliff because it's so slow, it's not your fault or your imagination. The problem comes directly from Apple. The tech giant faces two lawsuits from users claiming their iPhones are slow.</p><p>Software updates forces old phones to stop working properly in order to urge customers to buy the latest model iPhone X. Apple released the statement admitting they do slow down older iPhones to keep the batteries from dying.</p><p>But is this really just a big tech company screwing its own loyal users. That's what I think. I think Apple knows we're all going to buy their phones. My phone is doing also -- is just throwing up apps. They all open at once for no reason. I'm not looking at Netflix.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes, I think so too. Although I don't really update my phone because I'm never off of it long enough.</p><p>KENNEDY: She's an iPhone 3.</p><p>TIMPF: I have to do too much texting. And if I'm updating it then I can't send people 30 messages in a row.</p><p>KENNEDY: Joe?</p><p>DEVITO: I think it's a scam because you think of all the notifications you get sent, and they act like, oh, no, we're just trying to save battery life so you don't have to worry about all that -- it bother some texting and messaging.</p><p>KENNEDY: Why would you (INAUDIBLE) it's so tacky.</p><p>DEVITO: She gets the jitter bug phone for older people that jabs you and that takes your blood pressure while you're --</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>DEVITO: What do we actually --</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, we have 10 seconds, Marie.</p><p>HARF: This is place into every big brother theory that you have and I think Apple, this is -- as a loyal iPhone user, this is very annoying.</p><p>KENNEDY: It is disconcerting. Marie is a secret libertarian. I'll take all of that. Thank you guys so much for being here tonight (INAUDIBLE) coming up, you want more proof of why we should get rid of the bloated federal agencies like the FDA?</p><p>Wait until you hear how long it takes to get an unsafe food off the shelves. Dr. Marc Siegel joins me in moments.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, the Food and Drug Administration recall process could put your health or your life at serious risk. Oh, no, another government failure. A new report from the office of the inspector general found it can take up to 10 months to get unsafe products of all store shelves after a recall.</p><p>Ten months is almost a year. I mean, food products are left out for you to go through and maybe die from. The report found it took an average of 57 days to start a recall once they found something wrong.</p><p>In one case, it took nearly three months for the FDA to recall a brand of cheese after it learned it was contaminated with a potentially deadly listeria. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has responded by saying, \"I know that much work remains to be done.\" He sounds so committed.</p><p>So, should we just get rid of the bloated bureaucracy all together? Joining me now, from the Fox NewsMedical A-team, Dr. Marc Siegel, also a professor of medicine at NYU Langone. Welcome back to the show, Dr. Siegel.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, NYU LANGONE: Kennedy, good to be with you.</p><p>KENNEDY: So, you know, the FDA has been wrought with failure over the last several decades. And, you know, when you hear about these recalls, whether it's spinach or a nut butter or a cheese, or the entire Chipotle chain.</p><p>You just assume that magically these problems better themselves, but there's really not an incentive for companies to take stiff off the shelves because they are waiting for the government to do it for them.</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, that's for sure. The companies are not going to do it on their own and I'll tell you what a big problem here is, the companies have been able to keep recalled products on the shelves without anyone knowing about it.</p><p>So one thing that the FDA is doing and I do not believe that the FDA or Commissioner Gottlieb was asleep at the switch here, Kennedy, they've established something called SCORE, Strategic Coordinated Oversight of Recall Execution.</p><p>Now that sounds like George Orwell, I understand, 1984, but I think it's a real serious attempt to get at this problem. And I heard from the FDA that next year, they're going to expose stories and companies that have tainted products on the shelves. And other thing, there is --</p><p>KENNEDY: We should already be doing that. I mean, we should already be letting people know where this stuff is. And I understand there's a perceptual problem, but there is a health problem and, you know, potentially a life and death problem.</p><p>Particularly, for people who ingest these things, pregnant women who are at risk of losing their babies if they contract certain food-borne diseases.</p><p>SIEGEL: Which is to be fair, two infants did die in the amount of time you looked at there. Between 2012 and 2015 is when this report was covering and they looked at 30 instances. And 27 of them were called very severe. But since 2016, I think it's starting to get better.</p><p>Now the reason that this is so important is because there's a food safety modernization act that was passed in 2011 that gives the FDA the power to step in. You said companies aren't going to do it on their own, absolutely not. They're not. Well, FDA now has the power to step in.</p><p>Will they step in? This is a new watch. Gottlieb is a new one to the Trump Administration. I think they're taking this seriously. This year alone, they've clamped down on some listeria on some herbs that were tainted with lead.</p><p>They've gotten some E. coli out, salmonella. There are some instances where they've stepped in time, but the companies and the stores --</p><p>KENNEDY: In one area where they've actually gotten out of the way and this is shifting our story a little bit is in drug testing and the approval process.</p><p>Because that has been so slow and so many people have died waiting for FDA approval and some of these arbitrary requirements that they impose on doctors and drug makers.</p><p>But you're saying that Scott Gottlieb has actually gotten much better and the agency is in a much better position of approving some of these life- saving drugs and techniques.</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, Kennedy, you know, when it comes to food, they have to wait until it's already on the shelves. When it comes to prescription drugs, they have the right to stop something from getting it approved or getting it fast tracked.</p><p>And with some of the new cancer treatments out, immunotherapies, personalized medicine, they're zooming ahead with it. And the other thing is with generics which they think will introduce competition and bring down prices with generics, you now only have to show that you're active chemical is something that's already been used before.</p><p>In other words, the brand name manufacturers, the drug companies are wise guys. They say, you know, paten is running out, but anybody that wants to come in as a generic has to go through the research all over again.</p><p>FDA is cutting that out of the way and get rid of some of these regulations. They've approved 46 drugs this year alone which is a record for the FDA. I agree with you about overregulation.</p><p>KENNEDY: That's good news for people who are facing some daunting diagnoses that, you know, we've heard horror stories over the last few years and finally people are getting the right to try and getting some of these drugs and therapies that they absolutely deserve. Dr. Siegel, thank you so much for your time. Happy New Year.</p><p>SIEGEL: Happy New Year. Thanks. Great to see you, Kennedy.</p><p>KENNEDY: You too, thank you. Coming up, police across the country are calling for body cams on geese after a vicious attack at an Indiana gas station. Investigator suspect it was foul play. \"TOPICAL STORM\" is next.</p><p>KENNEDY: Aw, lamb chop. Tonight is our second to the last show of 2017. So we wanted to look back at some of our very favorite videos of the year. Unfortunately, the IT Department have no access from viewing the type of website, those videos were found on, the following five stories will have to do.</p><p>Delete your search history because this is the \"TOPICAL STORM.\" Topic number one. We begin tonight at Brigham Young University where the football team goes all out with pre-game festivities. They have got the smoke cannons, the cheerleaders, the marching band, even the skydivers who can't land.</p><p>Uh-oh. Where's he going? Oh, no. This guy was supposed to land on the 50-yard line, but he wound up landing on the poor people in the front row. Whoopsie, are you going to finish those nachos? Historian say this is the wildest things that happened on BYU campus since the game of shoes and ladders with a double overtime.</p><p>They didn't even have any Sprite to wash down their anxiety. Over two million people have seen this video which is amazing because it's hardly the only story that you're about to a guy going too far. I'd name the others, but we ain't got enough time, the list is awful long, Kevin Spacey.</p><p>Topic number two. Skydivers aren't the only ones who have landing issues this year. Look at this hamster. Oh, my gosh, that's going to give him an adult size banggaroo. He was trying to work off the holiday calories when a little jogging buddy came in and exercise in survival. Yes, he jumps on the wheel, doesn't even ask to work in like a total lowlife.</p><p>And now she is an internet punch line, and you're just (INAUDIBLE) fat. For those of you Samantha Bee fans who are watching a \"punch line\" is the thing you put at the end of a joke. A note to internet headline writers, the only thing that Samantha Bee has ever totally destroyed is one's will to watch television.</p><p>Topic number three. Numero tres in Espanol. Si. Indiana law enforcement are a God-fearing bunch who fear no man. Geese however are another story. A detective who's walking into the Clarksville Police Station after following a singer's advice and taking the last train to Clarksville.</p><p>But this goose did not meet him at station. She met him on the sidewalk. What a bastard. Gave him the business end of that mouth or beak or whatever it is. Yes, they're strong and tough and they've got teeth and they've learned to munch your private.</p><p>The Clarksville PD share this video as a public service announcement that urged citizens to never leave a bar without paying for their gray goose vodka. That's why I drink Tito's and Fireball mixed. Topic number four. Here's a video of an Australian man who flew a helicopter to McDonald's to get a filet of fish.</p><p>The cashier was shocked and she was like, \"Who orders a filet of fish?\" This guy does. Yes. He likes them so much, he goes by chopper which makes total sense to him because Australia is the world's Florida. Hi, I'd like a fillet of fish before me bath salts kick in. Yes, guys.</p><p>This video has been seen by over 2 million people and it was one of the only flying videos of the year that didn't involve someone getting dragged off a plane and beaten with a stroller which sounds off unless you're the rabbit that united cremated. We didn't know how to do with it because we killed it. Is that what you do with giant priceless rabbit?</p><p>Heartless bastards. I'm switching to delta. Topic number five. There is a price war going on in the taxi industry and Uber's fares are becoming a real steal. This video was shot on the driver's surveillance cam back in august and it shows a woman reaching into his tip cap and grabbing a handful of singles.</p><p>Uber has since suspended her access which is fine by her because she clearly prefers Lyft. The driver called the caps, but unfortunately they were handling a much bigger call. He's going to kill it if it's a pterodactyl.</p><p>Coming up, \"Vanity Fair\" has a bunch of suggestions for what <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>should do in the New Year including knitting and volunteer work. I have a better idea for Hillary. I'll give her the business and the (INAUDIBLE) in the \"NIGHTCAP\", next.</p><p>KENNEDY: It's almost the end of the show. Let's finish up strong. \"Vanity Fair\" used their digital platform Hive to poke some much deserved fun at <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>Some millennial staffers encouraged the hopeless, hapless presidential loser to do anything, but seek the presidency including teaching class on alternative nostril breathing and learning knitting and impromptu comedy.</p><p>The message was quite clear, the next generation of media titans is imploring Mrs. Clinton to get the hell off the political stage, they're asking that she never run again as I've pointed out on this show. Many times her desperate schtick has worn incredibly thin.</p><p>Look at me, victim mode is tired and fat, but I have a different resolution for the once popular despotic never was. Stick around. Hillary has provided hours of father and diatribes about who write themselves. If she hogs the spotlight, it gives so many of us endless material and we can easily pluck out the barbs and jabs she pretends to despise.</p><p>Let's face it. She needs the attention and we need the material. So for the love of God, Hillary not only should you stick around, you should run for presidency again. Imagine how much you would give us when you score a political turkey and lose the presidency for a third time.</p><p>Send your cards and letters to any Hillary affiliated super pack so we can keep the old gal around for one more sadistic turn on the dance floor. This New Year's Eve, I know Hillary is going to be partying on watching our show. That's right. I'm going to be hosting the All-American New Year with Jesse Watters.</p><p>It starts at 10:00 pm Eastern, 7:00 in the West on the Fox NewsChannel. The countdown to 2018, that starts at 8:00 pm. Thank you so much for watching the best hour of your day. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram @kennedynation. On Facebook, it's KennedyFBN. Email, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kennedyfbn@foxbusiness.com\">kennedyfbn@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>Tomorrow night on the show, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters, Katie Pavlich is here, along with Matt Welch. I hope I'll be seeing you too. Good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KENEDY-2017122701cb234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8S-K3S1-DXH2-64SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437068</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>KENNEDY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 27, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taxes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Charity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Holidays</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Arms Control</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Food and Beverages</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921110MM</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ</classCode><className>The Presidency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Tesla shares are slumping early on Friday morning, two days after the company reported yet another \"profitable\" quarter helped along by a massive sale of over $400 million in regulatory credits.  In fact, TSLA is now down over 21% from its recent record highs, officially entering a bear market in many investors' minds    And Robinhooders are surging in as the price tumbles    It seemed like yet another story of Tesla playing with its numbers - whether it be regulatory credits, A/R or warranty reserves - to turn a profit during a quarter when it most certainly shouldn't have. We outlined Tesla's results in this full report[3] and also noted analyst Gordon Johnson's analysis of how Tesla posted the numbers it did here[4].  But after this quarter - and especially after CFO Zach Kirkhorn said on the company's conference call that Tesla wouldnotbe selling nearly as many regulatory credits next quarter, it appears that focus couldactually be turning to the company's auto sales growth.And if that's the case, look out below. </p><p>   Amidst all the bluster about expanding Gigafactories and the narrative of saving the world, there remains the core issue of whether or not Tesla plans on ever making money selling cars.As we noted in our earnings writeup, Tesla's sales growth has been about as impressive as its net income ex-regulatory credit sales. That is to say, not impressive at all.  A new Bloomberg opinion piece[5] published by Chris Bryant the day after Tesla's earnings also seems to begrudgingly (and finally)address the issue of sales growth. It called the company's $104 million of net income a \"modest amount\" for a company that trades at 800x its trailing earnings. Modest, we would argue, is an understatement.  The piece then hones in on the fact that these regulatory credit sales can not, and will not, last forever:  The profits are also more than accounted for by $1 billion of regulatory credits that Tesla sold to other carmakers during the 12 months to June, including $428 million in the latest quarter. It's only able to earn this income because rivals haven't gotten their act together yet on building enough electric vehicles and have to buy credits from Musk's company to satisfy emissions regulators. Tesla acknowledges this good fortune won't last forever.  The op-ed piece calls for a renewed look at Tesla's revenue growth - which isn't really growth at all. In fact, what we noted earlier this week is that for a company that is valued more than most other automakers in the world combined on its prospective growth, and is larger than both the entire US and European auto sector, one would expect revenue to actually, well,grow at some point?    Bryant seems to realize that these chickens could soon be coming home to roost. So far, in the second quarter, we have seen nothing but Tesla slashing demand - of both its Model 3 in China and its Model Y. This would indicate to use that the automaker may once again be having issues getting vehicles out the door. Here is a snapshot of Tesla's total production and deliveries over the last 5 quarters, also showing unimpressive growth:    \"Tesla isn't growing all that much right now, which is hard to square with the massive jump in its share price.Revenuedeclined 5% year on year in the latest quarter.The pandemic will have taken a toll, but Tesla will only really start to merit its 'Big Tech'valuation once its top line starts firing again,\" the op-ed concludes.  Remind us to explain gamma squeezes to Bloomberg one of these days; maybe we can unravel the mystery of Tesla's \"massive jump\" in its share price.   Regardless, if Tesla is, in fact, having a demand problem - and regulatory credits dry up in Q2 while the financial mainstream starts to realize the ridiculous nature of the company's valuation - we could see a sharp move closer to reality, which for Tesla shares is probably closer to double digits than all time highs.

Carlson touted a proposal introduced by Senator Josh Hawley back in June. Per an NBC News report at the time[1]: Hawley's bill would change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides immunity for big tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter from liability for content posted by its users. </p><p>Under his legislation, titled the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, companies would have to earn immunity by submitting to Federal Trade Commission audits that prove their algorithms and content-removal practices are 'politically neutral.' One of the reasons there hasn't been action on this proposal, as well as calls to break up tech companies, Carlson said, is 'that conservative nonprofits here in Washington, the ones that are supposed to be looking out for you, aren't actually looking out for you.' Carlson cited a report on Google and the Koch network saying Google has given money to groups like the American Conservative Union and the Heritage Foundation. 'Big Tech companies silence conservatives. Conservatives' nonprofits try to prevent the government from doing anything about it,' he said. Regarding Heritage in particular \u2014'Half the conservatives in this city seem to have worked there at one time or another, almost 30 years ago I did for example' \u2014 Carslon said, 'To this day there are nice and well-meaning people at Heritage. But as an organization, Heritage no longer represents the interests of conservatives. At least on the question of tech.' He cited a recent Heritage piece titled 'Free Enterprise Is the Best Remedy for Online Bias Concerns'[2] that criticized Hawley and said the following: Even if systemic bias were conclusive, the fact is that these private companies have the right to moderate content according to standards of their own choosing. That does not mean that conservatives have no recourse. Indeed, conservatives have countered left-wing media privilege in the past without regulation. Deregulation, in fact, benefits the underdogs. In the present circumstances, the better response to bias concerns is not government speech controls, but empowering consumers, investors, and competitors to create alternatives, punish misdeeds, and reward excellence. In contrast, S. 1914, if enacted, would yield more harm than benefit, and would violate fundamental conservative principles. 'Heritage isn't embarrassed. None of the so-called conservative nonprofits in Washington are embarrassed. They make deals with people who hate you. They secretly sell out your interests, then they beg you to tithe like it's the medieval church,' Carlson said. You can watch above, via Fox News. Have a tip we should know?

He and his guest, attorney Harmeet Dhillon, who serves on President Donald Trump's 2020 advisory council, agreed that free speech to debate is critical during a time like this.Dhillon observed that Twitter was 'censoring people for reporting that a drug that had been approved by the FDA is a hopeful alternative to suffering and dying from this disease.'She also noted that Twitter has allowed the Chinese government to spread 'absolute gaslight propaganda about this disease originating not in Wuhan where we all know that it did but actually by the United States military bringing it to China. Thats A-OK in Twitter's worldview.'Twitter announced[2] that the platform is 'expanding our safety rules to include content that could place people at a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19' on March 18. The platform said that it would restrict content that 'increases the chance that someone contracts or transmits the virus.'Carlson acknowledged that while hydroxychloroquine[3], a drug used to treat malaria, is still being examined, 'some doctors and researchers on the front lines think it works, and they are treating patients with it right now. </p><p>The FDA just approved it. Yet because the media are partisan and stupid, their position is hydroxychloroquine doesn't work and could never work, and if you disagree with that, we'll make you shut up.'The FDA issued[4] on March 28, 2020, 'an EUA [Emergency Use Authorization] to allow hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and used for certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19.'Twitter has allowed[5] Chinese government officials to point a finger at the United States for the Wuhan virus on the platform. Lijian Zhao, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, for example, speculated[6] in a tweet: 'It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.'Brazillian President Jair Bolsonaro appears to have not gotten the same level of protection from Twitter. The platform 'took down two tweets from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, citing its policy against misinformation related to the Chinese coronavirus,' reported Breitbart[7].Tucker, who has cautioned before that the virus is not to be taken lightly[8], still defended Bolsonaro's right to ask questions concerning the drug:'Now, of course, Bolsonaro could be completely wrong about that. He might also be completely right. We don't know. Nobody does. But Big Tech does not believe you should be allowed to think about this.'Tucker elaborated that advice from institutions has been suspect in recent months, from the U.S. Government 'telling you that masks don't protect the public from coronavirus' to the World Health Organization telling citizens 'that China had determined that the virus couldn't be spread from person-to-person.'Why is Twitter allowing this double-standard? Dhillon says to follow the money. 'The answer is big dollar signs,' she said. 'These companies are desperate to break into China' she observed, before adding 'these American corporations want to -- they're globalist, they're pushing a globalist agenda, and they want to make sure that when the time comes for China to be open to them, they aren't on the wrong side of China's propaganda arm in the Chinese government.'Twitter and other Big Tech companies' actions on this 'could have health consequences,' she warned.

But Big Tech does not believe you should be allowed to think about this.'Tucker elaborated that advice from institutions has been suspect in recent months, from the U.S. Government 'telling you that masks don't protect the public from coronavirus' to the World Health Organization telling citizens 'that China had determined that the virus couldn't be spread from person-to-person.'Why is Twitter allowing this double-standard? Dhillon says to follow the money. 'The answer is big dollar signs,' she said. 'These companies are desperate to break into China' she observed, before adding 'these American corporations want to -- they're globalist, they're pushing a globalist agenda, and they want to make sure that when the time comes for China to be open to them, they aren't on the wrong side of China's propaganda arm in the Chinese government.'Twitter and other Big Tech companies' actions on this 'could have health consequences,' she warned.

In a clarifying debate last weekend, Tucker Carlson argued that laissez-faire doesn't guarantee fair.In his appearance at the Student Action Summit on December 22nd, Carlson engaged in a vigorous but respectful debate with TurningPointUSA founder Charlie Kirk. </p><p>They sparred on subjects such as the role of Big Tech Companies in the free market and the ideological tactics of conservatives should embrace in the digital age.Carlson has brought up these issues previously on his own show, and reiterated how he came to his new viewpoint, 'Every morning you wake up and there's someone else who's been kicked off and deplatformed and the companies say, 'You can't say that in public, and by the way, you can't make a living anymore' ... PayPal is not gonna do business with you, what does that mean in the digital age? It means you're outta work.'As he sparred with Kirk over traditional conservative distrust of government regulation and the changing nature of politics, Carlson asserted that many conservatives are following the letter of old laws while ignoring the actual principles they were trying to defend.'You've been brainwashed by a small number of dumb idealogues in DC,' he said, 'into believing what matters is the theory, above all, whether it screws you or not. And what you need to retrain your brain to understand is that what matters is your life, and the life of your family.' This applies to the debate over whether tech companies should face some sort of legislation by government in order to protect America's defining value of free speech.Companies, Carlson stated, can pose a greater threat to personal freedoms and privacy than government: Really simple question, who has more technological power, Google or the US government? It's not even close. Who knows more about you, Google or the Social Security administration? Not even close. Who is actually likely to suppress your ability to say and think what you want or prevent you from getting a job, Google or the US government? It's not even close. While Kirk proclaimed the value of the free market, Carlson repeatedly challenged the idea that the free market is enough to guarantee protection of our personal freedoms. 'If you have a monopoly like Google which wields more power than any organization has ever wielded in the history of the world,' he said, 'where all human information in english flows through this tiny portal that's totally opaque -- we have no idea what the metrics are to sort this information -- if you have a company like that and you like at that and you're like, 'That's the free market at work' I'm not for the free market.' </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NBST107778154663969480325176500125</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V48-CM61-F03R-N533-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><timeReceived>10:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In a clarifying debate last weekend, Tucker Carlson argued that laissez-faire doesn't guarantee fair.In his appearance at the Student Action Summit on December 22nd, Carlson engaged in a vigorous but respectful debate with TurningPointUSA founder Charlie Kirk. </p><p>They sparred on subjects such as the role of Big Tech Companies in the free market and the ideological tactics of conservatives should embrace in the digital age.Carlson has brought up these issues previously on his own show, and reiterated how he came to his new viewpoint, 'Every morning you wake up and there's someone else who's been kicked off and deplatformed and the companies say, 'You can't say that in public, and by the way, you can't make a living anymore' ... PayPal is not gonna do business with you, what does that mean in the digital age? It means you're outta work.'As he sparred with Kirk over traditional conservative distrust of government regulation and the changing nature of politics, Carlson asserted that many conservatives are following the letter of old laws while ignoring the actual principles they were trying to defend.'You've been brainwashed by a small number of dumb idealogues in DC,' he said, 'into believing what matters is the theory, above all, whether it screws you or not. And what you need to retrain your brain to understand is that what matters is your life, and the life of your family.' This applies to the debate over whether tech companies should face some sort of legislation by government in order to protect America's defining value of free speech.Companies, Carlson stated, can pose a greater threat to personal freedoms and privacy than government: Really simple question, who has more technological power, Google or the US government? It's not even close. Who knows more about you, Google or the Social Security administration? Not even close. Who is actually likely to suppress your ability to say and think what you want or prevent you from getting a job, Google or the US government? It's not even close. While Kirk proclaimed the value of the free market, Carlson repeatedly challenged the idea that the free market is enough to guarantee protection of our personal freedoms. 'If you have a monopoly like Google which wields more power than any organization has ever wielded in the history of the world,' he said, 'where all human information in english flows through this tiny portal that's totally opaque -- we have no idea what the metrics are to sort this information -- if you have a company like that and you like at that and you're like, 'That's the free market at work' I'm not for the free market.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-NBST107778154663969480325176500125</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V48-CY61-DXKX-03N2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><timeReceived>10:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
