The new device packs more computing power and a sharper screen than its predecessor, and is also US$100 cheaper.    [embedded content]     The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest step in Facebook\u2019s long-term strategy of making VR more accessible and popular. Facebook recently brought all its VR work under the umbrella of Facebook Reality Labs , it has announced new applications like the Infinite Office VR workplace , and will also require a Facebook login for future Oculus devices.    The compulsory link to Facebook has many consumers concerned, considering the social media giant\u2019s chequered history with privacy and data . VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are perhaps the most data-extractive digital sensors we\u2019re likely to invite into our homes in the next decade.   Why does Facebook make virtual reality headsets?   Facebook acquired VR company Oculus in 2014 for an estimated US$2.3 billion . But where Oculus originally aimed at gamers, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wants VR for social media.    At the same event last year, Zuckerberg said Facebook sees VR as a pathway to a new kind of \u201csocial computing platform\u201d using the enhanced feeling of \u201cpresence\u201d that VR affords. For Facebook, the introduction of VR-based computing will be like the leap from text-based command line interfaces to the graphical user interfaces we use today.    This may well be right. VR affords a strong feeling of embodied presence that offers new possibilities for entertainment, training, learning and connecting with others at a distance.    But if the VR future is the one Facebook is \u201c working in the lab \u201d on, it will function via the company\u2019s existing social computing platform and business model of extracting data to deliver targeted advertisements.   Virtual reality collects real data   A VR headset collects data about the user, but also about the outside world. This is one of the key ethical issues of emerging \u201cmixed reality\u201d technologies.    As AmericanVR researcher Jeremy Bailenson has written :     \u2026commercial VR systems typically track body movements 90 times per second to display the scene appropriately, and high-end systems record 18 types of movements across the head and hands. Consequently, spending 20 minutes in a VR simulation leaves just under 2 million unique recordings of body language.     The way you move your body can be used to identify you , like a fingerprint, so everything you do in VR could be traced back to your individual identity.    Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest headsets also use outward-facing cameras to track and map their surroundings.    [embedded content]     In late 2019 Facebook said they \u201cdon\u2019t collect and store images or 3D maps of your environment on our servers today\u201d. Note the word today , which tech journalist Ben Lang notes makes clear the company is not ruling out anything in the future.   Virtual reality leads to augmented reality   Facebook wants to collect this data to facilitate its plans for augmented reality (AR).    Where VR takes a user to a fully virtual environment, AR combines virtual elements with our real surroundings.    Last year Facebook unveiled the Live Maps application, a vision of an expansive surveillance apparatus presumably powered by AR glasses and data collected from Oculus Insight. Live Maps will provide many minor conveniences for Facebook users, like letting you know you\u2019ve left your keys on the coffee table.    [embedded content]     Now Facebook have announced their first steps towards making this a reality: Project Aria . This will involve people wearing glasses-like sensors around Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area, to collect the data to build what Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly calls \u201cthe mirrorworld \u201d, the next big tech platform.      People are rightly concerned about the ethical implications of this kind of data extraction. Alongside Project Aria, Facebook launched its Responsible Innovation Principles page, and they\u2019re already quick to emphasise that faces and license plates will be blurred in this data collection.    As we have argued elsewhere , framing questions about VR and AR surveillance in terms of individual privacy suits companies like Facebook very well. That\u2019s because their previous failings are actually in the (un)ethical use of data (as in the case of Cambridge Analytica ) and their asymmetric platform power .     We need more than just \u2018tech ethics\u2019   Groups like the XR Safety Initiative recognise these emerging issues, and are beginning work on standards, guidelines and privacy frameworks to shape VR and AR development.    Many emerging technologies encounter what is known as the Collingridge problem : it is hard to predict the various impacts of a technology until it is extensively developed and widely used, but by then it is almost impossible to control or change.    We see this playing out right now, in efforts to regulate Google and Facebook\u2019s power over news media .    As David Watts argues, big tech designs its own rules of ethics to avoid scrutiny and accountability :     Feelgood, high-level data ethics principles are not fit for the purpose of regulating big tech \u2026 The harms linked to big tech can only be addressed by proper regulation.     What might regulation of Facebook\u2019s VR look like? Germany offers one such response \u2013 their antitrust regulations have resulted in Facebook withdrawing the headset from sale . We can only hope the technology doesn\u2019t become too entrenched to be changed, or challenged.    But regulation has not always stopped Facebook in the past, who paid out US$550 million to settle a lawsuit for breaching biometric privacy laws. In the multi-billion dollar world of big-tech, it\u2019s all a cost of doing business.    Another question we might ask ourselves is whether Facebook\u2019s virtual-reality future and others like it really need to exist. Maybe there are other ways to avoid forgetting your keys.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43104049948</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W0-0T31-F07F-81TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Conversation AU</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 18, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The new device packs more computing power and a sharper screen than its predecessor, and is also US$100 cheaper.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>In the video above, Facebook's Oculus Quest 2 (from AUD$479) - a powerful wireless VR headset for gaming and, Facebook hopes, much more.<br/>The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest step in Facebook's long-term strategy of making VR more accessible and popular. Facebook recently brought all its VR work under the umbrella of Facebook Reality Labs, it has announced new applications like the Infinite Office VR workplace, and will also require a Facebook login for future Oculus devices.<br/>From Amsterdam to the worldWe're taking our flagship tech event online - and you can attend for free<br/>TELL ME MORE<br/>The compulsory link to Facebook has many consumers concerned, considering the social media giant's chequered history with privacy and data. VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are perhaps the most data-extractive digital sensors we're likely to invite into our homes in the next decade.<br/>[Read: Are EVs too expensive? Here are 5 common myths, debunked]<br/>Why does Facebook make virtual reality headsets?Facebook acquired VR company Oculus in 2014 for an estimated US$2.3 billion. But where Oculus originally aimed at gamers, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wants VR for social media.<br/>At the same event last year, Zuckerberg said Facebook sees VR as a pathway to a new kind of \"social computing platform\" using the enhanced feeling of \"presence\" that VR affords. For Facebook, the introduction of VR-based computing will be like the leap from text-based command line interfaces to the graphical user interfaces we use today.<br/>This may well be right. VR affords a strong feeling of embodied presence that offers new possibilities for entertainment, training, learning, and connecting with others at a distance.<br/>But if the VR future is the one Facebook is \"working in the lab\" on, it will function via the company's existing social computing platform and business model of extracting data to deliver targeted advertisements.<br/>Virtual reality collects real dataA VR headset collects data about the user, but also about the outside world. This is one of the key ethical issues of emerging \"mixed reality\" technologies.<br/>As AmericanVR researcher Jeremy Bailenson has written:<br/>...commercial VR systems typically track body movements 90 times per second to display the scene appropriately, and high-end systems record 18 types of movements across the head and hands. Consequently, spending 20 minutes in a VR simulation leaves just under 2 million unique recordings of body language.<br/>The way you move your body can be used to identify you, like a fingerprint, so everything you do in VR could be traced back to your individual identity.<br/>Facebook's Oculus Quest headsets also use outward-facing cameras to track and map their surroundings.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FacebookVR headsets use Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) to track the movements of the headset in 3D space. This is also another opportunity for collecting data about the world.<br/>In late 2019 Facebook said they \"don't collect and store images or 3D maps of your environment on our servers today.\" Note the word today, which tech journalist Ben Lang notes makes clear the company is not ruling out anything in the future.<br/>Virtual reality leads to augmented realityFacebook wants to collect this data to facilitate its plans for augmented reality (AR).<br/>Where VR takes a user to a fully virtual environment, AR combines virtual elements with our real surroundings.<br/>Last year Facebook unveiled the Live Maps application, a vision of an expansive surveillance apparatus presumably powered by AR glasses and data collected from Oculus Insight. Live Maps will provide many minor conveniences for Facebook users, like letting you know you've left your keys on the coffee table.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In the video above, Facebook's Live Maps application is a vision of a Facebook-owned AR platform.<br/>Now, Facebook has announced its first steps towards making this a reality: Project Aria. This will involve people wearing glasses-like sensors around Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area, to collect the data to build what Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly calls \"the mirrorworld,\" the next big tech platform.<br/>People are rightly concerned about the ethical implications of this kind of data extraction. Alongside Project Aria, Facebook launched its Responsible Innovation Principles page, and they're already quick to emphasize that faces and license plates will be blurred in this data collection.<br/>As we have argued elsewhere, framing questions about VR and AR surveillance in terms of individual privacy suits companies like Facebook very well. That's because their previous failings are actually in the (un)ethical use of data (as in the case of Cambridge Analytica) and their asymmetric platform power.<br/>We need more than just 'tech ethics'Groups like the XR Safety Initiative recognize these emerging issues and are beginning to work on standards, guidelines, and privacy frameworks to shape VR and AR development.<br/>Many emerging technologies encounter what is known as the Collingridge problem: it is hard to predict the various impacts of a technology until it is extensively developed and widely used, but by then it is almost impossible to control or change.<br/>We see this playing out right now, in efforts to regulate Google and Facebook's power over news media.<br/>As David Watts argues, big tech designs its own rules of ethics to avoid scrutiny and accountability:<br/>Feelgood, high-level data ethics principles are not fit for the purpose of regulating big tech ... The harms linked to big tech can only be addressed by proper regulation.<br/>What might the regulation of Facebook's VR look like? Germany offers one such response - their antitrust regulations have resulted in Facebook withdrawing the headset from sale. We can only hope the technology doesn't become too entrenched to be changed or challenged.<br/>But regulation has not always stopped Facebook in the past, who paid out US$550 million to settle a lawsuit for breaching biometric privacy laws. In the multi-billion dollar world of big-tech, it's all a cost of doing business.<br/>Another question we might ask ourselves is whether Facebook's virtual-reality future and others like it really need to exist. Maybe there are other ways to avoid forgetting your keys.<br/>So you like TNW?

The new device packs more computing power and a sharper screen than its predecessor, and is also US$100 cheaper.[embedded content]In the video above, Facebook's Oculus Quest 2 (from AUD$479) \u2014 a powerful wireless VR headset for gaming and, Facebook hopes, much more. The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest step in Facebook's long-term strategy of making VR more accessible and popular. Facebook recently brought all its VR work under the umbrella of Facebook Reality Labs[3], it has announced new applications like the Infinite Office VR workplace[4], and will also require a Facebook login[5] for future Oculus devices. The compulsory link to Facebook has many consumers concerned, considering the social media giant's chequered history with privacy and data[6]. VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are perhaps the most data-extractive digital sensors we're likely to invite into our homes in the next decade. </p><p>[Read: Are EVs too expensive? Here are 5 common myths, debunked[7]]Why does Facebook make virtual reality headsets?Facebook acquired VR company Oculus in 2014 for an estimated US$2.3 billion[8]. But where Oculus originally aimed at gamers, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wants VR for social media. At the same event last year, Zuckerberg said Facebook sees VR as a pathway to a new kind of 'social computing platform' using the enhanced feeling of 'presence' that VR affords. For Facebook, the introduction of VR-based computing will be like the leap from text-based command line interfaces to the graphical user interfaces we use today. This may well be right. VR affords a strong feeling of embodied presence that offers new possibilities for entertainment, training, learning, and connecting with others at a distance. But if the VR future is the one Facebook is 'working in the lab[9]' on, it will function via the company's existing social computing platform and business model of extracting data to deliver targeted advertisements.Virtual reality collects real dataA VR headset collects data about the user, but also about the outside world. This is one of the key ethical issues[10] of emerging 'mixed reality' technologies. As AmericanVR researcher Jeremy Bailenson has written[11]: commercial VR systems typically track body movements 90 times per second to display the scene appropriately, and high-end systems record 18 types of movements across the head and hands. Consequently, spending 20 minutes in a VR simulation leaves just under 2 million unique recordings of body language. The way you move your body can be used to identify you[12], like a fingerprint, so everything you do in VR could be traced back to your individual identity. Facebook's Oculus Quest headsets also use outward-facing cameras to track and map their surroundings.[embedded content]FacebookVR headsets use Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) to track the movements of the headset in 3D space. This is also another opportunity for collecting data about the world. In late 2019 Facebook said[13] they 'don't collect and store images or 3D maps of your environment on our servers today.' Note the word today, which tech journalist Ben Lang notes[14] makes clear the company is not ruling out anything in the future.Virtual reality leads to augmented realityFacebook wants to collect this data to facilitate its plans for augmented reality (AR). Where VR takes a user to a fully virtual environment, AR combines virtual elements with our real surroundings. Last year Facebook unveiled the Live Maps application, a vision of an expansive surveillance apparatus presumably powered by AR glasses and data collected from Oculus Insight. Live Maps will provide many minor conveniences for Facebook users, like letting you know you've left your keys on the coffee table.[embedded content]In the video above, Facebook's Live Maps application is a vision of a Facebook-owned AR platform. Now, Facebook has announced its first steps towards making this a reality: Project Aria[15]. This will involve people wearing glasses-like sensors around Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area, to collect the data to build what Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly calls 'the mirrorworld[16],' the next big tech platform. People are rightly concerned about the ethical implications of this kind of data extraction. Alongside Project Aria, Facebook launched its Responsible Innovation Principles[17] page, and they're already quick to emphasize that faces and license plates will be blurred in this data collection. As we have argued elsewhere[18], framing questions about VR and AR surveillance in terms of individual privacy suits companies like Facebook very well. That's because their previous failings are actually in the (un)ethical use of data (as in the case of Cambridge Analytica[19]) and their asymmetric platform power[20].We need more than just 'tech ethics'Groups like the XR Safety Initiative[21] recognize these emerging issues and are beginning to work on standards, guidelines, and privacy frameworks[22] to shape VR and AR development. Many emerging technologies encounter what is known as the Collingridge problem[23]: it is hard to predict the various impacts of a technology until it is extensively developed and widely used, but by then it is almost impossible to control or change. We see this playing out right now, in efforts to regulate Google and Facebook's power over news media[24]. As David Watts argues, big tech designs its own rules of ethics to avoid scrutiny and accountability[25]: Feelgood, high-level data ethics principles are not fit for the purpose of regulating big tech The harms linked to big tech can only be addressed by proper regulation. What might the regulation of Facebook's VR look like? Germany offers one such response - their antitrust regulations have resulted in Facebook withdrawing the headset from sale[26]. We can only hope the technology doesn't become too entrenched to be changed or challenged. But regulation has not always stopped Facebook in the past, who paid out US$550 million[27] to settle a lawsuit for breaching biometric privacy laws. In the multi-billion dollar world of big-tech, it's all a cost of doing business. Another question we might ask ourselves is whether Facebook's virtual-reality future and others like it really need to exist. Maybe there are other ways to avoid forgetting your keys.

Coming to you live from New York, it is Wednesday, July 29th. I am Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Tonight, a historic grilling for the Titans of tech. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, they have all been gathered virtually, of course, because of the pandemic for the most important antitrust hearing in front of the U.S. Congress in more than two decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These executives represent 60 percent of the total market cap on the S&amp;P 500 combined. Their companies are worth nearly $5 trillion. Lawmakers allege they have become too vast and far too powerful and abused their positions to keep competition out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And now, the pandemic has worsened the role that they play in our society. Stock prices soared as work, retail, and social interactions has turned more online than ever before. In their opening remarks, each CEO insisted they do indeed face competition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: The retail market we participate in is extraordinarily large and competitive. Amazon accounts for less than one percent of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than four percent of U.S. retail. There is room in retail for multiple winners.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: Just as America's technology leadership is not inevitable. Google's continued success is not guaranteed. New competitors emerge every day and today, users have more access to information than ever before.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Many of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of users. Some are upstarts, but others are gate keepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their App Stores to compete with them.</p><p>In many areas, we are behind our competitors.</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: Companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built successful businesses with different approaches. We are okay with that.</p><p>Our goal is the best, not the most. In fact, we don't have a dominant share in any market or in any product category where we do business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: This is the biggest antitrust hearing since the days of Bill Gates and Microsoft 22 years ago. In the end, Microsoft settled with the U.S. government and was forced to change.</p><p>Today, some accuse America's most powerful tech CEOs of running monopolies once again.</p><p>Let's start Amazon. This is Jeff Bezos's first time in a hearing like this. Lawmakers are concerned that because Amazon both operates the marketplace and sells its own products in that same marketplace, it abuses the data it collects to root out any smaller competition.</p><p>Apple is the most valuable company in the world and it is new to this level of antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. The issue here is the App Store where Apple takes a 30 percent cut from sales. Some say that that's simply too high and Apple is abusing its position because it doesn't let other App Stores compete.</p><p>Google runs the world's most dominant search engine and sells the most online ads. Critics allege that its search results favors its own services like YouTube and Maps.</p><p>And Facebook has the smallest market cap of the four, but sits at the crux of many thorny political issues from an antitrust perspective, Facebook's aggressive acquisition strategy is under fire.</p><p>They talked a lot about Instagram during the hearing. After buying up that particular app and WhatsApp, lawmakers fear the data Facebook collects on billions of users allows it to quash rivals.</p><p>With me now, Nicholas Thompson is the editor-in-chief of \"Wired,\" Donie O'Sullivan follows this information, politics and tech for us here at CNN.</p><p>So Donie, let me start with you. How high was the stake here for these four CEOs? How well did they do?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, this is a huge day for them. Of course, we have seen before that Congress makes a lot of noise about regulating the tech industry, but sometimes hasn't delivered frankly.</p><p>I thought one of the most substantive items we have seen so far in this hearing that is still ongoing is this committee -- today's hearing is really just a part of a much wider, broader, months' long investigation by this committee, and as part of that, they have obtained documents from these companies.</p><p>And Mark Zuckerberg was asked by the Democratic representative, Jerry Nadler about internal Facebook communications from 2012. That's the year Facebook bought Instagram. And in those e-mails, Zuckerberg describes Instagram as being potentially very disruptive. And in another e-mail, another Facebook employee mentions neutralizing a potential competitor.</p><p>So Nadler's question to Zuckerberg was to say, you know, isn't this just an example of Facebook rather than competing fairly with a possible competitor that they just swallowed them up and that they just acquired them?</p><p>Zuckerberg of course pointed out that the F.T.C. at the time raised no objections to that acquisition.</p><p>So, I think we are going to see more of these internal communications not just from Facebook, but from other companies come out in the hours ahead which should be quite enlightening.</p><p>[15:05:28]</p><p>ASHER: Nicholas, obviously, there was some talk about conservative bias and misinformation. Donie, actually just brought up some questions asked by Jerry Nadler. Just wondering whether you thought, overall, we are only about an hour and a half into this hearing, but did you think that lawmakers -- when it comes to antitrust and competitive issues, are lawmakers asking the right questions?</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"WIRED\": No, they are not. I was pretty disappointed. I thought because this was a specific subcommittee, it's the antitrust subcommittee, they are writing a report on antitrust, I thought this hearing would very focused on the law. I thought it would be really focused on antitrust.</p><p>And instead, we have had diversions into hydroxychloroquine, we've had diversions into political bias. We have had a lot of talk about China, disagreements with China. Those are all tangential to antitrust, they are not at the core.</p><p>We have had some moments as was just described with Jerry Nadler where the representatives have asked about market power and abuse of market power. And in particular, the question with Instagram, which is do these companies have so much data, in fact so much secret data that they are able to identify and kill or crush competitors before those competitors even know how fast they are growing?</p><p>That is a huge question, and at the very least, we know from the Instagram documents that someone on the committee is on it, even if the others are asking about hydroxychloroquine or what else.</p><p>ASHER: Okay, and Donie, that question that Mark Zuckerberg had to field on the acquisition of Instagram and quashing competition, how good of a job did he do of answering that question, do you think?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Well, I mean, he brought up that the F.T.C. at the time approved it. But now the F.T.C. has a very different makeup and dynamic, so I think drawing attention to that may not have been the wisest move on Zuckerberg's part.</p><p>But to Nicholas's point, you know, I mean, I think we are going to see more and more sort of partisan questions as the evening continues here.</p><p>We are likely to hear from Republicans talking about perceived or alleged anti-conservative bias, and we are probably going to hear from Democrats asking Zuckerberg why he doesn't do more about Trump, how Trump uses his platform.</p><p>Zuckerberg did come out fighting, though, I thought, in his opening statements. He name checked several of his competitors, including YouTube, Apple, and TikTok, saying, you know, that in certain areas they have a bigger market share than Facebook has.</p><p>And one other interesting point, I thought, in Zuckerberg's written testimony was that he highlighted that Facebook was proudly an American company, which is worth remember -- you know, writing that in the context now of when we think about the Chinese-owned app, TikTok and the U.S. government and the Trump administration potentially considering banning that, and Facebook launching a TikTok competitor.</p><p>You know, all these thing are related and I think we might hear more questions about China.</p><p>ASHER: Nicholas, are these companies, just in your opinion, heavily guilty of abusing their on line dominance? And what do you expect? What sort of concrete changes do you hope or do you anticipate to come out of this hearing?</p><p>THOMPSON: Are they heavily guilty? I would say they are pretty guilty, more than moderately guilty, but maybe less than heavily guilty and it differs for each of them.</p><p>I do think Google is quite guilty of rejiggering its search results to favor its products. I think Amazon is very guilty, maybe even heavily guilty of identifying data from its marketplace and allowing itself to create competitive products.</p><p>I think Apple is very guilty of using its market power in the App Store for predatory pricing. I think Facebook is reasonably guilty of acquiring companies for the sole purpose of crushing them though actually, their antitrust violations at the moment are relatively minor.</p><p>So, there is a different spectrum of guiltiness. They are all pretty guilty.</p><p>ASHER: Okay, different shades of guilty.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Fifty shades of guilt. All right, Nicholas Thompson, live for us. I understand you are going to be joining us a little bit later on in the show. Donie, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: All right, the growth of these four companies during the pandemic has only heightened concerns about their competitive edge. The S&amp;P 500 is roughly even on the year. During the same time, Amazon's shares have risen about 60 percent. Apple is up closer to 30 percent, far behind Amazon, but well above the index.</p><p>Then we have Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google of course, both opened the day up some 13 percent on the year. We must also note the S&amp;P 500 includes the value of these tech giants.</p><p>[15:10:19]</p><p>ASHER: If you were to subtract them from the index, these margins would actually look much wider. Former F.T.C. Commissioner Mozelle Thompson joins us live now from Delaware.</p><p>So, Mozelle, let's just start with Amazon. During this pandemic, when people are obviously relying on the online marketplace much more, how has Amazon been able to use the pandemic to really strengthen their power even more, do you think?</p><p>MOZELLE THOMPSON, FORMER FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIONER: Well one thing -- there are a couple of things. One is that people are in isolation, so they are not going out to the grocery stores or shopping and if they need goods and services they -- Amazon is really easy to use. It's right in front of them and they have ramped up their delivery services so it makes it really easy to get those goods and services.</p><p>So that makes them extremely popular, and I have seen very little complaints about their delivery and access to goods, and even for producers and small companies and small businesses who wouldn't normally get access to consumers in the way that they are getting it right now -- so I actually think that Amazon has actually strengthened their position as providing important services to people.</p><p>ASHER: Our correspondent, Donie O'Sullivan was just talking about Jerry Nadler's question about Facebook buying up Instagram and how that really strengthened Facebook's sort of dominance in the marketplace for them. Will that practice -- that practice of these companies buying up their competition, buying up the likes of an Instagram or a WhatsApp, will that be much harder do you think, going forward?</p><p>M. THOMPSON: Well, it depends not necessarily on what the Congressman thinks, but what the regulators think and what the law enforcers think.</p><p>You know, acquihires are common throughout industry, but especially in technology. The idea of buying companies, including their talent is actually a pretty common fixture in the industry for decades.</p><p>I'm not sure if the comment that was made by Congressman Nadler means they really disapprove of that. And if so, I am not sure that that necessarily makes it easier for younger companies, younger upstarts, who actually acquire the kind of lift they need in order to get the attention to be in the marketplace.</p><p>The other thing, too, that I thought was interesting in his -- in the questions is this. It's not the fact that you thought that you had, under the law -- that they were a competitor. It's when you also thought that they had some sort of strategic advantage for you.</p><p>In the case of Instagram, the fact that they were involved in photo sharing, and that was a hot new issue, and that they thought they could acquire talent to essentially jump start photo sharing on their platform is pretty significant.</p><p>So it doesn't necessarily have to be that there is just this broad swath of eyeballs as competitors, it is whether they actually complimented the business aims that you had. That's the important law enforcement question there is there.</p><p>So, to the extent your prior commenters talked about well, that might have been a got-cha moment, I was truly struck at how it wasn't.</p><p>ASHER: Okay, and just talking about Apple, I mean, we are going to be talking about Apple a little bit later on in the show, but what does Apple -- one of the sort of big issues with Apple is how there is not a level playing field for app developers that are relying on its online store.</p><p>What does Apple need to do? What does Tim Cook need to do from this point forward to change that? To really make things fair for developers?</p><p>M. THOMPSON: Well, one of the problems here is that for app developers, anybody who has a platform, whether it is Android or whether it is Apple, they are going to extract a price or for that matter, if you want to be on an application on cable, you are going to have to have a price.</p><p>So none of those have been determined by any government to be essential services like a utility. Until that happens, then you are always going to be at some mercy of somebody else's platform to get eyeballs. I'm not sure whether Tim Cook is going to feel it necessary to be more transparent than Apple has been about what that means.</p><p>I think that that would be a good start.</p><p>ASHER: And it is a similar story for third-party sellers that are relying on the Amazon platform, of course. Because the fear is that Amazon can actually use data from third-party sellers to actually strengthen their own brands and compete unfairly.</p><p>M. THOMPSON: Well, one of the challenges you have is there is so much data out there now, whether it is -- that you don't necessarily have to get performance information from people on your platform. You can actually -- Amazon could sit down and buy that from Google advertisers. Okay?</p><p>[15:15:33]</p><p>M. THOMPSON: So that's the challenge. I think what would be helpful for Amazon is if -- if they are also a little bit more transparent about access to their own goods and services and how that competes with others so that it doesn't necessarily come up as the -- if you want a voice command hardware, that theirs doesn't come up first. I think that -- or at least a clearer understanding to the public of what that means.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Mozelle Thompson, we will have you in about 15 minutes, I believe. Thank you so much for joining us and we will have more coverage of the Big Tech hearing in Washington later on this hour looking into the antitrust accusations against Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google.</p><p>But first, the Fed has a warning about the U.S. economy as it announces its decision on interest rates. That's next.</p><p>ASHER: The Federal Reserve warns the U.S. economic recovery is under threat from resurgence of coronavirus. It just announced it is leaving interest rates unchanged, near zero.</p><p>Wall Street had been expecting the decision. Right now, the Dow is up triple digits on the news. The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell says the pace of recovery will heavily depend on government relief efforts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: We have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity.</p><p>For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit card and credit card use moved down since late June, while recent market indicators point to a slowing in job growth especially among smaller businesses.</p><p>A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: All right, let's bring in CNN's Paul La Monica. So, Paul, the Fed has announced that they are leaving interest rates unchanged. How long do we expect interest rates to remain at these low levels? What sort of concrete sign of recovery is the Fed waiting for before, you know, it changes course?</p><p>[15:20:10]</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I think the Fed, Zain, is going to be waiting for real evidence that the economy is going to hit bottom, and we are not going to get that any time soon. We are going to get a GDP number for the second quarter, the first estimate on that tomorrow morning and it is going to be brutally bad.</p><p>I mean expectations of about 35 percent contraction. The hope is that that is the worst of it, but as Chair Powell just talked about during this press conference, it was a sober realization of the fact that there are increasing cases of coronavirus in many states in the U.S. now, and I think we are not out of the woods yet.</p><p>So with that in mind, you have got to think the Fed is going to keep rates near zero through at least the rest of this year and 2021, and possibly even through 2022. This is going to be a very slow recovery that will take years and the Fed doesn't want to make the mistake of taking its foot off the gas with regards to stimulus before we have an actual recovery.</p><p>ASHER: Right, and so Fed Chair Jerome Powell also talked the travel sector just how that industry has been decimated by the coronavirus and the fact that there are lots of travel jobs that simply are not going to come back.</p><p>We've got earnings from Boeing and they reported a $2.4 billion quarterly loss and 65 percent dip in revenue from their commercial airlines unit. You and I both know that Boeing was already in dire straits before the pandemic. Now, what sort of future does it face?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, Boeing clearly has a lot of challenges that it needs to go through. The numbers were extremely bad, a worse than expected loss. Revenues plunging. You have concerns about orders drying up for Boeing jets.</p><p>And obviously, because of the issues related to safety with the 737 MAX, Boeing needs to be extremely careful before they can get those planes back in the air, but even if we get to a point where Boeing's safety issue aren't a concerns, as you point out, are people going to be traveling and flying anywhere in a meaningful way?</p><p>And that's probably not going to happen any time soon as long as we have COVID-19 as a major threat in the United States. So Boeing faces the challenges of a terrible economy, as well as its own self-inflicted wounds with the 737 MAX problems.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Paul La Monica live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>The head of Heathrow Airport is calling on the British government to create a new testing routine for passengers returning from high risk countries. The CEO, John Holland-Kaye says a system is needed to open up travel and boost the economy. Here is our Anna Stewart with more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: He described the U.K.'s current travel policy as a game of quarantine roulette. The CEO of Heathrow Airport is urging the government to allow for a coronavirus testing scheme to reduce the quarantine time imposed on these people traveling into the U.K. from countries deemed high risk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN HOLLAND-KAYE, CEO, HEATHROW AIRPORT: We can see that other countries have gone to other ways of doing this. They have started to -- France from the beginning of June were doing trials of testing on departure and on arrival and then they went down to a single test, but we are not calling for that here.</p><p>We are calling for a double test, once on arrival and the second after five days or eight days, where people would stay in quarantine until they had had two tests that showed that they didn't have the disease. And then they would be allowed out earlier than otherwise would be the case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: This proposal could reduce the quarantine period for those people who test negative on both tests from 14 days to just seven.</p><p>The dual testing scheme is designed to mitigate the risk that someone travels into the U.K., tests negative despite having caught the virus which could be in its incubation phase.</p><p>John Holland-Kaye told Sky News that Heathrow Airport could have a testing facility up and running within two weeks. However, it needs the cooperation of the U.K. government. He says the continued reliance on blanket quarantines and nationwide lockdowns could have a devastating impact on the aviation sector and the wider economy.</p><p>Anna Stewart, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: We will return to Washington in just a moment where four of the world's most powerful tech CEOs are taking antitrust questions from Congress. That's next.</p><p>[15:27:38]</p><p>ASHER: Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher. There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment when we will return to the Big Tech hearing in Washington discussing how lawmakers have been grilling the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet.</p><p>And the former Director of the C.D.C. says that the U.S. action on coronavirus was too little too late to prevent the outbreak.</p><p>Before that, though, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>The U.S. is soon expected to have 150,000 coronavirus deaths. The latest tally by Johns Hopkins University is just shy of that number. California just reported 197 COVID related deaths in a single day, that's a new daily record for that state.</p><p>U.S. Congressman Louie Gohmert tested positive for the coronavirus. The Texas Republican has often refused to wear a mask while on Capitol Hill. He was scheduled to accompany President Trump to Texas today on board Air Force One.</p><p>Oregon's Governor says Federal officers are leaving Portland. They have been involved in violent clashes with protestors there for several weeks. The Department of Homeland Security says it will remain a presence there until Federal property is no longer under threat.</p><p>The Chief Executive Carrie Lam is warning Hong Kong it is on the brink of a large scale coronavirus outbreak and people should remain home if all possible. The city's strictest lockdown measures so far begin today restricting gatherings to only two people and expanding mandatory mask wearing to include outdoor public places.</p><p>Back to our top story this hour. Some of the biggest tech CEOs in the U.S. appear before Congress for an antitrust hearing. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest of the four, but he has the most recent experience on Capitol Hill. That was apparent as he deflected accusations that he had broken competition laws by buying Instagram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I think with hindsight, it probably looks like obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious.</p><p>It was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed. The acquisition has done wildly well, Largely because -- not just because of the founder's talent, but because we invested.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Former FTC Commissioner Mozelle Thompson is back with us now. So, Mozelle, is it true that Instagram may not have succeeded if it wasn't for Facebook?</p><p>MOZELLE THOMPSON, FORMER COMMISSIONER, FTC: I can't predict that. But I do think that Facebook had a significant role in making Instagram what it is, not only in terms of scalability, but also economic investment. And also, with personnel, people who they hire to bring in to essentially make Instagram big and more prominent. So, there are substantial investment. And there's no question, to me, that there's some synergies involved, because Facebook new (AUDIO GAP) as it did it already, and that DNA is also going over to Instagram to make them more successful.</p><p>ASHER: So, Facebook obviously owns Instagram and WhatsApp as well. Basically, has completely neutralized competition. About 3 billion people use at least a company that Facebook owns. Facebook or a company that owns every single month. TikTok has about 800 million monthly users. Twitter and Snapchat, or Snap, the parent company, about 200 million. What needs to change for Facebook's dominance to shrink slightly? What needs to change to make the landscape that much more fairer?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, I think one thing is that if consumers feel that they're not getting value out of using the platform, so the products that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp offers. And whether there's another company that provides things that might be of greater value. TikTok is growing really fast. And don't forget, these are also platforms that are not available in China. So, that they have their own homegrown network works. So, there's still a lot of competition out there.</p><p>And -- but I do think that what you hear a little bit in the -- in the congressmen questions today is there are some people who believe that big, by its very nature, is bad. And some who are going back, drilling down to the question of, well, are consumers better off or not? I would like to hear a little bit more about that discussion, but I'm not sure that a format like this is designed to really produce that kind of information.</p><p>ASHER: OK. So, what questions should lawmakers be asking of Facebook when it comes to competition and antitrust?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, one of the things for Facebook, I think, is to sit down and think about how are they going to provide their customers with service if they say that they want -- if Facebook says that consumers don't like the information they're getting, how can they get better info information from people posting on Facebook? How does that actually happen? So, that it's not just bad news or faulty news, but better news and better quality news. That's a very interesting question. And Facebook is taking a hands off of everything. Then, the question is, is does Facebook become a platform for only the most shrilled voices, in which case, it will become less valuable for the majority of people who use it?</p><p>ASHER: We are heading in, of course, the 2020 election season, have less than 100 days to go. Just in terms of misinformation because that's obviously a topic of the day because there were a lot of concerns, of course, in 2016. How much progress has Facebook made this time around compared to 2016 in terms of tackling misinformation, and what do they need to do to restore people's trust in this country?</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, I think that they've -- Mark Zuckerberg talked a bit about that about hiring 30,000 people and putting a lot more money into artificial intelligence to determine fake news, or manipulated systems for news. I don't think that as long as you have a platform, I don't care whether it's the newspaper or the radio, or for that matter, social media, which moves even faster, that you can have a totally perfect system. But you also have -- you also have the other side of the equation, too. What you see is a split within Congress. Some people who don't like the fact that Facebook is going through and looking for these things and perhaps censoring or acting as a gatekeeper. And some who believes that they should be more aggressive in being a gatekeeper. There's not a consensus on that in the United States.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Mozelle Thompson live for us there, thank you so much, appreciate it. A few companies have prospered through the COVID-19 pandemic quite like Amazon. It's helped solidify CEO Jeff Bezos as the world's richest man. He argued today that his company is not the dominant power it seems. Asked about company policy on using third-party data, Bezos had this heated exchange.</p><p>[15:35:13]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: It's a voluntary policy. As far as I'm aware, no other retailer --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, there's no -- so, there's no actual -- there's no actual enforcement --</p><p>BEZOS: -- at all. And I think we have --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's no actual enforcement of that policy?</p><p>BEZOS: Oh, no, they -- I was going to --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, it's voluntary and there's no actual enforcement. So, maybe that answers my --</p><p>BEZOS: No, no, no. Sorry. No, I think -- I think I may have misspoke. I'm trying to say that Amazon is -- the fact that we have such a policy is voluntary. I think no other retailer even has such a policy. Our enforcement of that policy, we would treat that like any internal policy. And if we found that someone violated it, we would take action against them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: OK. So, some confusion there in terms of that question and how he answered. Clare Sebastian is joining us live now from New York. So, Clare, there are a lot of people in this country don't even know what Jeff Bezos' voice sounds like. He's certainly never appeared before Congress before. How well did he do, do you think, so far, because it's still ongoing?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Still ongoing. Zain, so far, he's only had two rounds of questioning. It took an hour and 57 minutes for him to get the first one. He was the very last of the four CEOs to be questioned. You know, he was -- he was a little halting, I'd say, a little hesitant. In some ways, perhaps you can tell that this is his first time testifying before Congress. But I did think that that exchange that you just played, which was longer than that, it was one of the most substantive parts of the hearing in all. Because he really did make some news. He said that while they do have this policy, that Amazon cannot use third-party seller data -- by the way, third-party sellers make up more than half of the sales on their platform. They can't use data from those sellers to inform their own private label brands, which now, of course, compete with third-party sellers.</p><p>He said, while that policy exists, he cannot guarantee it's never been violated. He said, of course, you know, if they do find a violation, they will act on it, but he couldn't guarantee that hadn't happened. And this is a very well-briefed committee there. The Congresswoman who was interviewing him and they said that they had spoken to former Amazon employees who had said that they knew of instances where this had happened, and there was a Wall Street Journal investigation on this. So, I thought it was interesting that he didn't have, you know, a concrete answer on whether there had been violations and that he admitted that there might have been, even though Amazon, by the way, is reportedly being investigated on this matter by two U.S. states and the European Union. And so, that was a crucial exchange.</p><p>ASHER: And on top of that, Clare, a lot of third-party sellers have said that their profits have actually shrunk. So, aside from the misuse of their data, their profits have actually shrunk because they end up spending a lot of money and giving a lot of money to Amazon to spend on things like fulfillment, on advertising, that sort of thing, which actually, they say is essential to be able to compete on Amazon on that platform. So, how does Jeff Bezos defend that?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, he hasn't been asked specifically about that yet, but I will say, Zain, from my own reporting on this matter, you're absolutely correct. There are a lot of strings attached that go with selling on Amazon. And there have been problems. And I've reported on issues with counterfeits on the platform in the past, and even companies that have experienced real problems with their products being copied by other sellers illegally. It still say they can't afford not to be on the platform. And this gets to another sort of part of the antitrust argument around Amazon.</p><p>They have argued today, Jeff Bezos, in his opening statement, he said that they're only about one percent of the overall global retail market. But according to e-marketer, they're expected to get 38 percent of the online retail market this year. Their closest competitor, Walmart, is less than six percent. So, you can really see that under those circumstances when you have the number of eyeballs that you have on Amazon, it's kind of hard not to be there. And that gives Amazon a whole lot of power. And that's what I think that the Congress is trying to get out today.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Clare Sebastian live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Google like Facebook dominates a significant portion of the online ad market as well as search. Earlier, CEO Sundar Pichai was asked whether Google is misusing its position on the web from a privacy perspective.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Did Google ever use its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: Congressman, just like other businesses, we try to understand trends from, you know, data, which we can see, and we use it to improve our products for our users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Apple, meantime, has been accused of abusing its power of its App Store by charging certain developers commissions of up to 30 percent. Speaking earlier, CEO Tim Cook said, Apple does not have any monopoly in any market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: We don't have a dominant share in any market or in any product category where we do business. If Apple is a gatekeeper, what we've done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the store, not keep them off.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:40:01]</p><p>ASHER: Nicholas Thompson is editor in chief of Wired. He joins me live now from New York via Skype. So, you heard Tim Cook there say, Listen, if Apple is a gatekeeper, all we've done is open the gate wider. We don't have any monopoly. Is that true?</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, WIRED (via Skype): It's partially true of the four companies out there, it is the hardest to make the claim that Apple has a specific monopoly. However, it very clearly has a duopoly with Google on the most important platform in the world, which is phone operating systems. And this gets to the heart of the App Store question. Tim Cook said, Oh, we compete with lots of app stores. We compete with PlayStation and Xbox. But really, there are two. There's the Google Play Store, and there's Apple's App Store. And so, they can have predatory pricing there without fear of competition.</p><p>ASHER: So, Apple's argument, as well, just the way that they have traditionally defended themselves is that, you know, we only have 15 percent of the global market when it comes to smartphone. So, we're not dominant in that sense. Yes, we are more dominant in the U.S. But globally, it's only 15 percent. Is that a fair and valid argument in all of this?</p><p>N. THOMPSON: It is a fair and valid argument and it's also a massively incomplete. What's so interesting is when you watch all of these tech CEOs, the argument they make in this congressional hearing is consistently, oh, we're tiny. We're threatened by everybody. And then, you watch them in non- congressional settings. There's just a reference to a presentation that Sheryl Sandberg made to her board, where she said, Oh, we are the absolute dominant company. We're the only place that's going to get your money. So, what's clear is that, in this hearing, they are dialing back. They are recasting the statistics in the way to make them seem meek and small, which is completely different from truth of the situation.</p><p>ASHER: So, in terms of Google, obviously, Sundar Pichai is there in the hot seat. A lot of people believe that Google has used its search engine dominance to sort of gear people towards its products. For example, YouTube. Have lawmakers done a good job of asking the right questions of Pichai in all of this?</p><p>N. THOMPSON: No, I've been most disappointed with the questions to Pichai. They have been tinged with all these strange allegations about Communist China and Google abandoning the U.S. military. The questions to him have been the most random and the most off topic. There's been a couple of moments where Congresspeople have actually pushed on the things that matter. Because Google use its dominant search position to advantage its other products, but not enough and not in a repeated way, that would actually get us new information or get us closer to real answers.</p><p>ASHER: OK. So, the questions, you haven't been wowed by the questions, but in terms of Pichai's actual answers, has he done a good job of defending his company?</p><p>N. THOMPSON: You know, Pichai's strategy has been to ask for more time to say he'll follow up. And then, to give, you know, vague statements saying their company does have values, it does adhere to standards. It does have lots of competitors. I have seen no answers of Pichai's that I was terribly impressed with. So, unfortunately, I was hoping for a hearing where there were great questions and great answers. And I haven't seen either yet.</p><p>ASHER: You walked away disappointed. Nicholas Thompson, we have to leave it there. The hearing is still ongoing, I believe. Hopefully, I'll just have to catch up.</p><p>N. THOMPSON: But I'm very happy with your question.</p><p>ASHER: Good. I like to hear that. Thank you so much. Nicholas, good to have you on the program. All right. When we return, the former U.S. Surgeon General and ex-head of the CDC, David Satcher, joins me to discuss the U.S. response to COVID, and the race for a vaccine, that's next.</p><p>ASHER: Shares of Kodak are skyrocketing for a second day after a massive government loan helped breathe new life into the former film giant. The stock is up around 400 percent. Yes, that is right, 400 percent after rising 200 percent yesterday. President Trump is granting Kodak a $765 million loan under the Defense Production Act. That will help it ramp up production on pharmaceutical reducing America's dependency on foreign drug makers. Kodak CEO spoke earlier today to our Julia Chatterley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM CONTINENZA, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, KODAK: We're in this business just not in a large way. And this is a chance for us to expand. And then, when you look at Eastman Business Park, we have 1200 acres, we have several facilities, what we'll be putting into this entity, as we build out that will help lower the cost. We have our own power, steam, rail, waste treatment, chemical treatment. It's just, you know, utilizing the part which lowers the cost greatly, and it's doing something that's in our DNA, we've been doing for 100 years.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: The White House Chief Advisor, Peter Navarro, said, by the time this thing ramps up, 25 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for generics we need in the United States are going to be going to be right at this facility. That's incredible. How quickly can you do that?</p><p>CONTINENZA: Well, it takes about three years to build out. We proximate three to 3-1/2 years. But during this time, we'll still be manufacturing. We'll be manufacturing in batch manufacturing, moving to continuous manufacturing. So, it'll be a combination of two items.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And where do you see the biggest bottlenecks?</p><p>CONTINENZA: You know, again, it'll be in the build out when we transition over from the batch to the continuous. That'll probably be our biggest bottleneck. But we're prepared for it. And then from there, we'll innovate and continue to get more efficiencies out of it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, there are a number of companies in the United States that perhaps could have handled this, too. What about your relationship with the U.S. administration, why do you think they specifically came to you guys, and said, Look, we're going to rely on you to build this out?</p><p>CONTINENZA: OK, and I think we're the best position to do it. Again, find another company has been with chemicals for over 100 years, and has the facilities sitting there, ready to go, and is doing it today? I would say we're probably the best suited. I know they looked at several. We weren't the only one, I can guarantee that. And you'd have to, you know, again, you heard Dr. Navarro yesterday, Navarro yesterday state, you know, how they made this decision. They looked at others and we are most suited, invested to do this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: The CEO of Kodak there. Now, Russia is sprinting to the finish line in the global race for a vaccine and the scientific shortcuts. Moscow is taking to get there first. We'll explain it all. Next.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>ASHER: Russia says it plans to approve the world's first COVID vaccine in less than two weeks. But experts are warning that a safe and effective vaccine is still far, far off. And many are concerned a push from the Kremlin to be first means that corners were cut. CNN's Matthew Chance has this exclusive report from Moscow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russian officials are calling it a Sputnik moment, a technological leap like the unexpected launch into space of the first satellite back in the 1950s. And now, Russian officials say it's the Coronavirus vaccine that's being launched into the global pandemic to highlight Russian scientific achievement. And this is the clearest indication we've had yet as to when that Russian vaccine will be approved for use. Russian officials telling CNN, they're working towards the date of August the 10th, perhaps even earlier, extraordinarily quick, partly according to Russian officials because the technology they're using, they've used successfully in the past on other vaccines, but also undeniably because human trials would still be incomplete when the vaccine is approved.</p><p>Russian officials tell CNN that third phase human trials would be conducted only in parallel with the vaccination of front line medical workers, risky, of course, but given the acute Coronavirus problem in Russia, which is the fourth highest number of infections in the world, it's apparently a risk that the authorities here are willing to take. Now, there is, of course, enormous skepticism around the world about the effectiveness and the safety of this Russian vaccine.</p><p>Russia -- critics say Russia's push for it comes amid political pressure from the Kremlin and allegations that Russian spies hacked U.S. Canadian and British labs for vaccine secrets. Also, no test data has been released by Russia so far. But Russian officials now tell me that that data will be made available for publication and peer review early next month, which will undoubtedly attract a great deal of international scrutiny. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: All right. Back to our top story of the hour, the tech hearings in Washington are still ongoing. Four of the world's biggest tech CEOs are being grilled, as I speak. Let's get a final word now from Nicholas Thompson, editor in chief of Wired. He is back with us from Bovina, New York. So, Nicholas, what changes going forward, what concrete difference do you anticipate these hearings will make?</p><p>OK. It looks as though we are having trouble with Nicholas's audio. He was about to tell me what sort of concrete changes we anticipate these hearings will make that are happening right now in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, we only have five minutes left of the show, so we don't have time to go back to him. But we are going to go for a quick break, and we'll be back on the other side of this.</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>ASHER: All right, it is the last few minutes of trade on Wall Street. Let's take a look and see how the numbers are doing right now. As I mentioned earlier in the show, several times the heads of the world's biggest tech companies are testifying in antitrust hearings before Congress that is actually pushing tech stocks higher. You can see the Dow is up about 150 points, partly lifted by the Federal Reserve coming out and saying that they anticipate interest rates will be kept near zero for the foreseeable future. That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Zain Asher. \"THE LEAD,\" with my colleague, Jake Tapper, is next.

Zuckerberg called for a new type of big tech regulator as he lobbied the EU officials who have become the world''s top enforcers on big tech.The founder of the world''s biggest social network, which also owns Instagram and Whatsapp, came to EU headquarters as Brussels prepares to unveil a highly anticipated strategy to regulate artificial intelligence.Zuckerberg''s visit comes on the heels of similar meetings by Google boss Sundar Pichai, who in January called on Brussels to tread carefully in regulating artificial intelligence.But in a document released to reporters about Mark Zuckerberg''s meeting, Facebook emphasised the importance of better controlling hate speech and disinformation on platforms \u2014 all without muzzling free speech.This was the topic he was going to raise with European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova, a top Brussels official who became an outspoken critic of Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018.Jourova, an EU spokesman said, \"intends to raise issues related to the protection of democracy and fundamental rights, free and fair elections, the fight against disinformation, including the transparency of political advertising\".The Facebook paper stressed that the way to limit unwanted speech was to make sure that platforms put systems in place to fight it, not by holding them liable for the speech itself.\"Publisher liability laws that punish the publication of illegal speech are unsuitable for the internet landscape,\" the paper said.Online content \"may require a new type of regulator\", Facebook said.Facebook is fighting on several fronts in Europe. </p><p>It currently faces several probes with European data protection agencies and the EU executive is looking more deeply into possible anti-trust problems on data use.Zuckerberg also met with European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager and Commissioner Thierry Breton who are in charge of designing the EU''s stance on AI.Their proposal, due on Wednesday, was expected to pursue a \"risk-based\" approach to assessing AI similar to how Europe approaches food safety concerns, such as GMOs and certain chemicals.Vestager has told reporters she would back away from a ban on facial recognition technology and instead ask companies and authorities to think hard before deploying it.MENAFN2002202000280000ID1099736372</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It currently faces several probes with European data protection agencies and the EU executive is looking more deeply into possible anti-trust problems on data use.Zuckerberg also met with European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager and Commissioner Thierry Breton who are in charge of designing the EU's stance on AI.Their proposal, due on Wednesday, was expected to pursue a \"risk-based\" approach to assessing AI similar to how Europe approaches food safety concerns, such as GMOs and certain chemicals.Vestager has told reporters she would back away from a ban on facial recognition technology and instead ask companies and authorities to think hard before deploying it. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767158196154857425876100241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7C-6YF1-JCMN-Y208-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"436\"/><timeReceived>5:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Recently, a slew of major companies, including the ones mentioned, dropped out amid concern and public criticism that the digital currency would affect national security and would enable money laundering and other financial crimes.</p><p>In his prepared remarks, Zuckerberg said the Libra project \"is not an attempt to create a sovereign currency. Like existing online payment systems, it's a way for people to transfer money.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg promised in the hearing, titled \"An examination of Facebook and its impact on the financial services and housing sectors,\" that the cryptocurrency project should quell regulatory concerns.</p><p>\"Of course, as a big company, we're not going to do something that's unregulated or decentralized, we are going to work with the government that gets to the same standard on anti-money laundering and CFT (counter-terrorism financing) that all of the other world-class payment systems have,\" he said during questioning.</p><p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized cryptocurrencies, and also directly denounced Facebook's Libra project, saying the strongest currency in the world will always be the U.S. dollar.</p><p>\"I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,\" Trump said on Twitter in July. \"Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>\"Similarly, FacebookLibra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National and International,\" he wrote.</p><p>When questioned about the fact that a number of big companies had left Libra, Zuckerberg said the project \"is too big for any one company to do on its own, which is why we set up this independent Libra association with a number of companies.\"</p><p>\"It's a risky project, and there's been a lot of scrutiny,\" he added.</p><p>Facebook has been hit with a number of data scandals and fines, recently. On Oct. 22, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an update of the multistate antitrust investigation into Facebook, which she said that 47 attorneys general now have joined.</p><p>Lawmakers, in their questioning, often talked about how they believed Libra to be a digital currency that would challenge the U.S. dollar and said there were serious concerns that Facebook should be broken up.</p><p>At one point, Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to stop the project if he saw it couldn't be moved forward.</p><p>\"I will certainly stop Facebook's part of it,\" he told lawmakers. \"The independent Libra association is a separate thing that exists at this point. If I feel like Facebook can't be a part of it in keeping with the principles that I've laid out, then Facebook won't be a part of it.\"</p><p>Lawmakers also pressed Zuckerberg on Calibra, a new digital wallet for Libra that would be used by Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app. They questioned whether the wallets would be anonymous, as that could hide criminal activity.</p><p>\"Our wallet is going to have strong identity [verification],\" Zuckerberg said, adding that he doesn't speak for the Libra association, but promised commitment from Facebook.</p><p>The Facebook CEO's testimony follows news of a final report from a bipartisan congressional antitrust probe into big technology companies that's expected to be completed by the \"first part\" of 2020.</p><p>The subcommittee of the House's Judiciary Committee is investigating Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple over potential breaches of antitrust law. So far, the subcommittee has received tens of thousands of documents from the four companies, Rep.

The embattled social media founder, who has found himself in the midst of a number of privacy imbroglios over recent years, has probably found it best not to associate his name with the first form of 'corporate money'.Recently, this changed. In a recent quarterly earnings call, Zuckerberg felt a responsibility to address the elephant in the room, making it clear to shareholders and analysts how exactly Facebook is addressing Libra from a regulatory stance. </p><p>The Elephant in the Room As it stands, Facebook has over 100 individuals working on Libra. While this is only a small portion of the firm's 40,000 employees, the cryptocurrency project has made an outsized splash, gracing the headlines of every mainstream media outlet and the lips of some of the world's most powerful people.As such, it only made sense for Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, to try and tackle the concerns his shareholders have with the project on Wednesday, when the company held its latest earnings call[1].Speaking on the matter, Zuckerberg made it clear that his company will spend 'however long it takes' to make sure that the end product abides by the rules and regulations set in place by the world's economic and political bodies.He then affirmed that the early launch of the white paper was done in a bid to 'address these important questions out in the open', rather than surprising regulators with a globally-accessible form of money and financial ecosystem. The Facebook chief executive later added:We are trying to provide a safe and stable and well-regulated product, so that's always been the strategy and we'll continue to engage here.Zuckerberg's comments abide by the framework set in place by David Marcus, the head of Blockchain and Calibra at Facebook, last week. This, of course, implies that there is an underlying company stance. During the first Congressional hearings about Libra, the former PayPal president also made it clear that they will do everything in their power, including collaborating with regulatory agencies, to 'make it work'. Making it Work Facebook isn't taking this approach out of pure altruism. Per previous reports from Blockonomi[2], a representative of the European Central Bank believes that Facebook and its consortium of 27 partners \u2014 which includes Visa, PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Booking Holdings, and other key stakeholders \u2014 should not launch Libra.The board member, Benoit Coeure, explained that for something as important as a new payment system that will be accessible by over two billion individuals in most of the world's countries, everything needs to be 'safe, robust, and resilient from day one'.Also, Congressional representatives, including Maxine Waters, have claimed that Libra should be blocked from launching until all issues are solved. Not Enough A push to collaborate with regulators may not be enough to quell fears, however. During the hearings, Brad Sherman, a Congressman that represents California, made it clear that his peers should not proceed with discussions until Zuckerberg appears in front of the committee. (I'm sure you remember Zuckerberg's last Congressional hearing.)Sherman warned that if launched, Libra could be more dangerous to the United States' security than 9/11, warning of its ability to be used in illicit activities and data gathering.There has also been some talk of a draft bill[3] that would ban big names in technology from 'establishing, maintaining, or operating a digital asset' that is meant to fulfill the three fundamental tenets of money: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton\">https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro\">https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro</url> eToro Risk Warning: 66% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg conceded on Wednesday that the company's planned digital currency Libra was a \"risky project,\" but sought to reassure skepticalU.S. lawmakers that it could lower the cost of electronic payments and open up the global financial system to more people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zuckerberg also fended off aggressive questions on election interference, free speech, hate groups and fake news from members of theU.S. House of Representatives Financial ServicesCommittee.Rep. Maxine Waters, the panel's Democratic chair, quizzed Zuckerberg on Facebook's steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020U.S. presidential election. She also suggested policy-makers should consider breaking upFacebook.</p><p>Waters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch, and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financialservices.</p><p>\"It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\" Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting U.S. voters on its Instagram platform.</p><p>Lawmakers blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation, and for data privacy lapses. Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its2.4 billion users given the pasts candals.</p><p>Zuckerberg said Facebook would insist onU.S. regulatory approval before launching Libra, which is being established by a Switzerland-based consortium.</p><p>Libra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financialsystem. Several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay have abandoned theproject.Rep. Ann Wagner, a Republican, pressed Zucker berg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort.</p><p>The 35-year-old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a \"risky project\" and that he was not sure it would evenwork. During his testimony, the price of Bitcoin versus theU.S. dollar tumbled to a five-monthlow.</p><p>Calm and composed, Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without majorslip-ups.</p><p>The CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded questions over two days on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016U.S. presidential election.</p><p>On Wednesday, he acknowledged Facebook's mistakes, saying he understood the social media giant was not the \"ideal messenger\" for the Libra project and that the company has \"work to do to build trust.\" But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland.</p><p>\"The vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message.\"</p><p>Zucker berg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project.</p><p>OnOct. 14, the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed, as required by Swisslaw. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group's governing council, meaning Facebook will not call theshots.</p><p>Some Republicans did offer support for Zucker berg and the Libra support for Zuckerberg and the Libra project, arguing the government should not stop the private sector from innovating. \"I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech,\" saidRep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel. \"But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Sporting a suit and tie, Zuckerberg also fended off aggressive questions on election interference, free speech, hate groups and fake news from members of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. Representative Maxine Waters, the panel's fiery Democratic chair, quizzed Zuckerberg on Facebook's steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election. She also suggested policymakers should consider breaking up Facebook. </p><p>Waters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch, and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financial services. \"It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\" Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting U.S. voters on its Instagram platform. BIPARTISAN CRITICISM Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation, and for data privacy lapses. Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its 2.4 billion users given the past scandals. \"Facebook's internal model was for a long time was 'Move fast and break things.' Mr. Zuckerberg, we do not want to break the international monetary system,\" said Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat. Zuckerberg said Facebook would insist on U.S. regulatory approval before launching Libra, which is being established by a Switzerland-based consortium including venture capital firms and nonprofits. He said Facebook would even leave the Libra Association if other companies sought to launch the currency without that sign-off. Libra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system. Several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay have abandoned the project. Representative Ann Wagner, a Republican, pressed Zuckerberg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort. \"You've lost these stable partners and I find it highly concerning,\" she said. \"Why do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you're up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards?\" The 35-year old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a \"risky project\" and that he was not sure it would even work. During his testimony, the price of bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar tumbled to a five-month low. FACEBOOK HAS \"WORK TO DO\" Calm and composed, Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without major slip-ups and was even afforded a gentle rib by Democratic Representative Katie Porter, who complimented him on his short haircut. The CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On Wednesday, he acknowledged Facebook's mistakes, saying he understood the social media giant was not the \"ideal messenger\" for the Libra project and that the company has \"work to do to build trust.\" But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland. \"The vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message.\" Zuckerberg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project, sometimes to the frustration of lawmakers. On Oct. 14, the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed, as required by Swiss law. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group's governing council, meaning Facebook will not call the shots. Lawmakers also touched on other hot button issues, including diversity, inclusion, and charges brought by the housing regulator in March, still pending, alleging Facebook violated fair lending laws. Representative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat, hammered Zuckerberg, saying she viewed Facebook's efforts to address civil rights abuses as insufficient, calling them \"appalling and disgusting.\" Some Republicans did offer support for Zuckerberg and the Libra project, arguing the government should not stop the private sector from innovating. \"I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech,\" said Representative Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel. \"But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation\" (Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Michelle Price, Lincoln Feast and David Gregorio) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12027818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-0XF1-DYWP-R0MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>10:11 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Sporting a suit and tie, Zuckerberg also fended off aggressive questions on election interference, free speech, hate groups and fake news from members of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. Representative Maxine Waters, the panel's fiery Democratic chair, quizzed Zuckerberg on Facebook's steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election. She also suggested policymakers should consider breaking up Facebook. </p><p>Waters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch, and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financial services. \"It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\" Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting U.S. voters on its Instagram platform. BIPARTISAN CRITICISM Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation, and for data privacy lapses. Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its 2.4 billion users given the past scandals. \"Facebook's internal model was for a long time was 'Move fast and break things.' Mr. Zuckerberg, we do not want to break the international monetary system,\" said Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat. Zuckerberg said Facebook would insist on U.S. regulatory approval before launching Libra, which is being established by a Switzerland-based consortium including venture capital firms and nonprofits. He said Facebook would even leave the Libra Association if other companies sought to launch the currency without that sign-off. Libra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system. Several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay have abandoned the project. Representative Ann Wagner, a Republican, pressed Zuckerberg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort. \"You've lost these stable partners and I find it highly concerning,\" she said. \"Why do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you're up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards?\" The 35-year old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a \"risky project\" and that he was not sure it would even work. During his testimony, the price of bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar tumbled to a five-month low. FACEBOOK HAS \"WORK TO DO\" Calm and composed, Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without major slip-ups and was even afforded a gentle rib by Democratic Representative Katie Porter, who complimented him on his short haircut. The CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On Wednesday, he acknowledged Facebook's mistakes, saying he understood the social media giant was not the \"ideal messenger\" for the Libra project and that the company has \"work to do to build trust.\" But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland. \"The vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message.\" Zuckerberg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project, sometimes to the frustration of lawmakers. On Oct. 14, the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed, as required by Swiss law. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group's governing council, meaning Facebook will not call the shots. Lawmakers also touched on other hot button issues, including diversity, inclusion, and charges brought by the housing regulator in March, still pending, alleging Facebook violated fair lending laws.

(AFP photo)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg conceded on Wednesday that the company's planned digital currency Libra was a \"risky project,\" but sought to reassure skeptical US lawmakers that it could lower the cost of electronic payments and open up the global financial system to more people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sporting a suit and tie, Zuckerberg also fended off aggressive questions on election interference, free speech, hate groups and fake news from members of the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Representative Maxine Waters, the panel's fiery Democratic chair, quizzed Zuckerberg on Facebook's steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020 US presidential election. She also suggested policymakers should consider breaking up Facebook.</p><p>Waters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch, and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financial services.</p><p>\"It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\" Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting US voters on its Instagram platform.</p><p>Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation, and for data privacy lapses. Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its 2.4 billion users given the past scandals.</p><p>\"Facebook's internal model was for a long time was 'Move fast and break things.' Mr. Zuckerberg, we do not want to break the international monetary system,\" said Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat.</p><p>Zuckerberg said Facebook would insist on US regulatory approval before launching Libra, which is being established by a Switzerland-based consortium including venture capital firms and nonprofits. He said Facebook would even leave the Libra Association if other companies sought to launch the currency without that sign-off.</p><p>Libra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system. Several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay have abandoned the project.</p><p>Representative Ann Wagner, a Republican, pressed Zuckerberg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort. \"You've lost these stable partners and I find it highly concerning,\" she said. \"Why do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you're up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards?\"</p><p>The 35-year old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a \"risky project\" and that he was not sure it would even work. During his testimony, the price of bitcoin versus the US dollar tumbled to a five-month low.</p><p>Facebook has \"work to do\"</p><p>Calm and composed, Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without major slip-ups and was even afforded a gentle rib by Democratic Representative Katie Porter, who complimented him on his short haircut.</p><p>The CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election.</p><p>On Wednesday, he acknowledged Facebook's mistakes, saying he understood the social media giant was not the \"ideal messenger\" for the Libra project and that the company has \"work to do to build trust.\" But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland.</p><p>\"The vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project, sometimes to the frustration of lawmakers.</p><p>On Oct. 14, the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed, as required by Swiss law. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group's governing council, meaning Facebook will not call the shots.</p><p>Lawmakers also touched on other hot button issues, including diversity, inclusion, and charges brought by the housing regulator in March, still pending, alleging Facebook violated fair lending laws.</p><p>Representative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat, hammered Zuckerberg, saying she viewed Facebook's efforts to address civil rights abuses as insufficient, calling them \"appalling and disgusting.\"</p><p>Some Republicans did offer support for Zuckerberg and the Libra project, arguing the government should not stop the private sector from innovating.</p><p>\"I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech,\" said Representative Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel. \"But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/198/701/32/157186446640.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/198/701/32/157186446640.jpg</url></p><p>Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (L) testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.

His comments come after the U.S. social media giant was heavily criticised by politicians and the public for its failure to more rapidly remove footage of the March shooting attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, from its network. Fifty people were killed in the assault, with footage of it circulating online for days. Zuckerberg's meeting with Macron coincided with the release of a report commissioned by the French leader recommending increased oversight of Facebook and an independent regulator to police the efforts of large tech companies to deal with hate speech. </p><p>\"If more countries can follow the lead of what your government has done here, that will likely end up being a more positive outcome for the world in my view than some of the alternatives,\" Zuckerberg told reporters at Facebook's Paris office after the meeting at the Elysee palace. \"We need new rules for the internet that will spell out the responsibilities of companies and those of governments,\" he told France 2 television in an interview. \"That is why we want to work with the team of President Macron. We need a public process.\" The French president wants France to take a leading role on tech regulation, seeking to strike a balance between what he perceives as the United States' laissez-faire stance and China's iron grip on the internet. The 33-page report, co-written by a former lobbyist for Google France, recommends that French authorities should have more access to Facebook's algorithms and greater scope to audit the company's internal policies against hate speech. The report comes after Facebook allowed a team of French regulators to spend six months inside the company monitoring its policies. It represents a \"half-time\" assessment for their stint which started in January. \"The inadequacy and lack of credibility in the self-regulatory approach adopted by the largest platforms justify public intervention to make them more responsible,\" the report said. Companies like Facebook cannot simply declare themselves to be transparent, it added, noting that checking the integrity of the algorithms they use was a particularly complex task. 'DOMINATING POSITION' However, the convergence between French regulators and big tech companies was criticised by some internet lobby groups. \"Up to now, in terms of regulation, only the internet giants have been invited to the table, while others wait for decisions to be taken to have more visibility,\" Constance Bommelaer de Leusse of non-profit group Internet Society said. \"This only reinforces the dominating position of Web giants,\" she said. This week, Chris Hughes, one of the founders of Facebook with Zuckerberg while they were at Harvard, wrote in a long opinion piece in the New York Times that he believed the company was too powerful and needed to be broken up. Zuckerberg declined to comment on Hughes' piece when asked by reporters in Paris, but Nick Clegg, his global communication head and a former British deputy prime minister, dismissed it as \"melodramatic\". \"For us, the alternative to these melodramatic calls for breaking up companies is exactly what we're discussing here, which is proper regulation. What the tech sector needs is not to be broken up, it is proper rules,\" Clegg said. France's parliament, where Macron's ruling party has a comfortable majority, is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4per cent of their global revenue if they don't do enough to remove hateful content from their network. Facebook's decision to allow the team of French regulators inside the company was the first time the company had opened its doors in such a way. Facebook's shares fell as much as 5per cent in a single day following the Christchurch shooting, but have since risen by about 10per cent, helped by good first-quarter results.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees in July that the company would \"go to the mat\" to defeat Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren's expected effort to break up the world's largest social media company if she were elected President, according to audio of two internal company meetings published by The Verge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If she (Warren) gets elected President, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,\" he said, according to the leaked audio.</p><p>Warren, who in March called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc. , Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc., quickly issued a retort on Twitter.</p><p>\"What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights,\" Warren tweeted.</p><p>In a later series of tweets, Warren noted that Facebook has built more market dominance in recent years by acquiring potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>\"More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook,\" she wrote. \"They've got a lot of power - and face little competition or accountability.</p><p>\"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p>In the audio, Zuckerberg said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference \"more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg also drew laughter by saying Facebook's investment on safety is bigger than Twitter's entire revenue.</p><p>Zuckerberg issued a statement on his Facebook page, linking to The Verge's transcript, though he said it was meant to be internal.</p><p>\"You can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees\" he wrote in the post.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an open antitrust investigation into Facebook, and a group of state attorneys general led by New York is also investigating.</p><p>Other Democratic presidential candidates have also criticized Facebook. Senator Bernie Sanders said he would look to split up Facebook, Google and Amazon, while Sen. Kamala Harris said a break-up should \"seriously\" be considered.</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar, one of the lawmakers who introduced the Honest Ads Act that would force Facebook to disclose purchasers of ads on the platform, announced her campaign with a speech that criticized major tech companies.</p><p>Another senior Facebook executive told Reuters this month the company is confident it would defeat an effort to break it up.</p><p>With more than 2 billion monthly users, Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices. It has also come under fire for failing to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>President Donald Trump and other Republicans have criticized social media platforms for alleged bias against conservatives, which the platforms have denied.</p><p>Zuckerberg was on Capitol Hill last month for the first time since he testified before Congress in April 2018. While in Washington he met with Trump and members of Congress.</p><p>In the tape, he was asked about refusing requests to give public testimony before legislators around the world including the Senate.</p><p>\"It just doesn't really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up,\" he told employees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIONL-ec57662bd0b5511cb8ea5e911bf029c0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7B-X2S1-DYTR-42R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Union Leader Corp.

What is it? In a minute, Brit Hume and Professor Jonathan Turley join us to spell that out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, first, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent hours on Capitol Hill today taking questions from senators about Facebook's role in the 2016 election and in American society more generally. We'll talk to one of the senators who was there and spoke to Zuckerberg and more broadly what it meant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, first, Brett Larson, an anchor at \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\", who covers tech for our show, has the big moments from today. Brett?</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS ANCHOR, \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\": It was quite the day, Tucker. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg checked in with Congress today for day one of hearings.</p><p>And we learned a little bit about the inner workings of the social media giant. One thing we heard repeatedly was exactly what Facebook is and is not.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: What you think of as the Facebook service, everyone has control every single time that they go to share that, they can delete that data anytime they want, full control for the majority of the data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: Sharing everything? Not so much.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: No.</p><p>DURBIN: I think that might be what this is all about. Your right to privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: But with 2.2 billion users and in the wake of concerns about more than 80 million users having their data stolen by political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, is Facebook your only choice?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If I buy a Ford and it doesn't work well and I don't like it, I can buy a Chevy. If I'm upset with Facebook, what's the equivalent product that I can go sign up for?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: The second category that I was going to talk about -</p><p>GRAHAM: I'm not talking about categories. I'm talking about, is there real competition you face? You don't think you have a monopoly?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.</p><p>GRAHAM: OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: There is also concerns, Tucker, about First Amendment rights and just what control the social media giant has over what you see, say, and share.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: You say that you have 15,000 to 20,000 people working on security and content review. Do you know the political orientation of those 15,000 to 20,000 people engaged in content review?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: No, senator. We do not generally ask people about their political orientation when they're joining the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: Sen. Ben Sasse asked a similar question about censorship on the site and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the speech they censor is any time someone pushes to hurt others. Sen. Sasse was also concerned about addiction to the social media site.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA: As a dad, do you worry about social media addiction as a problem for America's teens?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well, my hope is that we can be idealistic, but have a broad view of our responsibility.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: And, Tucker, we will get more from Zuckerberg tomorrow when he sits down for day two. He's certainly been very frank in his responses and a little obtuse about specifics, which made the lack of understanding of exactly how Facebook works and our understanding of it very clear.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks for that, Brett. Appreciate it. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana was one of the many senators who spoke to Zuckerberg today. Here's part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today. And I say this gently. Your user agreement sucks. I'm going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it. And tell your $1200 an hour lawyers - no disrespect; they're good - but tell them you want it written in English.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Sen. Kennedy joins us tonight. Senator, thanks for coming on.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: What was the point of this hearing there? What laws are you all considering to constrain Facebook?</p><p>KENNEDY: Tucker, I was mildly disappointed with the hearing. I mean, I wanted the point to be - I wanted Mr. Zuckerberg to step up to the plate and say, look - three words - I'm on it. I get it. It can be fixed. I'm going to fix it. And we'll do it together. That's not what I heard. I just didn't feel like we connected with Mr. Zuckerberg today.</p><p>I mean, look, Facebook is an extraordinary company. It's done magical things, but it's clear that the digital promised land has some minefields in it. One is the privacy issue; the other is the propaganda.</p><p>And I don't want to have to vote to regulate Facebook, but, my God, I will unless they're willing to step up to the plate and address those two issues. I think they can; I hope they can. If they can't, we've got a bigger problem than just what we talked about today.</p><p>CARLSON: So, here you've got the biggest provider of news in the United States with far more power than William Randolph I ever had with a long and proven track record of censorship in this country and other countries, with the power to change election results.</p><p>You don't think that's enough of a threat right there to act?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I think that's a very important issue. Sen. Cruz and Sen. Sasse made that point. I ran out of time. I wanted to make that point.</p><p>And I think it's true. Poison is being spread on social media. OK. What's poison? Define poison.</p><p>And, look, I wanted - a lot of our Democratic friends have made a big deal about, well, Cambridge Analytica may work with President Trump. I wanted to ask Mr. Zuckerberg today about this statement that was made by somebody - a Ms. Carol Davidson from President Obama's election campaign in 2012.</p><p>This is what she says. She ran media analytics for the president. She said, \"Facebook was very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KENNEDY: I wanted to ask if that's an accurate statement, but I ran out of time.</p><p>CARLSON: Finally, the Congress would have really uniquely the ability to get this under control, if you think that too much power is vested in one company and they're, in effect, enemies of the First Amendment.</p><p>I know Republicans don't like to regulate things, but do you think we're approaching a point where - for the good of the public - that may need to be done?</p><p>KENNEDY: I don't think we're there yet, but I think a lot of it depends on how Mr. Zuckerberg reacts to this.</p><p>I'll say it again. There are two issues. One is a privacy problem. The other is a propaganda problem. And the issue there is how do we solve it without impinging on people's First Amendment rights?</p><p>Now, that's a tough one.</p><p>CARLSON: It is a tough one.</p><p>KENNEDY: And I want to be assured. Didn't get it today. Maybe we'll get it in the second round that Facebook is not politically biased one way or the other.</p><p>I don't want him pitching for the Republicans. I don't want him pitching for the Democrats either.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, they are. Senator, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>KENNEDY: You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: For more discussion of what happened today, Dave Maney is a tech entrepreneur and a fan of Facebook, Roger McNamee who was one of Facebook's first investors and now a critic sometimes of the company. Both of them join us.</p><p>So, Roger, first to you. The head of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg said today that he and the company are happy to censor hate speech, but was unclear exactly on what hate speech is. And then, suggested that maybe artificial intelligence will settle that question.</p><p>If you care about freedom of speech, does that make you uncomfortable?</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, ZUCKERBERG'S FORMER MENTOR: I think the whole thing makes me uncomfortable, Tucker.</p><p>I think the fundamental issue we've got here is its business model is based on inflammatory emotions - anger and fear.</p><p>And once you build a business model on that, it's really - the genie is out of the bottle and there's no way to put it back in. And Facebook has shown itself to be less than good at managing the dialogue on its site.</p><p>And as you pointed out, they are absolutely editing everything. There are a million different things they could show me at any moment in time. They pick the 20 that serve their business model best.</p><p>And quite clearly, they have failed on that, precisely as Sen. Kennedy just described.</p><p>CARLSON: Dave, we had a researcher on, a psychologist recently called Robert Epstein and he's taken a look at a bunch of different tech companies.</p><p>And he said specifically about Facebook, if Mark Zuckerberg had sent a targeted message to people identified on Facebook as Hillary voters and encouraged them to vote, he estimates it could have changed the vote total by 450,000 on election day 2016 and changed the course of the election.</p><p>That's a lot of power for one media company to have. Even if you are for Mark Zuckerberg's political views, should any company have the ability to change election outcomes the way Facebook does?</p><p>DAVE MANEY, TECH ENTREPRENEUR: I think you're giving him too much credit. First of all, I'm not a fan of that political worldview. I am a fan of free enterprise and letting them do what they will.</p><p>I mean, by that standard, how many people vote does \"The New York Times\" editorial choosing a candidate or anybody else is making influence?</p><p>So, I'm very wary of the Facebook site as a user. But this discussion about should we censor them and knock-back their political influence and are they a gigantic monopoly, I mean, I think that's crazy.</p><p>CARLSON: But they're literally a monopoly.</p><p>MANEY: They're not a monopoly, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: They are. They are actually because I know the numbers. I've worked in (INAUDIBLE) a lot for eight years.</p><p>Let me just give you the following number. So, Facebook and Google control over 90 percent of digital ads. So, that means if you run news or anything else that's ad supported online, you're beholden to them. They control the market completely. Why is that not a monopoly?</p><p>MANEY: If you want to say it's a monopoly for digital ads, that's fine. If you want to say it's a monopoly for political content, it's not.</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on. Digital ads are what supports all online news coverage apart from the non-profits. That's the whole point. You control the ads, you control the company.</p><p>MANEY: Tucker, are you worried about a monopoly in the digital ad business or are you worried about a concentration of political power?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I don't think there's a distinction between those two things. I'm worried that, in the addition to both, by the total inability of the Congress to respond to a looming threat to its own legitimacy from Facebook and Google. Roger, am I being insane here? I don't think that I am.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Tucker, I'm on your side on this issue because, at the end of the day, the problem we have here is a massive concentration of power. And that concentration of power is in the hands of people who preserve the rights of the First Amendment for their corporation, but they tend to overlook the First Amendment rights of the people who are the users of the sites.</p><p>And in that process, I mean, what we have is these things that are global, they are influencing democracy all around the world and we can't find a single example of them influencing it for the better.</p><p>And I'm with the Sen. Kennedy. This thing has gone on both sides. We've seen massive abuses of Facebook on both sides of this thing. And It doesn't look good either way.</p><p>And we need to reduce Facebook's influence, so that we don't have it determining the outcome of any election, whether it's 2012, 2016, 2018, or 2020.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think that's right because, in the end, Dave, this is not an American company or, more precisely, a company that sees itself as an American company. I would argue that, in effect, is, but they don't see that. Google doesn't either. They're companies of the world.</p><p>And yet, they have more influence potentially over our voting patterns than Russia or China or any other government. So, like, why wouldn't that be a threat to democracy?</p><p>MCNAMEE: And the worst part of it, Tucker, is they behave as though they don't have any influence; and as a result, bad actors have been able to manipulate the system, essentially undefended.</p><p>And to David, my simple point here is that, having watched this company from its earliest days, it has evolved into something very different than it started out as. And I too am a believer in free enterprise, but I'm a bigger believer in democracy and I don't believe any company's rights come before the rights of the people of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: So, David, I'm going to let you sum it up. Does any of this bother you? I get that you're for free enterprise. I admire that. But does any of this bother you at all?</p><p>MANEY: I largely stopped using the app in January when I went through their latest news revision to decide what I could see and not see. But that doesn't mean that I believe that Sen. Kennedy or those other knuckleheads down there today in that hearing, which gives - I'd say it was a goat rodeo, but that's unfair to goat rodeos.</p><p>Like, you can't let those people make those decisions. Consumers have to make those decisions. And your assertion that it's an unbreakable monopoly, it's just not.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it's not only unbreakable, it's growing in its part. Anyway, thank you both. We're out of time sadly. Appreciate it.</p><p>Tonight, in just the past 12 minutes, we've seen evidence that two other cable networks are colluding with \"The New York Times\" to put out negative stories on the Trump administration. Sort of.</p><p>Our proof and both Brit Hume and Professor Jonathan Turley coming up next.</p><p>CARLSON: \"CNN\", \"MSNBC\", and \"The New York Times\" are working together tonight to push a new story about the Trump administration.</p><p>At the top of the hour, \"MSNBC\" put on Maggie Haberman. \"CNN\" put on Michael Schmidt. Those two are both \"Times\" reporters. And they co- authored a piece in that newspaper, saying that Donald Trump attempted to fire Robert Mueller in December. Mueller is still there, of course.</p><p>The Mueller investigation, you'll remember, was officially created to uncover Russian hacking into the American democracy because they hacked our democracy.</p><p>But that's not what it is anymore. It is now an all-purpose probe into the president, his personal and financial life. It's designed to make us feel safer. I hope you feel safer.</p><p>Yesterday, FBI agents raided the office of Michael Cohen. That's the president's personal lawyer, apparently looking for evidence about payments to Stormy Daniels, the porn star who is not from Russia and who did not hack our election in any case.</p><p>Over on \"MSNBC\", Steve Schmidt noted that the men who wrote the constitution would be thrilled by this. They always hated the Bill of Rights, those guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE SCHMIDT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" CORRESPONDENT: If you listen closely tonight, you can hear the faint applause from heaven of this country's founding fathers who bequeathed to us a nation where the rule of law is supreme. We are a nation of laws.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. The founders wanted to know, did the money go to Stormy Daniels? What happened to Stormy Daniels?</p><p>Jonathan Turley is a professor at George Washington University's School of Law and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, I think, professor, you were one of the trustworthy people in this conversation. I don't even know what your politics are. I don't think we even agree politically, but whatever. I trust your legal views.</p><p>What do you make of this raid on the president's lawyer's offices?</p><p>JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW PROFESSOR: Well, part of this is of Cohen's making, in the sense that Cohen tends to blur his relationships between being a lawyer, a fixer and a business partner.</p><p>That's dangerous under any circumstances, but it's particularly dangerous if you're going to invoke the attorney-client attorney privilege because, first, you have to prove that you're acting like an attorney.</p><p>And he may have trouble with that. When you look at the Stormy Daniels agreement, it's still not clear what role he's playing there, whether he's this company he created, whether he's Trump's lawyer, that's going to come back to haunt him and haunt the president when they say some of this stuff should remain confidential.</p><p>But I think the president is right, in a sense that whenever you have a raid on an attorney's office, it should raise very troubling concerns for everyone.</p><p>I mean, this is a serious problem when someone can't rely on their attorney.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is the core potential violation here that the payments to Stormy Daniels - Ms. Daniels, we'll call her - were some form of campaign finance violations?</p><p>TURLEY: Well, actually, that is strengthening with some of the statements made publicly. When the president said, I didn't know anything about this payment, it sounds a lot like what's called an in-kind campaign contribution.</p><p>And that's what John Edwards was charged with and prosecuted for. He ultimately was not convicted of that. But, yes, they could make a case like that.</p><p>But, supposedly, the warrant covers everything from Stormy Daniels to taxi medallions. And there's a lot in between.</p><p>CARLSON: Is there any indication that Stormy Daniels was working with Russian agents to influence the outcome of the election, that she was herself part of the hacking of our democracy?</p><p>TURLEY: Well, I'm not familiar with all of her movies, but no. But, no, I'm not familiar with -</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So, I guess, we can say that the nature of the investigation has changed profoundly.</p><p>TURLEY: Oh, absolutely. Now, there's no question that this is a far off the mark. So was Manafort.</p><p>What's actually sort of fascinating about this is that Rod Rosenstein didn't have much of a problem when Mueller came to him and said I want to expand Manafort's investigation to include stuff that occurred years before and were not connected to the campaign.</p><p>Some of this stuff is actually closer, and yet Rosenstein said I want the southern district to do this.</p><p>CARLSON: Could Rosenstein have said, \"No, that's not the original charter of this, that's not the point of this investigation?</p><p>TURLEY: He could have, but it gets a little bit tough. If Mueller came to him and said, \"Look, we have evidence of crime that we have uncovered,\" it's hard not to give that to a prosecutor to look at.</p><p>We don't know what was shown to Rod Rosenstein. And that's part of the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: I think what you're saying is you would have to be either dumb or an active drug user to allow an independent counsel investigation to start.</p><p>TURLEY: Well, I think that - look, this is one of those things where it's easy to unleash the dogs of war. It's harder to get them back.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I know.</p><p>TURLEY: And a special counsel is a torpedo in the water, to use another metaphor. And he's still there.</p><p>And what's interesting about this move is that they haven't just expanded the investigation, they've expanded the prosecutors.</p><p>So, now, even if the president moved against Rosenstein, moved against Mueller, it wouldn't necessarily stop with the southern district.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Thank you for that. Professor Jonathan Turley, appreciate it.</p><p>Democrats are gearing up for an impeachment push against the president. What's the point of that and what will the outcome of it be, assuming they take back the House in the midterm? Brit Hume joins us next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With all of this turmoil, particularly this last week, has the president at any time thought about stepping down before or now?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: No. And I think that's an absolutely ridiculous question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, nobody can quite in the light of day tell you why the Stormy Daniels story is so significant, but clearly it is judging by the air time it gets. It's more important than the looming war in Syria, more important than the fact our economy is being eclipsed by China, more important than the vanishing American middle class or the tens of thousands who will die of drug ODs this year.</p><p>In fact, it matters so much that President Trump should consider leaving office over it. Does anyone who doesn't work in the media believe that?</p><p>Brit Hume is our senior political analyst here at Fox and he joins us tonight. So, Brit - and maybe I'm blinded by my reflexive revulsion about this story, but is it? In the scheme of stories concerning the world is on fire and changing faster than we can keep up with, is the Stormy Daniels story as significant as the airtime it's getting, do you think?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Of course, it's not.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>HUME: The big problem with the story from the start has been this. It doesn't tell us anything about Donald Trump that we didn't already know or should have known.</p><p>Indeed, this story itself came out - at least a piece of it that he had this liaison with her came out before the election.</p><p>Americans who voted for and against Donald Trump knew, or should have known, that he was a habitual philanderer. He had made a great public spectacle of it in the past, that he was a man with a taste for flashy women.</p><p>The story was entirely credible and remains so to this day. And the fact that he denies is a detail. I don't think most of the people who are for him think that his denial is true, but it simply doesn't rise to the kind of level you're talking about here unless you want to take very seriously the possibility that the money paid to keep her from blurting all this out sooner was a campaign contribution that well exceeded the proper limits for campaign contributions.</p><p>That is about as big as you can get it to be as far as we know.</p><p>CARLSON: That seems like a pretty tenuous connection to news. Just me. By the way, the other channels have covered this exclusively since we started 28 minutes ago. I mean, that's all they've covered for this hour so far.</p><p>HUME: Well, I think there's a lot of excitement about the search of the Cohen offices and so on, but the question that still you have to answer here is what really is the underlying crime and does it rise to the level of something for purposes of impeachment or as the questioner at the briefing said the possibility that Trump would resign.</p><p>That's an interesting question, of course, Tucker. Does anything about Trump's behavior in reaction to any of this suggest that this is a man contemplating quitting?</p><p>CARLSON: No!</p><p>HUME: I would say, obviously, palpably not.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not sure that he or anyone in the White House fully understands what would happen if Democrats take the House this fall as many polls suggest they will.</p><p>It seems like the very top of their agenda will be impeaching President Trump. That's what their voters want.</p><p>Yesterday, Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who is running against Cruz in the Senate race, said he would vote to impeach Trump, although he acknowledged it wouldn't make sense to do it right now.</p><p>But Democratic voters want impeachment. Do you think Democratic members, if they take control of the House, can do anything but start an impeachment?</p><p>HUME: I think there'll be moves in that direction. Of course, the last time this was done, in the case of Bill Clinton and the judges there were among other perjury and obstruction of justice that were pretty thoroughly documented - he had, obviously, lied to a grand jury. They did it.</p><p>They impeached him in the House and he was not anywhere near convicted in the Senate and he ended up leaving office in something like a blaze of glory and it kind of backfired politically on the Republicans. And Democratic politicians - those in the House of Representatives - might be given some pause by how all that turned out.</p><p>But you're right about the base. The Democratic base cannot the stand the ground that Trump walks on. They want him out and they want him impeached and they want their members to be part of the resistance.</p><p>Little Mr. O'Rourke running against Ted Cruz in Texas seemed a little confused about how impeachment works because he's running for the Senate and the Senate doesn't vote to impeach. The House votes to impeach. The Senate votes on whether or not to convict.</p><p>But that aside, his sentiments reflect that of many Democrats. And I think there will be a move to do it if, in fact, they get control of the House. How well it will work out for them politically remains to be seen.</p><p>CARLSON: It does remain to be seen. Brit Hume, thanks as always. Great to see you.</p><p>HUME: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, all the geniuses here in Washington are unanimous on this question. We must attack Syria and anyone who asks questions about why we must attack Syria is, obviously, by definition, working for Vladimir Putin.</p><p>How has this happened? How has almost everybody in power lined up behind yet another military intervention? Is the public crying out for one? Glenn Greenwald has watched this fairly carefully and he joins us next with an answer.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, virtually, all of official Washington - Republicans and Democrats - have united behind the idea that the United States has a moral obligation to go deeper into war in Syria.</p><p>We already have thousands of troops in Syria, but you wouldn't know it from watching the other Robert Mueller based channels. They're all Stormy Daniels all the time. But it's true we do.</p><p>And one American soldier had already died in Syria. We've killed hundreds of Russian citizens so far there and lobbed in a serious of cruise missiles. But that's not enough, the pundits say. We need a real war, something big and deadly, primarily to avenge the Syrian President Assad's poison gas attack on his own citizens over the weekend.</p><p>Here is some of the growing consensus on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAHAM: Assad and his inner circle should be considered war criminals, legitimate military targets. If you have the opportunity to take him out, you should.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's very clear to me that this president, after using such rhetoric on Sunday, has to take stronger military action than we did last year.</p><p>REP. JIM HINES (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We have a leader who is now a war criminal supported by the Iranians and the Russians. That demands a strong and risky response.</p><p>If the West won't stand up when a leader uses gas multiple times against his own people, we live in a very dangerous world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, that's the consensus. Last night, we asked the obvious questions about it. Before we go to war, are we sure all of this is real? Do we really know that Assad was behind the gas attack?</p><p>It's not a defense of Assad, but it's an obvious question. How could we know that conclusively so soon after the attack happened? We didn't have any Americans on the ground? And why would Assad do that given the certainty it would hurt his own interests?</p><p>And while we're on the subject, by the way, why is a war in Syria a good idea for the United States in the first place? How would it make us safer, happier, more prosperous?</p><p>Those seem like reasonable questions to us. In fact, the exact questions you'd want your policymakers to ask. But, no, they're not asking them. And they're offended to hear them.</p><p>The first person we asked those questions to, Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi implied that we were somehow allied with Vladimir Putin just for asking. Other than that, Wicker had no answers at all. It was embarrassing and he didn't seem embarrassed at all.</p><p>Others just denounced us right off the top. Jennifer Rubin of \"The Washington Post\" tweeted this, \"He is insane,\" meaning me. \"Fox is not a news organization. That is all.\"</p><p>Noah Rothman of \"Commentary\" called the show \"nothing less than undiluted Russian propaganda.</p><p>Seth Mandel of \"The New York Post\" summarized the criticism perfectly when he tweeted this, \"shut the F up.\"</p><p>These are journalists, by the way. No explanation. Of course, shutting the F up is the whole point of tweets like that. They want you to be quiet. They want you to do what you're told. No more questions, shut up and obey. There's no chance of that, though. Sorry.</p><p>Glenn Greenwald has been following all of this. He's a founding editor at \"The Intercept\" and he joins us tonight. So, Glenn, leaving aside the real question of how you should respond to Syria and is it a threat to the world order and to us and to its neighbors, I think those are all fair questions, but why the universal attempt in the media here in this country - left and right - to shut down a meaningful conversation about it?</p><p>GLENN GREENWALD, \"THE INTERCEPT\" FOUNDING EDITOR: The only time, I think, that the media praised Donald Trump was almost one year ago today when he bombed an airfield in Syria in response to what had been alleged at the time was a chemical attack by the Assad regime.</p><p>People who hate Donald Trump and go on air every day took a break for 24 hours to proclaim him presidential because that's what US presidents in their eyes do as they just drop bombs on other countries with no declaration of war, no reason why US interest or the US borders are at stake when it happens.</p><p>So, I think that's just the ethos in Washington that not only is it just an inherently good and presidential thing to do, to drop bombs on other countries. That's why polls around the world show that the greatest threat to world peace in the eyes of the public around the world is the United States.</p><p>But also, Adam Smith wrote 300 years ago that the reason people who live in capitals and the elites in countries love to watch their countries bomb other countries is because it gives them a sense of excitement and purpose and kind of this pulsating stimulation. And I think that's a really big part of it.</p><p>It doesn't matter whether it will accomplish anything. It just makes us feel strong and powerful and purposeful to do. And so, bombs away.</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's right. I mean, I think human nature explains a lot of this. I agree completely. But journalists exist to push back against that. Not necessarily against war, but against a feverish rush toward anything. I mean, our job is to be skeptical and ask real questions. Why is no one doing that and anyone who does is attacked?</p><p>GREENWALD: So, just about every name that you mentioned in the media who attacked you for raising questions about whether or not we ought to actually go and bomb another country are all essentially neocons.</p><p>The same people who were doing this in 2002 and 2003, saying anyone who asked questions about whether we should actually go to war and remove Saddam Hussein was an admirer of the Saddam Hussein.</p><p>They did the same in 2011 when it came time to remove Gaddafi. They said if you're against that war, it means you love Gaddafi and you want to see him slaughter people. It's just the standard tactic.</p><p>And what we have now is this kind of union between neocons, who have now once again kind of been embraced by both the establishment wings of the Republican and Democratic Party and the militarists in both parties, people like Lindsey Graham and lots of Democrats who love every single war.</p><p>And so, this climate arises that you're just supposed to cheer when it comes time to drop bombs on other countries, not ask whether there's evidence to justify it, not ask whether it will do any good, not ask whether it will kill any civilians.</p><p>And if you do ask those questions, it means you're on the side of America's enemies. It's an incredibly authoritarian tactic that gets used to suppress debate.</p><p>CARLSON: Yeah, it's poison. I agree. Glenn Greenwald, thank you as always.</p><p>GREENWALD: Good to be with you.</p><p>CARLSON: Richard Goodstein is an attorney who advised both of Hillary Clinton's campaigns and he supports strikes on Syria. Richard joins us tonight.</p><p>So, look, it seems to me, no matter what conclusion you reach, the first question for everybody ought to be the same, which is how is this in America's strategic interest. And I haven't met a single person who could answer it or is even willing to try. That's a problem, wouldn't you say?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER: It would be if there really was no answer.</p><p>I did see your interview with Sen. Wicker last night. You asked the question, how do even know Assad was behind this?</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Because Gen. Mattis basically said we weren't sure. But what we know is that a UN Commission saw links between sarin gas that we know was used and had the hallmarks of what the -</p><p>CARLSON: Sure. Look, I'm totally open-minded. I'm not here flacking for Assad. My God! I just want to be certain that we are acting on the basis of verifiable information. And in the case of this last weekend's attack with the chlorine gas, let's just stop lying, there is no way that we could know in 48 hours, 24 hours when the cable news shows start pushing for war that Assad was behind this. So, let's stop lying. That's my only point.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, I'm not sure who it is - look, it had all the hallmarks of something that we know Assad did. He was destroying towns willy-nilly.</p><p>And the notion that somehow the rebels would kill their own women and children and have them foaming at the mouth and so forth to make a point for CNN or Fox, that seems a bit much, right?</p><p>But I think what we're trying to do is -</p><p>CARLSON: Really, it's a bit much? OK. So, the first sarin gas attack took place within a week of the Trump administration saying we're no longer going to try to remove Assad from power. That happened. Bam, we went right back to the original policy.</p><p>This attack took place less than a week after the Trump people said we are going to pull our troops out.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, look, I don't know who did it. I'm not accusing anybody. I'm merely saying there's clearly questions that we need to be asking about this. And anyone who does, I'm a living example of this, is shouted down and called a poodle of Putin. Like, that's insane.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I wish I took as much pleasure from my critics coming after me as you do incidentally. So, I applaud you for feeling the umbrage that you do.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm attacked all the time. I don't care. I care about when and where we commit American troops. I have a son who is 21. This is not a joke.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right. So, it's not a question, frankly, of committing troops. Sure, there will be troops. We're talking about degrading their air force, degrading their helicopters, doing something frankly that we didn't do.</p><p>CARLSON: What does degrading mean?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: It means basically have so many -</p><p>CARLSON: Killing people. Let's not use euphemisms here.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Fine. Let's blow up airplanes and helicopters. If there are people in it, so be it. They made their choice to align with Assad and these are the very people who we've seen are dropping - I think we actually have had photographic evidence, dropping chlorine bombs on civilian populations.</p><p>So, do I feel badly about that? No. Do I think it's something United States should be doing? Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: But hold on. What's the goal? Just let's be really clear We take Assad out, and don't tell me that's not the plan. When you wage war against a government, you're not rooting for its continuation.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No.</p><p>CARLSON: Who runs Syria? And I'm saying I don't know actually if taking him out is the objective. And I agree with you. Just continue the war, kill more people.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I think the objective is so that Assad knows that his dropping chlorine gas on people is something where he's going to pay a price. And he has did it.</p><p>And I think we have to establish whether he did it or not. And the fact is it shouldn't be a feel-good exercise like it was last year. When Trump was basically talking about that great piece of chocolate cake with Xi, the time he was dropping bombs on those runways, that was a feel-good exercise.</p><p>If we're going to do something, we should do something, so that Assad can't do it as easily.</p><p>CARLSON: But we don't that he did do it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I agree.</p><p>CARLSON: Does it bother you when there's universal consensus on the left and among established Republicans that we just know, and like stop asking questions, let's just go ahead and do this for reasons that we can't fully explain, we can't tell you how it's going to make you richer or safer or happier, but just shut up and do it anyway? Does it bother you?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, it will make us better because we think we need to go after war crimes. The question is whether Assad did it. It has all the hallmarks of Assad. I don't blame people for concluding it did.</p><p>Do we need to establish with some certainty that it was Assad? Yes, we should probably do that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, every time a government does something appalling or kill civilians, we need to bomb them.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No.</p><p>CARLSON: No. OK, right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: We can't address every war crime. But those that we can address, yes, I think we should.</p><p>CARLSON: Just so we can.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Plenty more. I grant you.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. All right. Richard, thank you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: My head is spinning.</p><p>One of the Internet's top prostitution sites just shut down and feminists are delighted. Wait, what? No, they're furious. It's getting confusing in feminist world. So, we're going to explain it to you. Is prostitution pro-women? Or is it the exploitation of women? We'll get the new line on that. Next.</p><p>CARLSON: The site backpage.com - it's a classified ad site - has been shut down and several top officials who work there have got in trouble. They've been indicted over allegations that that site facilitated prostitution and child sex trafficking.</p><p>You would think feminists would be happy about this, and some are. But others are outraged by it.</p><p>Women's March tweeted, \"The shutting down of Backpage is an absolute crisis for sex workers. That's the new term for prostitutes who rely on that site to safely get in touch with clients. Sex workers' rights are women's rights.</p><p>Amy Peikoff is a talk show host and a feminist who supports keeping Backpage up and she joins us tonight. Amy, great to see you.</p><p>AMY PEIKOFF, TALK SHOW HOST AND FEMINIST: Hi, Tucker. Thanks for having me back again.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I know that you're a libertarian. I don't agree with you, but I certainly respect it. I think it's an intellectually coherent way to look at the world.</p><p>PEIKOFF: But I also know you are a feminist. And they seem at odds with each other.</p><p>So, the libertarian side of you would say, people have a right to enter into voluntary contracts. Prostitution falls under that heading. It's fine.</p><p>But the feminist part of you can't really believe that prostitution is empowering to women because it's the opposite of that.</p><p>PEIKOFF: Right. But here's the thing, we're talking about government shutting down a website. And regardless of what you and I, Tucker, think ethically about prostitution and other types of sex work, the question to ask is whether it violates anyone's rights.</p><p>And we need to, in order to empower women, leave all choices up to them in terms of how to conduct their own personal sex lives and everything else.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. That's the libertarian side. And I get that. I mean, again, I don't fully agree with it, but I think it's a reasonable thing to say.</p><p>But the feminist position has nothing to do with that. The feminist position is about empowerment and dignity and not objectifying women, reducing them to their physical appearance, which is, of course, what prostitution does. It degrades women completely.</p><p>PEIKOFF: My version - I mean, insofar as I consider myself a feminist, I consider myself a feminist in terms of protecting women's rights. So, whenever there's an actual threat to women's rights, I'm going to be there and argue against whatever it is and say that we need to take some action accordingly.</p><p>But insofar as this website was just facilitating transactions having to do with prostitution or other types of sex work, then there's no rights violation and you need to leave the choice up to the women.</p><p>We're not going to - it's not the American way to force a particular type of lifestyle choice on someone just because you disagree with it from your own ethical perspective. We need to back up and look at the perspective of the individual rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. But that doesn't mean that all \"lifestyle choices\" are the same. And I don't know why a feminist group like Women's March would describe as prostitutes as \"sex workers.\"</p><p>Many of them are really young. They are being pimped out by older men and sleeping with creepy - I mean, the whole thing is like disgusting actually.</p><p>PEIKOFF: But that problem would be only worse. That problem would be only worse, as I understand it, if there are not online opportunities for these women.</p><p>And, Tucker, there are two further kind of troubling implications of something like this, shutting down a site like backpage.com. One is that is in conjunction with a couple of pieces of legislation that are also troubling, designed to remove content about sex off of the Internet.</p><p>And I myself, I think that sex is a good thing. I don't think we should be shutting down content on the Internet. And there's been a lot of preemptive removing of content from Reddit and other sites because of this.</p><p>And the second thing is that I think this is ominous in terms of other types of websites and tech companies coming under government control in the future.</p><p>I mean, we just saw Zuckerberg in front of Congress today and you think, oh, well, right now, it's just a prostitution and sex trafficking website, but next it's going to be Tinder because people are using that to hook up and it's sex and maybe we can get away with controlling that or shutting that down.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I guess I used to feel that way.</p><p>PEIKOFF: And then, it will be Facebook and Twitter. And this is the problem, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: And I literally can't wait for that day, to be honest with you.</p><p>PEIKOFF: But today's websites, Tucker, they are not only the method of distributing content, including all of the content that is necessary to change the culture for the better, they also collect information about users.</p><p>So, it's a very different type of media.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm aware of it. But let me just ask you - hold on.</p><p>PEIKOFF: We have to be very careful about putting that under government control because I think you would agree with me -</p><p>CARLSON: I think you think the government is more sinister, I would not agree with you. I agree with you ten years ago back when I was a mindless libertarian who thought that government was the greatest threat to our freedom. But government is elected.</p><p>PEIKOFF: OK. So, we do not want to end up in Orwell's 1984. We do not want to end up in Orwell's 1984. And if you think that information is troubling in the hands of somebody who wants to make money, think of it in the hands of government.</p><p>CARLSON: Which is elected, unlike Zuckerberg. But, Amy, thank you. It's always nice to have you here. I like smart guests and you are.</p><p>PEIKOFF: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Zuckerberg, testifying on the Hill, it's a big story. But another tech titan has revealed his vision of the future and it will wreck your night. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Zuckerberg consuming all the headline space recently. And that's lucky for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who just revealed his terrifying vision of this country's future.</p><p>Last week, Dorsey shared an article he called \"great read\". The article was published on Medium. It says that there is no bipartisan future for the country. One side must win and totally destroy the other.</p><p>The piece describes the country as in a non-violent civil war now. And the only way forward, it says, is to do what California has done.</p><p>The piece is pretty explicit about that, import a voter base until elections are mere formalities as they are in California. End all debate. Allow only the left to speak.</p><p>In other words, make America a lot more like Twitter, a one-party state where armies of serfs happily serve tech gods like, well, Jack Dorsey. That's the future they are all hoping for. And now you know.</p><p>We didn't have anything about sex-crazed pandas tonight, but we're on that because we're journalists. So, stay tuned in the rest of the week for developments. That's it for us.</p><p>In New York, right now, Sean Hannity is standing by.

What is it?  In a minute, Brit Hume and  Professor Jonathan Turley join us to spell that out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But, first, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent hours on Capitol Hill today  taking questions from senators about Facebook's role in the 2016 election  and in American society more generally.  We'll talk to one of the senators  who was there and spoke to Zuckerberg and more broadly what it meant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But, first, Brett Larson, an anchor at \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\", who  covers tech for our show, has the big moments from today.  Brett?</p><p> BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS ANCHOR, \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\":  It was quite the  day, Tucker.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg checked in with Congress today  for day one of hearings.</p><p> And we learned a little bit about the inner workings of the social media  giant.  One thing we heard repeatedly was exactly what Facebook is and is  not.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  What you think of as the Facebook service,  everyone has control every single time that they go to share that, they can  delete that data anytime they want, full control for the majority of the  data.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  Sharing everything?  Not so much.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr.  Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p> DURBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about.  Your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  But with 2.2 billion users and in the wake of concerns about more  than 80 million users having their data stolen by political consulting  firm, Cambridge Analytica, is Facebook your only choice?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  If I buy a Ford and it doesn't  work well and I don't like it, I can buy a Chevy.  If I'm upset with  Facebook, what's the equivalent product that I can go sign up for?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  The second category that I was going to talk about - </p><p> GRAHAM:  I'm not talking about categories.  I'm talking about, is there  real competition you face?  You don't think you have a monopoly?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.</p><p> GRAHAM:  OK.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  There is also concerns, Tucker, about First Amendment rights and  just what control the social media giant has over what you see, say, and  share.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  You say that you have 15,000 to 20,000 people  working on security and content review.  Do you know the political  orientation of those 15,000 to 20,000 people engaged in content review?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No, senator.  We do not generally ask people about their  political orientation when they're joining the company.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  Sen.  Ben Sasse asked a similar question about censorship on the  site and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the speech they censor is any time  someone pushes to hurt others.  Sen.  Sasse was also concerned about  addiction to the social media site.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA:  As a dad, do you worry about social media  addiction as a problem for America's teens?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Well, my hope is that we can be idealistic, but have a broad  view of our responsibility.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  And, Tucker, we will get more from Zuckerberg tomorrow when he  sits down for day two.  He's certainly been very frank in his responses and  a little obtuse about specifics, which made the lack of understanding of  exactly how Facebook works and our understanding of it very clear.</p><p> CARLSON:  Thanks for that, Brett.  Appreciate it.  Sen.  John Kennedy of  Louisiana was one of the many senators who spoke to Zuckerberg today.   Here's part of it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Here's what everybody's been trying to  tell you today.  And I say this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  And tell  your $1200 an hour lawyers - no disrespect; they're good - but tell them  you want it written in English.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Sen.  Kennedy joins us tonight.  Senator, thanks for coming on.</p><p> SEN.  JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  You bet.</p><p> CARLSON:  What was the point of this hearing there?  What laws are you all  considering to constrain Facebook?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Tucker, I was mildly disappointed with the hearing.  I mean, I  wanted the point to be - I wanted Mr.  Zuckerberg to step up to the plate  and say, look - three words - I'm on it.  I get it.  It can be fixed.  I'm  going to fix it.  And we'll do it together.  That's not what I heard.  I  just didn't feel like we connected with Mr.  Zuckerberg today.</p><p> I mean, look, Facebook is an extraordinary company.  It's done magical  things, but it's clear that the digital promised land has some minefields  in it.  One is the privacy issue; the other is the propaganda.</p><p> And I don't want to have to vote to regulate Facebook, but, my God, I will  unless they're willing to step up to the plate and address those two  issues.  I think they can; I hope they can.  If they can't, we've got a  bigger problem than just what we talked about today.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, here you've got the biggest provider of news in the United  States with far more power than William Randolph I ever had with a long and  proven track record of censorship in this country and other countries, with  the power to change election results.</p><p> You don't think that's enough of a threat right there to act?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, I think that's a very important issue.  Sen.  Cruz and Sen.   Sasse made that point.  I ran out of time.  I wanted to make that point.</p><p> And I think it's true.  Poison is being spread on social media.  OK.   What's poison?  Define poison.  </p><p> And, look, I wanted - a lot of our Democratic friends have made a big deal  about, well, Cambridge Analytica may work with President Trump.  I wanted  to ask Mr.  Zuckerberg today about this statement that was made by somebody  - a Ms.  Carol Davidson from President Obama's election campaign in 2012.</p><p> This is what she says.  She ran media analytics for the president.  She  said, \"Facebook was very candid that they allowed us to do things they  wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\"</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> KENNEDY:  I wanted to ask if that's an accurate statement, but I ran out of  time.</p><p> CARLSON:  Finally, the Congress would have really uniquely the ability to  get this under control, if you think that too much power is vested in one  company and they're, in effect, enemies of the First Amendment.</p><p> I know Republicans don't like to regulate things, but do you think we're  approaching a point where - for the good of the public - that may need to  be done?</p><p> KENNEDY:  I don't think we're there yet, but I think a lot of it depends on  how Mr.  Zuckerberg reacts to this.</p><p> I'll say it again.  There are two issues.  One is a privacy problem.  The  other is a propaganda problem.  And the issue there is how do we solve it  without impinging on people's First Amendment rights?</p><p> Now, that's a tough one.  </p><p> CARLSON:  It is a tough one.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  And I want to be assured.  Didn't get it today.  Maybe we'll get  it in the second round that Facebook is not politically biased one way or  the other.</p><p> I don't want him pitching for the Republicans.  I don't want him pitching  for the Democrats either.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  Well, they are.  Senator, thank you.  Great to see you.</p><p> KENNEDY:  You bet, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  For more discussion of what happened today, Dave Maney is a tech  entrepreneur and a fan of Facebook, Roger McNamee who was one of Facebook's  first investors and now a critic sometimes of the company.  Both of them  join us.</p><p> So, Roger, first to you.  The head of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg said today  that he and the company are happy to censor hate speech, but was unclear  exactly on what hate speech is.  And then, suggested that maybe artificial  intelligence will settle that question.</p><p> If you care about freedom of speech, does that make you uncomfortable?</p><p> ROGER MCNAMEE, ZUCKERBERG'S FORMER MENTOR:  I think the whole thing makes  me uncomfortable, Tucker.  </p><p> I think the fundamental issue we've got here is its business model is based  on inflammatory emotions - anger and fear.  </p><p> And once you build a business model on that, it's really - the genie is out  of the bottle and there's no way to put it back in.  And Facebook has shown  itself to be less than good at managing the dialogue on its site.</p><p> And as you pointed out, they are absolutely editing everything.  There are  a million different things they could show me at any moment in time.  They  pick the 20 that serve their business model best.</p><p> And quite clearly, they have failed on that, precisely as Sen.  Kennedy  just described.</p><p> CARLSON:  Dave, we had a researcher on, a psychologist recently called  Robert Epstein and he's taken a look at a bunch of different tech  companies.</p><p> And he said specifically about Facebook, if Mark Zuckerberg had sent a  targeted message to people identified on Facebook as Hillary voters and  encouraged them to vote, he estimates it could have changed the vote total  by 450,000 on election day 2016 and changed the course of the election.</p><p> That's a lot of power for one media company to have.  Even if you are for  Mark Zuckerberg's political views, should any company have the ability to  change election outcomes the way Facebook does?</p><p> DAVE MANEY, TECH ENTREPRENEUR:  I think you're giving him too much credit.   First of all, I'm not a fan of that political worldview.  I am a fan of  free enterprise and letting them do what they will.</p><p> I mean, by that standard, how many people vote does \"The New York Times\"  editorial choosing a candidate or anybody else is making influence?</p><p> So, I'm very wary of the Facebook site as a user.  But this discussion  about should we censor them and knock-back their political influence and  are they a gigantic monopoly, I mean, I think that's crazy.</p><p> CARLSON:  But they're literally a monopoly.  </p><p> MANEY:  They're not a monopoly, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  They are.  They are actually because I know the numbers.  I've  worked in (INAUDIBLE) a lot for eight years.</p><p> Let me just give you the following number.  So, Facebook and Google control  over 90 percent of digital ads.  So, that means if you run news or anything  else that's ad supported online, you're beholden to them.  They control the  market completely.  Why is that not a monopoly?</p><p> MANEY:  If you want to say it's a monopoly for digital ads, that's fine.   If you want to say it's a monopoly for political content, it's not.</p><p> CARLSON:  But hold on.  Digital ads are what supports all online news  coverage apart from the non-profits.  That's the whole point.  You control  the ads, you control the company.</p><p> MANEY:  Tucker, are you worried about a monopoly in the digital ad business  or are you worried about a concentration of political power?</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I don't think there's a distinction between those two  things.  I'm worried that, in the addition to both, by the total inability  of the Congress to respond to a looming threat to its own legitimacy from  Facebook and Google.  Roger, am I being insane here?  I don't think that I  am.</p><p> MCNAMEE:  Tucker, I'm on your side on this issue because, at the end of the  day, the problem we have here is a massive concentration of power.  And  that concentration of power is in the hands of people who preserve the  rights of the First Amendment for their corporation, but they tend to  overlook the First Amendment rights of the people who are the users of the  sites.</p><p> And in that process, I mean, what we have is these things that are global,  they are influencing democracy all around the world and we can't find a  single example of them influencing it for the better.</p><p> And I'm with the Sen.  Kennedy.  This thing has gone on both sides.  We've  seen massive abuses of Facebook on both sides of this thing.  And It  doesn't look good either way.</p><p> And we need to reduce Facebook's influence, so that we don't have it  determining the outcome of any election, whether it's 2012, 2016, 2018, or  2020.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I think that's right because, in the end, Dave, this is not  an American company or, more precisely, a company that sees itself as an  American company.  I would argue that, in effect, is, but they don't see  that.  Google doesn't either.  They're companies of the world.</p><p> And yet, they have more influence potentially over our voting patterns than  Russia or China or any other government.  So, like, why wouldn't that be a  threat to democracy?</p><p> MCNAMEE:  And the worst part of it, Tucker, is they behave as though they  don't have any influence; and as a result, bad actors have been able to  manipulate the system, essentially undefended.</p><p> And to David, my simple point here is that, having watched this company  from its earliest days, it has evolved into something very different than  it started out as.  And I too am a believer in free enterprise, but I'm a  bigger believer in democracy and I don't believe any company's rights come  before the rights of the people of the United States.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, David, I'm going to let you sum it up.  Does any of this  bother you?  I get that you're for free enterprise.  I admire that.  But  does any of this bother you at all?  </p><p> MANEY:  I largely stopped using the app in January when I went through  their latest news revision to decide what I could see and not see.  But  that doesn't mean that I believe that Sen.  Kennedy or those other  knuckleheads down there today in that hearing, which gives - I'd say it was  a goat rodeo, but that's unfair to goat rodeos.</p><p> Like, you can't let those people make those decisions.  Consumers have to  make those decisions.  And your assertion that it's an unbreakable  monopoly, it's just not.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, it's not only unbreakable, it's growing in its part.   Anyway, thank you both.  We're out of time sadly.  Appreciate it.</p><p> Tonight, in just the past 12 minutes, we've seen evidence that two other  cable networks are colluding with \"The New York Times\" to put out negative  stories on the Trump administration.  Sort of.  </p><p> Our proof and both Brit Hume and Professor Jonathan Turley coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  \"CNN\", \"MSNBC\", and \"The New York Times\" are working together  tonight to push a new story about the Trump administration.  </p><p> At the top of the hour, \"MSNBC\" put on Maggie Haberman.  \"CNN\" put on  Michael Schmidt.  Those two are both \"Times\" reporters.  And they co- authored a piece in that newspaper, saying that Donald Trump attempted to  fire Robert Mueller in December.  Mueller is still there, of course.</p><p> The Mueller investigation, you'll remember, was officially created to  uncover Russian hacking into the American democracy because they hacked our  democracy.</p><p> But that's not what it is anymore.  It is now an all-purpose probe into the  president, his personal and financial life.  It's designed to make us feel  safer.  I hope you feel safer.</p><p> Yesterday, FBI agents raided the office of Michael Cohen.  That's the  president's personal lawyer, apparently looking for evidence about payments  to Stormy Daniels, the porn star who is not from Russia and who did not  hack our election in any case.</p><p> Over on \"MSNBC\", Steve Schmidt noted that the men who wrote the  constitution would be thrilled by this.  They always hated the Bill of  Rights, those guys.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE SCHMIDT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" CORRESPONDENT:  If you listen closely  tonight, you can hear the faint applause from heaven of this country's  founding fathers who bequeathed to us a nation where the rule of law is  supreme.  We are a nation of laws.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  The founders wanted to know, did the money go to Stormy  Daniels?  What happened to Stormy Daniels?</p><p> Jonathan Turley is a professor at George Washington University's School of  Law and he joins us tonight.  </p><p> So, I think, professor, you were one of the trustworthy people in this  conversation.  I don't even know what your politics are.  I don't think we  even agree politically, but whatever.  I trust your legal views.</p><p> What do you make of this raid on the president's lawyer's offices?</p><p> JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW PROFESSOR:   Well, part of this is of Cohen's making, in the sense that Cohen tends to  blur his relationships between being a lawyer, a fixer and a business  partner.</p><p> That's dangerous under any circumstances, but it's particularly dangerous  if you're going to invoke the attorney-client attorney privilege because,  first, you have to prove that you're acting like an attorney.</p><p> And he may have trouble with that.  When you look at the Stormy Daniels  agreement, it's still not clear what role he's playing there, whether he's  this company he created, whether he's Trump's lawyer, that's going to come  back to haunt him and haunt the president when they say some of this stuff  should remain confidential.</p><p> But I think the president is right, in a sense that whenever you have a  raid on an attorney's office, it should raise very troubling concerns for  everyone.</p><p> I mean, this is a serious problem when someone can't rely on their  attorney.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, is the core potential violation here that the payments to  Stormy Daniels - Ms.  Daniels, we'll call her - were some form of campaign  finance violations?</p><p> TURLEY:  Well, actually, that is strengthening with some of the statements  made publicly.  When the president said, I didn't know anything about this  payment, it sounds a lot like what's called an in-kind campaign  contribution.</p><p> And that's what John Edwards was charged with and prosecuted for.  He  ultimately was not convicted of that.  But, yes, they could make a case  like that.</p><p> But, supposedly, the warrant covers everything from Stormy Daniels to taxi  medallions.  And there's a lot in between.</p><p> CARLSON:  Is there any indication that Stormy Daniels was working with  Russian agents to influence the outcome of the election, that she was  herself part of the hacking of our democracy?</p><p> TURLEY:  Well, I'm not familiar with all of her movies, but no.  But, no,  I'm not familiar with -</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  So, I guess, we can say that the nature of the investigation  has changed profoundly.</p><p> TURLEY:  Oh, absolutely.  Now, there's no question that this is a far off  the mark.  So was Manafort.</p><p> What's actually sort of fascinating about this is that Rod Rosenstein  didn't have much of a problem when Mueller came to him and said I want to  expand Manafort's investigation to include stuff that occurred years before  and were not connected to the campaign.</p><p> Some of this stuff is actually closer, and yet Rosenstein said I want the  southern district to do this.</p><p> CARLSON:  Could Rosenstein have said, \"No, that's not the original charter  of this, that's not the point of this investigation?</p><p> TURLEY:  He could have, but it gets a little bit tough.  If Mueller came to  him and said, \"Look, we have evidence of crime that we have uncovered,\"  it's hard not to give that to a prosecutor to look at.</p><p> We don't know what was shown to Rod Rosenstein.  And that's part of the  problem.</p><p> CARLSON:  I think what you're saying is you would have to be either dumb or  an active drug user to allow an independent counsel investigation to start.</p><p> TURLEY:  Well, I think that - look, this is one of those things where it's  easy to unleash the dogs of war.  It's harder to get them back.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  I know.</p><p> TURLEY:  And a special counsel is a torpedo in the water, to use another  metaphor.  And he's still there.  </p><p> And what's interesting about this move is that they haven't just expanded  the investigation, they've expanded the prosecutors.</p><p> So, now, even if the president moved against Rosenstein, moved against  Mueller, it wouldn't necessarily stop with the southern district.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  Thank you for that.  Professor Jonathan Turley, appreciate  it.</p><p> Democrats are gearing up for an impeachment push against the president.   What's the point of that and what will the outcome of it be, assuming they  take back the House in the midterm?  Brit Hume joins us next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With all of this turmoil, particularly this last  week, has the president at any time thought about stepping down before or  now?</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  No.  And I think  that's an absolutely ridiculous question.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, nobody can quite in the light of day tell you why the  Stormy Daniels story is so significant, but clearly it is judging by the  air time it gets.  It's more important than the looming war in Syria, more  important than the fact our economy is being eclipsed by China, more  important than the vanishing American middle class or the tens of thousands  who will die of drug ODs this year.</p><p> In fact, it matters so much that President Trump should consider leaving  office over it.  Does anyone who doesn't work in the media believe that?</p><p> Brit Hume is our senior political analyst here at Fox and he joins us  tonight.  So, Brit - and maybe I'm blinded by my reflexive revulsion about  this story, but is it?  In the scheme of stories concerning the world is on  fire and changing faster than we can keep up with, is the Stormy Daniels  story as significant as the airtime it's getting, do you think?</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Of course, it's not.</p><p> CARLSON:  Thank you.</p><p> HUME:  The big problem with the story from the start has been this.  It  doesn't tell us anything about Donald Trump that we didn't already know or  should have known.  </p><p> Indeed, this story itself came out - at least a piece of it that he had  this liaison with her came out before the election.</p><p> Americans who voted for and against Donald Trump knew, or should have  known, that he was a habitual philanderer.  He had made a great public  spectacle of it in the past, that he was a man with a taste for flashy  women.</p><p> The story was entirely credible and remains so to this day.  And the fact  that he denies is a detail.  I don't think most of the people who are for  him think that his denial is true, but it simply doesn't rise to the kind  of level you're talking about here unless you want to take very seriously  the possibility that the money paid to keep her from blurting all this out  sooner was a campaign contribution that well exceeded the proper limits for  campaign contributions.</p><p> That is about as big as you can get it to be as far as we know.</p><p> CARLSON:  That seems like a pretty tenuous connection to news.  Just me.   By the way, the other channels have covered this exclusively since we  started 28 minutes ago.  I mean, that's all they've covered for this hour  so far.</p><p> HUME:  Well, I think there's a lot of excitement about the search of the  Cohen offices and so on, but the question that still you have to answer  here is what really is the underlying crime and does it rise to the level  of something for purposes of impeachment or as the questioner at the  briefing said the possibility that Trump would resign.</p><p> That's an interesting question, of course, Tucker.  Does anything about  Trump's behavior in reaction to any of this suggest that this is a man  contemplating quitting?</p><p> CARLSON:  No!</p><p> HUME:  I would say, obviously, palpably not.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm not sure that he or anyone in the White House fully  understands what would happen if Democrats take the House this fall as many  polls suggest they will.</p><p> It seems like the very top of their agenda will be impeaching President  Trump.  That's what their voters want.</p><p> Yesterday, Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who is running against Cruz  in the Senate race, said he would vote to impeach Trump, although he  acknowledged it wouldn't make sense to do it right now.</p><p> But Democratic voters want impeachment.  Do you think Democratic members,  if they take control of the House, can do anything but start an  impeachment?</p><p> HUME:  I think there'll be moves in that direction.  Of course, the last  time this was done, in the case of Bill Clinton and the judges there were  among other perjury and obstruction of justice that were pretty thoroughly  documented - he had, obviously, lied to a grand jury.  They did it.  </p><p> They impeached him in the House and he was not anywhere near convicted in  the Senate and he ended up leaving office in something like a blaze of  glory and it kind of backfired politically on the Republicans.  And  Democratic politicians - those in the House of Representatives - might be  given some pause by how all that turned out.</p><p> But you're right about the base.  The Democratic base cannot the stand the  ground that Trump walks on.  They want him out and they want him impeached  and they want their members to be part of the resistance.</p><p> Little Mr.  O'Rourke running against Ted Cruz in Texas seemed a little  confused about how impeachment works because he's running for the Senate  and the Senate doesn't vote to impeach.  The House votes to impeach.  The  Senate votes on whether or not to convict.</p><p> But that aside, his sentiments reflect that of many Democrats.  And I think  there will be a move to do it if, in fact, they get control of the House.   How well it will work out for them politically remains to be seen.</p><p> CARLSON:  It does remain to be seen.  Brit Hume, thanks as always.  Great  to see you.</p><p> HUME:  You bet.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, all the geniuses here in Washington are unanimous on this  question.  We must attack Syria and anyone who asks questions about why we  must attack Syria is, obviously, by definition, working for Vladimir Putin.</p><p> How has this happened?  How has almost everybody in power lined up behind  yet another military intervention?  Is the public crying out for one?   Glenn Greenwald has watched this fairly carefully and he joins us next with  an answer.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, virtually, all of official Washington - Republicans and  Democrats - have united behind the idea that the United States has a moral  obligation to go deeper into war in Syria.</p><p> We already have thousands of troops in Syria, but you wouldn't know it from  watching the other Robert Mueller based channels.  They're all Stormy  Daniels all the time.  But it's true we do.</p><p> And one American soldier had already died in Syria.  We've killed hundreds  of Russian citizens so far there and lobbed in a serious of cruise  missiles.  But that's not enough, the pundits say.  We need a real war,  something big and deadly, primarily to avenge the Syrian President Assad's  poison gas attack on his own citizens over the weekend.</p><p> Here is some of the growing consensus on that.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRAHAM:  Assad and his inner circle should be considered war criminals,  legitimate military targets.  If you have the opportunity to take him out,  you should.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's very clear to me that this president, after  using such rhetoric on Sunday, has to take stronger military action than we  did last year.</p><p> REP.  JIM HINES (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  We have a leader who is  now a war criminal supported by the Iranians and the Russians.  That  demands a strong and risky response.  </p><p> If the West won't stand up when a leader uses gas multiple times against  his own people, we live in a very dangerous world.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, that's the consensus.  Last night, we asked the obvious  questions about it.  Before we go to war, are we sure all of this is real?   Do we really know that Assad was behind the gas attack?</p><p> It's not a defense of Assad, but it's an obvious question.  How could we  know that conclusively so soon after the attack happened?  We didn't have  any Americans on the ground?  And why would Assad do that given the  certainty it would hurt his own interests?</p><p> And while we're on the subject, by the way, why is a war in Syria a good  idea for the United States in the first place?  How would it make us safer,  happier, more prosperous?</p><p> Those seem like reasonable questions to us.  In fact, the exact questions  you'd want your policymakers to ask.  But, no, they're not asking them.   And they're offended to hear them.</p><p> The first person we asked those questions to, Republican Senator Roger  Wicker of Mississippi implied that we were somehow allied with Vladimir  Putin just for asking.  Other than that, Wicker had no answers at all.  It  was embarrassing and he didn't seem embarrassed at all.</p><p> Others just denounced us right off the top.  Jennifer Rubin of \"The  Washington Post\" tweeted this, \"He is insane,\" meaning me.  \"Fox is not a  news organization.  That is all.\" </p><p> Noah Rothman of \"Commentary\" called the show \"nothing less than undiluted  Russian propaganda.  </p><p> Seth Mandel of \"The New York Post\" summarized the criticism perfectly when  he tweeted this, \"shut the F up.\"</p><p> These are journalists, by the way.  No explanation.  Of course, shutting  the F up is the whole point of tweets like that.  They want you to be  quiet.  They want you to do what you're told.  No more questions, shut up  and obey.  There's no chance of that, though.  Sorry.</p><p> Glenn Greenwald has been following all of this.  He's a founding editor at  \"The Intercept\" and he joins us tonight.  So, Glenn, leaving aside the real  question of how you should respond to Syria and is it a threat to the world  order and to us and to its neighbors, I think those are all fair questions,  but why the universal attempt in the media here in this country - left and  right - to shut down a meaningful conversation about it?</p><p> GLENN GREENWALD, \"THE INTERCEPT\" FOUNDING EDITOR:  The only time, I think,  that the media praised Donald Trump was almost one year ago today when he  bombed an airfield in Syria in response to what had been alleged at the  time was a chemical attack by the Assad regime.</p><p> People who hate Donald Trump and go on air every day took a break for 24  hours to proclaim him presidential because that's what US presidents in  their eyes do as they just drop bombs on other countries with no  declaration of war, no reason why US interest or the US borders are at  stake when it happens.</p><p> So, I think that's just the ethos in Washington that not only is it just an  inherently good and presidential thing to do, to drop bombs on other  countries.  That's why polls around the world show that the greatest threat  to world peace in the eyes of the public around the world is the United  States.</p><p> But also, Adam Smith wrote 300 years ago that the reason people who live in  capitals and the elites in countries love to watch their countries bomb  other countries is because it gives them a sense of excitement and purpose  and kind of this pulsating stimulation.  And I think that's a really big  part of it.  </p><p> It doesn't matter whether it will accomplish anything.  It just makes us  feel strong and powerful and purposeful to do.  And so, bombs away.</p><p> CARLSON:  I think that's right.  I mean, I think human nature explains a  lot of this.  I agree completely.  But journalists exist to push back  against that.  Not necessarily against war, but against a feverish rush  toward anything.  I mean, our job is to be skeptical and ask real  questions.  Why is no one doing that and anyone who does is attacked?</p><p> GREENWALD:  So, just about every name that you mentioned in the media who  attacked you for raising questions about whether or not we ought to  actually go and bomb another country are all essentially neocons.</p><p> The same people who were doing this in 2002 and 2003, saying anyone who  asked questions about whether we should actually go to war and remove  Saddam Hussein was an admirer of the Saddam Hussein.</p><p> They did the same in 2011 when it came time to remove Gaddafi.  They said  if you're against that war, it means you love Gaddafi and you want to see  him slaughter people.  It's just the standard tactic.</p><p> And what we have now is this kind of union between neocons, who have now  once again kind of been embraced by both the establishment wings of the  Republican and Democratic Party and the militarists in both parties, people  like Lindsey Graham and lots of Democrats who love every single war.</p><p> And so, this climate arises that you're just supposed to cheer when it  comes time to drop bombs on other countries, not ask whether there's  evidence to justify it, not ask whether it will do any good, not ask  whether it will kill any civilians.</p><p> And if you do ask those questions, it means you're on the side of America's  enemies.  It's an incredibly authoritarian tactic that gets used to  suppress debate.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yeah, it's poison.  I agree.  Glenn Greenwald, thank you as  always.  </p><p> GREENWALD:  Good to be with you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Richard Goodstein is an attorney who advised both of Hillary  Clinton's campaigns and he supports strikes on Syria.  Richard joins us  tonight.</p><p> So, look, it seems to me, no matter what conclusion you reach, the first  question for everybody ought to be the same, which is how is this in  America's strategic interest.  And I haven't met a single person who could  answer it or is even willing to try.  That's a problem, wouldn't you say?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER:  It would be if there  really was no answer.</p><p> I did see your interview with Sen.  Wicker last night.  You asked the  question, how do even know Assad was behind this?</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Because Gen.  Mattis basically said we weren't sure.  But what  we know is that a UN Commission saw links between sarin gas that we know  was used and had the hallmarks of what the -</p><p> CARLSON:  Sure.  Look, I'm totally open-minded.  I'm not here flacking for  Assad.  My God! I just want to be certain that we are acting on the basis  of verifiable information.  And in the case of this last weekend's attack  with the chlorine gas, let's just stop lying, there is no way that we could  know in 48 hours, 24 hours when the cable news shows start pushing for war  that Assad was behind this.  So, let's stop lying.  That's my only point.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Well, I'm not sure who it is - look, it had all the hallmarks  of something that we know Assad did.  He was destroying towns willy-nilly.</p><p> And the notion that somehow the rebels would kill their own women and  children and have them foaming at the mouth and so forth to make a point  for CNN or Fox, that seems a bit much, right?</p><p> But I think what we're trying to do is -</p><p> CARLSON:  Really, it's a bit much?  OK.  So, the first sarin gas attack  took place within a week of the Trump administration saying we're no longer  going to try to remove Assad from power.  That happened.  Bam, we went  right back to the original policy.</p><p> This attack took place less than a week after the Trump people said we are  going to pull our troops out.  </p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, look, I don't know who did it.  I'm not accusing anybody.   I'm merely saying there's clearly questions that we need to be asking about  this.  And anyone who does, I'm a living example of this, is shouted down  and called a poodle of Putin.  Like, that's insane.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  I wish I took as much pleasure from my critics coming after me  as you do incidentally.  So, I applaud you for feeling the umbrage that you  do.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm attacked all the time.  I don't care.  I care about when and  where we commit American troops.  I have a son who is 21.  This is not a  joke.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Right.  So, it's not a question, frankly, of committing troops.   Sure, there will be troops.  We're talking about degrading their air force,  degrading their helicopters, doing something frankly that we didn't do.</p><p> CARLSON:  What does degrading mean?</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  It means basically have so many -</p><p> CARLSON:  Killing people.  Let's not use euphemisms here.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Fine.  Let's blow up airplanes and helicopters.  If there are  people in it, so be it.  They made their choice to align with Assad and  these are the very people who we've seen are dropping - I think we actually  have had photographic evidence, dropping chlorine bombs on civilian  populations.</p><p> So, do I feel badly about that?  No.  Do I think it's something United  States should be doing?  Yes.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But hold on.  What's the goal?  Just let's be really clear We  take Assad out, and don't tell me that's not the plan.  When you wage war  against a government, you're not rooting for its continuation.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  No.</p><p> CARLSON:  Who runs Syria?  And I'm saying I don't know actually if taking  him out is the objective.  And I agree with you.  Just continue the war,  kill more people.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  I think the objective is so that Assad knows that his dropping  chlorine gas on people is something where he's going to pay a price.  And  he has did it.  </p><p> And I think we have to establish whether he did it or not.  And the fact is  it shouldn't be a feel-good exercise like it was last year.  When Trump was  basically talking about that great piece of chocolate cake with Xi, the  time he was dropping bombs on those runways, that was a feel-good exercise.</p><p> If we're going to do something, we should do something, so that Assad can't  do it as easily.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But we don't that he did do it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  I agree.</p><p> CARLSON:  Does it bother you when there's universal consensus on the left  and among established Republicans that we just know, and like stop asking  questions, let's just go ahead and do this for reasons that we can't fully  explain, we can't tell you how it's going to make you richer or safer or  happier, but just shut up and do it anyway?  Does it bother you?</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Well, it will make us better because we think we need to go  after war crimes.  The question is whether Assad did it.  It has all the  hallmarks of Assad.  I don't blame people for concluding it did.</p><p> Do we need to establish with some certainty that it was Assad?  Yes, we  should probably do that.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, every time a government does something appalling or kill  civilians, we need to bomb them.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  No.</p><p> CARLSON:  No.  OK, right.  </p><p>GOODSTEIN:  We can't address every war crime.  But those that we can  address, yes, I think we should.</p><p> CARLSON:  Just so we can.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Plenty more.  I grant you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  All right.  Richard, thank you.  </p><p>GOODSTEIN:  My pleasure.</p><p> CARLSON:  My head is spinning.</p><p> One of the Internet's top prostitution sites just shut down and feminists  are delighted.  Wait, what?  No, they're furious.  It's getting confusing  in feminist world.  So, we're going to explain it to you.  Is prostitution  pro-women?  Or is it the exploitation of women?  We'll get the new line on  that.  Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  The site backpage.com - it's a classified ad site - has been shut  down and several top officials who work there have got in trouble.  They've  been indicted over allegations that that site facilitated prostitution and  child sex trafficking.</p><p> You would think feminists would be happy about this, and some are.  But  others are outraged by it.  </p><p> Women's March tweeted, \"The shutting down of Backpage is an absolute crisis  for sex workers.  That's the new term for prostitutes who rely on that site  to safely get in touch with clients.  Sex workers' rights are women's  rights.</p><p> Amy Peikoff is a talk show host and a feminist who supports keeping  Backpage up and she joins us tonight.  Amy, great to see you.</p><p> AMY PEIKOFF, TALK SHOW HOST AND FEMINIST:  Hi, Tucker.  Thanks for having  me back again.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, I know that you're a libertarian.  I don't agree with you,  but I certainly respect it.  I think it's an intellectually coherent way to  look at the world.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  But I also know you are a feminist.  And they seem at odds with  each other.  </p><p> So, the libertarian side of you would say, people have a right to enter  into voluntary contracts.  Prostitution falls under that heading.  It's  fine.</p><p> But the feminist part of you can't really believe that prostitution is  empowering to women because it's the opposite of that.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  Right.  But here's the thing, we're talking about government  shutting down a website.  And regardless of what you and I, Tucker, think  ethically about prostitution and other types of sex work, the question to  ask is whether it violates anyone's rights.</p><p> And we need to, in order to empower women, leave all choices up to them in  terms of how to conduct their own personal sex lives and everything else.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  That's the libertarian side.  And I get that.  I mean,  again, I don't fully agree with it, but I think it's a reasonable thing to  say.</p><p> But the feminist position has nothing to do with that.  The feminist  position is about empowerment and dignity and not objectifying women,  reducing them to their physical appearance, which is, of course, what  prostitution does.  It degrades women completely.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  My version - I mean, insofar as I consider myself a feminist, I  consider myself a feminist in terms of protecting women's rights.  So,  whenever there's an actual threat to women's rights, I'm going to be there  and argue against whatever it is and say that we need to take some action  accordingly.</p><p> But insofar as this website was just facilitating transactions having to do  with prostitution or other types of sex work, then there's no rights  violation and you need to leave the choice up to the women.</p><p> We're not going to - it's not the American way to force a particular type  of lifestyle choice on someone just because you disagree with it from your  own ethical perspective.  We need to back up and look at the perspective of  the individual rights.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  But that doesn't mean that all \"lifestyle choices\" are  the same.  And I don't know why a feminist group like Women's March would  describe as prostitutes as \"sex workers.\" </p><p> Many of them are really young.  They are being pimped out by older men and  sleeping with creepy - I mean, the whole thing is like disgusting actually.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  But that problem would be only worse.  That problem would be only  worse, as I understand it, if there are not online opportunities for these  women.</p><p> And, Tucker, there are two further kind of troubling implications of  something like this, shutting down a site like backpage.com.  One is that  is in conjunction with a couple of pieces of legislation that are also  troubling, designed to remove content about sex off of the Internet.</p><p> And I myself, I think that sex is a good thing.  I don't think we should be  shutting down content on the Internet.  And there's been a lot of  preemptive removing of content from Reddit and other sites because of this.</p><p> And the second thing is that I think this is ominous in terms of other  types of websites and tech companies coming under government control in the  future.</p><p> I mean, we just saw Zuckerberg in front of Congress today and you think,  oh, well, right now, it's just a prostitution and sex trafficking website,  but next it's going to be Tinder because people are using that to hook up  and it's sex and maybe we can get away with controlling that or shutting  that down.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  I guess I used to feel that way.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  And then, it will be Facebook and Twitter.  And this is the  problem, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  And I literally can't wait for that day, to be honest with you.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  But today's websites, Tucker, they are not only the method of  distributing content, including all of the content that is necessary to  change the culture for the better, they also collect information about  users.</p><p> So, it's a very different type of media.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm aware of it.  But let me just ask you - hold on.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  We have to be very careful about putting that under government  control because I think you would agree with me - </p><p> CARLSON:  I think you think the government is more sinister, I would not  agree with you.  I agree with you ten years ago back when I was a mindless  libertarian who thought that government was the greatest threat to our  freedom.  But government is elected.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  OK.  So, we do not want to end up in Orwell's 1984.  We do not  want to end up in Orwell's 1984.  And if you think that information is  troubling in the hands of somebody who wants to make money, think of it in  the hands of government.</p><p> CARLSON:  Which is elected, unlike Zuckerberg.  But, Amy, thank you.  It's  always nice to have you here.  I like smart guests and you are.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Mark Zuckerberg, testifying on the Hill, it's a big story.  But  another tech titan has revealed his vision of the future and it will wreck  your night.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Mark Zuckerberg consuming all the headline space recently.  And  that's lucky for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who just revealed his terrifying  vision of this country's future.</p><p> Last week, Dorsey shared an article he called \"great read\".  The article  was published on Medium.  It says that there is no bipartisan future for  the country.  One side must win and totally destroy the other.</p><p> The piece describes the country as in a non-violent civil war now.  And the  only way forward, it says, is to do what California has done.  </p><p> The piece is pretty explicit about that, import a voter base until  elections are mere formalities as they are in California.  End all debate.   Allow only the left to speak.</p><p> In other words, make America a lot more like Twitter, a one-party state  where armies of serfs happily serve tech gods like, well, Jack Dorsey.   That's the future they are all hoping for.  And now you know.  </p><p> We didn't have anything about sex-crazed pandas tonight, but we're on that  because we're journalists.  So, stay tuned in the rest of the week for  developments.  That's it for us.  </p><p> In New York, right now, Sean Hannity is standing by.  Here he is.</p><p> END</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

What is it?  In a minute, Brit Hume and  Professor Jonathan Turley join us to spell that out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But, first, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent hours on Capitol Hill today  taking questions from senators about Facebook's role in the 2016 election  and in American society more generally.  We'll talk to one of the senators  who was there and spoke to Zuckerberg and more broadly what it meant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But, first, Brett Larson, an anchor at \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\", who  covers tech for our show, has the big moments from today.  Brett?</p><p> BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS ANCHOR, \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\":  It was quite the  day, Tucker.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg checked in with Congress today  for day one of hearings.</p><p> And we learned a little bit about the inner workings of the social media  giant.  One thing we heard repeatedly was exactly what Facebook is and is  not.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  What you think of as the Facebook service,  everyone has control every single time that they go to share that, they can  delete that data anytime they want, full control for the majority of the  data.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  Sharing everything?  Not so much.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr.  Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p> DURBIN:  I think that might be what this is all about.  Your right to  privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  But with 2.2 billion users and in the wake of concerns about more  than 80 million users having their data stolen by political consulting  firm, Cambridge Analytica, is Facebook your only choice?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  If I buy a Ford and it doesn't  work well and I don't like it, I can buy a Chevy.  If I'm upset with  Facebook, what's the equivalent product that I can go sign up for?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  The second category that I was going to talk about - </p><p> GRAHAM:  I'm not talking about categories.  I'm talking about, is there  real competition you face?  You don't think you have a monopoly?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.</p><p> GRAHAM:  OK.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  There is also concerns, Tucker, about First Amendment rights and  just what control the social media giant has over what you see, say, and  share.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  You say that you have 15,000 to 20,000 people  working on security and content review.  Do you know the political  orientation of those 15,000 to 20,000 people engaged in content review?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No, senator.  We do not generally ask people about their  political orientation when they're joining the company.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  Sen.  Ben Sasse asked a similar question about censorship on the  site and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the speech they censor is any time  someone pushes to hurt others.  Sen.  Sasse was also concerned about  addiction to the social media site.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA:  As a dad, do you worry about social media  addiction as a problem for America's teens?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Well, my hope is that we can be idealistic, but have a broad  view of our responsibility.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARSON:  And, Tucker, we will get more from Zuckerberg tomorrow when he  sits down for day two.  He's certainly been very frank in his responses and  a little obtuse about specifics, which made the lack of understanding of  exactly how Facebook works and our understanding of it very clear.</p><p> CARLSON:  Thanks for that, Brett.  Appreciate it.  Sen.  John Kennedy of  Louisiana was one of the many senators who spoke to Zuckerberg today.   Here's part of it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN.  JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Here's what everybody's been trying to  tell you today.  And I say this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  And tell  your $1200 an hour lawyers - no disrespect; they're good - but tell them  you want it written in English.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Sen.  Kennedy joins us tonight.  Senator, thanks for coming on.</p><p> SEN.  JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  You bet.</p><p> CARLSON:  What was the point of this hearing there?  What laws are you all  considering to constrain Facebook?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Tucker, I was mildly disappointed with the hearing.  I mean, I  wanted the point to be - I wanted Mr.  Zuckerberg to step up to the plate  and say, look - three words - I'm on it.  I get it.  It can be fixed.  I'm  going to fix it.  And we'll do it together.  That's not what I heard.  I  just didn't feel like we connected with Mr.  Zuckerberg today.</p><p> I mean, look, Facebook is an extraordinary company.  It's done magical  things, but it's clear that the digital promised land has some minefields  in it.  One is the privacy issue; the other is the propaganda.</p><p> And I don't want to have to vote to regulate Facebook, but, my God, I will  unless they're willing to step up to the plate and address those two  issues.  I think they can; I hope they can.  If they can't, we've got a  bigger problem than just what we talked about today.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, here you've got the biggest provider of news in the United  States with far more power than William Randolph I ever had with a long and  proven track record of censorship in this country and other countries, with  the power to change election results.</p><p> You don't think that's enough of a threat right there to act?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, I think that's a very important issue.  Sen.  Cruz and Sen.   Sasse made that point.  I ran out of time.  I wanted to make that point.</p><p> And I think it's true.  Poison is being spread on social media.  OK.   What's poison?  Define poison.  </p><p> And, look, I wanted - a lot of our Democratic friends have made a big deal  about, well, Cambridge Analytica may work with President Trump.  I wanted  to ask Mr.  Zuckerberg today about this statement that was made by somebody  - a Ms.  Carol Davidson from President Obama's election campaign in 2012.</p><p> This is what she says.  She ran media analytics for the president.  She  said, \"Facebook was very candid that they allowed us to do things they  wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.\"</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> KENNEDY:  I wanted to ask if that's an accurate statement, but I ran out of  time.</p><p> CARLSON:  Finally, the Congress would have really uniquely the ability to  get this under control, if you think that too much power is vested in one  company and they're, in effect, enemies of the First Amendment.</p><p> I know Republicans don't like to regulate things, but do you think we're  approaching a point where - for the good of the public - that may need to  be done?</p><p> KENNEDY:  I don't think we're there yet, but I think a lot of it depends on  how Mr.  Zuckerberg reacts to this.</p><p> I'll say it again.  There are two issues.  One is a privacy problem.  The  other is a propaganda problem.  And the issue there is how do we solve it  without impinging on people's First Amendment rights?</p><p> Now, that's a tough one.  </p><p> CARLSON:  It is a tough one.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  And I want to be assured.  Didn't get it today.  Maybe we'll get  it in the second round that Facebook is not politically biased one way or  the other.</p><p> I don't want him pitching for the Republicans.  I don't want him pitching  for the Democrats either.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  Well, they are.  Senator, thank you.  Great to see you.</p><p> KENNEDY:  You bet, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  For more discussion of what happened today, Dave Maney is a tech  entrepreneur and a fan of Facebook, Roger McNamee who was one of Facebook's  first investors and now a critic sometimes of the company.  Both of them  join us.</p><p> So, Roger, first to you.  The head of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg said today  that he and the company are happy to censor hate speech, but was unclear  exactly on what hate speech is.  And then, suggested that maybe artificial  intelligence will settle that question.</p><p> If you care about freedom of speech, does that make you uncomfortable?</p><p> ROGER MCNAMEE, ZUCKERBERG'S FORMER MENTOR:  I think the whole thing makes  me uncomfortable, Tucker.  </p><p> I think the fundamental issue we've got here is its business model is based  on inflammatory emotions - anger and fear.  </p><p> And once you build a business model on that, it's really - the genie is out  of the bottle and there's no way to put it back in.  And Facebook has shown  itself to be less than good at managing the dialogue on its site.</p><p> And as you pointed out, they are absolutely editing everything.  There are  a million different things they could show me at any moment in time.  They  pick the 20 that serve their business model best.</p><p> And quite clearly, they have failed on that, precisely as Sen.  Kennedy  just described.</p><p> CARLSON:  Dave, we had a researcher on, a psychologist recently called  Robert Epstein and he's taken a look at a bunch of different tech  companies.</p><p> And he said specifically about Facebook, if Mark Zuckerberg had sent a  targeted message to people identified on Facebook as Hillary voters and  encouraged them to vote, he estimates it could have changed the vote total  by 450,000 on election day 2016 and changed the course of the election.</p><p> That's a lot of power for one media company to have.  Even if you are for  Mark Zuckerberg's political views, should any company have the ability to  change election outcomes the way Facebook does?</p><p> DAVE MANEY, TECH ENTREPRENEUR:  I think you're giving him too much credit.   First of all, I'm not a fan of that political worldview.  I am a fan of  free enterprise and letting them do what they will.</p><p> I mean, by that standard, how many people vote does \"The New York Times\"  editorial choosing a candidate or anybody else is making influence?</p><p> So, I'm very wary of the Facebook site as a user.  But this discussion  about should we censor them and knock-back their political influence and  are they a gigantic monopoly, I mean, I think that's crazy.</p><p> CARLSON:  But they're literally a monopoly.  </p><p> MANEY:  They're not a monopoly, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  They are.  They are actually because I know the numbers.  I've  worked in (INAUDIBLE) a lot for eight years.</p><p> Let me just give you the following number.  So, Facebook and Google control  over 90 percent of digital ads.  So, that means if you run news or anything  else that's ad supported online, you're beholden to them.  They control the  market completely.  Why is that not a monopoly?</p><p> MANEY:  If you want to say it's a monopoly for digital ads, that's fine.   If you want to say it's a monopoly for political content, it's not.</p><p> CARLSON:  But hold on.  Digital ads are what supports all online news  coverage apart from the non-profits.  That's the whole point.  You control  the ads, you control the company.</p><p> MANEY:  Tucker, are you worried about a monopoly in the digital ad business  or are you worried about a concentration of political power?</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I don't think there's a distinction between those two  things.  I'm worried that, in the addition to both, by the total inability  of the Congress to respond to a looming threat to its own legitimacy from  Facebook and Google.  Roger, am I being insane here?  I don't think that I  am.</p><p> MCNAMEE:  Tucker, I'm on your side on this issue because, at the end of the  day, the problem we have here is a massive concentration of power.  And  that concentration of power is in the hands of people who preserve the  rights of the First Amendment for their corporation, but they tend to  overlook the First Amendment rights of the people who are the users of the  sites.</p><p> And in that process, I mean, what we have is these things that are global,  they are influencing democracy all around the world and we can't find a  single example of them influencing it for the better.</p><p> And I'm with the Sen.  Kennedy.  This thing has gone on both sides.  We've  seen massive abuses of Facebook on both sides of this thing.  And It  doesn't look good either way.</p><p> And we need to reduce Facebook's influence, so that we don't have it  determining the outcome of any election, whether it's 2012, 2016, 2018, or  2020.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I think that's right because, in the end, Dave, this is not  an American company or, more precisely, a company that sees itself as an  American company.  I would argue that, in effect, is, but they don't see  that.  Google doesn't either.  They're companies of the world.</p><p> And yet, they have more influence potentially over our voting patterns than  Russia or China or any other government.  So, like, why wouldn't that be a  threat to democracy?</p><p> MCNAMEE:  And the worst part of it, Tucker, is they behave as though they  don't have any influence; and as a result, bad actors have been able to  manipulate the system, essentially undefended.</p><p> And to David, my simple point here is that, having watched this company  from its earliest days, it has evolved into something very different than  it started out as.  And I too am a believer in free enterprise, but I'm a  bigger believer in democracy and I don't believe any company's rights come  before the rights of the people of the United States.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, David, I'm going to let you sum it up.  Does any of this  bother you?  I get that you're for free enterprise.  I admire that.  But  does any of this bother you at all?  </p><p> MANEY:  I largely stopped using the app in January when I went through  their latest news revision to decide what I could see and not see.  But  that doesn't mean that I believe that Sen.  Kennedy or those other  knuckleheads down there today in that hearing, which gives - I'd say it was  a goat rodeo, but that's unfair to goat rodeos.</p><p> Like, you can't let those people make those decisions.  Consumers have to  make those decisions.  And your assertion that it's an unbreakable  monopoly, it's just not.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, it's not only unbreakable, it's growing in its part.   Anyway, thank you both.  We're out of time sadly.  Appreciate it.</p><p> Tonight, in just the past 12 minutes, we've seen evidence that two other  cable networks are colluding with \"The New York Times\" to put out negative  stories on the Trump administration.  Sort of.  </p><p> Our proof and both Brit Hume and Professor Jonathan Turley coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  \"CNN\", \"MSNBC\", and \"The New York Times\" are working together  tonight to push a new story about the Trump administration.  </p><p> At the top of the hour, \"MSNBC\" put on Maggie Haberman.  \"CNN\" put on  Michael Schmidt.  Those two are both \"Times\" reporters.  And they co- authored a piece in that newspaper, saying that Donald Trump attempted to  fire Robert Mueller in December.  Mueller is still there, of course.</p><p> The Mueller investigation, you'll remember, was officially created to  uncover Russian hacking into the American democracy because they hacked our  democracy.</p><p> But that's not what it is anymore.  It is now an all-purpose probe into the  president, his personal and financial life.  It's designed to make us feel  safer.  I hope you feel safer.</p><p> Yesterday, FBI agents raided the office of Michael Cohen.  That's the  president's personal lawyer, apparently looking for evidence about payments  to Stormy Daniels, the porn star who is not from Russia and who did not  hack our election in any case.</p><p> Over on \"MSNBC\", Steve Schmidt noted that the men who wrote the  constitution would be thrilled by this.  They always hated the Bill of  Rights, those guys.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE SCHMIDT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" CORRESPONDENT:  If you listen closely  tonight, you can hear the faint applause from heaven of this country's  founding fathers who bequeathed to us a nation where the rule of law is  supreme.  We are a nation of laws.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  The founders wanted to know, did the money go to Stormy  Daniels?  What happened to Stormy Daniels?</p><p> Jonathan Turley is a professor at George Washington University's School of  Law and he joins us tonight.  </p><p> So, I think, professor, you were one of the trustworthy people in this  conversation.  I don't even know what your politics are.  I don't think we  even agree politically, but whatever.  I trust your legal views.</p><p> What do you make of this raid on the president's lawyer's offices?</p><p> JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW PROFESSOR:   Well, part of this is of Cohen's making, in the sense that Cohen tends to  blur his relationships between being a lawyer, a fixer and a business  partner.</p><p> That's dangerous under any circumstances, but it's particularly dangerous  if you're going to invoke the attorney-client attorney privilege because,  first, you have to prove that you're acting like an attorney.</p><p> And he may have trouble with that.  When you look at the Stormy Daniels  agreement, it's still not clear what role he's playing there, whether he's  this company he created, whether he's Trump's lawyer, that's going to come  back to haunt him and haunt the president when they say some of this stuff  should remain confidential.</p><p> But I think the president is right, in a sense that whenever you have a  raid on an attorney's office, it should raise very troubling concerns for  everyone.</p><p> I mean, this is a serious problem when someone can't rely on their  attorney.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, is the core potential violation here that the payments to  Stormy Daniels - Ms.  Daniels, we'll call her - were some form of campaign  finance violations?</p><p> TURLEY:  Well, actually, that is strengthening with some of the statements  made publicly.  When the president said, I didn't know anything about this  payment, it sounds a lot like what's called an in-kind campaign  contribution.</p><p> And that's what John Edwards was charged with and prosecuted for.  He  ultimately was not convicted of that.  But, yes, they could make a case  like that.</p><p> But, supposedly, the warrant covers everything from Stormy Daniels to taxi  medallions.  And there's a lot in between.</p><p> CARLSON:  Is there any indication that Stormy Daniels was working with  Russian agents to influence the outcome of the election, that she was  herself part of the hacking of our democracy?</p><p> TURLEY:  Well, I'm not familiar with all of her movies, but no.  But, no,  I'm not familiar with -</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  So, I guess, we can say that the nature of the investigation  has changed profoundly.</p><p> TURLEY:  Oh, absolutely.  Now, there's no question that this is a far off  the mark.  So was Manafort.</p><p> What's actually sort of fascinating about this is that Rod Rosenstein  didn't have much of a problem when Mueller came to him and said I want to  expand Manafort's investigation to include stuff that occurred years before  and were not connected to the campaign.</p><p> Some of this stuff is actually closer, and yet Rosenstein said I want the  southern district to do this.</p><p> CARLSON:  Could Rosenstein have said, \"No, that's not the original charter  of this, that's not the point of this investigation?</p><p> TURLEY:  He could have, but it gets a little bit tough.  If Mueller came to  him and said, \"Look, we have evidence of crime that we have uncovered,\"  it's hard not to give that to a prosecutor to look at.</p><p> We don't know what was shown to Rod Rosenstein.  And that's part of the  problem.</p><p> CARLSON:  I think what you're saying is you would have to be either dumb or  an active drug user to allow an independent counsel investigation to start.</p><p> TURLEY:  Well, I think that - look, this is one of those things where it's  easy to unleash the dogs of war.  It's harder to get them back.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  I know.</p><p> TURLEY:  And a special counsel is a torpedo in the water, to use another  metaphor.  And he's still there.  </p><p> And what's interesting about this move is that they haven't just expanded  the investigation, they've expanded the prosecutors.</p><p> So, now, even if the president moved against Rosenstein, moved against  Mueller, it wouldn't necessarily stop with the southern district.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  Thank you for that.  Professor Jonathan Turley, appreciate  it.</p><p> Democrats are gearing up for an impeachment push against the president.   What's the point of that and what will the outcome of it be, assuming they  take back the House in the midterm?  Brit Hume joins us next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With all of this turmoil, particularly this last  week, has the president at any time thought about stepping down before or  now?</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  No.  And I think  that's an absolutely ridiculous question.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, nobody can quite in the light of day tell you why the  Stormy Daniels story is so significant, but clearly it is judging by the  air time it gets.  It's more important than the looming war in Syria, more  important than the fact our economy is being eclipsed by China, more  important than the vanishing American middle class or the tens of thousands  who will die of drug ODs this year.</p><p> In fact, it matters so much that President Trump should consider leaving  office over it.  Does anyone who doesn't work in the media believe that?</p><p> Brit Hume is our senior political analyst here at Fox and he joins us  tonight.  So, Brit - and maybe I'm blinded by my reflexive revulsion about  this story, but is it?  In the scheme of stories concerning the world is on  fire and changing faster than we can keep up with, is the Stormy Daniels  story as significant as the airtime it's getting, do you think?</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Of course, it's not.</p><p> CARLSON:  Thank you.</p><p> HUME:  The big problem with the story from the start has been this.  It  doesn't tell us anything about Donald Trump that we didn't already know or  should have known.  </p><p> Indeed, this story itself came out - at least a piece of it that he had  this liaison with her came out before the election.</p><p> Americans who voted for and against Donald Trump knew, or should have  known, that he was a habitual philanderer.  He had made a great public  spectacle of it in the past, that he was a man with a taste for flashy  women.</p><p> The story was entirely credible and remains so to this day.  And the fact  that he denies is a detail.  I don't think most of the people who are for  him think that his denial is true, but it simply doesn't rise to the kind  of level you're talking about here unless you want to take very seriously  the possibility that the money paid to keep her from blurting all this out  sooner was a campaign contribution that well exceeded the proper limits for  campaign contributions.</p><p> That is about as big as you can get it to be as far as we know.</p><p> CARLSON:  That seems like a pretty tenuous connection to news.  Just me.   By the way, the other channels have covered this exclusively since we  started 28 minutes ago.  I mean, that's all they've covered for this hour  so far.</p><p> HUME:  Well, I think there's a lot of excitement about the search of the  Cohen offices and so on, but the question that still you have to answer  here is what really is the underlying crime and does it rise to the level  of something for purposes of impeachment or as the questioner at the  briefing said the possibility that Trump would resign.</p><p> That's an interesting question, of course, Tucker.  Does anything about  Trump's behavior in reaction to any of this suggest that this is a man  contemplating quitting?</p><p> CARLSON:  No!</p><p> HUME:  I would say, obviously, palpably not.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm not sure that he or anyone in the White House fully  understands what would happen if Democrats take the House this fall as many  polls suggest they will.</p><p> It seems like the very top of their agenda will be impeaching President  Trump.  That's what their voters want.</p><p> Yesterday, Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who is running against Cruz  in the Senate race, said he would vote to impeach Trump, although he  acknowledged it wouldn't make sense to do it right now.</p><p> But Democratic voters want impeachment.  Do you think Democratic members,  if they take control of the House, can do anything but start an  impeachment?</p><p> HUME:  I think there'll be moves in that direction.  Of course, the last  time this was done, in the case of Bill Clinton and the judges there were  among other perjury and obstruction of justice that were pretty thoroughly  documented - he had, obviously, lied to a grand jury.  They did it.  </p><p> They impeached him in the House and he was not anywhere near convicted in  the Senate and he ended up leaving office in something like a blaze of  glory and it kind of backfired politically on the Republicans.  And  Democratic politicians - those in the House of Representatives - might be  given some pause by how all that turned out.</p><p> But you're right about the base.  The Democratic base cannot the stand the  ground that Trump walks on.  They want him out and they want him impeached  and they want their members to be part of the resistance.</p><p> Little Mr.  O'Rourke running against Ted Cruz in Texas seemed a little  confused about how impeachment works because he's running for the Senate  and the Senate doesn't vote to impeach.  The House votes to impeach.  The  Senate votes on whether or not to convict.</p><p> But that aside, his sentiments reflect that of many Democrats.  And I think  there will be a move to do it if, in fact, they get control of the House.   How well it will work out for them politically remains to be seen.</p><p> CARLSON:  It does remain to be seen.  Brit Hume, thanks as always.  Great  to see you.</p><p> HUME:  You bet.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, all the geniuses here in Washington are unanimous on this  question.  We must attack Syria and anyone who asks questions about why we  must attack Syria is, obviously, by definition, working for Vladimir Putin.</p><p> How has this happened?  How has almost everybody in power lined up behind  yet another military intervention?  Is the public crying out for one?   Glenn Greenwald has watched this fairly carefully and he joins us next with  an answer.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, virtually, all of official Washington - Republicans and  Democrats - have united behind the idea that the United States has a moral  obligation to go deeper into war in Syria.</p><p> We already have thousands of troops in Syria, but you wouldn't know it from  watching the other Robert Mueller based channels.  They're all Stormy  Daniels all the time.  But it's true we do.</p><p> And one American soldier had already died in Syria.  We've killed hundreds  of Russian citizens so far there and lobbed in a serious of cruise  missiles.  But that's not enough, the pundits say.  We need a real war,  something big and deadly, primarily to avenge the Syrian President Assad's  poison gas attack on his own citizens over the weekend.</p><p> Here is some of the growing consensus on that.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRAHAM:  Assad and his inner circle should be considered war criminals,  legitimate military targets.  If you have the opportunity to take him out,  you should.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's very clear to me that this president, after  using such rhetoric on Sunday, has to take stronger military action than we  did last year.</p><p> REP.  JIM HINES (D), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  We have a leader who is  now a war criminal supported by the Iranians and the Russians.  That  demands a strong and risky response.  </p><p> If the West won't stand up when a leader uses gas multiple times against  his own people, we live in a very dangerous world.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, that's the consensus.  Last night, we asked the obvious  questions about it.  Before we go to war, are we sure all of this is real?   Do we really know that Assad was behind the gas attack?</p><p> It's not a defense of Assad, but it's an obvious question.  How could we  know that conclusively so soon after the attack happened?  We didn't have  any Americans on the ground?  And why would Assad do that given the  certainty it would hurt his own interests?</p><p> And while we're on the subject, by the way, why is a war in Syria a good  idea for the United States in the first place?  How would it make us safer,  happier, more prosperous?</p><p> Those seem like reasonable questions to us.  In fact, the exact questions  you'd want your policymakers to ask.  But, no, they're not asking them.   And they're offended to hear them.</p><p> The first person we asked those questions to, Republican Senator Roger  Wicker of Mississippi implied that we were somehow allied with Vladimir  Putin just for asking.  Other than that, Wicker had no answers at all.  It  was embarrassing and he didn't seem embarrassed at all.</p><p> Others just denounced us right off the top.  Jennifer Rubin of \"The  Washington Post\" tweeted this, \"He is insane,\" meaning me.  \"Fox is not a  news organization.  That is all.\" </p><p> Noah Rothman of \"Commentary\" called the show \"nothing less than undiluted  Russian propaganda.  </p><p> Seth Mandel of \"The New York Post\" summarized the criticism perfectly when  he tweeted this, \"shut the F up.\"</p><p> These are journalists, by the way.  No explanation.  Of course, shutting  the F up is the whole point of tweets like that.  They want you to be  quiet.  They want you to do what you're told.  No more questions, shut up  and obey.  There's no chance of that, though.  Sorry.</p><p> Glenn Greenwald has been following all of this.  He's a founding editor at  \"The Intercept\" and he joins us tonight.  So, Glenn, leaving aside the real  question of how you should respond to Syria and is it a threat to the world  order and to us and to its neighbors, I think those are all fair questions,  but why the universal attempt in the media here in this country - left and  right - to shut down a meaningful conversation about it?</p><p> GLENN GREENWALD, \"THE INTERCEPT\" FOUNDING EDITOR:  The only time, I think,  that the media praised Donald Trump was almost one year ago today when he  bombed an airfield in Syria in response to what had been alleged at the  time was a chemical attack by the Assad regime.</p><p> People who hate Donald Trump and go on air every day took a break for 24  hours to proclaim him presidential because that's what US presidents in  their eyes do as they just drop bombs on other countries with no  declaration of war, no reason why US interest or the US borders are at  stake when it happens.</p><p> So, I think that's just the ethos in Washington that not only is it just an  inherently good and presidential thing to do, to drop bombs on other  countries.  That's why polls around the world show that the greatest threat  to world peace in the eyes of the public around the world is the United  States.</p><p> But also, Adam Smith wrote 300 years ago that the reason people who live in  capitals and the elites in countries love to watch their countries bomb  other countries is because it gives them a sense of excitement and purpose  and kind of this pulsating stimulation.  And I think that's a really big  part of it.  </p><p> It doesn't matter whether it will accomplish anything.  It just makes us  feel strong and powerful and purposeful to do.  And so, bombs away.</p><p> CARLSON:  I think that's right.  I mean, I think human nature explains a  lot of this.  I agree completely.  But journalists exist to push back  against that.  Not necessarily against war, but against a feverish rush  toward anything.  I mean, our job is to be skeptical and ask real  questions.  Why is no one doing that and anyone who does is attacked?</p><p> GREENWALD:  So, just about every name that you mentioned in the media who  attacked you for raising questions about whether or not we ought to  actually go and bomb another country are all essentially neocons.</p><p> The same people who were doing this in 2002 and 2003, saying anyone who  asked questions about whether we should actually go to war and remove  Saddam Hussein was an admirer of the Saddam Hussein.</p><p> They did the same in 2011 when it came time to remove Gaddafi.  They said  if you're against that war, it means you love Gaddafi and you want to see  him slaughter people.  It's just the standard tactic.</p><p> And what we have now is this kind of union between neocons, who have now  once again kind of been embraced by both the establishment wings of the  Republican and Democratic Party and the militarists in both parties, people  like Lindsey Graham and lots of Democrats who love every single war.</p><p> And so, this climate arises that you're just supposed to cheer when it  comes time to drop bombs on other countries, not ask whether there's  evidence to justify it, not ask whether it will do any good, not ask  whether it will kill any civilians.</p><p> And if you do ask those questions, it means you're on the side of America's  enemies.  It's an incredibly authoritarian tactic that gets used to  suppress debate.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yeah, it's poison.  I agree.  Glenn Greenwald, thank you as  always.  </p><p> GREENWALD:  Good to be with you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Richard Goodstein is an attorney who advised both of Hillary  Clinton's campaigns and he supports strikes on Syria.  Richard joins us  tonight.</p><p> So, look, it seems to me, no matter what conclusion you reach, the first  question for everybody ought to be the same, which is how is this in  America's strategic interest.  And I haven't met a single person who could  answer it or is even willing to try.  That's a problem, wouldn't you say?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER:  It would be if there  really was no answer.</p><p> I did see your interview with Sen.  Wicker last night.  You asked the  question, how do even know Assad was behind this?</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Because Gen.  Mattis basically said we weren't sure.  But what  we know is that a UN Commission saw links between sarin gas that we know  was used and had the hallmarks of what the -</p><p> CARLSON:  Sure.  Look, I'm totally open-minded.  I'm not here flacking for  Assad.  My God! I just want to be certain that we are acting on the basis  of verifiable information.  And in the case of this last weekend's attack  with the chlorine gas, let's just stop lying, there is no way that we could  know in 48 hours, 24 hours when the cable news shows start pushing for war  that Assad was behind this.  So, let's stop lying.  That's my only point.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Well, I'm not sure who it is - look, it had all the hallmarks  of something that we know Assad did.  He was destroying towns willy-nilly.</p><p> And the notion that somehow the rebels would kill their own women and  children and have them foaming at the mouth and so forth to make a point  for CNN or Fox, that seems a bit much, right?</p><p> But I think what we're trying to do is -</p><p> CARLSON:  Really, it's a bit much?  OK.  So, the first sarin gas attack  took place within a week of the Trump administration saying we're no longer  going to try to remove Assad from power.  That happened.  Bam, we went  right back to the original policy.</p><p> This attack took place less than a week after the Trump people said we are  going to pull our troops out.  </p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, look, I don't know who did it.  I'm not accusing anybody.   I'm merely saying there's clearly questions that we need to be asking about  this.  And anyone who does, I'm a living example of this, is shouted down  and called a poodle of Putin.  Like, that's insane.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  I wish I took as much pleasure from my critics coming after me  as you do incidentally.  So, I applaud you for feeling the umbrage that you  do.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm attacked all the time.  I don't care.  I care about when and  where we commit American troops.  I have a son who is 21.  This is not a  joke.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Right.  So, it's not a question, frankly, of committing troops.   Sure, there will be troops.  We're talking about degrading their air force,  degrading their helicopters, doing something frankly that we didn't do.</p><p> CARLSON:  What does degrading mean?</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  It means basically have so many -</p><p> CARLSON:  Killing people.  Let's not use euphemisms here.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Fine.  Let's blow up airplanes and helicopters.  If there are  people in it, so be it.  They made their choice to align with Assad and  these are the very people who we've seen are dropping - I think we actually  have had photographic evidence, dropping chlorine bombs on civilian  populations.</p><p> So, do I feel badly about that?  No.  Do I think it's something United  States should be doing?  Yes.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But hold on.  What's the goal?  Just let's be really clear We  take Assad out, and don't tell me that's not the plan.  When you wage war  against a government, you're not rooting for its continuation.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  No.</p><p> CARLSON:  Who runs Syria?  And I'm saying I don't know actually if taking  him out is the objective.  And I agree with you.  Just continue the war,  kill more people.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  I think the objective is so that Assad knows that his dropping  chlorine gas on people is something where he's going to pay a price.  And  he has did it.  </p><p> And I think we have to establish whether he did it or not.  And the fact is  it shouldn't be a feel-good exercise like it was last year.  When Trump was  basically talking about that great piece of chocolate cake with Xi, the  time he was dropping bombs on those runways, that was a feel-good exercise.</p><p> If we're going to do something, we should do something, so that Assad can't  do it as easily.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But we don't that he did do it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  I agree.</p><p> CARLSON:  Does it bother you when there's universal consensus on the left  and among established Republicans that we just know, and like stop asking  questions, let's just go ahead and do this for reasons that we can't fully  explain, we can't tell you how it's going to make you richer or safer or  happier, but just shut up and do it anyway?  Does it bother you?</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Well, it will make us better because we think we need to go  after war crimes.  The question is whether Assad did it.  It has all the  hallmarks of Assad.  I don't blame people for concluding it did.</p><p> Do we need to establish with some certainty that it was Assad?  Yes, we  should probably do that.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, every time a government does something appalling or kill  civilians, we need to bomb them.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  No.</p><p> CARLSON:  No.  OK, right.  </p><p>GOODSTEIN:  We can't address every war crime.  But those that we can  address, yes, I think we should.</p><p> CARLSON:  Just so we can.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Plenty more.  I grant you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  All right.  Richard, thank you.  </p><p>GOODSTEIN:  My pleasure.</p><p> CARLSON:  My head is spinning.</p><p> One of the Internet's top prostitution sites just shut down and feminists  are delighted.  Wait, what?  No, they're furious.  It's getting confusing  in feminist world.  So, we're going to explain it to you.  Is prostitution  pro-women?  Or is it the exploitation of women?  We'll get the new line on  that.  Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  The site backpage.com - it's a classified ad site - has been shut  down and several top officials who work there have got in trouble.  They've  been indicted over allegations that that site facilitated prostitution and  child sex trafficking.</p><p> You would think feminists would be happy about this, and some are.  But  others are outraged by it.  </p><p> Women's March tweeted, \"The shutting down of Backpage is an absolute crisis  for sex workers.  That's the new term for prostitutes who rely on that site  to safely get in touch with clients.  Sex workers' rights are women's  rights.</p><p> Amy Peikoff is a talk show host and a feminist who supports keeping  Backpage up and she joins us tonight.  Amy, great to see you.</p><p> AMY PEIKOFF, TALK SHOW HOST AND FEMINIST:  Hi, Tucker.  Thanks for having  me back again.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, I know that you're a libertarian.  I don't agree with you,  but I certainly respect it.  I think it's an intellectually coherent way to  look at the world.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  But I also know you are a feminist.  And they seem at odds with  each other.  </p><p> So, the libertarian side of you would say, people have a right to enter  into voluntary contracts.  Prostitution falls under that heading.  It's  fine.</p><p> But the feminist part of you can't really believe that prostitution is  empowering to women because it's the opposite of that.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  Right.  But here's the thing, we're talking about government  shutting down a website.  And regardless of what you and I, Tucker, think  ethically about prostitution and other types of sex work, the question to  ask is whether it violates anyone's rights.</p><p> And we need to, in order to empower women, leave all choices up to them in  terms of how to conduct their own personal sex lives and everything else.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  That's the libertarian side.  And I get that.  I mean,  again, I don't fully agree with it, but I think it's a reasonable thing to  say.</p><p> But the feminist position has nothing to do with that.  The feminist  position is about empowerment and dignity and not objectifying women,  reducing them to their physical appearance, which is, of course, what  prostitution does.  It degrades women completely.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  My version - I mean, insofar as I consider myself a feminist, I  consider myself a feminist in terms of protecting women's rights.  So,  whenever there's an actual threat to women's rights, I'm going to be there  and argue against whatever it is and say that we need to take some action  accordingly.</p><p> But insofar as this website was just facilitating transactions having to do  with prostitution or other types of sex work, then there's no rights  violation and you need to leave the choice up to the women.</p><p> We're not going to - it's not the American way to force a particular type  of lifestyle choice on someone just because you disagree with it from your  own ethical perspective.  We need to back up and look at the perspective of  the individual rights.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  But that doesn't mean that all \"lifestyle choices\" are  the same.  And I don't know why a feminist group like Women's March would  describe as prostitutes as \"sex workers.\" </p><p> Many of them are really young.  They are being pimped out by older men and  sleeping with creepy - I mean, the whole thing is like disgusting actually.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  But that problem would be only worse.  That problem would be only  worse, as I understand it, if there are not online opportunities for these  women.</p><p> And, Tucker, there are two further kind of troubling implications of  something like this, shutting down a site like backpage.com.  One is that  is in conjunction with a couple of pieces of legislation that are also  troubling, designed to remove content about sex off of the Internet.</p><p> And I myself, I think that sex is a good thing.  I don't think we should be  shutting down content on the Internet.  And there's been a lot of  preemptive removing of content from Reddit and other sites because of this.</p><p> And the second thing is that I think this is ominous in terms of other  types of websites and tech companies coming under government control in the  future.</p><p> I mean, we just saw Zuckerberg in front of Congress today and you think,  oh, well, right now, it's just a prostitution and sex trafficking website,  but next it's going to be Tinder because people are using that to hook up  and it's sex and maybe we can get away with controlling that or shutting  that down.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  I guess I used to feel that way.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  And then, it will be Facebook and Twitter.  And this is the  problem, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  And I literally can't wait for that day, to be honest with you.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  But today's websites, Tucker, they are not only the method of  distributing content, including all of the content that is necessary to  change the culture for the better, they also collect information about  users.</p><p> So, it's a very different type of media.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm aware of it.  But let me just ask you - hold on.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  We have to be very careful about putting that under government  control because I think you would agree with me - </p><p> CARLSON:  I think you think the government is more sinister, I would not  agree with you.  I agree with you ten years ago back when I was a mindless  libertarian who thought that government was the greatest threat to our  freedom.  But government is elected.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  OK.  So, we do not want to end up in Orwell's 1984.  We do not  want to end up in Orwell's 1984.  And if you think that information is  troubling in the hands of somebody who wants to make money, think of it in  the hands of government.</p><p> CARLSON:  Which is elected, unlike Zuckerberg.  But, Amy, thank you.  It's  always nice to have you here.  I like smart guests and you are.</p><p> PEIKOFF:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Mark Zuckerberg, testifying on the Hill, it's a big story.  But  another tech titan has revealed his vision of the future and it will wreck  your night.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Mark Zuckerberg consuming all the headline space recently.  And  that's lucky for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who just revealed his terrifying  vision of this country's future.</p><p> Last week, Dorsey shared an article he called \"great read\".  The article  was published on Medium.  It says that there is no bipartisan future for  the country.  One side must win and totally destroy the other.</p><p> The piece describes the country as in a non-violent civil war now.  And the  only way forward, it says, is to do what California has done.  </p><p> The piece is pretty explicit about that, import a voter base until  elections are mere formalities as they are in California.  End all debate.   Allow only the left to speak.</p><p> In other words, make America a lot more like Twitter, a one-party state  where armies of serfs happily serve tech gods like, well, Jack Dorsey.   That's the future they are all hoping for.  And now you know.  </p><p> We didn't have anything about sex-crazed pandas tonight, but we're on that  because we're journalists.  So, stay tuned in the rest of the week for  developments.  That's it for us.  </p><p> In New York, right now, Sean Hannity is standing by.  Here he is.</p><p> END</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company's privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections. Facebook said on Tuesday the company had received invitations to testify before Congress and that they were talking to legislators. </p><p>House Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said \"The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify\". On the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers' invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong. The company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject. The head of the committee called Zuckerberg's decision \"astonishing\" and urged him to think again. Facebook shares closed down 4.9 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The privacy breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation. Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election. AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie's remarks. Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ. Cambridge Analytica said last Monday it did not use Facebook data in Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules. In full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers this week Zuckerberg said the app built by a university researcher \"leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014\". He apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg, as well as the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee had already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called \"substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.\" (Writing by Susan Thomas; Editing by James Dalgleish) - Reuters/zl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-10080310</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYS-SB01-JCDN-101M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><timeReceived>9:11 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, follows through on her vow to try to break up major technology firms, according to a leaked recording of his remarks published Tuesday. \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us?</p><p> Yeah,\" Zuckerberg said in a July meeting with employees, a transcript of which was published Tuesday by technology news site The Verge. He added, \"I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that's not the position that you want to be in when you're, you know, I mean . it's like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\" Warren, D-Mass., soon responded over Twitter, \"What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\" The unusually direct exchange between a presidential candidate and a major corporate leader underscored the heightened political stakes for Silicon Valley ahead of the 2020 election. While many technology leaders have been visibly uneasy with President Trump - who attacks the industry routinely over its alleged bias against conservatives and other issues - there also is discomfort with the calls by Warren and other Democrats to regulate technology firms more aggressively than in the past. The most alarming proposal to technology leaders is the call by Warren and some other liberals to dismantle major companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook for alleged antitrust violations. Chris Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg, has been among those calling for a breakup of the company on the grounds that it has grown too powerful. Facebook dominates much of social media worldwide through its namesake platform as well Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which Facebook acquired when they were smaller but up-and-coming potential rivals. Zuckerberg said in the same meeting with employees that Facebook is experimenting with a potential alternative to Chinese-owned TikTok, which has grown popular among teens and young adults for its short videos. The Facebook alternative, called Lasso, is being tested in Mexico because, Zuckerberg said, TikTok is not yet popular there. He also said that Facebook was working with government regulators on the company's controversial plan to introduce a new online currency called Libra. After Zuckerberg's comments were published Tuesday, Warren took advantage of the news moment to tout her plan, \"How We Can Break Up Big Tech,\" linking to it in a tweet saying, \"I'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech.\" Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to elaborate on Zuckerberg's comments or respond to those from Warren. Hours after the Verge story was published, Zuckerberg linked to it on his Facebook page saying, \"even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it's out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics like social responsibility, breaking up tech companies, Libra, neural computing interfaces, and doing the right thing over the long term.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN71336180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X62-NCW1-DYRV-41JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Suffice it to say, the biggest social networking company in the world finds itself fighting against headwinds today that include an enormous amount of mistrust, with even its CEO recently joking[1] the company doesn't exactly have the best record when it comes to privacy. </p><p>Nevertheless, for some reason, a top Facebook executive speaking at an event in Berlin on Monday thought it would be worthwhile to amp up the continuing tension[2] between the social network and Apple by launching a fresh broadside against the iPhone maker, of course without calling it out by name. These comments come at a time when Facebook is diving into a major cryptocurrency project and trying to bundle together its myriad messaging services while also avoiding regulation from lawmakers that increasingly have had enough of its mishaps. Image Source: LODI Franck/SIPA/Shutterstock Noting that Facebook is 'free' and meant for everyone, the company's head of global affairs Nick Clegg then went on to rant that 'Some other big tech companies make their money by selling expensive hardware or subscription services, or in some cases both, to consumers in developed, wealthier economies. They are an exclusive club, available only to aspirant consumers with the means to buy high-value hardware and services.' There's no exclusivity or 'VIP access' at the company, Clegg continued. Its services 'are as accessible to students in Guatemala, cattle farmers in the Midwest United States, office workers in Mumbai, tech startups in Nairobi, or taxi drivers in Berlin. More than 2 billion people use our platforms \u2014 because they can.' Of course, some of you will no doubt shoot back \u2014 Millions of peoples' personal data has been taken advantage of over and over by Facebook. Because it can. Apple CEO Tim Cook, for his part, has done the same in recent weeks, with one of his best lines in his recent commencement address at Stanford University being when he blasted unnamed companies (but the implication being companies like Facebook) as chaos factories. 'It feels a bit crazy that anyone should have to say this, but if you built a chaos factory, you can't dodge responsibility for the chaos,' Cook said. It's unfortunate to see companies make trite arguments to differentiate themselves from the competition and to deflect from their own troubles, but Clegg's argument here is definitely nothing new. Namely, that Apple gets rich by selling super-expensive hardware to users while Facebook is the more populist and better option of the two. Anyone ought to be able to see this straw man from a mile away.

Some speaking before the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights argued that tech M&amp;A is crucial to innovation, while others argued that much of the M&amp;A from big tech firms such as Facebook removes potential competition from the market. Senators like Josh Hawley, R-Mo., even argued that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission may be unfit to properly assess the impact of certain tech acquisitions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In February, the FTC announced that it had formed a task force to monitor competition in U.S. technology markets. In July, Facebook disclosed that it was being investigated by the FTC for antitrust concerns, shortly after it agreed to pay a $5 billion fine to settle FTC-documented privacy violations. Politicians recently have even proposed unwinding previously approved Facebook acquisitions.</p><p>Not helping investor sentiment, CNBC on Sept. 26 published results of a survey of senior-level technology executives, showing that Facebook would be the company most likely to face antitrust punitive action from the government's antitrust review. Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel also confirmed that his company has been internally documenting anti-competitive activity from Facebook.</p><p>Facebook is also facing regulatory pressure over its cryptocurrency plans, announcing this week that it will delay the launch until all regulatory concerns are addressed.</p><p>Facebook shares were off by 4.4% for the week, as of midday trading Sept. 27.</p><p>In other news from Washington, D.C., the U.S. government is considering limiting U.S. portfolio investment in Chinese companies, according to a Sept. 27 Bloomberg News report citing unnamed sources. Shares of companies like Tencent Music Entertainment Group, Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. were down between 3% and 6% as of midday trading.</p><p>Online dating company Match Group Inc. also faced some regulatory heat during the week.</p><p>In a lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas division, the FTC claimed that Match.com used fake love interest advertisements to lure hundreds of thousands of consumers into buying paid subscriptions, alleging that Match unfairly exposed consumers to the risk of fraud and engaged in other allegedly deceptive and unfair practices.</p><p>Match Group responded in a Sept. 25 statement that the FTC was making \"completely meritless allegations supported by consciously misleading figures.\" Match Group shares were off by 8.8% for the week through midday Sept. 27.</p><p>Netflix Inc. shares were also punished during the week. The company recently posted a miss on membership guidance for the June quarter.</p><p>One of the more damaging reviews of Netflix came from Barclays, with analyst Kannan Venkateshwar in a Sept. 23 note calling the company \"very expensive\" compared to its potential market reach.</p><p>However, Barclays issued more favorable commentary on the streaming company after its stock was pounded throughout the week.</p><p>While \"it is tough to make a valuation argument to own Netflix,\" Venkateshwar said in a Sept. 27 note, \"NFLX valuation is a function of its pricing power, churn and optionality from additional revenue sources in the end state. We believe Netflix continues to be in a great position to flex these variables which can add significant value. Therefore, while there is a narrative risk near term for the story muting short term performance, we continue to like NFLX.\"</p><p>While competitive pressure from companies such as The Walt Disney Co. and AT&amp;T Inc. could weigh on Netflix's domestic subscriber base, Netflix still has plenty of growth runway in international markets, and its competitors still face \"substantial\" execution risks that are not currently being valued, the analyst said.</p><p>Netflix showed considerable volatility through the five trading days, falling almost 4% by midweek, but the stock recovered much of those losses, trading down just 0.3% for the week, as of midday trading Sept. 27.</p><p>Finally, in IPO news, Hollywood talent agency Endeavor LLC postponed its IPO, citing market conditions.</p><p>The Hollywood talent agency planned to offer 15 million shares of class A common stock with a price range between $26 to $27 per share, which is below the $30 to $32 range the company set last week.</p><p>\"Endeavor will continue to evaluate the timing for the proposed offering,\" the company said in a statement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-54470659</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5V-Y5K1-JDVW-N0XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Facebook said that accepting the EU demand for internal documents that include 2,500 specific key phrases means \"handing over unrelated but highly-sensitive data,\" reports the BBC.   The European Commission said it will defend the case in court.   Tim Lamb, Facebook's competition lawyer, said that they are cooperating with the commission \"and would expect to give them hundreds of thousands of documents\".   \"The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees\".   Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), which looks into big tech companies and their data practices, has sent a preliminary decision to Facebook-owned WhatsApp for their submissions and made further progress in three other investigations related to Facebook.   Facebook is facing two investigations in the EU to find out if the social network has breached competition laws.   --IANS na/   ( 203 Words)   2020-07-28-09:20:07 (IANS)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42702976228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FW-YN11-F07F-8336-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"274\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NetIndia123.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook said that accepting the EU demand for internal documents that include 2,500 specific key phrases means \"handing over unrelated but highly-sensitive data,\" reports the BBC.      The European Commission said it will defend the case in court.   Tim Lamb, Facebook's competition lawyer, said that they are cooperating with the commission \"and would expect to give them hundreds of thousands of documents\".   \"The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees\".   Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), which looks into big tech companies and their data practices, has sent a preliminary decision to Facebook-owned WhatsApp for their submissions and made further progress in three other investigations related to Facebook.

Facebook said that accepting the EU demand for internal documents that include 2,500 specific key phrases means \"handing over unrelated but highly-sensitive data,\" reports the BBC.   The European Commission said it will defend the case in court.   Tim Lamb, Facebook's competition lawyer, said that they are cooperating with the commission \"and would expect to give them hundreds of thousands of documents\".   \"The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees\".

Who among us would want to defend the bile of Milo Yiannopoulos and his racist slurs, the anti-Semitic rantings of Louis Farrakhan or the ugly conspiracy theories of Infowars host Alex Jones who has threatened journalists and suggested the 2012 slaughter of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., was an Obama-orchestrated hoax to promote gun control?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump has suggested the Facebook purge of serial haters was part of a pattern of social media discrimination against conservatives. Trump specifically cited his concern that Paul Joseph Watson, a far-right personality who has served as Infowars editor-at-large and a purveyor of conspiracy theories and doctored videos, was on Facebook's banned list.</p><p> Trump has warned \"I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms. This is the United States of America \u2014 and we have what's known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH.\" He has suggested that the social media's attempt to arbitrate the limits of free speech explains why \"Congress wants to get involved \u2014 and they should.\"</p><p> First things first: This is not a free-speech issue. Facebook is a private enterprise, and users are free to accept or reject its parameters of acceptable expression. What Americans should be worried about is government interference with free speech.</p><p> But this controversy, as with so many others surrounding Facebook \u2014 on privacy, on its vulnerability to election meddling, on its suppression of content and exploitation of customer data from legitimate news organizations \u2014 is yet another measure of the corrosive effects of its extraordinary market domination.</p><p> Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, suggested in a New York Times opinion piece published online last week (\"It's Time to Break Up Facebook\") that the social media giant should be subject to antitrust enforcement. Among his recommendations was that it should be forced to spin off the popular apps Instagram and WhatsApp and that further acquisitions should be banned for several years.</p><p>Hughes also suggested that Congress should create a new agency to regulate tech companies, and one of its charges should be to \"create guidelines for acceptable speech\" on social media.</p><p> \"This idea may seem un-American \u2014 we would never stand for a government agency censoring speech,\" Hughes wrote. \"But we already have limits on yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater, child pornography, speech intended to provoke violence and false statements to manipulate stock prices. We will have to create similar standards that tech companies can use.\"</p><p> I agree with Hughes on one point: The notion of government censoring speech does seem un-American. It would be precarious to police even if it were not impossibly impractical in the infinite world of cyberspace. The haters who were chased off Facebook and other sites willing to comply with the law would simply find other warrens of wanton waste to inhabit.</p><p> The more immediate remedy for Facebook accountability would be to force it to choose: Is it a platform or a publisher?</p><p>Facebook has essentially claimed each role, depending on the convenience of the moment.</p><p> Here is why it matters:</p><p> Under the Communications Decency Act of 1996, a platform is not responsible for the content of its users \u2014 in much the way a cell-phone company has no liability for your conversations, no matter how offensive, or Amazon would not presume to control what you read on its Kindle device. This principle was tested in a court ruling that cleared MySpace against a claim from a teen who was sexually assaulted by an adult male who met her on the space.</p><p> However, a publisher is responsible for its content, and assumes that role by exerting its authority to select, monitor, edit or delete content \u2014 or banish users that violate its terms of service.</p><p> So which definition fits Facebook? Is it merely a town square, or a conversation curator?</p><p> It has argued both sides.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a U.S. Senate committee in April 2018 that his company is not a \"media company\" or publisher that creates content. Yet in other contexts, most notably in legal proceedings, it has argued that it has a traditional newspaper-like function to determine what can and cannot be published. Zuckerberg also told the Senate that, \"I agree we are responsible for the content,\" even if Facebook does not produce it.</p><p> So where is this all headed? Even with its most advanced algorithms, Facebook would be hard pressed to cull the haters and purveyors of offensive speech from its 2 billion users globally. Are we headed toward a social media future where Americans separate into their ideological camps, as they have with cable news, right to Fox and left to MSNBC? Is Facebook's banishment of Farrakhan, Jones, Yiannopoulous, Watson and a handful of prominent others just a warning shot or the start of a trend that eventually will reach your Trump-supporting uncle in Idaho or antifa-sympathizing niece in Berkeley?</p><p>Facebook's moves came soon after the conservative furor of actor James Wood getting locked out of Twitter for his \"abusive behavior.\" After the Mueller report, the Hollywood star tweeted that \"If you try to kill the King, you best not miss\" with the hashtag #HangThemAll. The Twitter suspension did seem excessive: the famous Ralph Waldo Emerson quote about not missing a strike on the king is often invoked metaphorically.</p><p> \"The purposeful &amp; calculated silencing of conservatives by @facebook &amp; the rest of the Big Tech monopoly men should terrify everyone,\" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on May 3. \"It appears they're taking their censorship campaign to the next level. Ask yourself, how long before they come to purge you? We must fight back.\"</p><p> Nothing Facebook or Twitter could do is as terrifying as government intervention in regulating social media speech. If those social media sites become overly censorious, on the right or the left, there are abundant options to families to share prom photos, birthday greetings or news articles  \u2014 if we are willing to go there. The same is true if those sites become overly infected with hate.</p><p> The cold truth is that many of us are addicted to Facebook, even as we complain about the way it exploits our private information, poisons our democracy, limits our news choices and \u2014 depending on one's point of view \u2014 bans voices we want to hear.</p><p> Perhaps the ultimate solution is not to break up Facebook, but to break up with it. If we dare.</p><p> John Diaz is The San Francisco Chronicle's editorial page editor.

Who among us would want to defend the bile of Milo Yiannopoulos and his racist slurs, the anti-Semitic rantings of Louis Farrakhan or the ugly conspiracy theories of Infowars host Alex Jones who has threatened journalists and suggested the 2012 slaughter of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., was an Obama-orchestrated hoax to promote gun control?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump has suggested the Facebook purge of serial haters was part of a pattern of social media discrimination against conservatives. Trump specifically cited his concern that Paul Joseph Watson, a far-right personality who has served as Infowars editor-at-large and a purveyor of conspiracy theories and doctored videos, was on Facebook's banned list.</p><p>Trump has warned \"I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms. This is the United States of America - and we have what's known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH.\" He has suggested that the social media's attempt to arbitrate the limits of free speech explains why \"Congress wants to get involved - and they should.\"</p><p>First things first: This is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not </emphasis>a free-speech issue. Facebook is a private enterprise, and users are free to accept or reject its parameters of acceptable expression. What Americans should be worried about is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">government</emphasis> interference with free speech.</p><p>But this controversy, as with so many others surrounding Facebook - on privacy, on its vulnerability to election meddling, on its suppression of content and exploitation of customer data from legitimate news organizations - is yet another measure of the corrosive effects of its extraordinary market domination.</p><p>Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, suggested in a New York Times opinion piece published online last week \"It's Time to Break Up Facebook\" that the social media giant should be subject to antitrust enforcement. Among his recommendations was that it should be forced to spin off the popular apps Instagram and WhatsApp and that further acquisitions should be banned for several years.</p><p>Hughes also suggested that Congress should create a new agency to regulate tech companies, and one of its charges should be to \"create guidelines for acceptable speech\" on social media.</p><p>\"This idea may seem un-American - we would never stand for a government agency censoring speech,\" Hughes wrote. \"But we already have limits on yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater, child pornography, speech intended to provoke violence and false statements to manipulate stock prices. We will have to create similar standards that tech companies can use.\"</p><p>I agree with Hughes on one point: The notion of government censoring speech does seem un-American. It would be precarious to police even if it were not impossibly impractical in the infinite world of cyberspace. The haters who were chased off Facebook and other sites willing to comply with the law would simply find other warrens of wanton waste to inhabit.</p><p>The more immediate remedy for Facebook accountability would be to force it to choose: Is it a platform or a publisher?</p><p>Facebook has essentially claimed each role, depending on the convenience of the moment.</p><p>Here is why it matters:</p><p>Under the Communications Decency Act of 1996, a platform is not responsible for the content of its users - in much the way a cell-phone company has no liability for your conversations, no matter how offensive, or Amazon would not presume to control what you read on its Kindle device. This principle was tested in a court ruling that cleared MySpace against a claim from a teen who was sexually assaulted by an adult male who met her on the space.</p><p>However, a publisher <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is </emphasis>responsible for its content, and assumes that role by exerting its authority to select, monitor, edit or delete content - or banish users that violate its terms of service.</p><p>So which definition fits Facebook? Is it merely a town square, or a conversation curator?</p><p>It has argued both sides.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a U.S. Senate committee in April 2018 that his company is not a \"media company\" or publisher that creates content. Yet in other contexts, most notably in legal proceedings, it has argued that it has a traditional newspaper-like function to determine what can and cannot be published. Zuckerberg also told the Senate that, \"I agree we are responsible for the content,\" even if Facebook does not produce it.</p><p>So where is this all headed? Even with its most advanced algorithms, Facebook would be hard pressed to cull the haters and purveyors of offensive speech from its 2 billion users globally. Are we headed toward a social media future where Americans separate into their ideological camps, as they have with cable news, right to Fox and left to MSNBC? Is Facebook's banishment of Farrakhan, Jones, Yiannopoulous, Watson and a handful of prominent others just a warning shot or the start of a trend that eventually will reach your Trump-supporting uncle in Idaho or antifa-sympathizing niece in Berkeley?</p><p>Facebook's moves came soon after the conservative furor of actor James Wood getting locked out of Twitter for his \"abusive behavior.\" After the Mueller report, the Hollywood star tweeted that \"If you try to kill the King, you best not miss\" with the hashtag #HangThemAll. The Twitter suspension did seem excessive: the famous Ralph Waldo Emerson quote about not missing a strike on the king is often invoked metaphorically.</p><p>\"The purposeful &amp; calculated silencing of conservatives by @facebook &amp; the rest of the Big Tech monopoly men should terrify everyone,\" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on May 3. \"It appears they're taking their censorship campaign to the next level. Ask yourself, how long before they come to purge you? We must fight back.\"</p><p>Nothing Facebook or Twitter could do is as terrifying as government intervention in regulating social media speech. If those social media sites become overly censorious, on the right or the left, there are abundant options to families to share prom photos, birthday greetings or news articles - if we are willing to go there. The same is true if those sites become overly infected with hate.</p><p>The cold truth is that many of us are addicted to Facebook, even as we complain about the way it exploits our private information, poisons our democracy, limits our news choices and - depending on one's point of view - bans voices we want to hear.</p><p>Perhaps the ultimate solution is not to break up Facebook, but to break up with it. If we dare.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Alex Jones, of InfoWars, yells at protesters outside before a Trump rally in Houston. </p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Milo Yiannopoulos, Louis Farrakhan and Alex Jones are among the users that have been permanently banished from Facebook and Instagram on the allegation that their presence on the sites had become  dangerous.

Google, for example, has an online advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook\u2019s. And Google also collects vast amounts of information about the people who use its online services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as Facebook has taken it on the chin over the way it has handled the personal information of its users, the leaders of other tech companies have demonstrated that even in publicity-hungry Silicon Valley, it is entirely possible for billionaire executives and their sprawling empires to keep a low profile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What set Mr. Zuckerberg apart? The personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Google and the biggest tech companies \u2014 as far as anyone knows \u2014 have never made such a giant mistake.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg was the only executive to testify in two days of hearings this week. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, were also asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>But when that hearing combined with one from another committee, which had not asked for Google or Twitter\u2019s participation, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey were let off the hook, said company officials and congressional aides.</p><p>For now, at least.</p><p>Before the hearing on Tuesday, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-04-10%20CEG%20to%20Twitter%20-%20Data%20Privacy.pdf\">sent letters</url> to Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey with 14 questions. In       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-04-10%20CEG%20to%20Google%20-%20Data%20Privacy.pdf\">his letter to Google</url>, Mr. Grassley wanted to \u201cunderstand how Google manages and monitors user privacy for the significant amounts of data which it collects.\u201d</p><p>The companies have until April 25 to respond. When asked whether they were concerned about congressional or regulatory scrutiny, Google and Twitter, through company representatives, declined to comment.</p><p>\u201cOutside of Facebook, there is probably no company paying more attention\u201d than Google, said Jason Kint, a frequent critic of Google and Facebook and chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely ducking for cover while the heat is on Facebook. They don\u2019t want to try to trip any alarms.\u201d</p><p>Like Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users \u2014 including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history \u2014 to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.</p><p>On Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook\u2019s tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \u201cthe rest of the industry\u201d employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google\u2019s data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook\u2019s industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.</p><p>Google employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.</p><p>In a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201ccompletely focused on protecting our users\u2019 data\u201d and \u201cwill take action\u201d if it found evidence of \u201cdeceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\u201d</p><p>Google has been criticized \u2014 even fined \u2014 for its privacy practices over the years. It paid a $17 million fine <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/technology/google-to-pay-17-million-to-settle-privacy-case.html\">to settle a case</url> when it bypassed privacy settings in Apple\u2019s Safari browser to track users and show them advertisements in 2011 and 2012. It also got dinged for scooping up people\u2019s passwords, email and other personal information       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/technology/google-pays-fine-over-street-view-privacy-breach.html\">during its Street View mapping project</url>.</p><p>Privacy advocates also criticized a Google social network, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/technology/31ftc.html\">called Buzz</url>, in 2010 for automatically including users\u2019 email contact. Google eventually settled the matter with the Federal Trade Commission and agreed to strengthen an existing privacy program.</p><p>Google is staying on the sidelines in other ways. Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook\u2019s endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.</p><p>Mr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement. Google has not taken a public position.</p><p>Similarly, Facebook and Google had donated $200,000 each to a group opposing a California ballot initiative that proposes enabling Californians to sue companies for data breaches, among other things. Facebook this week dropped its opposition to the initiative, which organizers said was on track to appear on the November ballot in California.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes, which were photographed during the testimony, also contained a prepared response if lawmakers echoed criticism from Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who has chided Facebook and other companies for collecting gobs of personal information about their users.</p><p>\u201cLots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\u201d said the document. \u201cImportant you hold everyone to the same standard.\u201d</p><p>Representatives for Facebook and Apple declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes.</p><p>Apple has long campaigned to draw a distinction between the way it operates and the way Facebook and Google do.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook told MSNBC. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic.\u201d</p><p>After users download Apple\u2019s most recent software update for iPhones and iPads, released on March 29, their devices prominently display a message that said \u201cprivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said the update, which has been in the works for months, was intended to better inform users on its data practices and comply with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html\">Europe\u2019s new data-privacy rules</url> that take effect May 25 \u2014 not taunt Facebook.</p><p>When asked if it was worried about regulations for the industry stemming from new scrutiny of Facebook, Apple referred to recent comments Mr. Cook made to MSNBC. He said he typically believed \u201cthe best regulation is no regulation\u201d but \u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that here.\u201d</p><p>Amazon, for its part, has mirrored Google\u2019s approach, staying silent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html\">despite the frequent attacks</url> President Trump has made against the company on Twitter. Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.</p><p>Amazon uses shoppers\u2019 purchase history to target ads, though Forrester Research estimated its advertising revenue last year was $2.5 billion. Facebook makes $39.9 billion on ads and Google makes $95.4 billion.</p><p>Privacy advocates <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/business/media/amazon-google-privacy-digital-assistants.html\">are also concerned</url> about the tens of millions of Amazon Echo smart speakers and other voice-controlled devices that have put microphones in people\u2019s homes.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s top competitors for that business? Google and Apple.</p><p>Many tech companies understand that Washington\u2019s renewed focus on privacy is likely to reach them soon, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group representing the largest tech companies.</p><p>\u201cThe tide has shifted,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is passing us by.\u201d</p><p>Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi and Jack Nicas on Twitter: @daiwaka and @jacknicas Nick Wingfield contributed reporting from Seattle. </p><p>PHOTO: Last year lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google appeared in Congress to answer questions about foreign meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But in the recent scandal over personal data, only Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg ended up testifying.

For now.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAN FRANCISCO - Two pages of notes sitting in a binder in front of Mark Zuckerberg during his congressional testimony this week hinted at a message the Facebook chief executive rarely got a chance to deliver: We're not the only ones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Zuckerberg was prepared to say that his company accounts for just a slice of the $650 billion advertising market and that it has plenty of competitors. Google, for example, has an online advertising business more than twice the size of Facebook's. And Google also collects vast amounts of information about the people who use its online services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as Facebook has taken it on the chin over the way it has handled the personal information of its users, the leaders of other tech companies have demonstrated that even in publicity-hungry Silicon Valley, it is entirely possible for billionaire executives and their sprawling empires to keep a low profile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What set Mr. Zuckerberg apart? The personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election. Google and the biggest tech companies - as far as anyone knows - have never made such a giant mistake.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg was the only executive to testify in two days of hearings this week. Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, were also asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>But when that hearing combined with one from another committee, which had not asked for Google or Twitter's participation, Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey were let off the hook, said company officials and congressional aides.</p><p>For now, at least.</p><p>Before the hearing on Tuesday, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent letters to Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey with 14 questions. In his letter to Google, Mr. Grassley wanted to \"understand how Google manages and monitors user privacy for the significant amounts of data which it collects.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[2 days, 10 hours, 600 questions: Read about what happened when Mark Zuckerberg went to Washington.]</emphasis></p><p>The companies have until April 25 to respond. When asked whether they were concerned about congressional or regulatory scrutiny, Google and Twitter, through company representatives, declined to comment.</p><p>\"Outside of Facebook, there is probably no company paying more attention\" than Google, said Jason Kint, a frequent critic of Google and Facebook and chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \"They're absolutely ducking for cover while the heat is on Facebook. They don't want to try to trip any alarms.\"</p><p>Like Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users - including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history - to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.</p><p>On Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook's tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \"the rest of the industry\" employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google's data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook's industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.</p><p>Google employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.</p><p>In a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \"completely focused on protecting our users' data\" and \"will take action\" if it found evidence of \"deceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\"</p><p>Google has been criticized - even fined - for its privacy practices over the years. It paid a $17 million fine to settle a case when it bypassed privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser to track users and show them advertisements in 2011 and 2012. It also got dinged for scooping up people's passwords, email and other personal information during its Street View mapping project.</p><p>Privacy advocates also criticized a Google social network, called Buzz, in 2010 for automatically including users' email contact. Google eventually settled the matter with the Federal Trade Commission and agreed to strengthen an existing privacy program.</p><p>Google is staying on the sidelines in other ways. Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook's endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill's co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.</p><p>Mr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement. Google has not taken a public position.</p><p>Similarly, Facebook and Google had donated $200,000 each to a group opposing a California ballot initiative that proposes enabling Californians to sue companies for data breaches, among other things. Facebook this week dropped its opposition to the initiative, which organizers said was on track to appear on the November ballot in California.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg's notes, which were photographed during the testimony, also contained a prepared response if lawmakers echoed criticism from Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, who has chided Facebook and other companies for collecting gobs of personal information about their users.</p><p>\"Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\" said the document. \"Important you hold everyone to the same standard.\"</p><p>Representatives for Facebook and Apple declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg's notes.</p><p>Apple has long campaigned to draw a distinction between the way it operates and the way Facebook and Google do.</p><p>\"We're not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it's an invasion of privacy,\" Mr. Cook told MSNBC. \"I think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic.\"</p><p>After users download Apple's most recent software update for iPhones and iPads, released on March 29, their devices prominently display a message that said \"privacy is a fundamental human right.\" Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said the update, which has been in the works for months, was intended to better inform users on its data practices and comply with Europe's new data-privacy rules that take effect May 25 - not taunt Facebook.</p><p>When asked if it was worried about regulations for the industry stemming from new scrutiny of Facebook, Apple referred to recent comments Mr. Cook made to MSNBC. He said he typically believed \"the best regulation is no regulation\" but \"I think we're beyond that here.\"</p><p>Amazon, for its part, has mirrored Google's approach, staying silent despite  the frequent attacks President Trump has made against the company on Twitter. Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.</p><p>Amazon uses shoppers' purchase history to target ads, though Forrester Research estimated its advertising revenue last year was $2.5 billion. Facebook makes $39.9 billion on ads and Google makes $95.4 billion.</p><p>Privacy advocates are also concerned about the tens of millions of Amazon Echo smart speakers and other voice-controlled devices that have put microphones in people's homes.</p><p>Amazon's top competitors for that business? Google and Apple.</p><p>Many tech companies understand that Washington's renewed focus on privacy is likely to reach them soon, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group representing the largest tech companies.</p><p>\"The tide has shifted,\" he said. \"I don't think this is passing us by.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi and Jack Nicas on Twitter: @daiwaka and @jacknicasNick Wingfield contributed reporting from Seattle.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005846255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3V-K7N1-JC85-N1SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 13, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Europe has been the most aggressive in taking on Silicon Valley, but a tougher approach is gaining ground in the United States, where the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/facebook-ftc-settlement.html\">Federal Trade Commission</url> is considering imposing a multibillion-dollar fine against Facebook, and lawmakers have called for new data-privacy regulations.</p><p>The parliamentary report recommends the creation of a British watchdog to oversee the technology industry, similar to the country\u2019s approach to regulating media companies. It also suggested legally requiring Facebook and other large internet platforms to remove what the government determines to be harmful content, or risk fines or other punishments.</p><p>Silicon Valley has long opposed making tech companies responsible for content on their sites. The industry argues that websites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are simply unbiased platforms for others to share material, and that new restrictions could impede free speech.</p><p>\u201cSocial media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a \u2018platform\u2019 and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites,\u201d the parliamentary report said.</p><p>Facebook acknowledged past mistakes and said it was open to \u201cmeaningful regulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,\u201d said Karim Palant, a public policy manager for Facebook in Britain. \u201cWe have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\u201d</p><p>The blistering report concludes the committee\u2019s work, which started as a study of how social media can be manipulated to influence elections like Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to exit the European Union, but became a closer examination of Facebook\u2019s business practices. The committee held several hearings related to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">Facebook\u2019s relationship with Cambridge Analytica</url>, the voter-targeting firm that gained access to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>The committee does not have lawmaking authority on its own, but Mr. Collins said in an interview that he hoped the recommendations would be incorporated into a broader review of technology regulation underway within the British government. Policymakers are debating new rules to prevent online election meddling, and the spread of hate speech and terrorist content.</p><p>A British parliamentary committee would not typically cause much worry for a company of Facebook\u2019s size, but the panel became a persistent challenge for the social media company.</p><p>Mr. Collins has threatened to force Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify if he ever travels to Britain. In December, the committee released a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/technology/facebook-documents-uk-parliament.html\">trove of secret internal emails</url> in which Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives discussed sharing access to user data with certain companies, like Netflix and Airbnb, while cutting off others.</p><p>The committee said the emails showed Facebook\u2019s willingness to sacrifice user privacy to maximize revenue and generate more money from advertising. Without new oversight, technology companies cannot be expected to change, the report concluded.</p><p>\u201cThe big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: A protester in London in November satirized Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg how his company could continue to offer services for free, the 33-year-old, already one of the richest men in the world, had a succinct response: \"Senator, we run ads.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People laughed, perhaps unfairly. Even though Orrin Hatch's question was preceded by remarks which showed he knew how Facebook made money, Zuckerberg was widely thought to have gotten the better of the exchange. But the assurance with which the self-made billionaire pronounced his words was supported by a business model set to face its most fundamental challenge yet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The implicit charges levied by technology companies on hundreds of millions of people around the world for posting family snaps, using search engines or keeping up with friends via email are set to be laid bare by landmark European legislation, potentially dealing a billion-dollar blow to a lucrative trade in third-party data and slashing advertising revenues.</p><p>The European Commission's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25, will require companies to gain users  consent before using their data and selling it on to advertisers, or face potentially enormous fines.</p><p>They will have to tell them what it is going to be used for, and the consent, which the EU wants to lapse after a year, can be withdrawn at any time.</p><p>While predicting how consumers will react is tricky, two marketing professors who have looked at the impact of expiry dates on cookies   the data trackers which websites download onto computers and can be used to monitor a user's every click   expect a big impact from this measure alone.</p><p>Cookie expiration could cost publishers, including Facebook and Google parent Alphabet Inc., 8.1% of the  10.6 billion in annual cookie-based display ad revenue, Klaus Miller and Bernd Skiera, from Goethe University in Frankfurt calculated. If the expiration period is set at two years, as the industry has lobbied for, this loss is reduced to 1.4%.</p><p>Cookies are more valuable if they last longer because ad marketers learn more about the users attached to specific cookies over time, Miller said in an email.</p><p>\"Essentially, this revenue loss stems from the lost value buildup over time that we would lose once cookies are set to auto expire,\" Miller said.</p><p>Fines</p><p>While the U.S. and Canada still accounted for the largest share of Facebook s revenue in 2017   $6.3 billion, as compared to $3.2 billion for Europe   the rate of revenue growth was higher in Europe, at 31% compared to 28%. Average revenue per user also increased more quickly in Europe than elsewhere, jumping by 41%, versus 36% in the U.S. and Canada, 22% for the Asia-Pacific region and 33% in the rest of the world. Facebook counted 277 million daily active users in Europe by the end of 2017.</p><p>While the cost of complying with GDPR will be significant, the cost of noncompliance would be higher. A first level of fines can run to the greater of  10 million or 2% of total revenue, and major violations can cost the higher of  20 million or 4% of total revenue.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepares to be interrogated.</p><p>Source: Associated Press</p><p>This is a major step up from the previous punitive regime governing electronic information. London-based TalkTalk Telecom Group plc was fined only \u00a3400,000 for the data breach of its 157,000 customers, noted Phil Beckett, a forensic technology expert with consultancy firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal. Last year, Spain's privacy watchdog said it was fining Facebook  1.2 million for its use of cookies. Facebook is appealing that decision.</p><p>\"While GDPR may be an initial burden on the balance sheet, firms need to consider the fines and reputational damage that could be incurred if something were to go wrong,\" Beckett said, adding that managing GDPR compliance may cost most companies \"upwards of six figures\" as well.</p><p>Facebook declined to speak about GDPR's potential effect on ad revenue. A person familiar with the company said while it did not comment on forward-looking revenue questions, Facebook was going to share more information on GDPR in the coming weeks.</p><p>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg reassured investors on a fourth-quarter conference call that \"the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in the GDPR framework, which are transparency and control. And we're building on this to make sure we're ready to fully comply by May.\"</p><p>In a Q&amp;A posted on the Facebook website, Zuckerberg said that the company intended to make the same controls and settings needed to comply with GDPR available everywhere, though he noted that it might not be in the same format in all jurisdictions. \"We need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with the different laws and different places,\" he said.</p><p>Paid content</p><p>That was a couple of months before the Cambridge Analytica news broke. Facebook stock dropped on the news and had lost 10.5% during 2018 to $157.93 by the close on April 9, the day before Zuckerberg started his two days in the Congressional hot seat. It has since recovered, standing at $168.66 by the close on April 17.</p><p>The share prices of other big tech companies, including Alphabet, Twitter Inc. and Snapchat-owner Snap Inc., also tumbled on fears that the revelations that Facebook data might have been used to help campaigns in favor of Donald Trump and Brexit, coupled with previous scandals over fake news and extremist content, might prompt U.S. authorities to impose GDPR-like rules, crimping advertising. Facebook has even approached conservative groups for help in fending off such legislation in Washington, Politico reported.</p><p>Some of these companies have made tentative moves toward straight-up charges for their services, such as when, in 2015, Google launched YouTube Red, which allows subscribers to watch videos uninterrupted by ads and provides original content for those willing to pay. But advertising remains the bedrock of their businesses, with Google reporting a 22% jump in fourth-quarter advertising revenue to $27.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. While other revenue was up 38%, it only came to $4.7 billion.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on a fourth-quarter earnings call that the company was committed to complying with GDPR for all services provided in Europe. Google did not respond to an emailed request for comment.</p><p>\"We've seen this movie before, especially in print and audio,\" said Laura Beaudin, a partner with consultancy Bain &amp; Co., referring to the crises which struck the newspaper and music industries when they struggled to find ways to make people pay for online continue.</p><p>\"It's been really hard for any company to survive with just an advertising model,\" she said.</p><p>But, so far, Facebook seems to be doing just that. Its fourth-quarter revenue from advertising was up 48% to $12.8 billion year over year, while payment and other fees accounted for only $193 million, an increase of 7%.</p><p>And at the hearing, Zuckerberg indicated that advertising was likely to remain central to his company, telling Sen. Hatch \"There will always be a version of Facebook that is free.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLFIN-44202450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLFIN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5G-9BT1-F19Y-C4HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1189\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Financial Services Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 19, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Internet &amp;
