It is an honor. I am heartened by your bipartisanship. I commend the detailed and focused preparation by committee staff in advanced of this hearing. If Congress is to make meaningful and appropriate laws, it must undertake these inquiries. Digital markets are complex field, and there is value to mapping its many dimensions and inviting different perspectives. This testimony reflects my own views and research carried out at Denmark's Center for Media and Information Technologies at Aalborg University. As a mother of three Danish-American children who are European citizens, I also have a personal and academic interest in why European policies are failing to stimulate European-made internet innovation and reducing consumer trust online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The objectives of this digital markets inquiry are to (1) document competition problems in digital markets, (2) examine whether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct, and (3) assess whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies, and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues. Additionally, the subcommittee seeks feedback on how and whether data either enable or deter market entry and how privacy may affect competition and antitrust enforcement.</p><p>Digitization challenges traditional antitrust analysis because of complexity and change. (1) Indeed the writings of Judge Louis Brandeis have been popularized of late to justify new-fangled antitrust approaches to large technology companies. However, just as Brandeis was skeptical about so-called big business, he was also concerned about big government. (2) As such, it is inconsistent to advocate dismantling enterprise while growing government.</p><p>Interestingly, Brandeis' key argument against large enterprise was that it was inefficient, but that critique does not describe today's technology firms, which are extremely efficient. These companies are highly innovative, continue to increase output, and deliver increasing value to end users. It is not in their interest to behave anticompetitively--at least in an overt way. However, I am concerned about their covert practices, their activities that do not in themselves rise to the level of antitrust violations but lead to conditions and settings that favor their continued dominance. Namely, I am concerned about how they influence public choices on internet policy and technology. Moreover, some large American tech firms have put Americans' safety, security, and privacy by bending to the will of the Chinese government in requiring data processing in China and with Chinese tools.</p><p>I will use the engineering concept of control points to describe this covert behavior. Just as a linchpin keeps a wheel from sliding off the axel, harnessing a control point is a powerful, efficient way to govern a system. As these platforms grow and gain economies of scale, the more easily they manage control points in the system, adding more capability with seemingly less effort. One need not control the system if one can just manage its control point. I will describe how the companies leverage control points in technology and public policy to gain advantages in the marketplace. Moreover, I will demonstrate how regulatory interventions, however well-intentioned, such as data protection, privacy regulation, and net neutrality, have strengthened the market positions of these companies. Many well-meaning policies are promoted on the premise that they will \"level the playing field,\" but we must look at the actual effects, not just the theory.</p><p>Moreover, I am skeptical to opportunistic, election season, media-seeking calls to break up \"big tech\". I am hard-pressed to find successes from government intervention. For example, American folklore alludes to the 19th-century railroads as justification for regulatory intervention, but the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission itself was a product of rent seeking, reflecting the political prioritization of powerful agricultural interests over that of transport, not consumers. (3) The government intervention in Microsoft changed little; Microsoft is today the largest technology company on earth with more than $1 trillion in market capitalization. Perhaps the most successful intervention was one that never happened-IBM. New modes of computering are what bested Big Blue, not enlightened regulators.</p><p>Consider telecommunications. The Bell Telephone Company and the American government agreed on a regulated national monopoly to ensure \"universal service\" in 1913. Regulators were tasked with setting prices to ensure \"fairness.\" Naturally the regulator that wanted to protect the entity on which its existence was predicated, so Bell earned excessive profits. However, consumers suffered unnaturally high prices and could only buy their phone from approved carriers. Finally, the Department of Justice broke up the collusion. However, competition was ultimately driven by new technologies in cable and mobile wireless, not governmental intervention.</p><p>The airline industry followed a similar pattern. Until deregulation in 1978, airlines in America operated under a government sanctioned oligopoly, a cartel for airmail delivery, passenger routes, and transport rates. Partial deregulation of the airline industry in the US and sunset of its outdated regulation led to a 45% decline in consumer airline ticket prices from 1978 to 2008, a doubling of passengers, a quantum leap in airline productivity, and the emergence of low-cost carriers.</p><p>It's hard to see past the dominance of the large tech-platform companies today--but if we regulate them like monopolies, they will be around a lot longer than without the help of regulation. Today's tech giants came to prominence with better products and services that unseated their heavily regulated rivals in television, radio and print. Yet once the web firms gained critical mass, they blocked potential competitors through classic telecom rules like \"network neutrality\" obligations and anti-discrimination policies that were applied to the telecom operators but not to them. These rules have given the tech titans a free ride along the information highway. They force consumers to pay the full cost of their communications, rather than have it subsidized with advertising. Just as ads let Google and Facebook offer free services, it could lower the price of internet service. This innovation would give advertisers credible alternatives to the reigning platforms. That's why the tech giants and their globally coordinated advocates have fought vehemently against it, aborting its birth by lambasting it as \"non-neutral\". The rules were designed by the internet industry and maintained for its benefit. But such \"regulatory capture\" is not abnormal. Economic history is replete with eye-popping examples of sector-specific regulations that perpetuated monopolies rather than tempered their dominance.</p><p>As we can see some 18 months after the promulgation of the European Union's exalted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Google, Facebook, and Amazon have gained market share while their fledgling ad tech rivals have lost ground. Only the largest players can afford the GDPR's costly requirements for lawyer fees, staff hires, software updates, and 45 other requirements. Many studies suggest that European consumers are worse off from the GDPR. The EU's morass of privacy laws, regulations, directives, and disclaimers are not lessening data breaches or the proliferation of Chinese apps, which operate in brazen defiance of European rules.</p><p>Policies such as GDPR, net neutrality and other misguided regulation have strengthened Silicon Valley dominance, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will likely extend it further. If we want the reign of the platforms to end, we should accelerate the rollout of new technologies and lower barriers to entry to new technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, block-chain, and so on.</p><p>Technology as a Control Point</p><p>A company's governance of control points, whether they are in the platform's network or not, can strengthen a platform. Control points are not the same as network effects, the increased value that a platform enjoys as more people use it. The governance of control points is an important component of understanding the complexity of online systems. I will provide examples of control points including operating systems, developer tools, digital book pricing, third-party contracts, and the DoH, the so-called domain name server (DNS) over secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), unilateral efforts by Google and Mozilla to subsume a vital part of internet protocol into their proprietary networks.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple offer platforms or digital ecosystems with a foundational architectural superstructure on which modules or applications can be added to extend the services. This co-creation among the platform owner, users, and developers tussles between generative innovation and infrastructure control. (4) Some of these generative characteristics include leverage (the extent to which tools make possible a set of activities that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive otherwise), adaptability (the scope of uses tools can be put to and the ease to which they can be modified to extend this range of uses), mastery (ease to adopt tools by a broad audience), accessibility (ease of access to the tools and the information on how to use them), and transferability (degree to which the instrument can be deployed for new uses). (5)</p><p>While many radio, TV, and print outlets blame online players for displacing and disrupting their revenue, online platforms have improved the experience for consumers and advertisers. They have also expanded the media market, creating entirely new channels of distribution out of ones and zeros. More broadly, online players have invested billions of dollars to attract users and to make the online experience compelling, while many brick-and-mortar retailers have failed to make the physical shopping experience more pleasant and convenient. It feels like work to drive to a mall, find a parking space, walk a long distance to a store in surroundings with offending music and lighting, and then interact with a disinterested employee. (6) Indeed, it is personalization based on personal information that makes the online experience compelling and convenient.</p><p>However, personalization is not unique to the online world. Many can remember the shopkeeper who recognized you, knew which products to recommend based on your relationship, and tailored unique offers to you based on your preferences. The difference today, of course, is that the knowledge of relationship is documented in code and strengthened with other sources of information. It was possible to do this in the past, but it was costly and time-consuming. Moreover, many forms of consumer tracking today did not exist in the past, notably mobile device tracking. Indeed, online brands are attempting to build a brick-and-mortar presence with their coded knowledge. (7)</p><p>Some suggest that the ability to amass data itself is a barrier to competition; however, today's innovators and entrepreneurs have multiple ways to access large databases whether free, open source projects, or via commercial databases. Indeed, there are significant costs and risks to warehouse data, and many firms find it preferable to purchase data in the market, rather than host the data themselves.</p><p>Access to data is important for machine learning. Leading financial analyst and physicist Richard Windsor explains that while media hype focuses on the killer apps of new technologies that</p><p>... it's the smaller, simpler and deadly dull projects that are likely to see real success in the short to medium-term... boring things like saving money on electricity and basic automation where the money is going to be made... Deep learning, at its heart, is a system for statistically separating characteristics of data such that when these characteristics occur again, they can be recognized... Furthermore, the algorithm needs to be shown every combination and permutation that is possible before it can be relied on with 100% accuracy. This means that the ideal task needs to have both a finite and a stable dataset in order for deep learning to work well. (8)</p><p>A similar concern is expressed that some platform owners have disproportionate ability to mine their own data warehouses. However, this can't be true in all cases because platforms make much of their proprietary data and capabilities available through application program interfaces (APIs). The analog example is the grocery story that creates a house brand or white label brand based upon information it has about its customers and vendors. However, not all product categories are successes, and stores may focus on quality rather than price. (9)</p><p>Control Point Examples in Digital Markets</p><p>The operating system (OS) is the software that supports a computer's basic functions. Operating systems were originally designed as digital operating manuals; they did not collect or track user behavior for marketing purposes. Developers use operating systems to access baseline data about the workings of an application. This information is frequently called telemetry: data to monitor performance remotely, especially crashes and errors. Finding and improving deficiencies help improve the system through patches, updates, and successive versions. Transforming the operating system from a mere analytics dashboard to a commercial marketing system is part and parcel of the realization of modern smartphones. While may antitrust discussion focus on the monopoly of Android-enabled devices, many forget that Android replaced the Nokia smartphone with its Symbian operating system, a platform that many thought was unbreakable. With 5G, we can begin to see creative destruction as smartphones will be supplanted by the Internet of Things.</p><p>Operating systems are the subject of considerable conflict. The Apple iOS platform ecosystem offers a rich field for research with millions of devices, over half a billion users, and millions of apps. An information systems analysis examined 4,664 technical articles published from 2007 to 2011 on the topic of contested innovation on the iOS operating system. (10) Some 30 incidents were cited as disputes between Apple and other actors over \"boundary resources,\" the interface between the platform and developer. These incidents emerged over time, and many are ongoing today and reflect the general nature of the rivalry over sharing resources, notably Apple's rules about the language in which third-party apps must be written, how to migrate its customer base to new devices and systems, and even controversial judgments about whether some apps are politically unacceptable.</p><p>Android, by far the world's most popular operating system, has been the focus of antitrust investigations abroad related to the bundling of the operating system with Google's suite of applications, the legality of derivative versions of the operating system, and alleged exclusionary licensing of its operating system. The efficacy of these approaches in promoting innovation and alternatives remains to be seen, and there are some questions as to whether the EU properly applied competition law. (11)</p><p>The Android OS serves as the \"brain\" of a device containing the information of the system, all the inputs and outputs of the device, notably the log of calls and messages and the bank of photos, videos, contacts, and calendar. Android records the users' keystrokes, words, and viewed images. Android sees the information a user types before it is encrypted. Android sees the decrypted message once it's received. Android sees all browsing data, the URLs entered, search terms, pages visited and specific clicked items, logins, time spent on content, file uploads and downloads, IP address, bookmarks, app user history, and more. It has location history such as the device location, coordinated with cell tower information, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.</p><p>Android's capabilities extend to data collected by sensors, webcams, microphones, and any other mobile attachments. In the earlier versions, app developers were able to access, profile, and track \"persistent\" identifiers such as the Android ID, International Mobile Equipment Identity number, (12) hardware addresses, and SIM serial card number. (13) The advertising ID is the user's digital marketing fingerprint that is consistent across the apps and devices they use. With the \"advertising ID\" asset, Android can work more closely with app developers and advertisers to provide more relevant advertising to the user and monetize the experience. Android assigns unique and global advertising identifiers, more comprehensive than cookies, to devices and allows apps to access that unique identifier for each device running the operating system. (14) These data are collected and processed from users, both to make the systems and applications work better and to provide insights to advertisers. Data from the operating system may be combined with personal data from other systems for marketing, research and development, and so on. For these reasons, the Android operating system can be provided to the end user without an out-of-pocket cost.</p><p>Facebook offers interesting jurisdictional questions because most of its users are outside the United States, and it attempts to tailor many of its offerings to local tastes. It hosts a variety of points of control that both enable users and developers to engage and share and allow Face-book to impose discipline. Facebook hosts many competing applications in platform, such as YouTube, Twitch, games, monetary transaction, and music. These apps can be experienced without leaving Facebook. While users enjoy the experience because they like to share it with their friends, it allows Facebook to capture additional personal data that can be used for ad mon-etization. Given the platform's capabilities, which can allow content to go viral, Facebook is constantly managing distribution, and it is critiqued on the one hand for not immediately blocking fake accounts or for not immediately stopping violent, terrorist content and on the other for not distributing social content widely enough. Facebook has made major investments in human and artificial intelligence for content and developer moderation, but it appears that the platform grows faster than its capability to manage, and the company has suffered in its earnings as a result. (15) Facebook's internal limitations and shortcomings represent opportunities for competitive alternatives. Hill Holliday's survey of Generation Z (those born since 1994) shows that so-called digital natives, who are estimated to comprise 40 percent of U.S. consumers by 2020 and of whom more than 90 percent use social media platforms, found that more than one-half had switched off social media for extended periods and one-third had canceled their social media accounts. (16) Users cited time wasting as the reason for quitting twice as often as a concern about privacy. While service providers don't like the high rates of churn on their platforms, (17) they are indicative of a competitive market in which consumers find it easy to leave and try other platforms with different features.</p><p>Amazon's relentless focus on data has reinvented the retail experience and provides an important source of competition to Google in product search. Amazon was able to incubate with a unique set of factors such as the investors who were comfortable with losses while it gained market share and profitability; the dearth of sales tax; brick-and-mortar competitors that shouldered many labor, environmental, and other regulations it did not; and regulatory decisions that deterred retailers from mergers that would have otherwise increased its competition. Amazon's control points include digital book pricing, an area in which it attempted to be price maker, but a challenge from publishers has changed how prices are negotiated. (18) As a platform for third parties, Amazon faces conflicts over contract terms, alleged cannibalization with white label products, and proliferation of banned, unsafe, and mislabeled products. (19) Similar concerns have been raised around Amazon Web Services (AWS), for example that it mines the data of retailers for insights to improve its own ecommerce. (20) However a bad rap for AWS is boon to its competitors IBM, Oracle, Virtustream, Microsoft, CenturyLink, RackSpace, and others which can set up service level agreements to avoid such practices.</p><p>The notion of control points embraces \"co-opetition,\" (21) the idea that firms both cooperate and compete in the marketplace and suggests that firms and industries converge, develop, and create value in unexpected ways. (22) To describe this process David Teece's 1986 paper \"Profiting from Technological Innovation: Implications for Integration, Collaboration, Licensing and Public Policy\" (23) is essential. He observed that most innovations are not products themselves. They must be combined with complementary assets before they can be marketable products. Such partnerships lower barriers to entry and provide rewards to an innovator upfront.</p><p>Firms make partnerships or \"join complementary assets\" (e.g., content provider and broadband provider) to make applications known. Most applications on their own have little to no value, or will almost never be found, unless they are joined with their complementary asset. Thus, a specialized asset may be an operating system that runs on a mobile phone, such as Apple iOS or Android. A co-specialized asset may be a 4G mobile network for the Apple iPhone, its complementary asset. Many iPhone features cannot be realized unless the phone is connected to the appropriate 4G mobile network (e.g., Siri or Uber).</p><p>Marketing is a type of complementary asset. For many firms the cost on getting online is nominal: fees of hosting, storage, and servers. Where they face major barriers may be competition from other content, applications, and services, not to mention being findable on platforms such as search engines, social platforms, and app stores. The practices of search engine optimization and app store optimization are designed to help firms overcome these intermediaries.</p><p>Further, Teece's paper attempts to predict whether the innovator will succeed. To determine who wins, one needs to examine (1) appropriability--how easy is it to leverage knowledge, ease of imitation, intellectual property, etc.--and (2) complementary assets--who owns what (generic, co-specialized, or specialized). Teece also distinguishes between invention and innovation (ability to do something better than the state of the art), the latter of which adds value to users and economy. This is analogous to incremental and fundamental innovation.</p><p>Teece observes that innovating firms frequently fail to win the profits of their innovation and that the owner of the intellectual property does not necessarily get the benefit. It goes instead to customers, suppliers, or competitors--the actor which has the best fit of complementary assets. He gives the examples of EMI having developed the CAT scanner but competitors succeeding to commercialize it; RC Cola having developed diet soda but both Coca-Cola and Pepsi succeeding; Bowmar introducing the calculator but HP and Texas Instruments commercializing it; and Xerox developing the fundamental innovations that Apple managed to commercialize.</p><p>To overcome this, incumbent firms would be wise to get a position in the complementary asset market. Frequently it is not the firm that is first to market that wins, but rather that which is third, fourth, and so on. In any case, the need to work with complementary firms is reflected in the presence of joint ventures, coproduction agreements, cross-distribution arrangements, and technology licensing.</p><p>Teece also describes two stages of scientific evolution, the pre-paradigm stage and the paradigm stage. In the pre-paradigm stage, there are competing ideas, and designs are fluid. In the paradigm stage, designs become accepted, codified, and standardized. One design emerges as best (e.g., Model T, IBM 360, Douglas DC-3). Once design emerges, competition shifts to price away from design. Scale and capital then become important. Innovation can still occur but may be in niches. This model tends to characterize large consumer markets.</p><p>Few industries have the benefit of strong appropriabilities. Most of the time the appropriability is weak, so the innovator needs a business model to make its innovation known. In the pre-paradigm stage, innovators need to allow their designs to \"float\" to get enough of a market test to see whether they can work. In the pre-paradigm stage, the focus is on the winning design. Production is low (few users), so it does not yet make sense to deploy specialized assets. There are no scale economies, and price is not necessarily an issue. With the move to the paradigm stage, investment becomes irreversible. Once the design becomes standardized, then the importance of complementary assets takes over.</p><p>Marketing and distribution are a key complementary asset. This was demonstrated with the PC market. Many companies made computers, but few succeeded because of the scale required to sell to companies across the US (i.e., need a large sales force, get on retail shelves, etc.). So, the strategy is to sell to the big provider (e.g., IBM). In any case, Teece concludes that strategic partnerships frequently do not work for the reasons he cites. (24)</p><p>IBM's success in the PC market was related to joining the complementary assets, many of them generic. It made more sense for IBM to find them in the market than to develop them in-house. IBM's key asset relative to the generic inputs was its strong brand, which engendered credibility with customers, plus its formidable marketing and distribution network. (25)</p><p>Complementary assets are not a one-size-fits-all solution; rather it requires that each actor pursue the relevant partnership. This contrasts to the overrated policy prescription of data portability. While porting a phone number from one mobile operator to another may make sense, data from a social network do not necessarily map to an online marketplace. (26) An economic experiment with college students in the EU found that data portability was their least valued \"right\" of the GDPR. (27) This speaks to the lack of testing and evidence before the adoption of the GDPR and a common mistake made by policy elites to assume that users desire their preferred solutions. Instead policymakers should focus on ensuring that the marketplaces encourage innovation and experimentation.</p><p>DoH in the Mozilla and Chrome Web Browser</p><p>Another control point is the DNS, the naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network. Normally, DNS is a separate service from the platform, but platforms can also exert control on points outside their network.</p><p>DNS is characterized as a feature of the decentralized and modular architecture of the internet. Many different entities provide DNS service, and it is at the forefront to fight cyberattacks, block malicious traffic, and limit the spread of child exploitation, terrorism, and other illegal activities. DNS is also the technology that allows parents to exercise controls to protect their children and families and a range of privacy-enhancing tools that are deployed today. DNS also enables the content delivery network industry.</p><p>One of the many privacy-enhancing technologies is encryption, techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. Encrypted internet traffic has hit an all-time threshold of over 72 percent of all network traffic, up from 55 percent in Q3 of 2017. (28) Google has been leading the charge for encryption, and while its operating system can see the data before and after it is encrypted, it encrypts its browser traffic so that no other parties can see it.</p><p>With a simple update to their code, Google can bypass the user's local DNS and send encrypted traffic to the central Google or Mozilla server instead, as Mozilla recently announced it plans to do soon in the US. (29) While we should encourage technological efforts to improve privacy, DoH puts even more of the internet under Google's domain and dramatically changes the internet's decentralized character. Google and Mozilla (30) offer that the move is a mere default setting to which the user can opt out and that they offer parent DNS solutions and \"safe search\" options. Undoubtedly, DoH makes business sense for Google and Mozilla, and some users may welcome the change. However, the furtive nature of the rollout appears to violate the spirit of the multi-stakeholder internet community. Security analysts have observed that centralizing traffic to Google's or Mozilla's DNS creates a new but needless central point of attack, breaks many parental controls, disrupts enterprise content filtering solutions, and interferes with malware detection systems. Moreover, it can exacerbate challenges for law enforcement, which has hitherto relied on DNS information. However, the lucrative new opportunities for global data monetization by large platforms is likely driving the DoH effort.</p><p>AEI's Shane Tews observes:</p><p>Centralized encrypted DNS is a new model of internet business that goes beyond online advertising; it's a play by companies looking to exploit user behavior for their own monetary gain, cloaked as an effort to improve security and privacy. Of course, the information in these transactions can also be shared or sold with various unnamed third parties for predictive analytics and other purposes. (31)</p><p>It is not clear whether disadvantaged parties could take legal action against Google and Mozilla for an activity that turns off their traffic in an instant, but it exemplifies that vast power that can be wielded, outside of the platforms, with a mere coding tweak.</p><p>Public Policy as a Control Point</p><p>Technology can create lock-in effects but can be overcome by innovation and design. Policy and regulation, on the other hand, are more powerful control points because they can be cemented by rule of law.</p><p>Data Protection and Privacy Regulation</p><p>A policy control point is the EU's GDPR. It stipulates that any entity in the world using a European's data must comply with 45 specific regulations including hiring a chief privacy officer; purchasing a GDPR compliant software system; submitting annual audits and impact assessment to the authorities; at users' request, delivering services to users without their participation; and, at moment's notice, producing, rectifying, erasing, or transferring a user's data, among other requirements. European politicians proffered that this regime would level the playing field with Big Tech and put users in control, but 18 months after its implementation, we find that largest US tech firms have increased their market share, the ad tech competitors of these firms have lost market share, many small- and medium-sized (SMEs) firms have exited, and Europeans' trust online is at the lowest point since 2006. Less than half of all applicable firms comply given the high cost, some $3 million per firm. Indeed, the data protection authorities are flooded with complaints, many generated by bots, and moreover most complaints focus on billing issues with financial and retail providers, which are already covered under other laws. Europeans rarely exercise any of their 17 newly invented data protection \"rights.\"</p><p>Since the implementation of the GDPR, Google, Facebook, and Amazon have increased their online advertising market share in the EU. (32) Three things have happened. (33) First, the high cost of GDPR compliance is a fixed cost; large, profitable firms can absorb this, but it falls harder on SMEs. Second, many advertisers and publishers have stopped using tracking tools that compete with Google and Facebook, giving a greater share of the market to the established players. Third, users are less likely to try new platforms and tools, sticking instead with the \"devil they know\" in the incumbent players because they perceive that the larger companies have more resources to comply with the regulation.</p><p>The GDPR has affected the downstream advertising market as well. Given the scope of Google's advertising platform and its affiliates on syndicated networks, its compliance with the GDPR has caused ripple effects in ancillary markets. Independent ad exchanges noted prices plummeting 20 to 40 percent. (34) Some advertisers reported being shut out from exchanges. (35) The GDPR's complex and arcane designations for \"controllers\" and \"processors\" can ensnare third-party chipmakers, component suppliers, and software vendors that have never interfaced with end users, as European courts have ruled that any part of the internet ecosystem can be liable for data breaches. (36) One online publisher called the GDPR the \"Google Data Protection Regulation\" and explained, \"We have suddenly become even more dependent on Google, while other exchanges are hurting.\"</p><p>For those who study the empirical outcomes of regulation, the GDPR's perverse outcomes are surprising. As Nobel economist George Stigler observed more than 40 years ago, \"Regulation is acquired by industry and operated for its benefit.\" (37) There was an expectation that large fines would deter the platforms' business, that companies would be less aggressive in data collection, and that a space would open for small firms, but as Politico reported, large firms with financial and regulatory resources have \"gamed\" the system. Rules that were supposed to empower citizens have instead helped \"Big Tech.\" (38)</p><p>However, disruptive innovation which would allow startups to topple the giants is probably not the goal of most European policymakers. Instead these elites likely prefer a predictable, long-lasting, and highly regulated oligopoly under government control conforms to their ordoliberal preferences. This contrasts with American notions of a free and fair marketplace in which startups have a shot for success without being unduly burdened by regulation. That fact that so many Europeans entrepreneurs come to the US to launch their business is a testament to this fact.</p><p>Some 40,000 internet startups in the US were founded in 2018 alone. (39) However, this a staggering number is likely to fall with the promulgation of the CCPA, what I call the GDPR-heavy because it adds 77 new regulations to enterprise, 22 more than the GDPR. The largest platforms would prefer to extend the GDPR to the US, rather than to adopt the CCPA, which has some overlapping but slightly different provisions. Indeed, Microsoft has reportedly asked US policymakers for the GDPR to be extended. (40) When large players start asking for regulation on themselves, their motivation is probably not to create competition in their own market.</p><p>The California Department of Justice and Office of the Attorney General recently issued a cost benefit analysis of the CCPA legislation and its own supplementary regulation. It notes the total initial compliance cost of $55 billion, 1.8 percent of California's gross domestic product in 2018, and another $16 billion in the coming decade. (41) About half of surveyed firms expect costs to run between $100,000 and $1 million, with vast majority of the fees going for legal services. The report also notes that 99 percent of California companies have fewer than 500 employees, meaning that costs will fall hardest on the firms with the least amount of resources and employees. (42)</p><p>Even with sophisticated modeling and economic projections, there are no scenarios in which benefits either meet or exceed costs with the CCPA. The most generous models suggest consumer benefit could amount to $1.6-$5.4 billion over time based on experiments in which consumers report willingness to pay for privacy features. Other cost benefit models suggest conservatively that the costs of the CCPA exceed benefits by a factor of four. (43)</p><p>As such, the policy will be a drag on the economy and is likely to hasten the SME exodus from the state. For a state that bills itself as a progressive leader, California is transferring massive wealth to the privacy and plaintiff bars, key advocates for the CCPA. If the goal was to help consumers, then it would be better to provide rebates to customers than fees to lawyers. The report reiterates the findings of the GDPR with the expectation of a similar impact with the CCPA noting,</p><p>Small firms are likely to face a disproportionately higher share of compliance costs relative to larger enterprises. Conventional wisdom may suggest that stronger privacy regulations will adversely impact large technology firms that derive most of their revenue from personal data, however evidence from the EU suggests the opposite may be true. Over a year after the introduction of the GDPR, concerns regarding its impact on larger firms appear to have been overstated, while many smaller firms have struggled to meet compliance costs. Resources explain this dichotomy as large technology companies are often several steps ahead of both competitors and regulators. (44)</p><p>When startups and small players exit, existing large companies which can afford to comply will take the market share of the firms that exited.</p><p>This is what happened in the EU and is what will happen in California if the CCPA is not preempted. Academic studies of other industries over time have noted that entry regulation is a barrier to entrepreneurship. (45) (46)</p><p>Not only can complex regulation reduce enterprise, it tricks consumers into believe the marketplace is trustworthy. Indeed \"complex regulatory frameworks create the illusion of a well-controlled system,\" notes a recent report of Scientific Board of the European Financial Systemic Risk Board. (47) Similar unintended consequences have been noted in other industries, particularly banking and finance as the report describes,</p><p>Excessively complex regulations contribute to increased systemic risk in several ways. First, complex regulatory frameworks create the illusion of a well-controlled system, while at the same time creating incentives for regulated entities to game the system. Second, such a framework risks missing contingencies that are not well understood, e.g. because of a lack of historical experience. An \"over-fitted\" regulatory system may not be well equipped to address \"unknown unknowns\". Third, when risks materialize, the combination of hard-to-understand interactions between different regulations and a wide array of regulatory tools can make policy responses convoluted and difficult to judge. It can also hamper the accountability of regulators and supervisors. Finally, excessive regulatory complexity can encourage the transfer of risks to institutions outside the regulatory perimeter, creating an environment where systemic risk is amplified more than it would have been if risks had remained within the perimeter. (48)</p><p>Public policy should promote firms to use data, not punish them for improving products and services for their customers. Indeed, the trouble with today's economy is not that there is too much use of data, but too little. A lack of \"information intensity\" is holding back the so-called other 70 percent of American economy, sectors such as transportation and health care, the latter of which consumes almost one-fifth of gross domestic product. (49) Outside of certain applications, the traditional healthcare industry is woefully inefficient; digital industries, on the other hand, are eight times more productive and innovative. If the US does not innovate these other sectors, other nations will beat us to it. China is already on track with an \"Internet Plus\" policy which supports the digitization of industries, including healthcare and government. (50)</p><p>While policies such as the GDPR and CCPA claim to promote competition, they both have the effect of increasing barriers for new market entrants and reducing competition. When they were founded, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft enjoyed permissionless data collection and processing innovation; the next wave of innovators will not. So, we can only expect to drag out the dominance of these large firms which now enjoy government-promoted protection from competition. A detailed discussion of the effects of the GDPR and CCPA is submitted to the subcommittee in a separate report, as it exceeds time allotted this hearing.</p><p>Internet Regulation</p><p>Public policy is a salient control point in the marketplace, and its value is so well established that is has been enshrined by Tullock's paradox. (51) It notes that the cost of rent-seeking is small relative to the gains. (52) While the size of the public affairs budgets of the big tech companies can make for an interesting story or two in the press, a few million dollars is relatively little compared to their total operations, which number in the trillions of dollars. It makes good economic sense for the companies to spend a few million on public affairs to win favorable public policy, for the costs of developing fundamental innovation and associated products and services is in the billions. For more than a decade, control point subterfuge by the tech companies fooled policymakers into thinking that America's 5,441 internet service providers were a threat internet openness. The entire US broadband industry, some $300 billion, is still smaller than the market capitalization of any one of the internet giants. And still, many policymakers have supported a distorted notion that the internet giants should be shielded from competition.</p><p>My doctoral research investigated net neutrality policy across 53 countries during the period of 2010-16 to test the hypothesis that countries that adopt hard, bright line net neutrality rules should experience an increase in locally developed mobile app development innovation in their national economy. (53) Following the net neutrality tenets, I expected to see those countries adopting rules would experience greater competition to established edge providers. However, I discovered the opposite. In fact, net neutrality in practice works to cement the market position of existing giants. In no country that has adopted hard net neutrality rules have we seen any platforms emerge to challenge Google, Facebook, or Amazon. In fact, the only places that has produced meaningful competitors to these firms are Russia and China, and these countries have no net neutrality rules at all. If we followed the net neutrality predictions, we should have seen global platforms emerge from Brazil and India, which have had hard net neutrality rules for years. Tomasso Valletti has also described the ambiguous effects of this policy. (54)</p><p>Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and to a lesser degree, Apple, have lobbied hard in the US and other countries on this issue. They have succeeded to enshrine the norm that disproportionately large senders of traffic pay little to nothing for the cost of networks while the end user pays the full network cost regardless of whether she visits those sites. Moreover, the policy restricts competition by prohibiting startups and end users the freedom to partner to tailor services to their individual wants, needs, and budgets. If it was not for the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which allows the industrial sector to work collectively for favorable price controls, these platforms would likely be guilty of collusion and restraint of trade.</p><p>Policy Considerations</p><p>Stop Promoting Regulation That Strengthens the Largest Players</p><p>If we are concerned about competition and market entry, we must stop making high-cost policies that give Big Tech an unfair advantage. This testimony documents how many well-intentioned regulations delivered the opposite of their intended effect. The high cost of compliance has turned into a market barrier that only the richest companies can afford. As a result, nascent competitors have either stagnated or exited the market while the large companies gained market share. I urge Congress not to adopt the GDPR, or its US imitator, the CCPA, whose financial impacts are likely to be even more detrimental to the US than the GDPR is to Europe.</p><p>If the California law is promulgated, it will likely be challenged in court on free speech grounds and will ultimately be struck down as unconstitutional. Moreover, the CCPA threatens to torpedo more than two-dozen hard-fought privacy laws with existing regimes and regulators overseeing the health and insurance sectors, to name just two industries. To keep the US from devolving into 50 conflicting layers of privacy regulation and destroying interstate internet commerce, Congress should preempt the CCPA with evidence-based policy instrument that complement, not supplant, existing law.</p><p>Rational Privacy Protections</p><p>Evidence-based policy is a rational, linear process to make decisions based upon an evaluation of problems and possible solutions, the collection of information about the possible solutions, and the measurement and comparison of expected outcomes. Had California used an evidence-based approach, it would have conducted randomized, controlled trials to test the efficacy of the 185 provisions rather than slop together a laundry list of feel good rules, as it did over a few weeks. (55) The policy process should be informed by competing approaches with associated assessments before legislation is made, not after. Ideally the bill would undergo Congressional scoring and/or review by the Office of Management and Budget for additional rigor.</p><p>I appreciate the efforts of this committee, notably Ranking Member Collins, (56) to explore rational, rule-of-law-based methods to protect consumers' privacy and encourage innovation without burdening small- and medium-sized enterprise. Such an approach preserves Constitutional rights and freedoms including interstate commerce; honors the single national market created by our founders; and protects the legal system from rent-seeking and abuse by the plaintiff bar and litigation financiers who wish to profit off the largesse of the tech industry. Most consumers never the rents of class action lawsuits, as winnings go overwhelmingly to the attorneys bringing the cases. (57)</p><p>Congressman Collins' proposal (58) dovetails with the \"Privacy Bill of Rights\" presented by the 2012 Obama White House, a sound privacy framework built on the principles of individual control, transparency, respect for context, security, accuracy, and accountability and strengthened enforcement at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). (59) President Obama's proposal supported using multi-stakeholder processes to develop enforceable codes of conduct through Section 5 of the FTC Act. Moreover, the Obama administration was adamant about the need for preemption of state laws that would contradict the national standard. Plan architect Cameron F. Kerry describes how it would have functioned,</p><p>The bill of rights articulated seven basic principles that should be legally enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission: individual control, transparency, respect for the context in which the data was obtained, access and accuracy, focused collection, security, and accountability. These broad principles are rooted in longstanding and globally-accepted \"fair information practices principles.\" To reflect today's world of billions of devices interconnected through networks everywhere, though, they are intended to move away from static privacy notices and consent forms to a more dynamic framework, less focused on collection and process and more on how people are protected in the ways their data is handled. Not a checklist, but a toolbox. This principles-based approach was meant to be interpreted and fleshed out through codes of conduct and case-by-case FTC enforcement--iterative evolution, much the way both common law and information technology developed. (60)</p><p>Sadly, Silicon Valley thwarted this visionary plan. (61) It is likely that had the US adopted this plan in 2012, it would have beat the EU to the privacy punch and avoided much of the current state of fallout.</p><p>University of Washington Law professor Jane Winn offers a helpful overview of US information law, noting how the US focused on risk-based laws which allow innovation except where risk justifies precaution versus the EU where the bureaucracy administers unilateral control rights. (1) She explains that the US approach is an attempt to strike a balance between the public demand for protection from harm with the public demand growth and innovation, and making legislation when there is a clear misuse of information to harm individuals. Citing the low rate of compliance of EU firms with information laws (both the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive and the GDPR), Winn explains that European governments and businesses have an \"attitude of calculated indifference toward the challenge of achieving real compliance\" and reluctance to compete on digitization. She observes, \"American businesses are more likely than their European counterparts to try to use technology innovation as a source of competitive advantage.\"</p><p>Winn describes important historical points where consumer choice and business innovation have allowed the United States to emerge as the global leader in making digital transformation accessible to individuals and the punctuating legislation. For example in prior centuries, one of the first things European immigrants did upon arriving to the US was to borrow money for new clothes so that they could blend in with Americans. (2) \"Consumerism and the power to construct a new identity with consumer credit remain inextricably woven into the fabric of American democracy,\" she writes. When Congress enacted the world's first fair information practices law to protect American consumers' power to borrow money, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, \"it was acting in response to the high level of concern among American consumers that the migration of paper credit bureau records to computers might needlessly restrict their access to credit.\" If there is an \"fundamental right\" enshrined in American legislation, it is the \"right of American consumers to borrow freely to finance their present consumption... in most European countries, there is often a deep ambivalence or even hostility toward American-style consumerism and the culture of easy access to consumer credit that makes it possible,\" notes Winn.</p><p>A related issue in the 1970s was a deep distrust of the US government from the Vietnam War and Watergate which threatened to deter signups to the new Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare commissioned a report to determine what the federal government needed to do to restore trust, resulting in the groundbreaking 1973 HEW Report on Computers, Records and the Rights of Citizens and the subsequent Privacy Act of 1974 which contained the first mention of \"fair information privacy practices\" or FIPPS ever articulated anywhere in the world. FIPPs was \"a way to restore the necessary balance between the interests of individuals in how their data is processed on the one hand, and the interests of organizations and the public generally in how that data is processed on the other.\" What has allowed the Privacy Act to endure is not the notion of privacy as a fundamental right of individual control (an idea it rejects), but rather the mutual interest of the individual and the government to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the personal information with the use of FIPPS as a guide. Congress has since made many information privacy laws for specific areas, still in effect today, depending on the harm at risk with the issue at hand. (3)</p><p>Winn advises a new framework of information governance that simultaneously addresses privacy and disclosure in a flexible, dynamic way. Congress can borrow elements of other U.S. laws that have been very successful in other contexts, such as the way the way regulators work with voluntary, consensus standards organizations to create concrete, certifiable standards for the specific business practice in question. Unlike industry self-regulation, \"accredited\" standards are certified by the American National Standards Institute and organizations adopting these official standards must observing the due process requirements contained in a document known as \"ANSI Essential Requirements.\" ANSI standards are already employed today successfully across many industries. A key advantage compared to the EU's blanket rights approach is that standards are explicit, technical, and measurable and therefore can ensure stricter compliance.</p><p>To enable the transition for the millions of firms to which the integrated, national information framework would apply, Congress could authorize federal regulators to confer \"safe harbor\" status to organizations adopting the rigorous standards along with limited preemption for inconsistent state laws. Notably such rules allow the FTC to impose stricter rules when warranted on certain firms and industries, rather than to saddle every startup with obligations designed for a trillion-dollar platform. Most important, Winn describes why the traditional US approach to privacy has been the best avenue to deliver democracy and actual privacy on the ground, not just on the books.</p><p>Cloaking European-style data protection law in the language of fundamental rights short-circuits the democratic process of balancing the costs and benefits of different regulatory strategies... Having insulated themselves from democratic accountability with a fundamental rights narrative, EU institutions are now reaping a whirlwind of populist and nationalist movements across Europe that are openly hostile to European institutions... For those who have never faced the challenge of creating and sustaining a culture of compliance, EU-style data protection law appears to be a much simpler, clearer solution to the problem of information governance than a messy, ambiguous risk-based approach. It is only when the challenges of achieving actual compliance is taken into account that the democratic character of the American risk-based model becomes clear.</p><p>Congress is right to focus on competition in the tech sector, but it won't achieve this with from third rate platforms mandate by government fiat. Instead Congress should hasten the next technological revolution which will supplant the current incumbents. This can be done through policy that supports investments and incentives for next-generation technologies and removes the market barriers to entrepreneurship, innovation, and enterprise. Here the focus should be on fast-tracking 5G, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and security technologies.</p><p>In summary rational privacy legislation could consist of (1) framework that protects Americans' Constitutional rights and freedoms for speech and commerce; (2) strengthened authority and budget for the FTC to develop risk-based privacy standards for the online economy (this would also include budget for more economists and technologists at the agency); (3) safe harbors that allow companies to migrate their operations to those standards, (4) investments and incentives for the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, and (5) consumer education and competency training. (62)</p><p>I am heartened by the bipartisanship in Congress today with the opportunity to make a meaningful framework that builds on proven American success and scientific evidence. I thank the committee for this opportunity to testify, its willingness to engage a range of participants, and its openness to new ideas and frameworks. I look forward to your questions.</p><p>(1) Winn, Jane, The Governance Turn in Information Privacy Law (July 11, 2019).

In 2016, the government also introduced the equalization levy. India could emerge as a trailblazer in defining norms to tax businesses that have large user bases without a significant physical presence in a country. There is also a distinct possibility of recognizing data as an asset class under the Indian Accounting Standards 38.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, Germany's Federal Cartel Office (FCO) has threatened curbs on how Facebook monetizes its data. In the coming months, the European Union (EU) will also implement the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which will introduce radical data-protection norms.</p><p>These developments strike at the core of how technology companies make money and reflect growing disenchantment with big tech.</p><p>In 2011, the World Economic Forum and Bain published a joint study identifying personal data as a \"new asset class\" leading to the \"data is oil\" narrative.</p><p>John Lanchester, writing for the London Review Of Books, said that \"if the product is free, you are the product\". For example, anyone using Facebook is working for it. In 2014, The New York Times found that users collectively spent 39,757 years on the site, every single day, at the time. This was \"almost fifteen million years of free labour per year\".</p><p>Moreover, Facebook maintains 98 data points on each user in addition to the information purchased from 5,000 data brokers. This is at the centre of Facebook's advertising strategy-allowing it to make $27 billion from advertising in 2016. YouTube, on the other hand, is the largest music library on the planet, playing billions of tracks annually. But in 2015, artists earned less from it than they earned from sales of vinyl.</p><p>Therefore, the countries in which these people are located are \"working for\" these tech entities. Technology companies, on the other hand, argue that they offer hugely valuable products not just cheap but free. But free is not free as users pay for these services, not in dollars but in data.</p><p>India can become a significant stakeholder in shaping the rules of this data world. It has become data rich before it has become economically rich. With over 450 million internet users, it ranks amongst the top 5 per capita data consumption economies and is now the top mobile data user in the world.</p><p>First, taxation is a battle frontier for the digital economy. Taxes were designed for the brick-and-mortar era and communication entailed paper and telephone calls. Tax authorities are asking for a revised system in which companies could be taxed in countries where they collect and monetize data. Large internet companies such as the FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) have paid insignificant taxation relative to revenue due to archaic tax laws. Raw material (data) is extracted without payment from a source country (say, India) and then processed offshore and sold back as finished products (targeted advertisements) back to the source country. This sounds strikingly similar to the operations of the erstwhile East India company. Such an \"unjustifiable fragmentation\" falls squarely within recently adopted general anti-avoidance rule tax legislation in India.</p><p>Moreover, data fracking from the internet can be likened to crushing sugarcane for sugar. Data miners invest in processing power to recover useful and monetizeable data. Policymakers need to estimate average recovery rates of useful data. Depending on the data use case, varied tax methodologies can be devised. There is also a need for international coordination amongst nations.</p><p>Second, the individual should be able to monetize her data. Opt-in provisions (as with the EU's GDPR) and greater transparency in algorithms would be a key first step in valuing data. Currently, the monetary value of data either gets left out completely from financial statements or gets expensed, thereby reducing taxable profits of tech giants. There are different experiments to reveal the price of personal data. Multinational telecommunications company Telefonica is experimenting with a platform, Aura, to allow the customer full control over data. Blockchain experiments such as Basic Attention and Brave tokens are also underway for the same purpose. Data should be established as a store of value and exchanged, gifted or inherited.</p><p>Once a counterculture darling, the internet is now seen with less utopian eyes. As technology companies morph into big tech and start resembling monopolies, scrutiny intensifies. Are companies being taxed adequately and are the users compensated fairly? Moreover, the sovereign right to collect taxes stands largely compromised.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica fiasco has shown us how tech giants have failed to discharge their information fiduciary. They are akin to the 19th-century railroad barons in the US who dominated society, avoided taxation and operated as monopolies. That wrong was righted by the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). There is a need for an Internet Commerce Commission-but until such a time, domestic regulators need to step up.</p><p>We live in a world where wealth resides in intellectual property. We need to reset the tax regime and also find creative solutions for individuals to control and extract value from their data. It is critical to prevent society from becoming a winner-takes-all for digital robber barons.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Only Cook attended in person.</p><p>He has repeatedly said privacy is a \"fundamental human right\" and vowed his company wouldn't sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do.</p><p>His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide.</p><p>The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts.</p><p>The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use.</p><p>GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

So the question is, why now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church, and this is the CNN Newsroom.</p><p>There are growing demands for answers and the expanding scandal involving Facebookand a data firm's reported misuse of Facebookuser's information. The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating Facebookfor possibly breaking its privacy promises to users.</p><p>U.S. and U.K lawmakers are calling on FacebookCEO, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to testify about the web site's relationship with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>The president of the European parliament have a hint of new regulations when he urge lawmakers to be strict with social media companies.

In another clip, Nix took credit for Mr. Trump's winning strategy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: have you met Mr. Trump?</p><p>ALEXANDER NIX, CEO, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: Many times.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have?</p><p>NIX: We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Channel 4's Washington correspondent Kylie Morris joins me now to talk more about this undercover investigation. Good to have you with us.</p><p>KYLIE MORRIS, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, CHANNEL 4: Thanks, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: Now we just heard part of your team's report highlighting Cambridge Analytica's close relationship with the Trump campaign. The company claimed it ran all of Mr. Trump's digital campaign and essentially put him in office. Just bragging or can they indeed take the credit for that.</p><p>MORRIS: Well, we have to allow for some exaggeration on their part. I think, you know, this was a sales pitch within a meeting where they were trying to entice clients, namely ourselves, to do business with them, and indeed, a lot of the -- a lot of the allegations against them they have denied by saying that actually, they were trying to tease out the bonafides of these clients, and that's why they were talking about, you know, all kinds of dirty tricks. That was about the clients and not about them.</p><p>But, in terms of, you know, those exaggerations, the reality is, that this company was the data analytics company for the Trump campaign. You know, they say within the kind of, the mother ship of the Trump digital team. They may perhaps be exaggerating what their overall effect will be.</p><p>And I think in the fall out from the story there's been a little bit of reorganization or the renewal in the assessment of the role that they played, suggesting that perhaps this psychographic stuff wasn't used in the end and it was not that important. But the point is that they were certainly there, and they did played a role within the campaign that led to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>winning the presidency.</p><p>CHURCH: Kylie, let's just listen to another part of your report, this one set in a restaurant with Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIX: I went to speak to them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>NIX: And the Republicans asked three questions. Five minutes, done. The Democrats asked two hours of questions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you have to answer everything?</p><p>NIX: No, it's voluntary, but I did because I'm trying to help them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>NIX: We have no secrets.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>NIX: They're politicians, they're not technical.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct.</p><p>NIX: They don't understand how it works. They don't understand because the candidate never, is never involved. He's told what to do by the campaign team.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So the candidate is the puppet?</p><p>NIX: Always.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right, right, right.</p><p>NIX: But in every election, or nearly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So for democrats this is like the sour grapes, they're saying?</p><p>NIX: Yes, sour grapes. That's exactly what it is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:05:04] CHURCH: And Kylie, as your team's report went to air, Cambridge Analytica announced that it had in fact suspended CEO Alexander Nix pending a full investigation, what does that tell you, and what would you expect the full ramifications to be of your undercover investigation?</p><p>MORRIS: Well, the company itself it's important to say is still denying many of the allegations within our reports, they are saying that this was a pitch meeting. They were, as I mentioned earlier, the defense is that they were simply, you know, teasing out and trying to work out the bonafides of the clients.</p><p>Having said that, though, you know, they are obviously taking very seriously the comments that Alex -- that Nix has made, because that's why they took this action to do suspend him, they say that he wasn't properly representing the company and they are very worried by it and they are going to invite independent investigators to deal with that.</p><p>Moving forward, I think into future elections now, there will be a great deal and more scrutiny of the kinds of beings and images and videos that come into your individual feeds, your computer, your timelines, you know, where are these messages coming from, who designed them and what are they trying to tell you and what are they trying to manipulate you to do with your vote.</p><p>And I think that's going forward, hopefully, the ramifications of this will be that people will begin to understand better, you know, the engineering behind that.</p><p>CHURCH: Yes. Indeed, and of course, on Tuesday, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman said this, and I am quoting here. \"Cambridge Analytica has never claimed it won the election for President Trump, this is patently absurd. We are proud of the work we did on that campaign and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign.\"</p><p>Kylie, what's your response to that?</p><p>MORRIS: Well, I think Alexander Nix today we door stepped him as he was going into his office before he was suspended, and he said that appearances can be deceptive. So I think that is their defense.</p><p>But what we're seeing on tape isn't really anything that we should put too much still by. But having said that, I think it's important to note that even though they say they were just kind of stringing us along in these meetings, seven weeks after our final meeting with Cambridge Analytica and the final meeting with Alexander Nix, we were still, our undercover team were still getting e-mails from the company saying, hey, what about this partnership, can we move forward? So that sends a strongly contradictory message.</p><p>CHURCH: And Cambridge Analytica's chief data officer was recorded separately claiming their firm is responsible for <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>triumph in the Electoral College. He said, and I'm quoting again here. \"When you think about the fact that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>lost the popular vote by three million votes but won the Electoral College, that's down to the data and the research. That's how he won the election.\"</p><p>So, of course, Kylie, the chief data officer claims Cambridge Analytica is responsible for <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>victory, but the company spokesman says it has never made such a claim.</p><p>Again, this could come down to an over -- overly enthusiastic boastful employee about what the company's capable of doing and that's the problem here, isn't it? Trying to make that differentiation and sort of say, well, there is a something to this? Or it's just bragging.</p><p>MORRIS: Exactly. I mean, I think we have to deal with the fact that you know, the Trump -- the Trump re-election campaign in 2020 has today announced that it will not be working with Cambridge Analytica in the upcoming elections.</p><p>There are investigates here by the State of New York, by the State of Massachusetts into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. And of course, Facebook's own action in suspending Alexander Nix suggests that there is more to learn here and certainly more to understand. CHURCH: And we will continue to keep a very close eye on this and all the developments that come as a result of this report. Kylie Morris, thank you so much. We appreciate it.</p><p>MORRIS: Rosemary, thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: And Cambridge Analytica announced an independent investigation and said, Nix's comments do not represent the company's values and that his suspension reflects how seriously the firm views the violation.</p><p>Well, the scandal is taking a huge financial toll on Facebookand it's dragging down other tech firms as well.</p><p>Andrew Stevens joins us now from Hong Kong with more on that. So, Andrew, what impact is this crisis having on the value of Facebook, and of course, on trust in the company?</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think the latter point there is more important to Facebookat this stage, Rosie. It's just about the trust in Facebookand how it is being eroded by what's been happening.</p><p>Financially though, we've seen the stock price fall more than 9 percent over the past two days. Fifty billion wiped off the value of that stock, including a few billion off of <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>holding as well. So, there is that.</p><p>[03:09:57] But the wider implication here, Rosemary, is that this is now a full blown crisis for Facebook. They are still not fronting <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to say what has happened and what they are going to do.</p><p>So, at the moment, they're sort of seen as leaderless at a time of deep, deep crisis. Remember, that this has got 2.2 billion users and trust in their ability to keep the people's details private is paramount to people using Facebook.</p><p>It is obviously a social media tool, but the last thing that most people want to see is their data used unknowingly, which is what has happened.</p><p>But if you look at what Facebookhas actually done, all they have done so far is issue a statement. And just let me read it to you. It does says that, \"Mark and Sheryl,\" that Sheryl Sandberg, the COO, \"and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue. The entire company is outraged, we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and we will take whatever steps are required to see that it happens.\"</p><p>OK, that sounds good. But, any P.R. person will tell you that when you have a crisis of this magnitude in a company which is so globally well-known, you have to put the person who is closest to that company, which in this case, obviously, it's <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>put him forward. Get him -- get the company on the front foot, get him explaining, getting, trying to win the people's trust back. Remember, people are always, were already a little bit skeptical about Facebookor perhaps more than a little bit when it was, it was seen that a lot of the information of fake news was spread via Facebookand fake advertising by Facebookin the 2016 elections.</p><p><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>initial response to those allegations was that's a crazy idea. So he has recanted those. But there is this trust issue at the center of Facebooknow, and the company isn't addressing it.</p><p>CHURCH: Now it is that people want to hear from <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg. </nameText></person>Andrew Stevens joining us there with that live report from Hong Kong, where it's just after three in the afternoon. We thank you so much.</p><p>Well, for the first time ever, Israel has admitted to bombing a Syrian nuclear facility in 2007, although the world quickly found out about an Israeli air strike in the Syrian desert, the nature of it remain secret. Both Israel and Syria stayed quite.</p><p>More than a decade later, tensions in the region are still high.</p><p>And CNN's Oren Liebermann joins us now live from Jerusalem. Oren, of course, why has Israel decided to release the footage at this time? That's a big question. Why are we learning more about this now?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It absolutely is, especially because everyone here and probably most people outside of Israel knew it. It was this country's air force that had carried out the strike, even though both Israel and Syria were markedly quiet in the days, weeks and months following that attack.</p><p>So, why now? Even if it is essentially fascinating footage to see from the cockpit when that strike was carried out, the timing of this is still very interesting in a different Middle East, Syria is now a fractured country. So we ask ourselves, who is the target audience of the release of the footage and the information, and that may very well be Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LIEBERMANN: In the crosshairs of an Israeli fighter jet, a secret Syrian nuclear reactor, mere months away from completion. In this never-before released footage, you see the reactor as it was in the early morning hours on September 6, 2007 as precision guided Israeli bombs bore down on their target. After the strike, Israel's nuclear war shifting from Syria to Iran.</p><p>AARON DAVID MILLER, VICE PRESIDENT FOR NEW INITIATIVES, WOODROW WILSON INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR SCHOLARS: I mean, Israelis, not only are trying to demonstrate deterrents but to make it unmistakably clear that they would strike again and make it unmistakably clear to Russia, to the Assad regime. And with respect to the Iranian nuclear program, should the Iranians accelerate enrichment and seek to break out that the Israelis are prepared to act against Iran as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) LIEBERMANN: Israel has never fully acknowledged the strike against Syria. The video held by military sensors who review the story and enforced strict rules on media before publication.</p><p>These pictures released by the U.S. in early 2008 they say were taken inside the facility, show the core of reactor under construction. The U.S. said the gas cooled, graphite moderated reactor was built with North Korean assistance, the only other country to have built such a plant in decades.</p><p>Syria has never acknowledged building a nuclear reactor at the site instead, insisting it was a missile facility.</p><p>BASHAR JAAFARI, SYRIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Syria builds many buildings all over the country, does that mean any building we build should be a project or a design to be a nuclear reactor building?</p><p>[03:14:58] LIEBERMANN: IAEA inspectors found traces of uranium at the site. The CIA said the reactor could not produce electricity and was not for peaceful purposes.</p><p>For years, Israel stayed quiet, believing silence could prevent escalation with Syria. Israel had been collecting top secret intelligence on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his nuclear ambitions. Their conclusion in 2007, Syria was less than a year away from an operational nuclear reactor. If completed, the facility would have made Syria the first Arab nuclear state.</p><p>A quarter century earlier, Israel fighter jets struck the Osirak nuclear facility in Iraq, crippling that country's nuclear program. It established Israel's policy that it would carry out preemptive strikes against weapons of mass destruction it considered a threat, like it did in Syria.</p><p>MILLER: Whether or not the United States is prepared to take the lead, Israel has agency and it's prepared in anticipation of any of their neighbors who presume to develop a nuclear program to weaponize that the Israelis are prepared to act well in advance of that weapon becoming operational.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LIEBERMANN: There may well be other reasons this video, this information was released, for example, the prime minister at the time has a book coming out where he talks about his reasoning behind the strike, as well as Israeli media have been working on the story for months, if not years, and all of that may have got into the Israeli military's calculation.</p><p>But the overriding reason here seems to be Iran, when you look at today's Middle East, especially the Israeli government, they've been waging an all-out lobbying campaign against Iran and the nuclear deal. Iran has entrenched itself in Syria, increased its influence its presence with the ongoing civil war.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel is trying to keep Iran as far away from the border as possible.</p><p>Rosemary, it seems that Israel-Iran relationship their battle for opinion that battle for policy here may very well be at the center of the information in the video we've just seen.</p><p>CHURCH: Interesting. Our Oren Liebermann with that live report from Jerusalem, where it is 9.16 in the morning. We thank you very much.</p><p>We'll take a short break here, but still to come, the latest on the bombings in central Texas, five explosions in 19 days. And the serial bomber is still on the loose.</p><p>Plus, the Kremlin has faced accusations for years about poisoning its opponents. Still to come, a look at some people who have been killed and a few who survived. We're back in just a moment.</p><p>CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, investigators may have some crucial new leads on the bombings that have terrorized Austin, Texas. Six packages, rigged with explosives are now connected to a serial bomber or bombers. And a source tells CNN the motive appears to be mayhem and death, rather than targeting one specific group.</p><p>Nick Watt reports from Austin.</p><p>[03:19:58] NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Austin is a city on edge, a false alarm of false bomb report called in from this Goodwill store it actually turned out to be a box of donations. In one of those boxes there was what they are calling an incendiary device, a military memento that did catch on fire and slightly injured an employee.</p><p>But on the scene there were cops, there were FBI, there was ATF, of course, the day began with an explosion at a FedEx facility down near San Antonio, about 60 miles away from here and that slightly injured one worker there.</p><p>And then six hours later, another device was discovered at another FedEx sorting office up here near the Austin airport. The FBI and the police are saying that those two devices are definitely linked to the spate of bombings that we have seen here in Austin since March 2nd.</p><p>And the FBI, we are told by local police department here, the FBI is looking into the probability that those two packages, those two FedEx packages were dropped off at the same office. That is a major lead right now.</p><p>Nick Watt, CNN, Austin, Texas.</p><p>CHURCH: Twenty three Russian diplomats are back in Moscow after the U.K. followed up on its threat to expel them over a chemical attack in England. The diplomats and their families flew out of London's Stansted Airport on Tuesday. Britain is blaming Russia for poisoning former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. But Moscow says it was not involved. CNN's Matthew Chance joins me now from Moscow with more. So, Matthew, in the midst of this nerve agent crisis, and of course, the tit for tat punishments going back and forth between Russia and Britain, Moscow continues to insist that it is not behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, but of course, history seems to tell a different story.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: I mean, that's absolutely right, Rosemary. I mean, with all eyes now focus on the Skripal's nerve agent attack in Salisbury in England, and the Kremlin has, for instance, dismissed that's unthinkable any allegations that have been made, for instance, by the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson that Russia has this covert chemical weapons program aimed at assassinating its political opponents.</p><p>But in fact, you know, the past several years, recent years, past decade or more in fact, has been littered with examples of people who were seen as opponents by the Kremlin, who have met untimely deaths through the use of exotic toxins.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHANCE: He was one of the Kremlin's most ruthless enemies, an Arab Jihadist called Khattab, notorious for executing Russian troops during the brutal Chechen War. When Russia security services finally announced his assassination in a special operation in March, 2002, they released this video to prove it showing Khattab laid out dead, with no visible wounds.</p><p>Russian state media and the rebels both said, he died ever after opening a poisoned letter. It was it seems quite literally a message from the Kremlin. And there have been alleged messages from Moscow too.</p><p>In 2004, the pro-western Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko who went on to lead the country was badly disfigured after severe dioxin poisoning. He told me back then his push for Ukraine to join the European Union and NATO had made him enemies at home and in Moscow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO, FORMER PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): We started dinner at about 10 o'clock and finished around 3.30 in the morning. While driving back home, the first thing I felt was a terrible headache. I had never felt anything like it before. When I got home my wife kissed my lips, she said she could taste something metallic, I asked her for some medication but the pain was aggravated. Only then I said to myself, Viktor, you're in trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHANCE: For others that trouble proved deadly. The radioactive killing of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 foreshadowed the recent Skripal nerve agent attack. Both were former members of the Russian secret services were poisoned with chemicals said by Britain to be Russian and seen as traitors by the Kremlin.</p><p>There has been, in other words, a growing list of people. This Kremlin sees its opponents and long before the poisoning of Skripals in Britain who have met painful and untimely deaths. Not all of course were poisoned, one of Russia's main opposition figures, Boris Nemtsov there was shot dead in 2015 right here on this bridge.</p><p>Of course, the Kremlin denies any involvement and rejects the allegation it could have ordered the Skripal nerve agent attack as unthinkable.</p><p>[03:25:02] And as this poisoned father and daughter, Sergei and Yulia Skripal fight for their lives in intensive care, the Kremlin insists Britain should apologize for the series of allegations it has made or present proof of Russia's hand.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHANCE: Well, Rosemary, the Russian foreign ministry has now summoned all the foreign ambassadors in Russia to a meeting later on today to clarify, in their words, the situation regarding the allegations coming from Britain about Russian use of nerve gas in Salisbury. So far, as I mentioned, the Russians have categorically denied any involvement and there's very little sign that that position is likely to change.</p><p>CHURCH: They are digging their heels in. Matthew Chance with that live report from Moscow, where it is nearly 10.30 in the morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>Let's take another short break here, but still to come, a top executive is out for Cambridge Analytica's problem are far from over. An update on the growing scandal over the firm's use of Facebookdata.</p><p>Plus, President Trump calls Russia's <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>to say congratulations. Why that led to backlash even from some of the top republicans in Washington. We're back with that and more in just a moment.</p><p>CHURCH: And a warm welcome back, everyone. I'm Rosemary Church, I want to update you on the main stories we have been following this hour.</p><p>At least 35 people have been killed, scores wounded after a rocket attack on a busy market in the Syrian capital. State-run media say the rocket landed in a government controlled neighborhood in Damascus. The attack in the capital comes as government forces continue to pound rebel-held Eastern Ghouta.</p><p>Critics are blasting <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for congratulating <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>on his re-election. Republican Senator John McCain called the Russian president a dictator who won a sham election. President Trump says he plans to meet with Mr. Putin in the not too distant future. Cambridge Analytica suspended its CEO following undercover reports showing him discussing political methods including potential bribery and entrapment. Alexander Nix is shown claiming he met with then- candidate <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>many times, and that the data firm's research steered the campaign strategy.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica calls the reports gross misrepresentations.</p><p>Well, U.S. and U.K. lawmakers are pressing for more answers on all of this.</p><p>Isa Soares joins us now from London with the latest.</p><p>[03:30:01] So, Isa, what are U.K. lawmakers planning to do about the scandal that's exposed both the firm Cambridge Analytica, and of course, Facebook?</p><p>SOARES: And like you quote quite rightly said Rosie, fresh on both sides of the Atlanta, you got lawmakers, you got regulatory bodies, you got Face -- ordinary Facebookusers right around the world who want answers from Facebook, as well as Cambridge Analytica, as well as Professor Kogan, if you remember Cambridge University, who created that App.</p><p>On how exactly was the data passed on to Cambridge Analytica and was it consent given and crucially what did they do with that data once they had it. So many questions being asked now, you've got the European Parliament, European President Tajani, spoke early this week, basically saying he wants answers. This is what he said. \"Allegations of misuse of Facebookuser data is unacceptable violation of (inaudible) privacy right.\"</p><p>The European Parliament he says, will investigate fully, pulling digital platforms to account. But you also have Britain's data protection authority. They are the ones that, the last two days, Rosie, have been trying to get a warrant basically to walk in to the offices of Cambridge Analytica and get all that data to try to attain exactly what they are doing with that data, whether that data is still there or whether that it has been deleted is another question entirely.</p><p>But Cambridge Analytica said yesterday, they were willing to cooperate and provide all the relevant data. Then on top of that, you have the Irish regulator, that is the body that oversees Facebookwithin the European Union, also wanting questions and then, in addition to that, you have the Chair of the Digital Coach of Median Sports Committee, Damian Collins, who has hosted a whole range of committees in terms of fake news and one he wrote a letter yesterday to <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who has been missing in action for the last few days on this, and he has asked him to come to the U.K. and to testify and in addition, he wants, Alexander Nix, the CEO -- the former CEO, I should say of Cambridge Analytica to also testify and he wants them to testify again.</p><p>The reason I say against, because only last month he testified, Rosie and he basically said, we have never used Facebookdata and we don't use Facebookdata. So, he thinks, Damian Collins thinks that he is being misled entirely by Alexander Nix. Take a listen to what Damian Collins told CNN just yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE PARTY: They need to explain how they keep user data safe. Why they didn't investigate more rigorously the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, why they did not act quicker to make sure that data has been destroyed and also what can they do ensure that user data that is gathered from Facebook. Picture that people's interaction with apps and games, and surveys created by other people. What can they do to make sure that data is safe too? And because of those -- it's not at all clear how that works at the moment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: He went on to say that data mishandling, Rosie, is nonnegotiable and he wants to tighten, clamp down on U.K. laws on a kind of big tech companies and ask for more regulation and more power for the U.K. authorities here to have over these tech companies here in the U.K., Rosie.</p><p>CHURCH: So, Isa, where does this leave Cambridge Analytica, can the company actually survive this scandal, do you think?</p><p>SOARES: Well, it's interesting when we heard yesterday that Alexander Nix was stepping down, because earlier in a day, he had floated the idea of stepping down in order to keep the company alive, to keep the jobs going for the -- all those young people working there.</p><p>Now, of course, the revelations we've seen in the expose in the last three days, do raise many eyebrows, in terms of the dirty tricks they played, right around the world, and it' worth pointing out that it's not just, they didn't just work on the U.S. election, which they boast about it, and the last two expose, Rosie, but they also worked on several elections right around the world, including the Kenya election, 2013 and 2017 and the Kenyan opposition is looking in to exactly what their role was there.</p><p>So, you have got those questions of what they did, in terms with the data. That could be -- you could be looking at a really implications in terms of in the U.K. and the U.S., criminal investigation in the U.S. and possibly one here in the U.K. was.</p><p>Did they break any laws? Facebookto be facing that in terms of did they past data's of third party, but crucially also, Rosie, let's think about this, it's the ethics behind the company that they might survive maybe a criminal investigation, perhaps, but in terms of, you know, long-term, can this company survive as it is right now in what it does? And the ethics of what we have seen in the exposes from channel 4 really raise huge questions about whether it can function.</p><p>CHURCH: Yes. Interesting point, Isa Soares, with that live report from London, were it's just after 7:30 in the morning. Thank you so much. [03:35:00] Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is under fire, for congratulating <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>on his re-election, despite warnings from his staff not to do that. But Washington Post reports a National Security Advisers wrote, do not congratulate in all capital letters on the president's briefing materials before that phone call and yet, he did it anyway. We get more now from CNN's Pamela Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much, everybody.</p><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNN NEWSROOM SHOW HOST: President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>announcing today that he called Russian President <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>to congratulate him on his recent re-election.</p><p>TRUMP: I had a call with President Putin. And congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory. The call had to do also with the fact that we will probably get together in the not too distance future. So, that we can discuss arms, we can discuss the arms race.</p><p>BROWN: After a scathing statement from Senator John McCain, critic of the President and calling Putin a dictator who won a sham election. The White House would not say whether it believes Russia's election was free and fair.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We don't get to dictate how other countries operate. What we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country and that's not something we can dictate to them how they operate. We disagree with the fact that we should not have conversations with Russia.</p><p>BROWN: The President maintains he has been tougher on Russia than his predecessor. But today the White House said the president didn't bring up the recent poisoning of a Russian in the U.K. during his conversation with Putin or Russia's election meddling ahead of the 2018 election. This has sent in an Intelligence Committee reiterated some of its key findings that Russia meddled in 2016.</p><p>RICHARD BURR, U.S. SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Let me say this with a great deal of confidence. It is clear the Russian government was looking for the vulnerabilities in our election system, highlighted -- and highlighted some of the key gaps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Director, if you would please rise.</p><p>BROWN: Meanwhile the White House is insisting that there are no plans to fire the man conducting the independent Russian investigation.</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: The White House had been confirms that the president is not considering or discussing the firing of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why doesn't he push for the firing of Robert Mueller if he thinks the probe should not have been going on in the first place? If he thinks the whole thing is a witch hunt, why does he need to fire him?</p><p>HUCKABEE SANDERS: Look, we will continue to be cooperative and we would like to wrap it up soon. We don't feel like that's the most productive step forward, but we would like to see this come to a conclusion.</p><p>BROWN: Democrats are not buying what the president's surrogates have to say, pointing to what the President himself has been saying on Twitter. That the probe should never have been started and suggest the Mueller's investigative team is politically bias.</p><p>JACKIE SPEIER, U.S. HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I trust the tweets of the president puts out when he's unsupervised and I think what we have seen over and over again is his intention to obstruct justice.</p><p>BROWN: And some Republicans believe a Mueller firing could spell the end for the Trump administration.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the President fired Robert Mueller, do you think that would be an impeachable offense?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Probably so, if he did it without cause, yes. I can't think of a more upsetting moment in the rule of law to have an investigator looking at a president's campaign as to whether or not they colluded with a foreign government. What kind of crimes may have been committed? I've seen no evidence of collusion, but to start an investigation without cause, I think, would be a Constitutional crisis.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much.</p><p>BROWN: But even if President Trump himself categorically denies any intention of firing Mueller, his credibility on such issues is highly suspect. Just last week Trump flatly denied in New York Times report saying he was unhappy with his legal team and intended to add another attorney.</p><p>But then they did exactly that on Monday adding Joe diGenova, for months has filed a conspiracy theory about the FBI and Russia's election meddling.</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, ATTORNEY: Make no mistake about it, a group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>of a falsely created crime.</p><p>BROWN: Well the president lawyers also reached out to former solicitor General Ted Olson to join the legal team, also declined that request, he also declined the request earlier last year when he was asked to join the team and despite the fact that the president's lawyers have been saying for months that the Russian probe is going to wrap up soon, it appears they are preparing for something different. Pamela Brown, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>CHURCH: Well, the president's lawyers are also busy on other fronts, they are facing legal action from a porn star, a Playboy playmate and a reality show contestant. On Tuesday the attorney for adult film actress Stormy Daniels released the results of the polygraph over lie detector that she took back in 2011.</p><p>According to the report she told the truth about having unprotected sex with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in 2006. Now, remember she was paid $130,000 just days before the election to sign a nondisclosure agreement to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump.</p><p>[03:40:11] She now wants to speak out about it, also on Tuesday former Playboy playmate, Karen McDougal filed a lawsuit to get out of the deal requiring her to keep quiet about her owned alleged 10 month affair with Mr. Trump back in 2006.</p><p>The suit is against American Media, the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid and they paid her $150,000 for her story, but never published it and the owner of American Media is David Pecker, who just happens to be a long time close friend of President Trump.</p><p>Then there's Summer Zervos, she appeared on Mr. Trump's reality show \"The Apprentice,\" and has accused the president of sexual assaults and is now suing him for defamation.

And we need more than prayers. I want to thank these first responders and law enforcement officers for the job they did, but we need more - we've gotta take action.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: And it's worth noting the attack in Maryland was the 17th -- that's 1-7 school shooting in the U.S. since the beginning of the year. They are happening with increasing frequency, averaging 1 1/2 incidents a week -- just some background on how CNN tallied that list. This map refers to shootings with someone was hurt or killed. Includes grades from kindergarten to college.</p><p>All right, it is spring in the United States, apparently, but winter is refusing to leave is the fourth major snowstorm in three weeks hits. Forecasters expect more snow than the three earlier Nor'easters combined, more than 70 million people from Virginia to Boston are under a storm warning or advisory, and more than 3000 flights Wednesday have already been canceled.</p><p>Now this comes after storm battered Alabama with powerful winds and baseball-sized hail. Let's turn to our meteorologist, Padram Javaheri to get some answers on why this is all happening. So Padram, why the reluctance for winter to move out and let spring move in?</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: I love the way you said it -- apparently spring right? It certainly doesn't feel like it across parts of the U.S. and you know Rosemary, this particular one, as you said really have the potential to be the most significant most disruptive and really, because of the time of year it is as you worked way into a lot of portion of March , of course, the atmosphere becomes a little bit warmer, so although it's cold enough to snow, it's fairly cold enough, so the snowflakes are going to be large, they are going to be wet, and they are going to cause a lot of disruptions, in fact, as you said over 70 million people from the Ohio Valley, towards New England and of course the major metro cities of the Northeast. Yet, again, in line for an absolute wintry nest across this region.</p><p>Look at the tremendous amount of snowfall already in place for the secondary feature closer to the coastal communities there in that particular one in addition to what's already in store, in addition to moisture from the Atlantic, getting towards this region really set the stage here for temps to be right around the freezing mark.</p><p>So, we think as the snow fall begins to comedown lightly at this hour, so really begin filling in here over the next several hours and could bring in the nation's capital through a tremendous amount of snow, as far as how much it could accumulate through Wednesday evening, but how about this, you look at the volume of flights impacted and Rosemary, just 3000 flights are impacted by this, but about 65 percent of flights out of LaGuardia impacted about 64 percent out of Newark and JFK, half of their flights have already been disrupted even afterwards Philly and Boston seen 30 plus percent of the flight impacted by all of this and the amount of snowfall 30, 40?</p><p>How about some areas of 60 cm of snowfall here in the second for their, first day of spring the -- first partial day of spring being Tuesday now, first full day on Wednesday, but 15 to 20 cm in Washington. That would be the highest amount for the city in the spring season. Same stories are fairly similar set up for New York City, upwards of 40 cm in the forecast across that region, you go in towards the Western U.S., Rosemary.</p><p>Another weather pattern that is just as impressive, this is a classic atmospheric River pattern or what is called a Pineapple Express, because of that line I drew, originates from this, the Hawaiian Islands, the moisture source coming in from that region directed towards Southern California, parts of Southern California could see a tremendous amount of rainfall really for anyone's standards, but you put this over that region of Santa Barbara County, you know what happened here recently, 150 plus millimeters of rainfall, noticed the burn scar indicated in the white outline here, the rainfall, the heaviest could be over that burn scar. This could be catastrophic of parts of California, Rosemary. So we are going to watch that, as well along the Southwestern United States.</p><p>CHURCH: And we appreciate you doing that as well, Pedram, thanks so much, a lot to cover there.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>CHURCH: And just as quick programming note for all of you, CNN takes you to Antarctica, to see one of the key areas in the battle against climate change.</p><p>Arwa Damon spent three weeks on the Greenpeace shipped the Arctic sunrise, to stopping the waters and the wildlife there.

So, that came.</p><p>SEVENZO: It was almost impossible to imagine, Sudan was born in the wild in 1973, hundreds of its kind roam the grasslands of the East Central Africa. Now, these two females, Najin and Fatu, Sudan's daughter and granddaughter are the only remaining Northern White Rhino's in the world. How did we get to this?</p><p>For decades now, all species of rhino have been pushed from their home. The valley does medicine in the Far East, demand for rhino horn and the profit from his sell, remain that rhino was always under threat. The Northern White's population became extinct in the wild in 2008, unlike another subspecies, the Southern White, whose numbers had rebounded. Wildlife vet, Dr. Steve Ngulu, put Sudan down.</p><p>STEVEN NGULU, SUDAN'S DOCTOR: Euthanasia was the best option at that moment, because then he was in a lot of pain. We had gotten to this stage, because of various catastrophes that have been created by mankind. When you look at (inaudible), when you look at illegal deforestation, and you look at Bush Habitat Clearing, all these things have led to where we are. We can't make another Sudan, but we believe and we are hopeful that we can propagate this species.</p><p>SEVENZO: Sudan's spent much of his life in a Czech Zoo, a move that almost certainly saved his life as posting an African wars took their toll on the remaining numbers. Czech Conservation is (inaudible) flew in on the eve of Sudan's death. He had known the Northern White Rhino for over a decade.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, this is exciting prospect that even in death, Sudan can still (inaudible) children. There are some unbelievable that Sudan still could have an offspring and the way is that actually, because there are White out on the wild, we have to help them, or assist them with an artificial techniques of reproduction.</p><p>One way is, that we would be able to harvest eggs from the females that we see behind me, its eggs will be fertilized in a laboratory and the embryo that would be produce through this procedure, will be put into a surrogate mother of the Southern White Rhino origin, then the baby that would be born will be Northern White Rhino.</p><p>SEVENZO: The challenge now for conservationist and scientist is to see how they can keep Sudan's lineage alive on this planet, here is Naji, one of Sudan's daughters, beyond their is Fatu, his granddaughter, this are the two only remaining Northern White Rhino alive.</p><p>Cutting edge technology and advance in the state of biology, scientist are now working hand-in-hand with conservationist to keep critically endangered species from dying out completely. After 50 million years on earth, it took mankind a couple centuries to wipe out an entire subspecies of rhino, even if the scientist manage to recreate Sudan's kind. Will mankind start killing them?</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>CHURCH: And Farai Sevenzo joins me now live from Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, Farai, while science comes to the rescue, in terms of trying to keep the Northern White Rhino species from disappearing, what is the Kenyan government doing, to try to stop other species from being hunted to near extinction?</p><p>SEVENZO: Well, you know, rosemary, this has been a fight throughout all of Africa's wild life services. The Kenya Wildlife Services (inaudible) with the corporation of people like El -- Ol Pejeta Conservancy here and indeed we are surrounded in a moment by zoologist and conservationist from the Czech Republic, well once look after Sudan, when he was in the zoo and ironically, it was that zoo that save his life.</p><p>[03:55:08] When you ask, what is the Kenyan Government doing? This is a problem that we had for so long, since there are rhino horn became so popular in the Far East for its legend, for this medicinal purposes now it figures, speak for themselves. This 1960, Rosemary, to 1990, in that 30 years, worldwide rhino population shrunk by an incredible 96.7 percent, that just tells you that these two last females of the Northern White Rhino, they did not have much of a chance in a world where so many of their number was being killed.</p><p>At the moment, of course, the emphasis is on education, to tell people that you cannot get anything out of a rhino horn, they just as hard as our nails, and it's incredible that they had become so profitable and then of course, in order to stop it, we have the government, the government have to try and take the game to the poaches and of course was such great amount of money, Rosemary, this poaches are used by GPS technology, that was advance weaponry and they think nothing of shooting of an entire hood, just to get to those horns.</p><p>It is going to be an uphill struggle, but of course the fight starts right here. Trying to keep this magnificent beast on the planet. So your grandchildren and mine can actually see them in the places they were meant to be.</p><p>CHURCH: Exactly right. It is heartbreaking and we hope to see some progress made. Farai Sevenzo, thank you so much for that live report.</p><p>And before we go, take a look at this, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ignoring leash and walking his robotic dog named Spot Mini, it's the creation of the robotics firm Boston Dynamics, Spot Mini is about the size of a Springer Spaniel, it's the same mechanical canine whistle earlier this year, opening a door on its own and we don't know yet if Bezos could teach it any new tricks, but we do know he doesn't need any doggie poopy bags, that's progress, right?</p><p>Thanks to your company this hour, I'm Rosemary Church. Remember to connect with me any time on Twitter, the news continues now with Max Foster in London. You're watching CNN, have yourself a great day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018032120CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXV-MGT1-JB20-G1X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

TRUST IN TECH IS SHOT</nitf:hl1><nitf:hl2>Technology ; 27 By Omar Oakes</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The only question that really matters for the ad tech and digital media industries in 2020 is: \"How can we regain trust?\" After so many years of brand-safety scandals, data-protection breaches and disingenuous behaviour from tech company titans, the time for real reform is long overdue to ensure that marketers can trust and measure digital ad buying, while consumers can be assured their data won't be exploited to destroy their privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of the major tech stories in marketing last year involved mistrust in some way: the rise of deepfake videos; the scourge of news stories being unnecessarily keyword-blacklisted from advertising; an investigation into programmatic advertising data \u00bb breaches; fake political ads and \"micro-targeting\"; and problems with measuring the effectiveness of influencer marketing.</p><p>If 2019 was the year of chickens coming home to roost, we can expect some large eggs to hatch very soon on both sides of the Atlantic. It will begin this month with the Information Commissioner's update on how the ad tech industry has begun cleaning up its act over large-scale data breaches in real-time bidding auctions. The Internet Advertising Bureau and Google, the major arbiters of real-time bidding standards, will be under pressure to be stricter to avoid a cascade of GDPR fines being meted out by the UK's data watchdog. This coincides with the California Consumer Privacy Act coming into force in the US. While not as strict as GDPR in Europe, the CCPA will mark a step-change in consumers' rights over how their data is processed.</p><p>However, the most important regulatory signal may come in November, when the US holds its presidential election. Unless Donald Trump survives impeachment and pulls offan electoral shock, a Democrat will become president, with Elizabeth Warren, who has pledged to break up the big tech companies, among the front-runners.</p><p>The so-called \"streaming wars\" should intensify in 2020 as Netflix, Amazon, Disney, Apple and the BBC/ITV are joined by a growing line of broadcasters rushing to launch video-on-demand services. There is a particular opportunity for Amazon and Apple to make the most aggressive moves in this space by bundling up subscription entertainment packages with purchases of the latest iPhone, for example.</p><p>Speaking of Apple, the biggest iPhone launch in recent years is widely expected to happen in September. The device, presumably to be called the iPhone 12 Pro, will provide access to 5G for the first time. The limited launch of super-fast 5G internet in 2019 has received lukewarm enthusiasm from consumers, but Apple's marketing genius could supercharge demand.</p><p>Closer to home, we can expect deepfakes to emerge as a more immediate concern for marketers and media owners, because they will become even easier to produce. In April last year, a David Beckham \"deepfake for good\" video captured attention after R/GA London employed a \"video synthesis\" specialist to make the footballing icon appear to be a polymath. By September, a Chinese app called Zao was enabling smartphone users to \"star\" in their favourite movies just by uploading a picture. So this could well be the year in which ordinary people are given more access to \"off-the-shelf\" deepfake creation tools, which could wreak havoc with trust in digital media and have damaging consequences for brands, advocacy groups and politicians.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are likely to see AI begin to play a major role in disrupting the way that agencies and brands do business. Publicis Groupe captured attention last year by launching an AI-powered tool, Marcel, at scale across its business. Now, more big agencies are set to ditch Excel spreadsheets in favour of AI-powered solutions for planning ad campaigns across markets and channels.</p><p>For brands, there will be the arrival of more robotic process automation for repetitive tasks, such as retailers forecasting demand, or sales, and planning logistics.</p><p>We should also see AI deployed to a greater extent in natural language processing, which is already being used by Reach to tackle unnecessary keyword blacklisting. There are also opportunities to roll it out more widely in copywriting for digital creative, as brands take advantage of programmatic tools to tailor messages based on time of day, weather and location.</p><p>Improvements in AI should also result in more intelligent chatbots coming to the fore as customer service and marketing tools. This is likely to happen first in finance, a sector that has been radically disrupted by tech in recent years, where brands will aim to offer new services such as robo-advisers and \"copbots\" to police online fraud.</p><p>Lastly, after so many stories in 2019 about dodgy behaviour surrounding influencer marketing, it is this market that, arguably, is in greatest need of building trust among advertisers and consumers. More ad agencies being directly involved in influencer-led campaigns should bring greater professionalism to the space, while the growing popularity of \"micro-influencers\", with smaller but committed followings, should wean advertisers offan obsession with viral posts and vanity metrics (likes and video views).</p><p>28 SO IMPROVE PRIVACY PROTECTION WHILE EMBRACING AUTOMATION EFFICIENCIES MattBush Director of agencies, Google UK This coming year in tech will be defined by the industry working together to ensure it is properly adapting to the changing face of the online world. This is crucial for tech platforms, advertisers, publishers and agencies. Key in this adaption will be prioritising transparency and privacy. Europe is leading the way in developing the new rules of the road with initiatives like the ePrivacy Regulations and GDPR, which offer important protections for users. Web browsers are also making important changes to limit the use of third-party cookies for personalisation.</p><p>The key message for 2020 is that privacy and personalisation are not at odds with each other. Billions of users trust Google every day with data about their activity. We use that to enhance the user experience, and give users control and transparency over how and whether it is used for ad personalisation. So the central question for the year ahead is: what is the least amount of data those across our industry can use to deliver excellent ad experiences? Machine-learning technology is playing a fundamental role in helping bridge this gap. Increasingly, it can help take the guesswork out of personalising, bidding and ad creation, while also minimising human access to data, thereby adding another layer of privacy protection. Advertisers must ensure they are embracing automation and driving increased efficiency in their tech solutions in order to keep up with this fast-changing ecosystem.</p><p>We also have a responsibility to make sure the web works for creators as much as users. Quality journalism is crucial for a healthy web and in wider society - and for publishers, the focus must be on commitment to transparency around monetisation. If this focus can be coupled with advertisers doubling down on privacy, there is hope that, through technology, our industry can rebuild trust in advertising and the online ecosystem.</p><p>Lastly, agencies must invest in innovation and technological advances, as independent specialists and consultants bite at their heels. They must learn to understand the changing creative landscape and what it means for digital media, and use innovative and experimental technologies to deliver the best results.</p><p>As we move through the year, tech businesses have a responsibility to restore trust in the advertising and broader digital ecosystems.</p><p>As an industry, we can create a future that works for everyone in a privacy-first world.</p><p>29 BREAK DOWN THE SILOS Dani Bassil Chief executive, Digitas UK he 2020s have arrived, thankfully, meaning we can draw a line under a dreadful decade of societal, political and commercial division.</p><p>TPolitically, we are divided. Isolationism has dominated political doctrine. Borders have closed in. People are lonelier than ever as they struggle with social-media addiction. And, from a business point of view, disconnection is harming our clients' business.</p><p>The main reason for all the division and disconnection? Silos that separate people. Everywhere.</p><p>Silos are a doubled-edged sword. They have made agencies specialised and expert but they have also made our value narrow and downstream. Procurement departments devalue what we do. Consultants have encroached as a result. Fundamentally, silos prevent people from coming together and understanding different points of view. Without careful management, they breed tribalism and narrow perspectives.</p><p>In our sector that means: \u2022 Performance and brand marketing activities are disconnected, leading to the issue of short-termism, risking long-term growth.</p><p>\u2022 Channels are siloed according to the structure of the organisation, resulting in disconnected customer experiences.</p><p>\u2022 An empathy gap, as Andrew Tenzer's excellent research has proved, with the danger being that we deliver work that doesn't appeal to its target audience.</p><p>To deliver a step-change in customer experiences and marketing activity we need to help our clients manage their own silos. But we also need to break down silos within agencies. We need to bring together media, creativity, data and technology. We need to become more empathetic and understand our target audiences better. We need to use data science to understand emotion and deliver empathy in our strategies. We need to embrace diversity, break down the silos between, and bring people of all types together to ensure all points of view are considered.</p><p>Lastly, we need to come together as a sector to help crack the biggest challenge of all: the climate emergency. Earlier in 2019, Digitas UK employees embraced flexible working and joined the march for climate awareness.</p><p>As agency partners we have a responsibility to our clients to deliver and challenge them on this issue, no matter the brief. To break down the silos, I believe we need to think and act differently. That's where the opportunity - and the value - lies.</p><p>30 AND USE TECH TO SUPERCHARGE YOUR CREATIVITY Lachlan Williams Group strategy director, R/GA The technology headlines are always the same - faster networks, better distribution of computing power, more connected automated things, big leaps in AI and many more equally exciting and nerdgasminducing advances. But through all the noise around such \"progress\", it's important to consider: progress for whom? For the people who design it, for companies looking to exploit people's data for commercial gain, or better for us all? If we want to get the most from technology, 2020 needs to be the year we put people back at the centre of it. Let's get back to using tech to solve people's problems, by bringing more types of people into the conversation and showing how it and human creativity can be a force for change. So while it's tempting to geek out on the latest tech muscle flex, let's make our New Year's resolution to stick to a people-first approach. Our industry can play a key role by taking responsibility for finding common ground between business ambition and people's needs.</p><p>In order to design technology that meets people's needs, we need to hire, well, people. And by that I mean, more than one type of person. The tech community is still predominantly male and white. The time for window-dressing is over, real change needs to happen now, so that the technology we're creating reflects the world we live in, not a very small privileged part of it.</p><p>\"What can I do?\" I hear you cry. Make space for different types of people and give them training, support and real opportunities to contribute. Encourage new narratives instead of reducing people to a diversity narrative. Acknowledge and confront your own biases (trust me, you have them). And listen, a lot.</p><p>In the wake of the 2018 techlash and documentaries like The Great Hack, we're in desperate need of a more empathetic approach. Dedicate yourself and your teams to creating tech that serves a real human purpose rather than creating tech because we can.</p><p>Like innovation, tech isn't something that should be the domain of a select group of people in your organisation. It should be everyone's responsibility. Employers need to ensure the culture around technology supports people, instead of demanding things from them. Think of it as a tool to augment our abilities. As something that gives our creativity superpowers.</p><p>So, no matter what lands in 2020, remember Amara's law: we always overestimate the short-term impact of technology and underestimate the long-term impact.</p><p>Let's make sure that humanity guides our long-term journey.</p><p>Quality journalism is crucial for a healthy web and in wider society - and for publishers, the focus must be on commitment to transparency around monetisation\" \"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAMPGN-156313419</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAMPGN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXJ-P9M1-JCBW-N539-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">235891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Haymarket Publishing Services Ltd.

Check out the full 'Sustainable Societies' program here.</p><p><br/>Digital technologies are often put forward as a solution to environmental dilemmas. The spread of the internet came with claims of a huge reduction in printing, and by replacing paper with bytes, we thought we'd reduce our negative environmental impact<br/>\u00a0But this early promise of solving environmental problems may not be delivering because digital devices, like most technologies, also have environmental impacts. Devices are powered by electricity - often produced in coal-fired plants - and are manufactured from materials such as metals, glass and plastics. These materials also have to be mined, made or recycled.<br/>So, while digital technologies can facilitate environmental benefits, we shouldn't assume they always do. My research published this year shows much more needs to be done to debunk such myths.<br/>Measuring digital eco-footprintsIt's difficult to measure the environmental impacts of our digital lives, partly because the digital ecosystems that facilitate the internet are complex.\u00a0The United Nations Environment Assembly defines a digital ecosystem as \"a complex distributed network or interconnected socio-technological system\".<br/>Simply, digital ecosystems are the result of humans, digital infrastructure and devices interacting with one another. They rely on energy consumption at multiple scales. The term \"digital ecosystem\" relates to ecological thinking, specifically in terms of how human-technological systems work.<br/>However, there's nothing inherently environmentally sustainable about digital ecosystems. It's worthwhile considering digital ecosystems' environmental impacts as they grow.<br/>In 2017, it was reported in Nature that internet traffic (to and from data centers) was increasing at an exponential rate. At that stage, it had reached 1.1 zettabytes (a zettabyte equals one trillion gigabytes). As our digital use continues, so do our carbon emissions.<br/>Dangers of data centersData centers majorly contribute to the carbon emissions of digital ecosystems. They are basically factories that store, backup and recover our data. In April last year, it was estimated data centers around the world used more than 2% of the world's electricity, and generated the same amount of carbon emissions as the global airline industry (in terms of fuel use).<br/>While there is debate about the impact of flying on climate change, we're less likely to evaluate our digital lives the same way. According to British Open University Professor John Naughton, data centers make up about 50% of all energy consumed by digital ecosystems. Personal devices use another 34%, and the industries responsible for manufacturing them use 16%.<br/>Tech giants such as Apple and Google have committed to 100% renewable targets, but they're just one part of our giant digital ecosystem. Also, on many occasions, they rely on carbon offsets to achieve this. Offsets involve people and organizations investing in environmental projects to balance their carbon emissions from other activities. For instance, people can buy carbon offsets when booking flights.<br/>Offsets have been critiqued for not effectively reducing the carbon footprints of wealthy people, while absolving guilt from continued consumption.<br/>A carbon-filled road aheadWith more digital technologies emerging, the environmental impacts of digital ecosystems are probably going to increase. Apart from the obvious social and economic impacts, artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental implications should be seriously considered.<br/>A paper published in June by University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers revealed training a large AI machine could produce five times as much carbon as what one car (including fuel) emits over a person's lifetime, on average. Also, this figure only relates to training a large AI machine. There are various other ways these machines suck energy.<br/>Similarly, bitcoin mining (an application of blockchain) continues to consume large amounts of energy, and is increasing on a global scale. According to the International Energy Agency, bitcoin mining uses more energy than some countries, including Austria and Colombia.<br/>Putting the 'eco' back in digital ecosystemThe digital ecosystem that supports our devices includes storage systems and networks that aren't in our homes or workplaces, such as \"the cloud\". But we should still take responsibility for the impact of such systems. Satellites are in space. Wires run beneath footpaths, roads and oceans.<br/>All the while, the Internet of Things is creeping into old technologies and transforming how we use them. These underground and distant aspects of digital ecosystems may partly explain why the growing environmental impacts of digital are sidelined.<br/>There are some ways people can find out more about responsible tech options. A 2017 guide by Greenpeace rated digital tech companies on their green credentials. It assessed a range of corporations, including some managing digital platforms, and others hosting data centers.<br/>But while the guide is useful, it's also limited by a lack of transparency, because corporations aren't obliged to share information on how much energy is needed or supplied for their data centers.<br/>Holding big tech accountableThe responsibility to make our digital lives more sustainable shouldn't lie solely with individuals. Governments should provide a regulatory environment that demands greater transparency on how digital corporations use energy. And holding these corporations accountable should include reporting on whether they are improving the sustainability of their practices.<br/>One immediate step could be for corporations that produce digital devices to move away from planned obsolescence. One example of this is when companies including Apple and Samsung manufacture smartphones that are not designed to last. Digital sustainability is a useful way to frame how digital technologies affect our environmental world.<br/>We need to acknowledge that technology isn't just a source of environmental solutions, but also has the potential for negative environmental impact. Only then can we start to effectively transition to a more sustainable future that also includes digital technologies.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-625275</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7H-5781-JBYT-H0FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Check out the full 'Sustainable Societies[2]' program here. Digital technologies are often put forward as a solution to environmental dilemmas. The spread of the internet came with claims of a huge reduction in printing, and by replacing paper with bytes, we thought we'd reduce our negative environmental impact But this early promise of solving environmental problems may not be delivering because digital devices, like most technologies, also have environmental impacts. </p><p>Devices are powered by electricity - often produced in coal-fired plants - and are manufactured from materials such as metals, glass and plastics. These materials also have to be mined, made or recycled. So, while digital technologies can facilitate environmental benefits, we shouldn't assume they always do. My research[3] published this year shows much more needs to be done to debunk such myths.Measuring digital eco-footprintsIt's difficult to measure the environmental impacts of our digital lives, partly because the digital ecosystems that facilitate the internet are complex.The United Nations Environment Assembly defines a digital ecosystem[4] as 'a complex distributed network or interconnected socio-technological system'. Simply, digital ecosystems are the result of humans, digital infrastructure and devices interacting with one another. They rely on energy consumption at multiple scales. The term 'digital ecosystem' relates to ecological thinking, specifically in terms of how human-technological systems work. However, there's nothing inherently environmentally sustainable about digital ecosystems. It's worthwhile considering digital ecosystems' environmental impacts as they grow. In 2017, it was reported in Nature[5] that internet traffic (to and from data centers) was increasing at an exponential rate. At that stage, it had reached 1.1 zettabytes (a zettabyte equals one trillion gigabytes). As our digital use continues, so do our carbon emissions.Dangers of data centersData centers majorly contribute to the carbon emissions of digital ecosystems. They are basically factories that store, backup and recover our data. In April last year, it was estimated data centers around the world used more than 2% of the world's electricity, and generated the same amount of carbon emissions[6] as the global airline industry (in terms of fuel use). While there is debate about the impact of flying on climate change, we're less likely to evaluate our digital lives the same way. According to British Open University Professor John Naughton[7], data centers make up about 50% of all energy consumed by digital ecosystems. Personal devices use another 34%, and the industries responsible for manufacturing them use 16%. Tech giants such as Apple[8] and Google[9] have committed to 100% renewable targets, but they're just one part of our giant digital ecosystem. Also, on many occasions, they rely on carbon offsets to achieve this. Offsets involve people and organizations investing in environmental projects[10] to balance their carbon emissions from other activities. For instance, people can buy carbon offsets when booking flights. Offsets have been critiqued for not effectively reducing the carbon footprints of wealthy people, while absolving guilt from continued consumption.A carbon-filled road aheadWith more digital technologies emerging, the environmental impacts of digital ecosystems are probably going to increase. Apart from the obvious social and economic impacts[11], artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental implications should be seriously considered. A paper published in June[12] by University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers revealed training a large AI machine could produce five times as much carbon as what one car (including fuel) emits over a person's lifetime, on average. Also, this figure only relates to training a large AI machine. There are various other ways these machines suck energy. Similarly, bitcoin mining (an application of blockchain) continues to consume large amounts of energy, and is increasing on a global scale. According to the International Energy Agency[13], bitcoin mining uses more energy than some countries, including Austria and Colombia.Putting the 'eco' back in digital ecosystemThe digital ecosystem that supports our devices includes storage systems and networks that aren't in our homes or workplaces, such as 'the cloud'. But we should still take responsibility for the impact of such systems. Satellites are in space. Wires run beneath footpaths, roads and oceans. All the while, the Internet of Things[14] is creeping into old technologies and transforming how we use them. These underground and distant aspects of digital ecosystems may partly explain why the growing environmental impacts of digital are sidelined. There are some ways people can find out more about responsible tech options. A 2017 guide[15] by Greenpeace rated digital tech companies on their green credentials. It assessed a range of corporations, including some managing digital platforms, and others hosting data centers. But while the guide is useful, it's also limited by a lack of transparency, because corporations aren't obliged to share information on how much energy is needed or supplied for their data centers.Holding big tech accountableThe responsibility to make our digital lives more sustainable shouldn't lie solely with individuals. Governments should provide a regulatory environment that demands greater transparency on how digital corporations use energy. And holding these corporations accountable should include reporting on whether they are improving the sustainability of their practices. One immediate step could be for corporations that produce digital devices to move away from planned obsolescence. One example of this is when companies including Apple and Samsung[16] manufacture smartphones that are not designed to last. Digital sustainability is a useful way to frame how digital technologies affect our environmental world. We need to acknowledge that technology isn't just a source of environmental solutions, but also has the potential for negative environmental impact. Only then can we start to effectively transition to a more sustainable future that also includes digital technologies.

Banks, insurance companies, and other financial services firms are the primary users of data classification solutions as they have to deal with large volumes of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and government regulations for data protection.<br/>- Other industries such as retail, government, and healthcare where user's data are considered highly confidential, implement data classifications solution to maintain integrity and confidentiality of the data. The surge in analytics applications with stored data and concern for data theft due to mismanagement are some of the driving factors expected to enhance the market for data classification solutions in the forecast period.</p><p>Major Market Trends</p><p>A Surge in Data Security Solutions for Increased Malware Infection Rates in Computers</p><p>- It's been a critical concern for a business organization as well as personal computer users about the increase in cyber threats at an alarming rate. As everything is shifting to the world of internet and mobile-based apps, the threat of data vulnerability has also increased in these recent years. Specifically, business organizations are facing tough challenges with respect to their data security and vulnerability, as they many times have to deal with storing, shifting, migrating and outsourcing their user data on open source platforms.<br/>- Organizations in developing economies like China, India, Russia, Brazil, and others are very much open to risks related to data protection and information management. According to the recent publication from Cybersecurity Insiders, China remains at the top in the list of the highest malware infection rates in computers with a 49% infection rate.</p><p>Government Mandate in Developed Nations is Driving the Demand for Data Classification Services</p><p>- In countries like the US, UK, Germany, Singapore and some others where the government has regulated the IT environment with data encryption and protection laws, tech firms are finding opportunity areas to promote their data classification services in these markets. Governments in the US and UK have established three-tiered classification schemes for public sector data. Even the government of Washington has gone beyond this range and has established a five-tiered classification scheme, which has well applauded by open data advocates in the region.<br/>- Risk management also, one of the areas where government officials have raised their bar of data integrity and data handling roles. In these countries, it's always been a concern for the user groups to handle public data depending upon their job roles and authorization, which eventually provide the right space for market development for data classification solutions and services.</p><p>Competitive Landscape</p><p>As a niche software solution, the market for data classification is highly fragmented with the presence of many small vendors such as Boldon James Ltd (QinetiQ), Covata Limited, Digital Guardian, HANDD Business Solutions, SECLORE, and many others.</p><p>However, big tech firms including Amazon Web Services, Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Symantec Corporation, and Open Text Corporation are trying to offer data classification service as a bundled offering with their legacy cloud and on-premise database solutions. The market is also experiencing many market development strategies in recent years.</p><p>Recent Developments</p><p>- May 2019 - Seclore introduced advanced email encryption solution compatible with Microsoft Office and 365, to augment security, data classification and data loss protection features for users. This innovative product is expected to enhance Seclore market competitiveness in the data classification domain.<br/>- October 2018 - PKWARE, Inc., launched the Smartcrypt Classification solution to enhance its product offering in data classification and security industry.</p><p>Key Topics Covered</p><p>1 INTRODUCTION</p><p>2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p><p>3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p><p>4 MARKET DYNAMICS<br/>4.1 Market Overview<br/>4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers  Challenges<br/>4.3 Market Drivers<br/>4.3.1 Government Regulations and Compliance for Privacy  Data Security<br/>4.3.2 Concern for Data Theft due to Mismanagement<br/>4.3.3 Surge in Analytics Applications with Stored Data<br/>4.4 Market Challenges<br/>4.4.1 Data Standardisation Issues  Classification<br/>4.5 Industry Value Chain Analysis<br/>4.6 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis<br/>4.6.1 Threat of New Entrants<br/>4.6.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers<br/>4.6.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers<br/>4.6.4 Threat of Substitute Products<br/>4.6.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry</p><p>5 MARKET SEGMENTATION<br/>5.1 By Solution<br/>5.1.1 Software<br/>5.1.2 Services<br/>5.2 By Deployment<br/>5.2.1 On-Premise<br/>5.2.2 Cloud<br/>5.3 By Application<br/>5.3.1 Access Management<br/>5.3.2 Governance  Compliance Management<br/>5.3.3 Email  Mobile Protection<br/>5.3.4 Auditing  Reporting<br/>5.3.5 Other Applications<br/>5.4 By Industry Verticals<br/>5.4.1 BFSI<br/>5.4.2 Healthcare<br/>5.4.3 Government  Defence<br/>5.4.4 IT  Telecom<br/>5.4.5 Energy  Utilities<br/>5.4.6 Other Industry Verticals<br/>5.5 Geography<br/>5.5.1 North America<br/>5.5.2 Europe<br/>5.5.3 Asia-Pacific<br/>5.5.4 Rest of the World</p><p>6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE<br/>6.1 Company Profiles<br/>6.1.1 Amazon Web Services Inc.<br/>6.1.2 Boldon James Ltd.

Some 44.4% of the sample group are worried about maintaining of privacy and confidentiality of data in the cloud. Controlling of access to data and the monitoring of threats are second and third in the risk ranking, with 40.5% and 36.7%, respectively.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IT security professionals from the financial services sector, who were the third-largest group of respondents in the survey, expressed the highest degree of concern about the security of cloud applications with 94.8% of them naming more than one cloud-related challenge to their organization in 2018.</p><p>Impact on banks</p><p>Financial regulators have already warned about protection of bank data in the cloud as an increasing number of lenders upload and store account data online. On the one hand, regulators are worried about what would happen to data owned by a bank if it collapses, but on the other, they fear of loosening supervision as growing amounts of data are transferred onto the platforms of big tech groups such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, the Financial Times reported in late April.</p><p>Banks are also growing more concerned about protecting customer data. As much as 71% of some 400 bank executives surveyed by The Economist in February and March 2018 said they are raising their cybersecurity budgets. The CyberEdge survey found that the financial services sector comes in third in a ranking of mean IT spend on information security. Financial firms allocate 12% of their IT budget to security compared to the global average of 12.1%.</p><p>Banks have become the object of an increasing number of cyberattacks with a number of cases reported in 2018. Seven of the leading U.K. banks were targeted by cybercriminals in a coordinated attack uncovered in an investigation by the National Crime Agency in November 2017. This caused disruptions or complete shutdowns of the banks' online services, the Financial Times reported April 25. In late May, the FT reported about two further attacks against Dutch bank ABN AMRO Group NV and one against counterpart lender ING Groep NV that happened in January and May. The hack led to a slowdown and in some cases, termination of online services at ABN.</p><p>In the U.S., the adoption of new technology such as embedded chip cards and terminals continued to shift identity fraud online rather than physical venues with the number of U.S. citizens affected growing to 16.7 million in 2017 from 15.4 million in 2016, financial services research and advisory firm Javelin found in its annual identity fraud study for 2018. The total cost of the U.S. fraud cases stood at $16.8 billion last year.</p><p>The German financial market supervisory authority, BaFin, also warned in a study June 15, that the financial services sector should be vigilant and take measures to prevent cybercrime, as its cost to companies globally is estimated to surge to $2.1 trillion in 2019 from $445 billion in 2015.</p><p>Lack of qualified staff</p><p>Although the number of successful cyberattacks and the frequency of repeated successful attacks is on the decline in 2018 for the first time over the past five years, companies have gotten more pessimistic about the future prevention of the attacks, CyberEdge's survey found. While the percentage of respondents affected by a successful attack fell to 77.2% in 2018 from 79.2% in 2017, the share of respondents optimistic about preventing future attacks has dropped to 38% and stayed at that level for the past three years, compared to 62% in 2014.</p><p>A key barrier to establishing effective defenses against cyberattacks is the lack of skilled personnel in the IT security sector, CyberEdge found. Companies have been growing increasingly concerned about the shortage of qualified professionals over the past five years. Ranking fifth among the main concerns named by respondents in the survey in 2014, skills shortage was now named as the top concern.

Some 44.4% of the sample group are worried about maintaining of privacy and confidentiality of data in the cloud. Controlling of access to data and the monitoring of threats are second and third in the risk ranking, with 40.5% and 36.7%, respectively.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IT security professionals from the financial services sector, who were the third-largest group of respondents in the survey, expressed the highest degree of concern about the security of cloud applications with 94.8% of them naming more than one cloud-related challenge to their organization in 2018.</p><p>Impact on banks</p><p>Financial regulators have already warned about protection of bank data in the cloud as an increasing number of lenders upload and store account data online. On the one hand, regulators are worried about what would happen to data owned by a bank if it collapses, but on the other, they fear of loosening supervision as growing amounts of data are transferred onto the platforms of big tech groups such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, the Financial Times reported in late April.</p><p>Banks are also growing more concerned about protecting customer data. As much as 71% of some 400 bank executives surveyed by The Economist in February and March 2018 said they are raising their cybersecurity budgets. The CyberEdge survey found that the financial services sector comes in third in a ranking of mean IT spend on information security. Financial firms allocate 12% of their IT budget to security compared to the global average of 12.1%.</p><p>Banks have become the object of an increasing number of cyberattacks with a number of cases reported in 2018. Seven of the leading U.K. banks were targeted by cybercriminals in a coordinated attack uncovered in an investigation by the National Crime Agency in November 2017. This caused disruptions or complete shutdowns of the banks' online services, the Financial Times reported April 25. In late May, the FT reported about two further attacks against Dutch bank ABN AMRO Group NV and one against counterpart lender ING Groep NV that happened in January and May. The hack led to a slowdown and in some cases, termination of online services at ABN.</p><p>In the U.S., the adoption of new technology such as embedded chip cards and terminals continued to shift identity fraud online rather than physical venues with the number of U.S. citizens affected growing to 16.7 million in 2017 from 15.4 million in 2016, financial services research and advisory firm Javelin found in its annual identity fraud study for 2018. The total cost of the U.S. fraud cases stood at $16.8 billion last year.</p><p>The German financial market supervisory authority, BaFin, also warned in a study June 15, that the financial services sector should be vigilant and take measures to prevent cybercrime, as its cost to companies globally is estimated to surge to $2.1 trillion in 2019 from $445 billion in 2015.</p><p>Lack of qualified staff</p><p>Although the number of successful cyberattacks and the frequency of repeated successful attacks is on the decline in 2018 for the first time over the past five years, companies have gotten more pessimistic about the future prevention of the attacks, CyberEdge's survey found. While the percentage of respondents affected by a successful attack fell to 77.2% in 2018 from 79.2% in 2017, the share of respondents optimistic about preventing future attacks has dropped to 38% and stayed at that level for the past three years, compared to 62% in 2014.</p><p>A key barrier to establishing effective defenses against cyberattacks is the lack of skilled personnel in the IT security sector, CyberEdge found. Companies have been growing increasingly concerned about the shortage of qualified professionals over the past five years. Ranking fifth among the main concerns named by respondents in the survey in 2014, skills shortage was now named as the top concern. Some 81.4% of IT security experts in financial services identified this as the main barrier to future prevention.</p><p>The Bank of England has also sounded the alarm about the low number of IT security staff, with Chief Information Officer Robert Elsey announcing June 5 the BoE will host \"its first face-to-face cybersecurity competition to find new talent.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLBTD-44959709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLBTD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM8-JCM1-F19Y-C50M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360226</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Bank and Thrift Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 20, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001SF9</classCode><className>ING GROEP NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC000DEAD</classCode><className>ABN AMRO GROUP NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>INGA (BIT)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>INGA (AMS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ING (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Sector Outlook</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp;

You matter. At the 40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held this year in the European Parliament in Brussels, that shift in power was very evident.</p><p>Last year, the lead speaker was the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy.</p><p>This year, the chief executive of the world's most valuable company chose the gathering for his most high-profile intervention yet on the \"crisis\" of \"weaponised\" personal data - a fierce attack which went down a treat with his audience.</p><p>\"These are not plastic flowers we're smelling,\" a beaming Giovanni Buttarelli declared after Mr Cook finished. High praise indeed from the tough European data protection supervisor, who once described tech firms as the \"sweatshops of the connected world\".</p><p>What's changed? One law: GDPR. When <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.sky.com/story/gdpr-heres-why-you-keep-getting-emails-about-privacy-and-data-11368763\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">this sweeping legislation </emphasis></url>came into operation on 25 May, European data protection regulators suddenly gained vast new powers to investigate and fine even the mightiest of tech behemoths.</p><p>\"It's a really exciting time and I think we have a very strong law now,\" Helen Dixon, Ireland's data commissioner told me.</p><p>Even among the newly-empowered European commissioners, Ms Dixon is a special case. In the 2000s and early 2010s, one Silicon Valley giant after another based itself in Dublin, mostly for reasons that accountants call \"tax efficiency\".</p><p>Now that decision - allied with a GDPR mechanism called \"one-stop-shop\", which means multinationals can be regulated in the country in which they have their headquarters - means Ms Dixon has power over the European data dealings of firms, including AirBnB, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google.</p><p>That's why, when Facebook was hacked at the end of September, it was Dixon who announced the official European investigation. Talking about that investigation, one of several she is currently pursuing, she promised an assertive approach.</p><p>\"We're pleased that the work is under way now that we can bottom out on questions that have been circulating for some time about whether users are getting a fair deal,\" she said.</p><p>\"We may be challenged in court as we go, but at least we're going to move forward in terms of driving that better bargain between users and big tech.\"</p><p>It's early days, but this could be start of a genuine pushback against the economic model of data surveillance. And with Tim Cook's latest statement, it appears the data commissioners have found a powerful ally.

Ohio takes a 'carrot' approach.</p><p>Taking a cue from the European Union's expansive new General Data Protection Regulation, California lawmakers in June adopted the toughest and most complex data privacy regulations in the United States. Given the state's history of driving national policy, the logical question is whether the California Consumer Privacy Act will inspire other states or even the federal government to impose strict new data privacy regulations of their own.</p><p>According to experts we spoke to, the answer is a definite maybe.</p><p>\"Over the years several California privacy statutes have been copied by other states. But they were mostly simple and straightforward,\" says Kristen Mathews, a partner in the New York City law firm Proskauer Rose LLP and the head of its global privacy and cybersecurity group. \"This new California law is not simple. I don't think it would be my first contender for a law that other states will copy.\"</p><p>She'll get no argument from David Zetoony, a partner with Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, based in St. Louis. Zetoony, head of the firm's global data privacy and security practice, calls the law \"misguided, dubious in value and not well-thought-out at all.\"</p><p>To be sure, not everyone sees it that way. In a blog post shortly after the bill was signed on June 28, Alan Friel and Nilou Massachi, privacy attorneys for Cleveland-based Baker Hostetler LLP, called it \"a win for both industry and consumers.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, in a statement released that same day, California Senator Bill Dodd (D), one of the measure's three authors, noted his hope that \"other states will follow, ensuring privacy and safeguarding personal information in a way the federal government has so far been unwilling to do.\"</p><p>That remains to be seen, but Zetoony says it really doesn't matter if states follow suit or not, noting that California was the first state to adopt online privacy requirements for companies doing business there. Even though other states didn't copy them, he says most large companies adopted those policies themselves, essentially spreading the power of the law across the country.</p><p>\"This law may not get emulated quickly, but it doesn't need to be to have a national impact,\" he says.</p><p>As noted, the California Consumer Privacy Act borrows heavily from the European Union's statute-\"80 or 90 percent,\" Zetoony says. Whether you think that's good or bad likely depends on whether you are a consumer advocate or a big tech company that currently collects consumer data with almost unfettered access. But wherever you fall on California's privacy act, everyone agrees it is a lot less demanding than its original incarnation, which was well on its way to going before voters as a ballot initiative.</p><p>Earlier this year, a group called Californians for Consumer Privacy sponsored a drive to put a version of the state law in front of voters in November. Although it collected more than 600,000 signatures-far more than needed to get the measure on the ballot-the group said it would withdraw the proposal if lawmakers passed an acceptable privacy bill. That sparked a frenzied effort to get something through both chambers and to the governor before the June 28 cutoff date for removing the measure from the ballot. They made it with a just few hours to spare.</p><p>It's Complicated</p><p>So what exactly does that measure (AB 375) do? The short answer is a lot.</p><p>As of Jan. 1, 2020, consumers will be able to request that companies provide them with an accounting of the data they have collected on them and require the company to delete that information. Companies will have to notify consumers that they have the right to opt out of having their information sold, and businesses can't retaliate or discriminate against a consumer who chooses that option. Consumers will further be allowed to take legal action against a company that violates these or other tenets of the law.</p><p>As noted by the Harvard Business Review, the statute establishes a fairly broad definition of personal information that includes a whole raft of personal identifiers, such as geolocation, biometric data, internet browsing history, psychometric data, and inferences a company might be able to make about the consumer from that data.</p><p>There are, however, some limitations on whom the law applies to. Companies under the law must meet one of the following criteria: have annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million; process the information of 50,000 or more consumers; or derive at least 50 percent of their annual revenues from the sale of personal information.</p><p>The bill also gave the California attorney general's office the chore of drafting regulations and advising businesses about compliance with the new law. That drew the ire of Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D), who in a letter to lawmakers complained that such a mandate comprised \"unworkable obligations and serious operational challenges\" for his office. He also questioned the legality of the new law's civil penalties.</p><p>That led to more legislation, SB 1121, signed by Governor Jerry Brown (D), which, among several things, kills a requirement that someone suing over a data breach first notify the attorney general's office. It also delays enforcement of the law until six months after the attorney general publishes the new regulations and clarifies that consumers can file suit under the law only if the breach is caused by a company's failure to implement reasonable security steps.</p><p>That is far less than some advertising and tech companies want. The Internet Association-an industry trade group comprising tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Uber-has made clear its intention to continue working to modify the law before it goes into effect in 2020.</p><p>Several of those same companies are also lobbying the Trump administration to come up with a federal law that would override the Golden State measure.</p><p>Do Companies Have Time to Comply?</p><p>In the meantime, however, companies around the nation that do business in California are girding up to comply with the new law. Zetoony believes that how ready they are when the calendar clicks over to 2020 will be determined in great part by the effort they have already been making to comply with the European statute.</p><p>\"A company that has been diligently preparing to comply with the GDPR should be in good position to comply with the California law,\" he says, referring to the European statute by its initials. \"But if you're starting from a dead stop, I think you're going to find California's timetable very aggressive.\"</p><p>Mathews says that preparation is even more challenging because the ground is still shifting under the California law.</p><p>\"If you really had a full year to prepare, it would be enough,\" she says. \"But we don't really have a year because while we know there will be more amendments; we don't know what they will be. We don't want to start implementing compliance programs without knowing what the final law will look like.\"</p><p>Using the European statute as a model for preparation purposes is a start, but hardly a foolproof one. The law has been enforceable only since May of this year and has not yet been cited in any enforcement actions. Without that, there is no way to know if the law will hold up to legal challenges.</p><p>An Eye on Ohio</p><p>Amid so much uncertainty, Zetoony argues that states looking for a model to follow cast their eyes not to California but to Ohio, where Senators Bob Hackett (R) and Kevin Bacon (R) sponsored SB 220, aka the Ohio Data Protection Act.</p><p>That law offers Buckeye State companies that compile and transfer personal data a safe harbor from litigation over breaches if they have in place at least one of 10 specific industry-recognized cybersecurity frameworks. These are designed to \"protect the security and confidentiality of personal information; protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of personal information; and protect against unauthorized access to and acquisition of personal information that is likely to result in a material risk of identity theft or fraud.\"</p><p>Ohio is the only state that uses a carrot rather than a stick regarding data privacy. Zetoony hopes it isn't the last.</p><p>\"If states adopted the Ohio law,\" he says, \"it would create a real sea change by getting far more companies to invest far more money into their data security systems.\" M</p><p>California's Out Front in Privacy Protection</p><p>The Consumer Privacy Act is not the only example of groundbreaking consumer privacy and security legislation to come from California. The home of Silicon Valley also enacted the first law requiring companies to notify consumers of data breaches. All 50 states now have breach-notification laws like California's.</p><p>California lawmakers have passed several other privacy laws, and although only a few other states have followed suit, the Golden State's actions have had an impact beyond its borders.</p><p>Online Privacy Policies It's now common to see privacy policies posted prominently on websites and online services. That's at least partly due to California's Online Privacy Protection Act, enacted in 2003. It requires websites and other online services that collect personally identifiable information from California residents to post and comply with an online privacy policy.</p><p>The law also requires commercial websites and online services to disclose in their privacy policies how they respond to web-browser \"Do Not Track\" signals or similar mechanisms. Consumers can turn on these mechanisms to prevent tracking of their personal information across sites or services and over time.</p><p>An Online Eraser for Minors In another first, California passed the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, known as the \"Online Eraser\" law, in 2013. It allows Californians under 18 to request removal of their own social media or other online postings that they later regret having shared.</p><p>It also prohibits websites or online services catering to children from advertising products or services that minors are legally prohibited from buying or are based on personal information collected about a minor.</p><p>Protecting Personal Information California law requires entities that own, license or maintain personal information to protect it. About half the states have data security laws. Some simply require that a company follow security procedures and practices; others require annual security assessments or audits, mandate training and specify that security frameworks and standards must be followed.</p><p>Protecting Connected Devices California recently became the first state to address security concerns surrounding the \"internet of things.\" The new law, which passed in September with bipartisan support, requires manufacturers to equip smart devices with reasonable security features to prevent cyberattacks. Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin (D) sponsored the bill to combat attacks that have infected routers, cameras, printers, digital video recorders and other devices. The infected devices enabled distributed denial of service attacks that shut down prominent websites and</p><p>\"With our growing reliance on internet of things devices, the threat that unsecure devices pose to individuals, businesses and our state looms large. Ensuring we have the right tools to keep our devices and information secure is critical,\" Irwin says. \"This new law was the result of hard work with many stakeholders from the business, technology, privacy and consumer communities.\"</p><p>Whether other legislatures follow its lead in these and future tech-related laws, California leaves a large footprint.</p><p>-Pam Greenberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STALEG-2137848392</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STALEG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV6-GYJ1-JBHT-D2VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316074</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1939\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Conference of State Legislatures Nov/Dec 2018</copyright><publicationName>State Legislatures</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 01476041</issn><volume>Vol. 44</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 1, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It's messy, confusing and new laws are set to land right in the backyard of Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Personalisation is in vogue at the expense of mass marketing. It was perhaps a timely and arguably purposeful message to the 3000-strong crowd at last week's Association of National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference in the US, as intensity mounts on the controversial privacy regulation the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which is set to take effect on January 1, 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Battle lines have been drawn - personal data, after all, is the elixir which underpins much of the digital economy. America's advertisers want one federal privacy law to pre-empt the emerging patchwork of current and pending state privacy legislation.</p><p>That argument clearly has merit. Big Tech wants the same, or at the very least, a watering down of the CCPA. The clock is ticking. California Governor Gavin Newsom has until Monday to sign into law the final version of the landmark CCPA, and by all accounts he will.</p><p>Modelled on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the CCPA strikes at Big Tech's homeland and is set to be the de facto consumer privacy law for the US. There will be wide-reaching implications for us all. Not least because the growing \"techlash\" is gathering steam.</p><p>While California's privacy law will probably play out through enforcement much like the GDPR - the looming threat of a fragmented US state-based privacy regulation system kicks data privacy into sharp focus.</p><p>Last month, 51 tech CEOs including those from Amazon, AT&amp;T, IBM, Dell and Salesforce sent a letter to Congress on behalf of the Business Roundtable (a non-profit association made up of CEOs from US companies), calling for a comprehensive federal consumer data privacy law. Urgently. The catalyst was the CCPA and its instigator Alastair Mactaggart, described as America's most important privacy activist. Mactaggart, a Californian real estate developer, spent $3.1 million of his own money to make the CCPA happen in 2018. In so doing, he focused the attention of America's leading companies - on the importance of data privacy to the consumer.</p><p>Mactaggart's agenda was simple: First, just do some good. Then: Do something about privacy. And then: Do something about data privacy. Mactaggart wants to give consumers transparency, control and accountability. To have the ability to demand what businesses know about them, as they can from any level of government via a Freedom of Information request. Mactaggart wants consumers to be able to tell companies not to sell their personal information and to hold companies accountable to take care of personal information. Mactaggart believes Big Tech's data use is out of control.</p><p>Greta Thunberg last month said: \"We are not the ones who are responsible for this, but we are the ones who have to live with these consequences, and that is so incredibly unfair.\" Her words on climate change echo in Mactaggart's purpose.</p><p>Both unlikely activists are on the same hymn sheet. While the drafting and ambiguity of the CCPA remains a contested issue, it is unarguable that Mactaggart has spearheaded action.</p><p>Next, he wants consumers to control their \"sensitive personal information\" - race, health, social security number and GPS locations. If ratified into law, consumers would have the right to prevent such data from being sold or used for advertising purposes.</p><p>It's yet another new squeeze for marketers. The complexity of the regulatory and legal framework around online tracking, data mining and privacy shows no respite - indeed it's fragmented for the foreseeable future: GDPR, CCPA, and closer to home, the Notifiable Data Breaches Act and the impending outcomes of the ACCC Digital Platforms Inquiry will continue spinning in their own orbits.</p><p>Meanwhile, customers are demanding greater accountability.

She chairs the Privacy &amp; Data Security Group at the Los Angeles office of Frankfurt Kurnit Klein &amp; Selz, teaches at Loyola Law School and was named by the Daily Journal as one of the top 20 cyber attorneys in California in 2018. She brought those powerhouse credentials and a foreboding warning to Sacramento on Feb. 5 when the California News Publishers Association gathered for an annual meeting of news professionals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forsheit was there to sound the alarm about the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is the absolute worst thing that California could be doing if it actually believes in a free press and making all news available to all consumers,\" she said. \"Trust me when I tell you the legislators do not understand how this works.\"</p><p>The law was passed in haste in 2018 after a Bay Area housing developer named Alastair Mactaggart bankrolled a $3 million-plus campaign to gather signatures for a ballot initiative that would enshrine personal data protection into California law. Because ballot initiatives are more challenging to amend than laws enacted by the Legislature, the California Legislature decided to crib the language straight from Mactaggart's ballot measure. They did, with a delay-the law does not take effect until Jan. 1, 2020- designed to give lawmakers time to make changes. Cue forward to this legislative session, with no fewer than a dozen bills introduced that would modify the CCPA.</p><p>Forsheit is one of the dozens of attorneys and cyber experts who have been lobbying the Legislature to make those changes, and a flurry of bills that define and redefine terms like \"privacy\" and \"sale of personal information\" have been moving along, but many have been coming to a halt as the legislative session comes to a close. (See story, p. 26.)</p><p>Mactaggart was moved to action by the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. With his supporters, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation, he submitted 629,000 signatures in May 2018, almost double the requirement of 366,000 to qualify for the ballot. Lawmakers contacted Mactaggart looking for a compromise deal, and just hours before the deadline to withdraw a ballot initiative- 5pm on Thursday, June 28, 2018-AB 375 passed. Mactaggart pulled the initiative.</p><p>Instead of an initiative, we have what Forsheit's colleague, attorney Daniel Goldberg, calls \"a monster bill.\"</p><p>\"It comes from a really good place,\" he says, \"but the way that it was written, it's kind of a monster. It has some of the stuff from [the Europe Union's General Data Protection Regulation]. But it doesn't clarify how things work.\"</p><p>Europe's GDPR, a data privacy law meant to rein in Big Tech companies like Facebook and Google, took effect on May 25, 2018. Maybe you've traveled to Europe since then. In the early days, if you tried to pull up a news site like the Dallas Morning News or Baltimore Sun on your laptop or smartphone, you'd instead see an error message from news outlets that did not comply-they decided it would be cheaper just to forego European readers. Click to the Los Angeles Times, and you'd get the message, \"Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries. We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market.\"</p><p>Still today, if you're traveling in Europe and go to montereycountyweekly com, you get an error message: \"451: Unavailable due to legal reasons. We recognize you are attempting to access this website from a country belonging to the European Economic Area including the EU which enforces the General Data Protection Regulation and therefore access cannot be granted at this time.\"</p><p>When Goldberg talks about implementation of the Consumer Privacy Act, which has been dubbed \"California GDPR,\" he calls it \"D-Day.\" What \"D-Day\" in California privacy looks like remains very much a question mark: Will users get error messages and a lack of access to websites like they did in Europe? Will hundreds of small businesses with websites that collect user information-customers who have entered email addresses to receive promotions, for instance-shut down their websites, or hire tech firms to get them into compliance?</p><p>\"Everything from toasters and baby dolls to televisions are connected to the Internet, gathering and using a wide range of information,\" according to a Senate Judiciary Committee analysis of the bill. That information includes things like phone numbers, email addresses, hotel preferences and shoe sizes.</p><p>When Mactaggart created the group Californians for Consumer Privacy and launched his ballot initiative, he was attempting to take on Big Tech giants. Those companies, Forsheit and Goldberg say, are going to have no trouble complying with the CCPA because they've already gotten into compliance with GDPR. It's the smaller entities, like local newspapers and boutique vendors, that are likely to have the toughest time making their websites legal and accessible.</p><p>\"That's the kind of awful irony,\" Forsheit said at the CNPA conference. \"Facebook and Google really have nothing to lose at the end of the day. Alastair [Mactaggart] thinks he's taking down the Goliath-absolutely not.\" (Through a spokesperson, Mactaggart declined a request for an interview.)</p><p>The California law applies to companies that meet at least one of three thresholds: They do at least $25 million in revenue annually; the business makes at least half its money by selling data; or the business gathers information on at least 50,000 consumers per year. (For comparison, Monterey County Weekly's website had 1.4 million unique visitors in the past year. Many do not provide personal information, but tens of thousands of readers do provide identifying information, like email addresses.)</p><p>Town News is an Illinois-based company that provides digital publication services to some 2,000 news outlets, including the Weekly. Since GDPR took effect in Europe, the default has been for its websites in Europe to get the 451 error.</p><p>One lingering issue with CCPA is the definition of \"deidentified data.\" Think of the creepy effect of searching online for a new camera, say-and then everywhere vou go, whether checking email or reading the news or booking a hotel room, an advertisement for a camera pops up.</p><p>Those ads use cookies, or \"deidentified data,\" to target potential customers. Advertisers know someone on your machine was searching for cameras, even if they don't know who you are. The fear, as expressed by Assemblymember Jaqui Irwin, D -Thousand Oaks, is that unless \"deidentified data\" is excluded from the CCPA, the law will have unintended consequences. (Her bill, AB 873, failed in committee, despite a long line of lobbyists from the business and advertising industries in support.)</p><p>\"If you're in a department store and you're using a credit card, you can tell the department store you want to be forgotten,\" Irwin told the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 9. \"They go in and erase everything they can reasonably associate with you. If you get rid of the 'reasonably,' they have to [check] other data, such as a store camera-you're going to have to use facial recognition. It's really anti-privacy.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the federal government is taking its own tack cracking down on Big Tech. July 24, the Federal Trade Commission announced a $5 billion settlement with Facebook, \"for its failure to protect consumers' privacy\" and \"deceptive privacy settings\"-and failure to comply with previous FTC orders. The fine amounts to 9 percent of Facebook's revenue last year. It's the largest civil penalty ever, and \"establishes a new era of privacy transparency at Facebook and at WhatsApp and Instagram, which Facebook owns,\" according to the FTC.</p><p>In her dissent, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter wrote that I even the unprecedented fine is not enough to chasten Facebook: \"The fact that Facebook's stock value increased with the disclosure of a potential $5 billion penalty may suggest that the market believes that a penalty at this level makes a violation profitable.\" Goldberg says whether the amount of the Facebook fine was appropriate remains debatable, but j he writes in a blog post that the takeaway is clear: \"Failure to incorporate privacy by design has real monetary consequences for business, which will amplify once the California Consumer Privacy Act takes effect in January 2020.\"</p><p>The 451 error message that greets Weekly readers in Europe since GDPR took effect;

Year-over-year increases after the broadcaster unplugged the usual morass of background adtech that makes surveillance capitalism 'function' are as follows:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>January: 62%; February 79%; March 27%; April 9%; May 17%; June 17%;</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Earlier this month Brave published five months' worth of the NPO ad revenue data. So this is actually an update on an earlier blog post on the topic. The updated figures from Ster, the NPO's ad sales house, slightly amend the earlier amounts, revising the reported figures further upwards. So, in short, non-tracking ad revenue bump has been sustained for half a year. Even amid a pandemic.<br/>Now the idea that switching from behavioral to contextual targeting can lead to revenue growth is not a narrative you'll hear from the ad tracking industry and its big tech backers. Aka the platform giants whose grip on the Internet's attention economy and the digital infrastructure used for buying and selling targeted ads has helped them to huge profits over the past half decade or so (even as publisher revenues have largely stagnated or declined during this boom period for digital ad spending).<br/>The adtech industry prefers to chainlink tracking and targeting to ad revenue - claiming publisher revenues would tank if content producers were forced to abandon their reader surveillance systems. (Here's Google's VP of ad platforms, last year, telling AdExchanger that the impact of tracker blocking on publishers' programmatic ad revenues could cut CPMs in half, for example.)<br/>Yet it's not the first time there's been a report of (surprise!) publisher uplift after ditching ad trackers.<br/>Last year Digiday reported that the New York Times saw its ad revenue rise in Europe after it switched off creepy ads ahead of a major regional regulatory update, shifting over to contextual and geographical targeting.<br/>The NYT does have a certain level of brand cache which not every publisher can claim. Hence the tracking industry counterclaims that its experience isn't one that can be widely replicated by publishers. So the NPO data is additionally interesting in that it shows revenue uplift for a public broadcaster even across websites that aren't dominant in their particular category, per Brave's analysis.<br/>Here's its chief policy &amp; industry relations officer, Dr Johnny Ryan, who writes:<br/>NPO and its sales house, Ster, invested in contextual targeting and testing, and produced vast sales increases even with sites that do not appear to dominate their categories. This may be a tribute to Ster's ability to sell inventory across NPO's media group as a collective, but this benefit would have applied in 2019 and does not account for the revenue jump in 2020. A publisher does not therefore need to have market dominance to abandon 3rd party tracking and reproduce NPO's vast revenue increase.<br/>And here's Ryan's take on why \"legitimate\" (i.e. non junk/clickbait) publishers of all sizes should be able to follow the NPO's example:<br/>Although it is a national broadcast group, NPO websites do not dominate the web traffic rankings in the Netherlands. Only one of NPO's properties (Nos.nl) ranks in the top 5 in its category in the Netherlands, according to Similar Web. None of the other NPO properties are in the Netherland's top 100. The other NPO websites for which Similar Web provides a traffic rank estimation (versus other websites in the Netherlands) range from 180th to 5,040th most popular in the Netherlands. NPO properties' popularity or market position in each content category are not correlated with increases in impressions sold. Country site rank, category site rank, and numbers of page views, vary widely between the properties, whereas the increases in impression sold are all above 83%, with one explicable exception [due to technical difficulties over the tracked period which prevented ads being served against one of its most popular programs].<br/>Brave has its own commercial iron in the fire here, of course, given its approach to monetizing user eyeballs aligns with an anti-tracking marketplace ethos. But that hardly takes away from the NPO's experience of - surprise! - revenue growth from ditching creepy ads.<br/>Joost Negenman, NPO's privacy officer, told TechCrunch they had certainly not expected to see ad revenue uplift from making the switch. The decision to move to contextual ads was made mid last year, as a result of the public broadcaster becoming \"convinced\" the programmatic targeting ad system it was using wasn't compatible with its \"public task\", as he tells it.<br/>\"We expected a rather dramatic drop in revenue,\" says Negenman, noting that at that time the NPO was only getting a consent rate from users of around 10% for the ad cookies Ster needed for its programmatic ad system - down from 75%+ prior to GDPR (\"probably\" because its Cookie Consent Module at the time had been based on \"implicit instead of explicit consent\"; whereas GDPR mandates for consent to be legally valid it must be specific, informed and freely given).<br/>\"We also expected a drop because advertisers could completely ignore us when NPO and Ster turned away from this market adtech standard together, at a time when there was no sophisticated alternative in place,\" he continues. \"This fortunate misjudgment on our side was also fuelled by the strong belief (and preaches) in programmatic ad-solutions by online marketeers and companies.\"<br/>Negenman attributes the surprise revenue bounty from selling contextual ads to a couple of factors: Namely the \"A-brand\" pull of NPO and its affiliate broadcasters, meaning advertisers still wanted to be able to reach their users. And, well, to having the pro-privacy zeitgeist on its side.<br/>\"We're all aware of the growing scrutiny on the adtech business, no explanation needed!\" he says.<br/>It's worth noting the NPO's switch to contextual ads did require some investment to pull off. The publisher shelled out for technology to enable contextual targeting across its web properties - such as building out descriptive metadata to enable more granular contextual targeting on video content. And the level of investment required to achieve similarly sophisticated contextual ad targeting might not be available to every publisher.<br/>Yet the sustained revenue bump NPO experienced post-switch means it very quickly earned back what it spent - so for publishers that can afford to invest up front in transitioning away from tracking it looks like a very compelling case study.<br/>\"It paid for itself within a month or so!\" confirms Negenman. \"Considering all the money Ster didn't have to share with Google and other in-betweens. From 1 advertisement Euro, 1 Euro goes to Ster!\"<br/>Though he also notes the broadcaster was helped by Dutch law placing an obligation on it to have subtitles for over 90% of its assets - meaning some of the leg work to build out contextual targeting had already been done.<br/>\"Subtitles data of course provides valuable descriptive metadata. So those tools where already in place,\" he says. \"But beside subtitles - that are nowadays easier to automate - standard program information like (sub)genre, titles of actors are of great value as well to add context on a video asset.\"<br/>Brave's Ryan posits that the role of NPO's sales house is also important to its success with contextual ads. \"Smaller publishers may benefit from engaging with reputable sales houses that can aggregate supply as Ster does for NPO's various properties,\" he suggests. \"Publishers of all sizes will benefit according to their reputations - unless advertisers and agencies purchase from sales houses with poor reputations.\"<br/>Asked whether he believes the switch would work for all publishers, Negenman does not go that far. \"For all A-brands I definitely see this approach working, also news outlets have the perfect (meta)data needed to feed such a system,\" he says, arguing there's a place in the market for both contextual and targeted ads.<br/>\"Not all online advertising is the same,\" he argues. \"A shoe annoyingly following you online is something other than creating (A-)brand awareness. Perhaps the contextual system can start by creating privacy friendly 'lagoons' where a person is not tracked or followed by a shoe. There the system gets time to prove its worth in revenue and respect for its audience.\"<br/>\"For other public broadcasters I believe they have more or less an (moral) obligation to at least start testing contextual ads,\" he adds. \"The adtech system's use of personal and behavioral data has become so un-explainable that the GDPR information obligation is almost impossible to meet.\"<br/>As we've said before, the evidence of viable alternatives to privacy-torching surveillance capitalism is stacking up - even as harms\u00a0linked to adtech platforms' exploitation of people's information keep piling up.<br/>And while contextual ads may not sum to a revenue boom for every type of publisher, the notion that it's tracking or nothing is clearly bogus.<br/>(You could also make a pretty compelling case that abusive exploitation of people's data that sustains low grade publishing is not at all a net societal good and so supporting a system that supports bottom feeding clickbait (and massive levels of ad fraud) is simply bad for everyone - well, other than the bottom feeders... )<br/>Ryan goes so far as to call conventional adtech \"a cancer eating at the heart of legitimate publishers\". And having worked inside the beast he's castigating, via an earlier stint at anti-ad-blocking adtech company called PageFair, his critique is all the more hard hitting.<br/>He's used his insider knowledge to file a number of complaints with European regulators - most notably against the real-time bidding (RTB) practice\u00a0programmatic advertising can rely on, drawing in vast quantities of Internet users' personal information and scattershotting it back out again.<br/>He contends this high velocity trading of personal data can't possibly be compliant with Europe's data protection framework - which, conversely, mandates that people's information be securely handled, not spread around like confetti. (Though he believes RTB can work fine if you strip out personal data and only use it for contextual ads.)<br/>European data protection regulators agree there's a 'lawfulness' problem with current adtech practices. But have so far sat on their hands rather than taking enforcement action, given how widespread the problem is.<br/>(Interestingly, Negenman says the NPO investigated continuing using programmatic RTB but with personal data stripped out. Though, in the event, he says this idea never got past the production stage. \"Personally I can imagine a compliant combination,\" he notes, adding: \"Most importantly, the personal data must not leave the trusted data partner [and be shared with] the advertisers.\")<br/>Turning a tanker clearly takes time. But the more publishers that see not pushing creepy ads on their users as an opportunity to experiment with alternatives, the more chance there will be for the market to shift wholesale for privacy - a shift that can be a huge win for publishers and users alike, as the NPO experience illustrates.\u00a0<br/>Competition regulators, meanwhile, are closing in on big (ad)tech's market power - and the conflicts of interest that arise from the \"vertically integrated chain of intermediaries\" which work to funnel the lion's share of digital ad spend into platform coffers. So it's not hard to conceive of an intervention to force market reform by breaking up Google's business empire - to separate the 'ad' bits from its other 'tech'.<br/>The self-interested forces that underpin surveillance capitalism made their fortunes when no one was really looking at how their methods exploit people's data. Now, with many more eyes trained on them, they are operating on borrowed time. It's no longer a question of whether change is coming. The sands are shifting, with platforms themselves now moving to limit access to third party tracking cookies.<br/>Savvy publishers would do well to get out ahead of the next round of platform power moves - and skate to where the puck's headed.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1261173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-W9J1-JBYT-H203-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Year-over-year increases after the broadcaster unplugged the usual morass of background adtech that makes surveillance capitalism 'function' are as follows:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>January: 62%; February 79%; March 27%; April 9%; May 17%; June 17%;</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Earlier this month Brave published five months' worth of the NPO ad revenue data. So this is actually an update on an earlier blog post on the topic. The updated figures from Ster, the NPO's ad sales house, slightly amend the earlier amounts, revising the reported figures further upwards. So, in short, non-tracking ad revenue bump has been sustained for half a year. Even amid a pandemic.<br/>Now the idea that switching from behavioral to contextual targeting can lead to revenue growth is not a narrative you'll hear from the ad tracking industry and its big tech backers. Aka the platform giants whose grip on the Internet's attention economy and the digital infrastructure used for buying and selling targeted ads has helped them to huge profits over the past half decade or so (even as publisher revenues have largely stagnated or declined during this boom period for digital ad spending).<br/>The adtech industry prefers to chainlink tracking and targeting to ad revenue - claiming publisher revenues would tank if content producers were forced to abandon their reader surveillance systems. (Here's Google's VP of ad platforms, last year, telling AdExchanger that the impact of tracker blocking on publishers' programmatic ad revenues could cut CPMs in half, for example.)<br/>Yet it's not the first time there's been a report of (surprise!) publisher uplift after ditching ad trackers.<br/>Last year Digiday reported that the New York Times saw its ad revenue rise in Europe after it switched off creepy ads ahead of a major regional regulatory update, shifting over to contextual and geographical targeting.<br/>The NYT does have a certain level of brand cache which not every publisher can claim. Hence the tracking industry counterclaims that its experience isn't one that can be widely replicated by publishers. So the NPO data is additionally interesting in that it shows revenue uplift for a public broadcaster even across websites that aren't dominant in their particular category, per Brave's analysis.<br/>Here's its chief policy &amp; industry relations officer, Dr Johnny Ryan, who writes:<br/>NPO and its sales house, Ster, invested in contextual targeting and testing, and produced vast sales increases even with sites that do not appear to dominate their categories. This may be a tribute to Ster's ability to sell inventory across NPO's media group as a collective, but this benefit would have applied in 2019 and does not account for the revenue jump in 2020. A publisher does not therefore need to have market dominance to abandon 3rd party tracking and reproduce NPO's vast revenue increase.<br/>And here's Ryan's take on why \"legitimate\" (i.e. non junk/clickbait) publishers of all sizes should be able to follow the NPO's example:<br/>Although it is a national broadcast group, NPO websites do not dominate the web traffic rankings in the Netherlands. Only one of NPO's properties (Nos.nl) ranks in the top 5 in its category in the Netherlands, according to Similar Web. None of the other NPO properties are in the Netherland's top 100. The other NPO websites for which Similar Web provides a traffic rank estimation (versus other websites in the Netherlands) range from 180th to 5,040th most popular in the Netherlands. NPO properties' popularity or market position in each content category are not correlated with increases in impressions sold. Country site rank, category site rank, and numbers of page views, vary widely between the properties, whereas the increases in impression sold are all above 83%, with one explicable exception [due to technical difficulties over the tracked period which prevented ads being served against one of its most popular programs].<br/>Brave has its own commercial iron in the fire here, of course, given its approach to monetizing user eyeballs aligns with an anti-tracking marketplace ethos. But that hardly takes away from the NPO's experience of - surprise! - revenue growth from ditching creepy ads.<br/>Joost Negenman, NPO's privacy officer, told TechCrunch they had certainly not expected to see ad revenue uplift from making the switch. The decision to move to contextual ads was made mid last year, as a result of the public broadcaster becoming \"convinced\" the programmatic targeting ad system it was using wasn't compatible with its \"public task\", as he tells it.<br/>\"We expected a rather dramatic drop in revenue,\" says Negenman, noting that at that time the NPO was only getting a consent rate from users of around 10% for the ad cookies Ster needed for its programmatic ad system - down from 75%+ prior to GDPR (\"probably\" because its Cookie Consent Module at the time had been based on \"implicit instead of explicit consent\"; whereas GDPR mandates for consent to be legally valid it must be specific, informed and freely given).<br/>\"We also expected a drop because advertisers could completely ignore us when NPO and Ster turned away from this market adtech standard together, at a time when there was no sophisticated alternative in place,\" he continues. \"This fortunate misjudgment on our side was also fuelled by the strong belief (and preaches) in programmatic ad-solutions by online marketeers and companies.\"<br/>Negenman attributes the surprise revenue bounty from selling contextual ads to a couple of factors: Namely the \"A-brand\" pull of NPO and its affiliate broadcasters, meaning advertisers still wanted to be able to reach their users. And, well, to having the pro-privacy zeitgeist on its side.<br/>\"We're all aware of the growing scrutiny on the adtech business, no explanation needed!\" he says.<br/>It's worth noting the NPO's switch to contextual ads did require some investment to pull off. The publisher shelled out for technology to enable contextual targeting across its web properties - such as building out descriptive metadata to enable more granular contextual targeting on video content. And the level of investment required to achieve similarly sophisticated contextual ad targeting might not be available to every publisher.<br/>Yet the sustained revenue bump NPO experienced post-switch means it very quickly earned back what it spent - so for publishers that can afford to invest up front in transitioning away from tracking it looks like a very compelling case study.<br/>\"It paid for itself within a month or so!\" confirms Negenman. \"Considering all the money Ster didn't have to share with Google and other in-betweens. From 1 advertisement Euro, 1 Euro goes to Ster!\"<br/>Though he also notes the broadcaster was helped by Dutch law placing an obligation on it to have subtitles for over 90% of its assets - meaning some of the leg work to build out contextual targeting had already been done.<br/>\"Subtitles data of course provides valuable descriptive metadata. So those tools where already in place,\" he says. \"But beside subtitles - that are nowadays easier to automate - standard program information like (sub)genre, titles of actors are of great value as well to add context on a video asset.\"<br/>Brave's Ryan posits that the role of NPO's sales house is also important to its success with contextual ads. \"Smaller publishers may benefit from engaging with reputable sales houses that can aggregate supply as Ster does for NPO's various properties,\" he suggests. \"Publishers of all sizes will benefit according to their reputations - unless advertisers and agencies purchase from sales houses with poor reputations.\"<br/>Asked whether he believes the switch would work for all publishers, Negenman does not go that far. \"For all A-brands I definitely see this approach working, also news outlets have the perfect (meta)data needed to feed such a system,\" he says, arguing there's a place in the market for both contextual and targeted ads.<br/>\"Not all online advertising is the same,\" he argues. \"A shoe annoyingly following you online is something other than creating (A-)brand awareness. Perhaps the contextual system can start by creating privacy friendly 'lagoons' where a person is not tracked or followed by a shoe. There the system gets time to prove its worth in revenue and respect for its audience.\"<br/>\"For other public broadcasters I believe they have more or less an (moral) obligation to at least start testing contextual ads,\" he adds. \"The adtech system's use of personal and behavioral data has become so un-explainable that the GDPR information obligation is almost impossible to meet.\"<br/>As we've said before, the evidence of viable alternatives to privacy-torching surveillance capitalism is stacking up - even as harms\u00a0linked to adtech platforms' exploitation of people's information keep piling up.<br/>And while contextual ads may not sum to a revenue boom for every type of publisher, the notion that it's tracking or nothing is clearly bogus.<br/>(You could also make a pretty compelling case that abusive exploitation of people's data that sustains low grade publishing is not at all a net societal good and so supporting a system that supports bottom feeding clickbait (and massive levels of ad fraud) is simply bad for everyone - well, other than the bottom feeders... )<br/>Ryan goes so far as to call conventional adtech \"a cancer eating at the heart of legitimate publishers\". And having worked inside the beast he's castigating, via an earlier stint at anti-ad-blocking adtech company called PageFair, his critique is all the more hard hitting.<br/>He's used his insider knowledge to file a number of complaints with European regulators - most notably against the real-time bidding (RTB) practice\u00a0programmatic advertising can rely on, drawing in vast quantities of Internet users' personal information and scattershotting it back out again.<br/>He contends this high velocity trading of personal data can't possibly be compliant with Europe's data protection framework - which, conversely, mandates that people's information be securely handled, not spread around like confetti. (Though he believes RTB can work fine if you strip out personal data and only use it for contextual ads.)<br/>European data protection regulators agree there's a 'lawfulness' problem with current adtech practices. But have so far sat on their hands rather than taking enforcement action, given how widespread the problem is.<br/>(Interestingly, Negenman says the NPO investigated continuing using programmatic RTB but with personal data stripped out. Though, in the event, he says this idea never got past the production stage. \"Personally I can imagine a compliant combination,\" he notes, adding: \"Most importantly, the personal data must not leave the trusted data partner [and be shared with] the advertisers.\")<br/>Turning a tanker clearly takes time. But the more publishers that see not pushing creepy ads on their users as an opportunity to experiment with alternatives, the more chance there will be for the market to shift wholesale for privacy - a shift that can be a huge win for publishers and users alike, as the NPO experience illustrates.\u00a0<br/>Competition regulators, meanwhile, are closing in on big (ad)tech's market power - and the conflicts of interest that arise from the \"vertically integrated chain of intermediaries\" which work to funnel the lion's share of digital ad spend into platform coffers. So it's not hard to conceive of an intervention to force market reform by breaking up Google's business empire - to separate the 'ad' bits from its other 'tech'.<br/>The self-interested forces that underpin surveillance capitalism made their fortunes when no one was really looking at how their methods exploit people's data. Now, with many more eyes trained on them, they are operating on borrowed time. It's no longer a question of whether change is coming. The sands are shifting, with platforms themselves now moving to limit access to third party tracking cookies.<br/>Savvy publishers would do well to get out ahead of the next round of platform power moves - and skate to where the puck's headed.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1261181</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-W9J1-JBYT-H205-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hopefully the ongoing crisis we are living through will take us to a new stage in the way we collaborate with the Internet.</p><p>1<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com\">https://www.facebook.com</url>/ help/302796099745838</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2087332724</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">26660ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T2X-7JF1-DYR7-805N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 10542337</issn><volume>Vol. 28</volume><issueNumber>No. 7</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 1, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Commentary</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So say concerned politicians and privacy advocates about a $2.1bn deal they fear signals Big Tech heading for a monopoly over our health information.</p><p>They want the deal blocked rather than give Google access to the heart rate, activity and sleep data of Fitbit's 27m users, as the search giant tries to catch up with Apple and its Watch in creating personalised health services. Hannah Kuchler reports regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have begun to look at whether a strong grip over data can play a part in competition cases against Big Tech companies. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition chief, said this month that dominance in data can make it hard for others to compete. From experiences on her <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Don't Be Evil</emphasis> book tour, Rana Foroohar reports that\u00a0the debate about digital rights, privacy and monopoly power is much more advanced in Britain than America.</p><p>Google is showing it can partially protect its users and control access to their data in another sphere. Richard Waters' latest Inside Business column looks at Google's announcement that it will no longer make it possible to direct political ads at\u00a0people based on their past voting record or demonstrated political leanings. The microtargeting carried out by political campaigns is not a free-speech issue, but withdraw a tool that has proved so powerful in amplifying political positions and the backlash that has now resulted from the decision\u00a0is predictable, he says.</p><p>The outrage over alleged gender bias against women in judging credit limits\u00a0for the Apple Card is less understandable, says Undercover Economist Tim Harford. Is the Apple Card actually sexist? he asks. \u201cOne definition of equal treatment for men and women would be that credit was extended equally to both, regardless of the fact that women tend to be paid less than men. Another would be that people with the same income got the same credit, regardless of gender. You might have spotted the problem: it\u2019s impossible to offer both forms of equal treatment simultaneously.\u201d</p><p>It was an algorithm that was making the judgments in this case and Tim says transparency is essential for our understanding of its reasoning: \u201cIn the case of algorithms, we should expect a clear and prominent explanation of how the algorithm is making its decision \u2014 and perhaps more importantly, we should expect independent experts to be able to assess the claims that are being made.\u201d</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.

In contrast, the\u00a0 Star Market \u00a0in Shanghai, positioned by top government officials as China\u2019s answer to Nasdaq, has featured more than 50 IPOs since\u00a0 its July launch. However, the IPO of\u00a0Megvii, the $4bn Chinese facial recognition company, now faces <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/chinese-ai-giant-is-said-to-face-hkex-queries-on-ipo-application\"> significant obstacles</url>, with the Hong Kong exchange pushing\u00a0back following Megvii's\u00a0blacklisting by the US government.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.

Proponents of the legislation, which will come into force in July,\u00a0say it is aimed at making it easier for people to use the foreign gadgets they buy.

These insights drive market readiness decisions and often lie at the crux of a product market strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as the technological revolutions of customer relationship management (CRM) tools and big data have changed how life sciences companies do business, machine-guided, predictive insights from that data are the industry's next big opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The future is here</p><p>According to Forbes, \"Big data is transforming businesses across industry sectors-from industrial systems to financial services, from media to healthcare delivery, from drug discovery to government services, from national security to professional sports.\"</p><p>In her annual 2017 \"state of technology\" presentation, Mary Meeker, the visionary Internet maven of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, dedicated 31 pages to digital health and called this moment \"the digital health inflection point.\" We are now looking at an industrial revolution that is driving a need for more sophisticated technologies to manage the intricacies of data commerce.</p><p>Similarly, a Bain &amp; Company report underlines the mastery of data and digital technologies as the distinguishing characteristic of the most competitive pharmaceutical companies in the next 10 years.</p><p>Furthermore, big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook are increasingly investing in healthcare. In fact, Bill Maris, a Google Ventures founder, left Google this year to raise a new investment fund of over $230 million that will focus solely on healthcare investments.</p><p>What's holding us back</p><p>The healthcare industry has been slow to adopt emerging technologies, but the cautious pace is understandable.</p><p>Healthcare companies create and manage exponentially-increasing amounts of highly sensitive data, and must be compliant with the laws and regulations that surround it. \"The healthcare industry has very stringent requirements around cryptographic security that dictates how and when the data needs to be encrypted, transmitted, and decrypted,\" writes Meeta Dash of the Tokbox Blog. \"The scope and complexity of healthcare regulation has made it incredibly difficult for organizations to adopt new technologies.\"</p><p>Add to that the changing stakeholder landscape of healthcare, which has become evermore complex. Traditionally, the industry catered to physicians- something that CRM software managed well. Field representative-generated data also helped to provide a more complete view of customers and markets for improved commercial and operational excellence. Yet, even as recently as 2016, according to an Econsultancy and Ogilvy CommonHealth report, up to 44% of biopharmaceutical companies said they were not prepared to use their CRM data in marketing campaigns.</p><p>Now, there are more stakeholders than just the physician; payers, prescribers, providers, provider networks, and patients are as relevant as physicians, and physicians' networks of influence are proving increasingly important in decision-making.</p><p>Changes in regulations and culture are also redefining what is meant by \"product value\" for life sciences companies; new treatments are no longer rated in terms of efficacy and cost alone, but also in terms of how well they address customer needs.</p><p>As healthcare organizations around the world grapple with increasing price pressures, emphasis on value-based pricing models is becoming more pronounced and providers are under pressure to do more with less as well. Pay-for-performance or value-based pricing agreements with healthcare providers and insurers-much like the one struck between Novartis and Aetna/Cigna early last year for heart drug Entresto-are becoming more commonplace and, in turn, holding greater sway over physician choice.</p><p>Additionally, segmented and sometimes siloed company divisions like market access or managed care are also quickly becoming essential sources (and consumers) of data for a more complete and holistic approach to \"go-to-market\" planning and execution.</p><p>To keep up with this growing stakeholder network, life sciences companies require access to deeper and more diverse data sets. They also need more complete, integrated, and crossenterprise technology solutions that can give them a broader view of the \"customer,\" with relationship and network analytics that provide a cohesive view of their market potential.</p><p>The tipping point</p><p>The first step for the healthcare industry was to digitize its existing banks of data, replacing analog and paper-based systems with digital versions. The data generated within a given organization then became easier to organize, analyze, and share.</p><p>The next step was to collect more data sources-in other words, it was time to put the word \"big\" in front of \"data,\" and to access more channels of information. According to a McKinsey &amp; Co. patient survey, nearly 70% of US consumers use an online channel to manage health and wellness, and patients can now access their own health records online and log important health data from their smartphones-simple actions that were previously unavailable. This democratization of healthcare information has returned incredible amounts of data to healthcare providers and the life sciences companies that work with them.</p><p>Patients are now connected instantly with disease-related information as well as online forums and communities. Meanwhile, apps and wearable technology are recording performance data based on lifestyle, selected symptoms, adherence, and overall well-being.</p><p>The result is that patients are more engaged than ever before with their treatment pathway, and frequently approach their physician with ideas and suggestions, making them another important influencing factor for a brand.</p><p>Key opinion leaders and healthcare professionals are also using digital technologies that produce real-time insights into customer relations, opinions, and patient needs. At the same time, however, it's still difficult to understand and set digital markers along the patient journey-including the increasingly complicated reimbursement journey-that align with a brand's digital strategy.</p><p>These activities all generate high-value data that can be used as a part of a complete brand strategy, and that can be integrated into that strategy for improved customer access and engagement. Now, life sciences companies need to more effectively manage new and existing data sets; to gather, compile, and analyze them in order to better understand how to deliver value for their product portfolio.</p><p>Tapping into these data sources and the insights they harbor is vital for life sciences firms to inform and transform their business operations. In order to remain relevant and align with customer values, they must leverage real-time data to make more agile and confident business decisions and predict future trends.</p><p>What's next</p><p>This technological adaptation in healthcare reflects our rapidly accelerating ability to adopt new digital solutions. A decade ago, smartphones didn't even exist and now more than half of the world's population uses one. Similarly, in those 10 years, over 80% of the US population now has at least one social media profile. The pace at which new technologies are created and adopted is redoubling again and again.</p><p>The next step is to take these massive datasets and put them to work. Having \"big data\" at our fingertips and knowing what to do with it is another story. Today, analysts still have to know which questions to ask of the data in order to gain any meaning from it. Shifting to machine-guided analytics means letting the data speak to us directly and suggest next-best steps. New technologies are less \"human-guided\" and more \"machine-guided,\" with predictive solutions increasing in importance. This is where life science companies' go-to-market efforts can benefit most dramatically, leveraging data intelligence platforms to guide a data-driven, insights-driven approach to customer engagement through all channels, including personal and non-personal.</p><p>The companies who are leading the way in digital transformation are equally focused on increasing their digital and analytic capabilities as well as on supporting these with strategy, culture, and organizational process. In order to be successful, a digital strategy must be embedded into all parts of the business, with customer engagement at the core, and the supporting technology being the means by which teams can holistically and cross-functionally execute to those initiatives.</p><p>With a coordinated, cross-enterprise plan to bring currently fragmented and siloed approaches to digitalization together, life sciences companies will get the market, medical, and customer insights they need to transform commercial success with speed and confidence. The implementation of a digital strategy for a brand needs to be a team effort. It is a complex process, involving many moving parts and departments (both internally and externally) and a fundamental switch in mindset around data and the benefits that this will bring to the business. To be effective, it requires the buy-in of every member of internal staff who will be working with, or adjacent to, the new system-and aligned support from the right external partners.</p><p>A signal of our industry's commitment to digital transformation is the increasing number of biopharma companies who now have senior leaders in place to lead these efforts-one in five of the top biopharma organizations, according to a McKinsey review of the top 25 global drugmakers. In fact, GlaxoSmithKline recently announced the appointment of a new senior position of chief digital and technology officer, recognizing the need to bring these initiatives to the highest level of senior management.</p><p>According to a recent survey from Marketo, almost 70% of all US marketers are planning to use predictive analytics as their primary strategic marketing technology this year. The life sciences industry knows it needs to change and move in a similar direction. A 2015 survey from PwC revealed that 65% of senior sales, marketing, and strategy pharma executives expected to see increased digital interactions within their commercial approach in the near future.</p><p>Healthcare companies have entered this new realm of analytics and insights, but so far have concentrated on clinical-centric initiatives. On the R&amp;D side of healthcare, digital technologies are already being deployed to improve the development and adherence of treatments. The commercial and brand side of life sciences companies now has that same exciting opportunity to adopt new technologies to rapidly evolve and accelerate goto-market-the likes of which we haven't seen since the advent of CRM in the early 1990s.</p><p>Commercial teams, for example, can now get real-time alerts on anything from a formulary status change to a drop in prescribing patterns for their target customers. As life sciences brand teams begin to adopt these innovative technology solutions, they will see noteworthy improvements in customer and market engagement as well as improved collaboration between sales and marketing for optimized strategy planning and execution.</p><p>Medical affairs teams also benefit from this digital transformation, where data and insightsdriven medical education programs improve product launch in an atmosphere that values scientific education over sales pitches.</p><p>Are you ready?</p><p>New digital technologies give everyone access to the art of data science. They transform advanced analytics into everyday insights so that commercial teams can stay one step ahead of customers and operate seamlessly with internal teams for improved brand success.</p><p>Now is the time for biopharma and medical device/ diagnostic companies to take the next crucial step to adopting innovative technology platforms; platforms that manage and integrate multiple and diverse data sources, in varied and disparate formats, and that produce predictive analytics, powered by domain expertise, to produce relevant, real-time, and actionable insights.</p><p>Welcome to the new inflection point in life sciences-the age of big data has now become the age of predictive insights.</p><p>Changes in regulations and culture are redefining what is meant by \"product value\" for life sciences companies; new treatments are no longer rated in terms of efficacy and cost alone, but also in terms of how well they address customer needs</p><p>Having \"big data\" at our fingertips and knowing what to do with it is another story</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHAEXE-1948911238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHAEXE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-YGM1-JBHT-D2WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316210</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2144\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 UBM Americas Sep 2017</copyright><publicationName>Pharmaceutical Executive</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 02796570</issn><volume>Vol. 37</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 1, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

These insights drive market readiness decisions and often lie at the crux of a product market strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as the technological revolutions of customer relationship management (CRM) tools and big data have changed how life sciences companies do business, machine-guided, predictive insights from that data are the industry's next big opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The future is here</p><p>According to Forbes, \"Big data is transforming businesses across industry sectors-from industrial systems to financial services, from media to healthcare delivery, from drug discovery to government services, from national security to professional sports.\"</p><p>In her annual 2017 \"state of technology\" presentation, Mary Meeker, the visionary Internet maven of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, dedicated 31 pages to digital health and called this moment \"the digital health inflection point.\" We are now looking at an industrial revolution that is driving a need for more sophisticated technologies to manage the intricacies of data commerce.</p><p>Similarly, a Bain &amp; Company report underlines the mastery of data and digital technologies as the distinguishing characteristic of the most competitive pharmaceutical companies in the next 10 years.</p><p>Furthermore, big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook are increasingly investing in healthcare. In fact, Bill Maris, a Google Ventures founder, left Google this year to raise a new investment fund of over $230 million that will focus solely on healthcare investments.</p><p>What's holding us back</p><p>The healthcare industry has been slow to adopt emerging technologies, but the cautious pace is understandable.</p><p>Healthcare companies create and manage exponentially-increasing amounts of highly sensitive data, and must be compliant with the laws and regulations that surround it. \"The healthcare industry has very stringent requirements around cryptographic security that dictates how and when the data needs to be encrypted, transmitted, and decrypted,\" writes Meeta Dash of the Tokbox Blog. \"The scope and complexity of healthcare regulation has made it incredibly difficult for organizations to adopt new technologies.\"</p><p>Add to that the changing stakeholder landscape of healthcare, which has become evermore complex. Traditionally, the industry catered to physicians- something that CRM software managed well. Field representative-generated data also helped to provide a more complete view of customers and markets for improved commercial and operational excellence. Yet, even as recently as 2016, according to an Econsultancy and Ogilvy CommonHealth report, up to 44% of biopharmaceutical companies said they were not prepared to use their CRM data in marketing campaigns.</p><p>Now, there are more stakeholders than just the physician; payers, prescribers, providers, provider networks, and patients are as relevant as physicians, and physicians' networks of influence are proving increasingly important in decision-making.</p><p>Changes in regulations and culture are also redefining what is meant by \"product value\" for life sciences companies; new treatments are no longer rated in terms of efficacy and cost alone, but also in terms of how well they address customer needs.</p><p>As healthcare organizations around the world grapple with increasing price pressures, emphasis on value-based pricing models is becoming more pronounced and providers are under pressure to do more with less as well. Pay-for-performance or value-based pricing agreements with healthcare providers and insurers-much like the one struck between Novartis and Aetna/Cigna early last year for heart drug Entresto-are becoming more commonplace and, in turn, holding greater sway over physician choice.</p><p>Additionally, segmented and sometimes siloed company divisions like market access or managed care are also quickly becoming essential sources (and consumers) of data for a more complete and holistic approach to \"go-to-market\" planning and execution.</p><p>To keep up with this growing stakeholder network, life sciences companies require access to deeper and more diverse data sets. They also need more complete, integrated, and crossenterprise technology solutions that can give them a broader view of the \"customer,\" with relationship and network analytics that provide a cohesive view of their market potential.</p><p>The tipping point</p><p>The first step for the healthcare industry was to digitize its existing banks of data, replacing analog and paper-based systems with digital versions. The data generated within a given organization then became easier to organize, analyze, and share.</p><p>The next step was to collect more data sources-in other words, it was time to put the word \"big\" in front of \"data,\" and to access more channels of information. According to a McKinsey &amp; Co. patient survey, nearly 70% of US consumers use an online channel to manage health and wellness, and patients can now access their own health records online and log important health data from their smartphones-simple actions that were previously unavailable. This democratization of healthcare information has returned incredible amounts of data to healthcare providers and the life sciences companies that work with them.</p><p>Patients are now connected instantly with disease-related information as well as online forums and communities. Meanwhile, apps and wearable technology are recording performance data based on lifestyle, selected symptoms, adherence, and overall well-being.</p><p>The result is that patients are more engaged than ever before with their treatment pathway, and frequently approach their physician with ideas and suggestions, making them another important influencing factor for a brand.</p><p>Key opinion leaders and healthcare professionals are also using digital technologies that produce real-time insights into customer relations, opinions, and patient needs. At the same time, however, it's still difficult to understand and set digital markers along the patient journey-including the increasingly complicated reimbursement journey-that align with a brand's digital strategy.</p><p>These activities all generate high-value data that can be used as a part of a complete brand strategy, and that can be integrated into that strategy for improved customer access and engagement. Now, life sciences companies need to more effectively manage new and existing data sets; to gather, compile, and analyze them in order to better understand how to deliver value for their product portfolio.</p><p>Tapping into these data sources and the insights they harbor is vital for life sciences firms to inform and transform their business operations. In order to remain relevant and align with customer values, they must leverage real-time data to make more agile and confident business decisions and predict future trends.</p><p>What's next</p><p>This technological adaptation in healthcare reflects our rapidly accelerating ability to adopt new digital solutions. A decade ago, smartphones didn't even exist and now more than half of the world's population uses one. Similarly, in those 10 years, over 80% of the US population now has at least one social media profile. The pace at which new technologies are created and adopted is redoubling again and again.</p><p>The next step is to take these massive datasets and put them to work. Having \"big data\" at our fingertips and knowing what to do with it is another story. Today, analysts still have to know which questions to ask of the data in order to gain any meaning from it. Shifting to machine-guided analytics means letting the data speak to us directly and suggest next-best steps. New technologies are less \"human-guided\" and more \"machine-guided,\" with predictive solutions increasing in importance. This is where life science companies' go-to-market efforts can benefit most dramatically, leveraging data intelligence platforms to guide a data-driven, insights-driven approach to customer engagement through all channels, including personal and non-personal.</p><p>The companies who are leading the way in digital transformation are equally focused on increasing their digital and analytic capabilities as well as on supporting these with strategy, culture, and organizational process. In order to be successful, a digital strategy must be embedded into all parts of the business, with customer engagement at the core, and the supporting technology being the means by which teams can holistically and cross-functionally execute to those initiatives.</p><p>With a coordinated, cross-enterprise plan to bring currently fragmented and siloed approaches to digitalization together, life sciences companies will get the market, medical, and customer insights they need to transform commercial success with speed and confidence. The implementation of a digital strategy for a brand needs to be a team effort. It is a complex process, involving many moving parts and departments (both internally and externally) and a fundamental switch in mindset around data and the benefits that this will bring to the business. To be effective, it requires the buy-in of every member of internal staff who will be working with, or adjacent to, the new system-and aligned support from the right external partners.</p><p>A signal of our industry's commitment to digital transformation is the increasing number of biopharma companies who now have senior leaders in place to lead these efforts-one in five of the top biopharma organizations, according to a McKinsey review of the top 25 global drugmakers. In fact, GlaxoSmithKline recently announced the appointment of a new senior position of chief digital and technology officer, recognizing the need to bring these initiatives to the highest level of senior management.</p><p>According to a recent survey from Marketo, almost 70% of all US marketers are planning to use predictive analytics as their primary strategic marketing technology this year. The life sciences industry knows it needs to change and move in a similar direction. A 2015 survey from PwC revealed that 65% of senior sales, marketing, and strategy pharma executives expected to see increased digital interactions within their commercial approach in the near future.</p><p>Healthcare companies have entered this new realm of analytics and insights, but so far have concentrated on clinical-centric initiatives. On the R&amp;D side of healthcare, digital technologies are already being deployed to improve the development and adherence of treatments. The commercial and brand side of life sciences companies now has that same exciting opportunity to adopt new technologies to rapidly evolve and accelerate goto-market-the likes of which we haven't seen since the advent of CRM in the early 1990s.</p><p>Commercial teams, for example, can now get real-time alerts on anything from a formulary status change to a drop in prescribing patterns for their target customers. As life sciences brand teams begin to adopt these innovative technology solutions, they will see noteworthy improvements in customer and market engagement as well as improved collaboration between sales and marketing for optimized strategy planning and execution.</p><p>Medical affairs teams also benefit from this digital transformation, where data and insightsdriven medical education programs improve product launch in an atmosphere that values scientific education over sales pitches.</p><p>Are you ready?</p><p>New digital technologies give everyone access to the art of data science. They transform advanced analytics into everyday insights so that commercial teams can stay one step ahead of customers and operate seamlessly with internal teams for improved brand success.</p><p>Now is the time for biopharma and medical device/ diagnostic companies to take the next crucial step to adopting innovative technology platforms; platforms that manage and integrate multiple and diverse data sources, in varied and disparate formats, and that produce predictive analytics, powered by domain expertise, to produce relevant, real-time, and actionable insights.</p><p>Welcome to the new inflection point in life sciences-the age of big data has now become the age of predictive insights.</p><p>Changes in regulations and culture are redefining what is meant by \"product value\" for life sciences companies; new treatments are no longer rated in terms of efficacy and cost alone, but also in terms of how well they address customer needs</p><p>Having \"big data\" at our fingertips and knowing what to do with it is another story</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHAEXE-1948911238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHAEXE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PP4-D3K1-JBHT-D0GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316210</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2144\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 UBM Americas Sep 2017</copyright><publicationName>Pharmaceutical Executive</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 02796570</issn><volume>Vol. 37</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 1, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Figuring out what it means, however, is hard. Banks are in possession of unprecedented volumes of data of various types, and the only way to make sense of it all is with metadata-data that describes other data, thus allowing information to be identified, discovered and stored so that analysts can unlock meaning. To put it another way: without metadata, Big Data is unmanageable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you skip the metadata part, you will have problems and be overwhelmed by the size of the data,\" states Zhiwei Jiang, global head of insights and data for financial services at Capgemini. \"It's one of the main reasons that banks do not derive the most useful insights out of the massive data they've been holding and storing.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With customer-transaction data, consumer-location data and all the data around the Internet of Things, metadata helps streamline collection, aid integration and enable analysis of Big Data. Jiang suggests three areas of technology tooling required for metadata management.</p><p>The first is exploration (i.e., how you discover the data), and this is made possible with a good set of open-source tools along with vended ones to get data organized.</p><p>The next set of tools is for data storage, including Apache Hadoop, the open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. Released in April 2006, Hadoop provides massive storage for any kind of data. With enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks, it removes both storage and processing constraints. Jiang says there are lot of start-ups and advanced Hadoop vendors developing data ingestion tools to help index data in a more organized way.</p><p>By providing a consistent approach-and tools that sit on top of a wide range of differing Big Data technologies-Informatica, a data software and services company, helped Russia's Tinkoff Bank integrate and analyze huge volumes of structured and semistructured Big Data for rapid decision-making while working with both emerging technologies and traditional data management infrastructures. \"Utilizing Informatica's Big Data Management, [Tinkoff] integrated multiple types of data on Hadoop,\" says Andrew Joss, Informatica's head of industry consulting for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \"They [thereby] improved marketing effectiveness, leading in some cases to a tenfold increase in conversion rates.\"</p><p>After data discovery and data storage, the next step is analysis. \"In today's world, where all these wonderful innovations, are happening with Big Data and AI [artificial intelligence], the same three simple steps: data recovery or discovery, storage, and analytics, run to the core,\" Jiang says. \"In order to analyze, you need to know how to organize your offerings and work out their value and function. If you want to look, for example, to see if a customer wants a mortgage with the bank, you need the metadata around both the customer and the mortgage.\"</p><p>Michael Zerbs, chief technology officer at Scotiabank, agrees there are a variety of effective and reliable tools allowing banks to leverage metadata and automate data lineage information. He says banks should establish a single enterprise business glossary and logical data model to describe each business group and its role within the organization, and each consumer domain (e.g., account customer). \"Once defined, you are able to create models to describe and track the data as it evolves. Without these, automation is unreliable. The models come before the tools.\"</p><p>He says Scotiabank uses many tools to support DevOps (deep collaboration between software developers and IT operations) and an agile-based environment (in \"agile software development,\" requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration of cross-functional teams, bottom-up rather than top-down). \"Also, we are developing capabilities related to automated code development, testing, metadata management and data governance,\" he says. \"The data-governance tools are instrumental in providing the business with direct access to quality, privacy and data-value extraction and management controls.\"</p><p>For Informatica's Joss, banks need to go even further to ensure that intelligent data management processes cover the entire organization. \"They won't be able to generate useful insights if data from different departments remain separate-actionable information is based on companywide data. Not only that, but in order to conduct analysis quickly, it's essential to have all your data at your fingertips whenever you need them. An agile business must ensure that its data assets are available at the drop of a hat.\"</p><h>LEVERAGING LINEAGE</h><p>To achieve this, Joss says banks should first map out their information landscape, ensuring that their data management systems have insight into every area of the business. \"Then they should consider [designing] their business [IT] around unified management policies and processes. Finally, creating a single view of the key data assets across the organization will start to unlock the value of the underlying data,\" he explains. \"Taken together, these capabilities will improve the trustworthiness of any insights generated.\"</p><p>He also stresses the importance of clean data: \"Automated management systems can help ensure that duplicates, false information and outdated entries are removed, and that the data is presented in a unified format for rapid digestion.\"</p><p>Scotiabank has made great progress on a long journey to improve Big Data capability. \"We continue to do more to assess, organize and report on legacy data more effectively to add business and customer value,\" states Zerbs, highlighting a major shift occurring in the convergence of operational and analytical data sources. \"Today, with event sourcing and data streaming, every transaction is both an event and a data point in a larger analytical dataset capable of providing real-time insight. Creating platforms that embrace this convergence rather than separate [the elements of it] is a very promising area of investment.\" This real-time processing of events creates opportunities to personalize customer engagement. In future, data streaming could lead to preemptive analytics.</p><p>Among transformational initiatives relating to data, he cites the ability to meet regulatory Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting (RDARR) requirements that were leveraged into a strategic business initiative to create a strong foundation for advanced analytical insights. \"Data lineage is an important part of this initiative, and today it drives a number of advanced analytics use cases,\" says Zerbs. \"Specifically, we have developed network analytics that identify relationships and payment flows with corporate and commercial customers. And lastly, we have enabled a customer-level view of all the products, channels and transactions among all their relationships in the bank.\"</p><p>Zerbs sees the ability to graph transaction sources and targets that support the \"discovery'\" of long paths of transactions between multiple parties that turn out to be a single entity a major benefit of these programs. \"Within a single enterprise, this shows the massive power of correct identification of data as well as a practical visualization of lineage as it applies to AML [anti-money laundering], fraud, etc.\"</p><p>In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force in May 2018. \"GDPR requires companies to give consumers greater control over how their data is stored and used, and noncompliance comes at the price of hefty fines. A comprehensive data management strategy will give businesses the insight they need to ensure that data is responsibly and securely handled, as well as the ability to provide customers with up-to-date information on request. In turn, this will help to build stronger customer relationships, ultimately driving more revenue, as well as helping to appease the regulators,\" says Informatica's Joss.</p><p>Banks lagging behind the data curve are in serious trouble-as they know they are in breach of GDPR, says Jiang. \"The challenge for laggers is they don't know where to start, and they don't start in the right way. Then the whole process becomes inefficient, with lots of errors and overprocessing. In global finance terms, it's the adjustment process, where producing quarterly reports makes the whole process very inefficient.\"</p><h>WHERE BUSINESS MEETS TECH</h><p>While most large banks created chief data officer (CDO) roles four or five years ago, Jiang urgently advises smaller banks to create a CDO and set up metadata functions. He also stresses the importance of looking at data for both business and technology issue: \"Banks need a very comprehensive end-to-end data strategy. On one side you have the business people all wearing nice suits, and on the other are the technology people in khaki pants and T-shirts. The IT guys will think about a data source and how to mingle the mobile data with [other data] and sew them together, while the business guys are thinking about how to get the cross-sell right.\"</p><p>Describing the ideal chief marketing officer (CMO) as someone who wears a suit over a T-shirt, Jiang says a data-driven CMO will work out the data sources needed for a specific outcome and then ask IT guys to merge them together. \"Banks need a comprehensive data surge from both ends [business and technology],\" he explains, \"and to let them converge, creating a harmonious data strategy.\" Zerbs agrees: \"Organizations require both business and technology partners at the table to clearly define a shared vision, objectives, aspirational goals and a method to implement and measure them. They must continuously support each other and model what success looks like.\"</p><p>Jiang believes the few banks making good use of data are modeling their success on big tech, e.g., Google and Apple, rather than on other banks, saying, \"Google knows more about you than you know yourself-because it's been learning all your behavior.\" Like big tech, several banks have made data and AI core innovation areas. \"AI will be more successful than [it has been in] previous generations,\" notes Jiang, \"because it will be data-driven, and the core enabler for data-driven AI is metadata.\"</p><p>He does not advocate machine over human, however. \"Everyone should be a data scientist-even customer reps and bank tellers,\" he says. \"Data is quite difficult because it is a unique asset, so you want to make sure that a lot of the leaders on the business and technology sides are also data thought-leaders-they need to know how to make journeys better and how to make money out of it.\"</p><p>Banks that fail to implement strong data management will find themselves left behind. \"In the connected age, data is the lifeblood of good business,\" says Joss at Informatica. \"Those that ignore it are putting themselves at a disadvantage-it's essential to extract intelligence from your data assets to retain the loyalty of an increasingly demanding customer base.\" And that is why metadata matters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jiang, Capgemini:</emphasis> In order to analyze, you need to know how to organize your offerings and work out their value and function.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo 2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joss, Informatica:</emphasis> It's essential to extract intelligence from your data assets.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo 3, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zerbs, Scotiabank:</emphasis> Organizations require both business and technology partners to clearly define a shared vision, objectives, aspirational goals and a method to implement them.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GFMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GFMAG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S53-8PC1-DYRW-V4D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297150</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1837\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Global Finance Media, Inc.

The firms sell their scoring services to major businesses across the U.S. economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People with low scores can suffer harsh consequences.</p><p>CoreLogic and TransUnion say that scores they peddle to landlords can predict whether a potential tenant will pay the rent on time, be able to \"absorb rent increases,\" or break a lease. Large employers use HireVue, a firm that generates an \"employability\" score about candidates by analyzing \"tens of thousands of factors,\" including a person's facial expressions and voice intonations. Other employers use Cornerstone's score, which considers where a job prospect lives and which web browser they use to judge how successful they will be at a job.</p><p>Brand-name retailers purchase \"risk scores\" from Retail Equation to help make judgments about whether consumers commit fraud when they return goods for refunds. Players in the gig economy use outside firms such as Sift to score consumers' \"overall trustworthiness.\" Wireless customers predicted to be less profitable are sometimes forced to endure longer customer service hold times.</p><p>Auto insurers raise premiums based on scores calculated using information from smartphone apps that track driving styles. Large analytics firms monitor whether we are likely to take our medication based on our propensity to refill our prescriptions; pharmaceutical companies, health-care providers and insurance companies can use those scores to, among other things, \"match the right patient investment level to the right patients.\"</p><p>Surveillance scoring is the product of two trends. First is the rampant (and mostly unregulated) collection of every intimate detail about our lives, amassed by the nanosecond from smartphones to cars, toasters to toys. This fire hose of data - most of which we surrender voluntarily - includes our demographics, income, facial characteristics, the sound of our voice, our precise location, shopping history, medical conditions, genetic information, what we search for on the Internet, the websites we visit, when we read an email, what apps we use and how long we use them, and how often we sleep, exercise and the like.</p><p>The second trend driving these scores is the arrival of technologies able to instantaneously crunch this data: exponentially more powerful computers and high-speed communications systems such as 5G, which lead to the scoring algorithms that use artificial intelligence to rate all of us in some way.</p><p>The result: automated decisions, based on each consumer's unique score, that are, as a practical matter, irreversible.</p><p>That's because the entire process - the scores themselves, as well as the data upon which they are based - is concealed from us. It is mostly impossible to know when one has become the casualty of a score, let alone whether a score is inaccurate, outdated or the product of biased or discriminatory code programmed by a faceless software engineer. There is no appeal.</p><p>Surveillance scoring bears a faint resemblance to credit scoring in the 1960s. In that pre-computer era, private investigators working for banks, retailers and insurance companies tailed consumers and scoured newspapers for information about arrests, promotions, sexual orientation, drinking habits and cleanliness to decide a consumer's creditworthiness -- until Congress established rules in the 1970s giving consumers the right to review and question their credit scores.</p><p>Today's data snoops obtain infinitely more information about their targets, and in real time. And the impact of surveillance scoring is far more pernicious.</p><p>The tech industry insists that its every advance improves our lives. But that's a myth. Surveillance scoring enables companies to cloak old-school discrimination in an aura of technological infallibility and wonder.</p><p>Secret surveillance scores create micro-markets in which some consumers are no longer welcome. They divide Americans into \"haves\" and \"have-nots,\" with the losers relegated to the status of second-class citizens.</p><p>Consumers need a 21st-century solution to this emergent threat. Congress, awash in tech money, is mired in an outdated legal paradigm: \"disclosure\" of privacy policies and \"consent\" via a click. No one pretends that these industrial age contract law concepts will do anything to curb data larceny, let alone regulate or bar secret surveillance scores.</p><p>We petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and regulate surveillance scoring. The commission's response? A blog post urging the firms that develop and apply scores to regulate themselves.</p><p>This is only the latest example of Washington's capitulation to the tech industry, whose continuous loop of privacy violations, abject apologies and payment of inconsequential penalties confirms that consumers cannot rely on the federal government for protection.</p><p>Secret surveillance scoring places us at the precipice of the \"singularity,\" a dystopian turning point after which machines will make judgments about humans that will determine our fate. We either seize control of our future, or risk losing it.</p><p>             Read more:</p><p>Jeff Bezos: How did tech CEOs do on Capitol Hill?

The more companies know about their users, the more competitive they are in the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Custom-tailored capitalism is what has made Google, Facebook, Amazon and others the richest companies in the world. This profit incentive has turned big tech into a competitive field of mass intelligence gathering. The better and more comprehensive the data, the higher profits will be.</p><p> But this business model - what I consider spying machines - has enormous potential to violate civil liberties.</p><p> Big tech's spy machines</p><p> Current news is rife with examples of data abuses. In April, NBC News broke a story detailing how Face-book CEO Mark Zuckerberg had used data gathered by the platform to support his friends and defeat his rivals.</p><p> This is not Facebook's first privacy PR nightmare. In 2018, data firm Cambridge Analytica used a Facebook app to collect data profiles of over 87 million people, which was later used to distribute targeted political advertising during elections.</p><p>Facebook is not alone in the data collection boom. This May, it was revealed that Snapchat employees were using the app's data to obtain location data, pictures and email addresses without users' consent. A new book by former Harvard business professor Shoshana Zuboff goes into great detail of the practices of what she calls \"surveil-lance capitalism.\" Zuboff writes, \"Once we searched Google. Now, Google searches us.\"</p><p> The practice goes beyond someone's taste in music or what they purchase on Amazon. Apps created to help people through mental illness or quit smoking sell data to big tech companies. These users could be potential targets for social stigmatization or targeted advertising that exacerbates heath problems rather than solving them.</p><p> In December, The New York Times published an expos\u00e9 on what one can learn about someone using their collated data from apps and smartphones. By blending location tracking with other online behavior, researchers were able to put together a detailed portrait of the most intimate details of users' lives, such as where their children go to school or who was cheating on their diet. They could even tell which area of a nuclear power plant an individual worked in - information that is typically classified.</p><p> Because of these revelations, data that big tech collects poses a national security problem. One open source researcher used data from Strava, a fitness app, to map U.S. military bases around the world as soldiers tracked their runs. Our devices are constantly telling companies where we are and what we are doing.</p><p> For the worst-case scenarios, look abroad</p><p> Big tech is a highly unregulated sector of the economy. Existing regulations have struggled to keep up with a rapidly innovating tech sector. In some scenarios, big tech's capabilities are being used by dictators to craft a dystopian digital reality.</p><p> Autocratic governments around the world have already begun to use emerging technology to violate human rights. China is a prime example. China integrates AI, biometric data and online activity to track and monitor dissidents and members of ethnic minority communities, who are then sent to reeducation camps.</p><p> From my time researching the ways Russia uses these platforms to threaten democracy, I am familiar with the worst-case scenarios of big tech's capabilities. Because platforms' success is predicated on making information go viral, the most successful content can also be some of the most divisive.</p><p> If Russian attacks on social media are combined with AI technology, information attacks could become precision-guided. Nefarious actors could gather the comprehensive profiles that surveillance capitalism has compiled over the years. Fake news would then no longer speak to issues but to individuals, appealing to what makes the user change their mind.</p><p> If a monopolistic tech company decided to fully embrace its capacity to spy on its users and leverage that data to a personal or political end, the consequences for democracy could be catastrophic. Americans got a taste of what an influence attack looks like during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. So long as big tech remains largely unregulated, future influence attacks on American elections will become only more potent.</p><p> Big tech isn't going anywhere</p><p> A surface-level solution to this privacy dilemma would be for people to decouple their online lives from these companies.</p><p> For example, DuckDuckGo is an alternative search engine that does not compile user data and promises total privacy. A new browser, Brave, has promised to pay users back for selling data to advertisers.</p><p> However, these products are nowhere near as useful for a casual internet user than Google. Simply choosing not to use Google is not that simple.</p><p> While there are many different companies in question, they all hold near-monopolistic control over their corner of the market. Amazon dominates online shopping. Facebook dominates interacting with friends and causes. Google dominates web browsing.</p><p> Individuals are thus faced with a choice: Radically change their lifestyle and how they interact with the world, or continue to be the target of big tech's spy machines.</p><p> Oversight and regulation may seem dramatic and anti-growth at the moment, but I believe that it is a necessary check on big tech - before the worst of its potentials come true.</p><p> Chase Johnson is a research associate at the Frank Church Institute, Boise State University School of Public Service.

It is also challenging antitrust regulators' ability to investigate competition issues, because today's antitrust laws don't specifically address data dynamics.Driving the news: Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, in a speech[1] Friday at an antitrust conference in Cambridge, Mass., said that the way tech firms amass data could raise concerns about competition. The DOJ is conducting an antitrust review of big tech companies, and Delrahim told the crowd that includes studying the role data plays in market power. </p><p>Context: The amount of data Google will collect in its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit is already drawing the attention of privacy advocates and competition enforcers. European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said deals that involve combining user data will get a close look because of their potential to hamper competition or create privacy issues, in response to questions about the Google deal at the Web Summit in Lisbon last week, according to Bloomberg[2].Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the organization will oppose the deal in part because of privacy issues. (Google has said it will not use Fitbit data for ads.)EPIC is also urging lawmakers to press the FTC on data collection in merger reviews ahead of a House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing Wednesday with Delrahim and FTC Chairman Joe Simons.In a statement for Axios, subcommittee chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said, \"The immense amount of data that dominant firms have collected has given them a tremendous advantage over potential competitors whose ability to attract investment and compete effectively often depends on their access to data.\" Yes, but: Fitbit is not the dominant player in the wearables health device market \u2014 that honor goes to the Apple Watch. Google and Fitbit also do not closely compete in the market, so Google's entry doesn't really eliminate competition between the two, but instead could pose a stronger competitive threat to Apple. More broadly, experts question whether antitrust laws are the right tool to remedy concerns about growing data collection. \"The enforcers see these companies getting big, they see them accumulating lots of personal data and they don't have a statutory framework to analyze or investigate that in the privacy realm, so they are borrowing from the antitrust realm, and it's a bad fit,\" said Joel Mitnick, an antitrust lawyer with Cadwalader, Wickersham ...ft.\"The only thing you can say in the antitrust realm in regard to companies' increasing possession of data is 'big is bad,' and 'big is bad' is a disreputable antitrust principle and has been for decades.\"Joel MitnickIn Europe, Vestager, who now has expanded regulatory powers, may impose new rules on tech companies' data use, per a Reuters report[3].'If we want to define the market, to set out what's acceptable and what isn't, then what we need is not more competition enforcement. We need regulation,\" she said, according to the report.The EU's General Data Protection Regulation includes a hefty fine for privacy violations to create an incentive structure around privacy that would be as punitive as competition violations. Meanwhile, Congress is looking at new data portability[4] legislation as a way to boost competition in the tech industry by allowing users to take information like friends lists from one platform to another. Democratic Sens. Mark Warner (Va.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) introduced a bill last month that would require social media companies to provide a way for customers to move their personal information to another platform.Rules requiring phone companies to allow customers to keep their number when switching providers are credited with increasing competition among wireless carriers.But that approach might be a tougher fit for personal information on digital platforms, where there's no standard format of exchange.

As we use their platforms, the corporate giants are collecting information about every aspect of our lives, our behaviour and our decision-making. All of that data gives them tremendous power. And that power begets more power, and more profit.</p><p>On one hand, the data can be used to make their tools and services better, which is good for consumers. These companies are able to learn what we want based on the way we use their products, and can adjust them in response to those needs.</p><p>\"It enables certain companies with orders of magnitude more surveillance capacity than rivals to develop a 360-degree view of the strengths and vulnerabilities of their suppliers, competitors and customers,\" says Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland and author of Black Box Society.</p><p>Access to such sweeping amounts of data also allows these giants to spot trends early and move on them, which sometimes involves buying up a smaller company before it can become a competitive threat. Pasquale points out that Google/Alphabet has been using its power \"to bully or take over rivals and adjacent businesses\" at a rate of about \"one per week since 2010.\"</p><p>But it's not just newer or smaller tech companies that are at risk, says Taplin. \"When Google and Facebook control 88 per cent of all new internet advertising, the rest of the internet economy, including things like online journalism and music, are starved for resources.\"</p><p>Traditionally, this is where the antitrust regulators would step in, but in the data economy it's not so easy. What we're seeing for the first time is a clash between the concept of the nation state and these global, borderless corporations. A handful of tech giants now surpass the size and power of many governments.</p><p>For comparison sake, Facebook has almost two billion users, while Canada has a population of just over 36 million. Based on the companies' sheer scale alone, it is increasingly difficult for countries to enforce any kind of regulation, especially as the tech giants start pushing for rules that free them from local restrictions, says Open Media's Meghan Sali.</p><p>\"Take, for example, NAFTA, where big tech companies are pushing to include legislation that stops countries from making rules that require the local storage of data,\" Sali says. \"When data is stored in Canada, it's a lot easier to legislate its uses and address privacy concerns.\"</p><p>That's just one way economic considerations are taking precedence over consumer protection.</p><p>Pasquale adds that regulators would \"certainly be able to intervene effectively\" if they had more resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201d money, personnel and technical capacity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with which to level the playing field. \"And very simple interventions could help enormously \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for example, requiring any dominant platform to pay out as wages or other compensation some percentage of revenues.\"</p><p>'We need the political will'</p><p>Sali also points out the similarities between the global dominance of the big five and the stranglehold of Canada's three major internet service providers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Bell, Rogers and Telus \u00e2\u20ac\u201d whose dominance of the domestic market has kept out competitors and led to Canadians paying some of the highest prices for wireless internet access in the world.</p><p>\"When we look at the price of data and the amount of money that's being made by big companies by reselling that data, it's certainly comparable to oil in that manner,\" she says. \"But it's a little bit different in that data isn't a finite resource. At the end of the day, we can certainly create more data, whereas we can't create more oil.\"</p><p>Government could also help by managing crucial parts of the data economy as public infrastructure \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a measure that has seen great success through the Community Broadband initiative, whereby government subsidies have helped build local fiber optic networks.</p><p>In other words, if the Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is going to claim that every Canadian has a right to high-speed internet, then perhaps network infrastructure should be treated like roads and highways and bridges, as opposed to resting it in the hands of corporate giants.</p><p>There are ways to rein in these mega-corporations, Taplin says.</p><p>\"We just need the political will,\" he says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBC-cbcstory1.4259677</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PB8-R3D1-F07J-T1PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305992</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><timeReceived>11:28 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Split into 10 categories, each trend delivers a snapshot of movements so far, while explaining why brands and marketers should pay attention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From complex cocktails and digital spas, to subscription insurance and scientific expeditions, \"The Future 100\" predicts 2020 will usher in an era that's realistic yet imaginative at the same time, leveraged by tech innovation and a redefined experience for shoppers on the high street. The report highlights insights and fresh takes on the year ahead and beyond. The report's 10 trend segments include culture, tech and innovation, travel and hospitality, brands and marketing, food and drink, beauty, retail, luxury, health and finance.</p><p>Data is under the microscope and this is affecting all industries with the trustworthiness of a brand now tied to the way it uses consumer data and how transparent its terms and conditions are, Emma Chiu, global director, Wunderman Thompson Intelligence, opined. Rules and regulations are slowly being implemented to protect consumers, and brands are racing to ensure they are using personal data responsibly. \"A real cultural change has taken place, with purpose and transparency leading customer loyalty, while imagination is trumping data for consumer appeal. Consumers have laid the foundations for change and now forward-thinking brands are working towards building an optimistic and reassuring future for all. 'The Future 100' is a way of keeping up with the big shifts and smaller fast-moving trends, offering marketers an opportunity to get ahead,\" she added.</p><p>According to the report, companies are urging the consumers to look forward towards an optimistic future as unsettling political, economic and environmental times have left consumers feeling anxious. From Pantone's Flame Scarlet red shade for spring/summer 2020 to Lego's challenge to \"rebuild the world,\" forward-thinking companies are brightening the gloom with a realistic and optimistic outlook. Along with delivering an optimistic outlook, brands are focusing on ensuring real sustainable business plans and carbon-neutral policies and are transparent about their responsibilities. As climate positive brands will not only build trust but also earn customer loyalty as consumers get wise to environmental impacts.</p><p>2019 saw a shift in openness around traditional taboos and gender straitjackets in Asia. This is initiating a fresh approach to the market. Supported by technology and rapid economic development, attitudes to mental health, sexual health and gender are on the path to break the taboos. On the other hand, experiential shopping has entered the beauty space especially for today's consumers who still prefer to try out and buy cosmetics in store. Spotting the trend, beauty brands are developing a veritable playground of experiences and reimagining the beauty counter as a destination where consumers can spend time playing and, of course, purchasing.</p><p>The report also revealed that 2020 is going to be a privacy era as once seen as an aid to consumers, data collection is now viewed as underhanded and unethical, with consumers at breaking point amid frequent and severe data breaches. 2019 initiatives were the first step on a path to redemption for some brands and the idea that consumers can control their own data is becoming a clear possibility.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THFIEX-0051299257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THFIEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y10-7NR1-DXMP-K3KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365020</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000205</classCode><className>BRANDING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

At almost the same time, Facebook announced that a massive data breach had affected almost 50 million users. This odd fluke of timing illustrates the perilous nature of data protection right now. </p><p>Because of data breaches at Facebook and countless other leading companies, consumers areunderstandably wary[1]about how much of their personal data is being tracked and stored. These fears were stoked after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, as it became clear that personal data was being used for far more than just targeted advertising. Better protections are something that consumers are beginning to prioritize and demand, but until just recently big tech has controlled the conversation. The aforementioned Senate hearing was just the most recent time that companies like Google and Microsoft have had to appear before Congress. Thus far legislators have taken a hands-off approach to data protection, but that position is quickly changing. As more of life has shifted online, the issues of data privacy and protection have become critical to the public good. Congress is beginning to treat them as such. Additionally, Applecame out in favor[2]of federal data regulations. The company supports giving users the right to control what information is stored, who it is shared with, and why. Considering that consumers, Congress, and now big tech are all in favor of stricter protections, companies need to begin preparing for a cybersecurity and regulatory future that looks drastically different from today. Luckily, an example already exists. Following in the EU's Footsteps The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect throughout the European Union last spring and represented the first major push for data legislation. GDPR lets each member country devise its own specific data protection rules, but they all share the same objectives: giving users transparent control over their own data. The GDPR rules affect any company that has consumers or does business in Europe, meaning lots ofAmerican companies[3]are forced to comply. Some companies are even considering voluntary adoption of these rules \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to prepare for impending data regulations that are likely coming to America. California recently passed AB 375, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which gives consumers far more control over their data. Other state regulations (along with federal legislation) will likely also come down the pike, suggesting that compliance will be a complex issue for any business, regardless of footprint. It will also be consequential. GDPR and other existing rules levy fines based on the size and severity of the breach. Companies are penalized for every record that is compromised, meaning that large-scale breaches can cost millions or even billions of dollars. There is no clear timeline for when nationwide regulations will take effect in the U.S., nor what form they will take. What is clear, however, is that companieschoosing to prepare[4]now will be ahead of their competition in enhancing their cybersecurity. Preparing for an Uncertain Future Companies don't have to wait for new laws to hit the books to begin planning for compliance. They also don't need to recruit an army of lawyers. Instead, follow these strategies to prepare for whatever happens next at the local, state, national, or international levels: 1. Follow core principles.Rather than trying to align your policies with future regulations, commit to some core principles such as consent, anonymization, and encryption. Making these your ongoing priorities will keep you on the right side of the law more often than not. 2. Evolve your culture.New rules could be right around the corner, and getting prepared takes time. In addition to new policies and protections, companies will need to cultivate an updated culture that respects data and gives preference to privacy. Making those changes meaningfully will not happen quickly or easily, which is why companies should get started sooner rather than later. 3. Treat all data as equal.Stop thinking about data as valuable/invaluable or secure/insecure. GDPR and other rules treat all data breaches equally, no matter what kind of data is compromised. That means rather than securing select information channels and databases, companies will need to take broader approaches to data classification. 4. Practice good governance.A systematic approach is important for preventing breaches, but it's just as important after a breach. Data rules commonly require companies to disclose a breach within days after it occurs. The only way to prepare for the technical, logistical, and reputational fallout on such a short timeline is to have policies and plans in place. 5. Seek the opportunities.Compliance is an obligation and an opportunity. Companies that make every effort to keep data safe tend to strengthen their customers' confidence. Treating data protection as an investment, rather than a burden, makes it easier to get compliant and stay compliant. We are quickly reaching a tipping point when lax data security is unacceptable for everyone. Now that nearly every stakeholder is on board, sweeping change is likely around the corner. Anyone with data at stake should read the writing on the wall and make data protection their next big initiative.

It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your (EU) lead. We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the US,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the US, California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are weighing more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook said \"our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponised against us with military efficiency\", adding that \"scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions\".</p><p>\"This is surveillance,\" he said. Cook's appearance seemed set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.</p><p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs by video. Only Cook attended in person. His speech came a week after Apple unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after the GDPR took effect in May.</p><p>The EU took on global leadership of tech regulation efforts when it launched the GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use. The GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars.</p><p>In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland's data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts. Google, meanwhile, shut down its Plus social network this month after revealing it had a flaw that could have exposed personal information of up to half a million people. | AP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPTIM-106016038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPTIM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJX-GSN1-F091-R1SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312415</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cape Times (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Facebook users will receive new privacy prompts in the coming weeks.</p><p>Don't bother thanking Washington, which remains mired in gridlock despite rising public concerns about data privacy. Rather the changes emanate from the European Union, which is imposing a host of new regulations that are forcing global changes, including for hundreds of millions tech consumers in the United States.</p><p>Privacy advocates warn that these changes won't fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and tech companies, many of which make their profits by collecting data on users, building individual profiles and selling advertising based on the resulting troves of data.</p><p>\"I don't know that these companies are making radical differences in what they're doing,\" said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumers Union.</p><p>But the changes do mark a rare shift toward greater user control and transparency as companies scramble to comply with the European regulations. Those that fail to do so could face fines of up to 4 percent of global profits.</p><p>The new laws, known as GDPR, for General Data Protection Regulation, take effect May 25 in the European Union. They require that tech companies use plain language to explain how their data will be used and that users give explicit consent for these uses. As companies create new ways of using data, they must ask again for permission.</p><p>Under GDPR, users also are gaining new rights to download their data and move it to other platforms. And there are new restrictions on data collection on users under the age of 16, unless parents or guardians consent.</p><p>Companies are not required to apply these same regulations outside the European Union. Some, such as Twitter, said they will implement privacy rules differently in the United States and Europe. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, announced last week that it was raising the minimum user age to 16 in Europe but leaving it at 13 for users in the rest of the world, including the United States.</p><p>Many others, however, are choosing to adopt a single global standard because of the logistical challenges of maintaining two sets of privacy regimes and also to avoid the potential political and public-relations backlash for giving protections to one set of consumers and not others. Companies say there may be minor variations between privacy standards in the E.U. and the U.S. but not to a degree most users would notice.</p><p>Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, during congressional testimony this month, said his company would apply the European standards to U.S. users. A company blog post later elaborated, \"Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook.\"</p><p>Facebook users in the United States are scheduled in coming weeks to see a series of new consent screens explaining how the company collects and uses personal data and asking permission for these uses.</p><p>There will be questions specifically seeking consent for facial recognition technology, which Facebook for years has employed to identify people in photos uploaded to the platform. (The technology will be new, however, in the European Union and Canada, and people there will be asked to consent to its use for the first time.)</p><p>Google says that it too is applying the same privacy standards globally across its many online services, though, as with Facebook, there may be minor variations in how these standards are applied.</p><p>Apple, which relies less on the collection of personal data than some other big tech companies, last month added new privacy protections in updates of its operating systems to comply with GDPR. Those updates applied to users worldwide, the company said, and created new alerts to signal when Apple collects user data. The company also is allowing all users to request their data, seek corrections and demand that any account be deleted.</p><p>One outlier is Twitter, which said that it is adopting a single, unified privacy policy for users throughout the world but implementing it differently outside of Europe, meaning users in the United States will see different explanations and requests for consent.</p><p>\"Our first priority is to meet the EU requirements to comply with GDPR on May 25th,\" the company said in a statement. \"People around the world use our service in different ways and therefore how we present features must be customized by region.\"</p><p>The uneven responses among the companies are frustrating privacy advocates, who argue that the arrival of GDPR offers an opportunity for fundamental change - beyond just a series of new explanations and consent boxes that users are asked to check.</p><p>\"They're just trying to get away with business as usual,\" said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HTCOUN-HC0067217533</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HTCOUR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S6S-X621-DY37-F1TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Hartford Courant Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hartford Courant</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 29, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009LLQ</classCode><className>GO DADDY GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Lawmakers, consumer advocates and even former commission officials were clamoring for tough action against Facebook, arguing it had violated an earlier FTC consent decree barring it from misleading users about how their information was shared.But the enforcement official, James Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Kohm \u2014 echoing Facebook's own argument \u2014 cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm's reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and likely had not broken its promises to the FTC. </p><p>The Cambridge Analytica data leak set off a reckoning for Facebook and a far-reaching debate about the tech industry, which has collected more information about more people than almost any other in history. At the same time, the FTC, which is investigating Facebook, is under growing attack for what critics say is a systemic failure to police Silicon Valley's giants and their enormous appetite for personal data.Most Read Business StoriesAlmost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The FTC serves as the country's de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech companies accused of misleading people about how their information is used. But many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current FTC officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the FTC has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the FTC's future. 'They have been asleep at the switch,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. 'It's a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.'Even if the agency does not penalize Facebook over the Cambridge incident \u2014 and some former FTC officials disagree with Kohm's reasoning \u2014 the commission could punish the company for other offenses. Former officials say they've been told that its inquiry has expanded to include recent security and privacy breaches as well as Facebook's secretive data-sharing deals with Amazon, Netflix and other companies. Facebook declined to comment on the inquiry. The agency \u2014 overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president's party \u2014 is habitually tight-lipped. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons declined to comment on the Kohm memo. 'If the FTC had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,' Simons said in a statement. 'Our investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.'The agency's defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the FTC to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.'The act creating the FTC was not designed with privacy in mind,' said Jessica Rich, a consumer-protection expert who formerly led the FTC's consumer bureau. 'That they've been able to bring hundreds of privacy and data security cases is actually quite a feat, not only given the limitations on their authority but the challenges companies have mounted, especially recently.'A cautionary tale As the federal government's main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the FTC has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robocallers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.But it is hampered by its relatively small size \u2014 about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency's enforcement arm, led by Kohm, doesn't have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the FTC chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants. 'They have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,' said Justin Brookman, a former FTC official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.FTC officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the past decade. Still, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech. Critics said a greater problem was cultural. The FTC is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as 'KidVid.' Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the FTC's power to issue new regulations. Even today, 'in just about every meeting I have at the FTC, staff mention KidVid,' said Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.Fears that Congress could again cripple the FTC have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations. 'They think of themselves as dealmakers, not cops,' said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. 'They have an institutional culture of deference.'That has hobbled the agency's approach to tech giants, leading to inadequate responses to privacy violations or efforts to squeeze out emerging competitors, according to Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department and president of the consumer group Public Knowledge. The FTC needs legislation to allow it to set new rules for the era of big tech, he argued. In 2013, for example, FTC commissioners overruled a staff recommendation to sue Google for abusing its dominance in search to harm rivals. Three years later, when Google began merging data collected by several of its services, including Gmail and the ad technology platform DoubleClick, consumer groups filed a complaint with the FTC calling the practice 'highly deceptive.' The agency took no public action. Nor did the FTC penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union's antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition. (The social network said it had notified users of the change with new terms of service and had allowed them to opt out of aspects of how Facebook used the data.)The FTC has defended its record on privacy, pointing for instance to a $22.5 million fine imposed on Google in 2012 for bypassing privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser in violation of a consent agreement. The fine was the largest civil penalty in the agency's history. Former officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.Ashkan Soltani, who was the FTC's chief technologist from 2014-15, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn't see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi's data could not identify specific individuals. Soltani argued that the FTC needed to get ahead of a technology that would soon become highly intrusive. (He eventually persuaded the agency to investigate, and in 2015 the FTC approved a settlement with Nomi.) Today, dozens of companies gather, use or sell location information so precise that it can pinpoint a phone within a few yards. The data can often be linked to a specific person \u2014 and is frequently harvested without clear consent. Proving harmPresident Donald Trump's arrival in Washington kicked off a period of uncertainty at the FTC. For 16 months, three of five seats remained vacant on the commission, which was initially led by acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen, an advocate of 'regulatory humility.' Ohlhausen's staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic FTC investigations.In an interview, Ohlhausen denied ordering a slowdown and cited privacy actions she had brought against PayPal and Lenovo. But she acknowledged having argued against going after what she regarded as small cases, like Nomi. With limited resources, she said, the FTC should 'pursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.' But that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm. Two former staffers said Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.In recent months, FTC employees meeting with Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users' locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an FTC spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Kohm 'has dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.' </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

As such, it is one of the most important global themes for marketers in 2020. While new regulations change the data landscape, there are opportunities for brands to present themselves as 'privacy first' to consumers who are wary of how their data is being used.</p><p><br/>Ahead of Data Privacy Day, privacy-first marketing is the focus of the Policy chapter of WARC Marketer's Toolkit 2020, which takes a deep dive into the regulatory drivers affecting marketing activity, and offers an evidence-based and practical guide for marketers to plan for the year ahead.<br/>The report is based on a survey with almost 800 client and advertising agency practitioners around the world and insights from CMOs.<br/>Lawmakers in many markets across the globe are implementing stronger data protection rights which will have significant implications for marketers. Specifically in the US, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) comes into force this month.<br/>Like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the CCPA limits how companies can collect, store, use and share customer data and gives consumers more control over their personal information. While the new regulations change the data landscape, there are opportunities for brands to present themselves as 'privacy first' to consumers wary of how their data is being used.<br/>More than half of respondents to the Marketer's Toolkit 2020 survey (52%) believe they need to strengthen their data policies. Almost a quarter (23%) of respondents in Asia have no form of data protection in place, compared with 14% globally.<br/>David Tiltman, VP - Content, WARC, commented, \"In this final chapter of our Marketer's Toolkit 2020, we've taken a closer look at the regulatory drivers affecting marketing activity.Whilst provisions around data protection are now in place for the majority, there is still work to do.\"<br/>The Policy chapter of WARC's Marketer's Toolkit 2020 brings to light the following findings:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Marketers anticipate greater privacy regulation in 2020</p></bodyText></listItem></list>45% of respondents to WARC's Marketers Toolkit survey expect advertising and marketing regulation to become \"more strict\" next year, with 88% agreeing, or strongly agreeing that digital privacy will be increasingly important in 2020.<br/>The major development in 2020 will be the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This will give stronger data protection rights to consumers, and affect companies that rely on the collection, usage, buying and selling of consumer data - including social media giants, third-party data brokers, and online behavioural advertisers. Companies that fail to comply risk a hefty fine - and, as the survey suggests, a loss of consumer trust.<br/>Home to over 39 million people (10% of the US population), California's act is causing a ripple effect across other states - several have already drafted similar data privacy legislation. Industry bodies are lobbying for a federal privacy law, preferable to marketers having to navigate different state regulations.<br/>Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer, Procter &amp; Gamble, commented, \"We're doing [with CCPA] just as we did on GDPR.

We hope it won't be, but this is why marketers must act now.\"<br/>In China, meanwhile, the Personal Information Security Specification proposes an \"unbundling\" of data protection consents, which will affect the ability to use consumers' personal data for marketing purposes.

The WARC survey finds 57% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they are \"readdressing consent management practices inlight of privacy regulation\".<br/>Some are investing in consent management platforms (CMPs), which collect and store customers' consent data, enabling marketers to keep track of peoples' privacy preferences and permissions.<br/>Marketers are also prioritising first-party data, with 58% of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that they have a strategy foractively collecting first-party data from customers. Not only is first party data compliant with regulations, it also gives brands the opportunity to identify and engage with opt-in customers who actually want to hear from them.<br/>Like Europe's GDPR before it, CCPA encourages companiesto have a data minimisation strategy, that is, companies should not keep data they do not need. In this environment, marketers may pivot from big data, to smaller, smarter, more secure data, enabling marketers to nurture relationships with lots of smaller, niche communities of opt-in consumers.<br/>Jill Baskin, Chief Marketing Officer, The Hershey Company, said, \"For us, a big part of it is whether we agree with how our partners are using data.

The Advertising Research Foundation found that US consumers have become less willing to share various aspects of personal data. Recent research by Fudan University and Publicis Media China showed Chinese consumers are most likely to share basic demographic or behavioural information, but they are most concerned about sharing highly-sensitive biometric/ healthcare or legal/ financial data. And a recent study by consulting firm Accenture found consumers are suspicious of emerging technologies that promise to make their lives easier while collecting more data about them.<br/>Brands recognise this shift. 66 per cent of respondents to the WARC Marketer's Toolkit survey agreed or strongly agreed that consumers will take greater control of their data in 2020.<br/>New tech has driven fresh concerns. Connected devices such as Google's Nest thermostat, Amazon's Alexa and Facebook's Portal TV are capable of gathering rich consumer data and are increasingly common in private spaces such as peoples' homes or cars. Marketers engaging in emerging tech should review how they are using consumer data, and ensure they are compliant with data privacy laws.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADGULY-M-572397</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADGULY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y32-SDR1-DYDW-711K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410740</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1372\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Adgully</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This attitude is shared by marketers: 86 per cent of WARC's survey respondents think big tech companies should be subject to greater regulation.</p><p>* Consumers will take more control over their data and their digital identities </p><p>Several surveys have found that consumers are being much choosier about where and how they share information.</p><p>Research by Dentsu Aegis revealed that 44 per cent of global consumers have taken steps to reduce the amount of datathey share online. The Advertising Research Foundation found that US consumers have become less willing to share various aspects of personal data. Recent research by Fudan University and Publicis Media China showed Chinese consumers are most likely to share basic demographic or behavioural information, but they are most concerned about sharing highly-sensitive biometric/ healthcare or legal/ financial data. And a recent study by consulting firm Accenture found consumers are suspicious of emerging technologies that promise to make their lives easier while collecting more data about them.</p><p>Brands recognise this shift. 66 per cent of respondents to the WARC Marketer's Toolkit survey agreed or strongly agreed that consumers will take greater control of their data in 2020.</p><p>New tech has driven fresh concerns. Connected devices such as Google's Nest thermostat, Amazon's Alexa and Facebook's Portal TV are capable of gathering rich consumer data and are increasingly common in private spaces such as peoples' homes or cars. Marketers engaging in emerging tech should review how they are using consumer data, and ensure they are compliant with data privacy laws.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADGLLY-0051457765</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADGLLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y32-7T21-JB5M-W08F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390238</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1370\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 E7 Network, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ad Gully</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

On the contrary, post-Cambridge Analytica and the #DeleteFacebook movement, UK user numbers have grown over the last year, passing 40 million for the first time (around 60 per cent of the UK population).&amp;#xA0;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Furthermore, the rate at which people accept default options and blindly accept T&amp;Cs and privacy policies only increases as our digital lives become more cluttered. According to a survey by Deloitte, 90% of consumers accept legal terms and conditions without reading them.</p><p>If we can&amp;#x2019;t help ourselves as consumers, who will?&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Data Protection Day 2019: Privacy firmly in the limelight<br/>Data privacy: will it be as in vogue as it was in 2018?<br/>A new era in data awareness<br/>Consumer protections</p><p>Enter Her Majesty&amp;#x2019;s Government. It seems that various factions across Government have come to the conclusion, almost in unison, that greater consumer protections are needed. With GDPR still the soundtrack to last summer that&amp;#x2019;s ringing in our ears, a slew of Government activity is underway to crack down on big tech companies, and some is directed specifically at ensuring greater privacy protections.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Recently, Jeremy Wright, the Digital secretary, unveiled that the newly founded Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation would conduct an inquiry into online targeting techniques. This is in addition to DCMS&amp;#x2019;s soon to be published White Paper on online harms, calling for a &amp;#x201C;digital super-regulator&amp;#x201D;. To add to that was a HM Treasury&amp;#x2019;s report on Unlocking Digital Competition conducted by Jason Furman, which culminated in the Chancellor ordering the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate online advertising. That was quite a couple of weeks in the midst of Brexit chaos!&amp;#xA0;</p><p>It is worth noting that the House of Lords committee report specifically suggested that services ought to default to strictest privacy and safety settings. Obviously, we greeted that with cheers at Viber, but more broadly tech companies can start to see the outline of what the Government wants to see the industry do.&amp;#xA0;</p><p/><p/><p>Image Credit: Pixabay</p><p> Regulation - where and by whom?</p><p>In the UK, it&amp;#x2019;s not yet clear who might regulate the privacy practices of tech firms. GDPR is policed by the ICO, but a lot relies around consent, and that isn&amp;#x2019;t hard for firms to obtain as we have seen. Then there&amp;#x2019;s the CMA looking at online advertising and potentially with the power to disrupt monopolies. Others have advocated for Ofcom to take on a larger role in digital media and tech.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>The regulatory picture in the UK is far from clear, and how that fits into a global regulatory framework for managing tech companies is anybody&amp;#x2019;s guess. In an increasingly global world, how fragmented can the rules for tech companies be before it damages the value they bring to users?&amp;#xA0;</p><p>A third way</p><p>Perhaps the choice between the privacy Wild West and the over-zealous sheriff is a false one? Can the tech industry create a code of conduct that polices behavior while also setting the bar for consumers as to what is fair use of their data?</p><p>We believe strongly that companies within social media, digital communications and messaging can meet governments&amp;#x2019; wish lists by moving to a privacy-focused mindset, with several key promises to users:</p><p>No reading or storing of any private chats<br/>No listening or recording of any private calls<br/>No scanning of any private media exchanged (pictures or video)<br/>No listening of live conversations through the microphone of a mobile phone<br/>By default, all settings (like end-to-end encryption) will be set to the most secure option. If needed the users will have to unlock those security features themselves and give explicit consent.</p><p>Clearly, sacrifices will have to be made by data hungry platforms in terms of monetisation. However, brands have been waking up to the idea that, as much as consumers tick the T&amp;Cs eagerly and sign away their data, it doesn&amp;#x2019;t necessarily mean that a brand following them all over their digital footprint with creepy levels of targeting is what they want to see. The cost of protecting users&amp;#x2019; privacy may not turn out to be as steep as many tech firms have feared.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Doing the right thing</p><p>Ultimately, it might not matter much who moves first, the private or public sector. What is certain, however, is that we will see a change in how the tech industry handles user data. It would send the right signal though if efforts were made to clean up practices before the hammer comes down. It will signal to users that more apps and services are focused on protecting their interests, not just the shareholders.</p><p>Cristina Constandache, Chief Revenue Officer at Viber&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Protect your privacy online with the best VPN<br/>Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/80/155559862106.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/80/155559862106.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-142703113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX9-CNP1-F11P-X4DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

However, government regulations can limit the risks. Tech companies will continue to invest in healthcare in order to capture market share. Data protection regulations will need to be updated more regularly to ensure the law keeps up with tech advancements. </p><p>Over the past decade, healthcare establishments have shifted towards digital record-keeping across hospitals, health plans and physician practices. Paired with the increasing popularity of healthcare IoT devices and apps, there has been an exponential growth in patient data stored digitally. This increases privacy risks as improper storage can lead to data breaches that could be leveraged by hackers to commit fraud or identity theft.RisksThough sharing patient data can never be risk-free, there are regulations in place to try and minimise the risk as much as possible. However, breaches of data can lead to theft of patient data and unprotected data can be accessed by third-parties and used for advertising purposes.Healthcare data remains a target for hackers and data breaches can be a common occurrence. In 2019, a hacking incident at American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA) resulted in millions of patients' data being affected. Quest Diagnostics on June 3 2019 disclosed that an 'unauthorised user' had access to AMCA's system and might have accessed data on 11.9 million Quest patients. According to Quest, the data stored by AMCA included financial information, such as credit card numbers and bank account information, medical information and other personal information, such as social security numbers.<table><title>Biggest Healthcare Data Breaches 2015-2019</title><tgroup cols=\"5\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec

In the US a regulation entitled Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) currently protects health information, the UK has a Data Protection act, and the EU has European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). All of these laws anchor protections to the data itself and employ the notion of a primary data custodian (a 'covered entity' in HIPAA or a 'controller' in the GDPR) and a third party, which may process data on that custodian's behalf (business associate or processor). Both define categories of permitted use and disclosure -- akin to the 'Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations' in the HIPAA privacy rule; GDPR codifies a narrower list of permitted uses for sensitive categories of data, including health information and genetic markers. And both codify parameters for patient or consumer consent for use or disclosure beyond those categories (known as affirmative authorisation in the CCPA), and rules to ensure that individuals and regulators are notified in the event of a data breach.However, these regulations are not enough to fully protect data as new methods of storing and sharing data have created gaps in the regulatory framework. Laws such as HIPAA are only enforced on 'covered entities' such as healthcare providers, research institutions, and healthcare plans. However, they do not cover digital records. International transmission of health information relies on voluntary agreements to adhere to terms of service, and private companies can solicit health data from users without having to conform to HIPAA regulations. As a result, more and more of our personal information, including health data, is being collected by Internet Service Providers and third party analytics companies to be sold to marketing agencies.In 2018, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fitbit</emphasis>'s acquisition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twine</emphasis>, a health coaching platform used in employer wellness programmes, highlighted growing adoption of wearables and blurred boundaries among consumers, patients, and paying enterprise customers. In 2019, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>'s planned acquisition of Fitbit raised new concerns about a combination of largely unregulated health data and a business that utilises personal information to power third-party advertising. In 2019 Google and Ascension, a large US non-profit health system, partnered in order to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of digital capabilities that enhance the experience of Ascension consumers, patients and clinical providers. This once again raised data privacy concerns despite both companies stating the collaboration is compliant with HIPAA and underpinned by a robust data security and protection effort and adherence to Ascension's strict requirements for data handling. For the specific project entitled 'Project Nightingale' the data is being transferred with full personal details including name and medical history and can be accessed by Google staff. This is unlike other data transfers as this time the data has not been made anonymous through a process of removing personal information known as de-identification. Project Nightingale is the largest data transfer of its kind in the healthcare industry.Big tech companies such as Google, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> all have global data centre infrastructure to support high-level of data processing and analytics, and moving forward we expect tech companies' presence to increase in the healthcare sphere. However, in order to ensure that patient data is protected healthcare establishments need to further invest in cybersecurity and regulations such as HIPAA need to be regularly updated to keep up with the evolution of tech. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1557186</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-N0B1-JD33-J19S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1114\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

Although these regulations have their inherent differences, the general scope of data privacy laws is to give consumers the right to know how and what type of personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, and the option to take legal action in the event that they should incur damages from bias or data security breaches. Until now, most organisations have focused their efforts on structured information, but they must also be able to understand what PII is located in textual data documents. Archived data, in particular, is an especially pressing concern for most enterprises. </p><p>AI-powered solutions will be instrumental in locating sensitive data and managing it through automated workflows. Organisations will also need to establish internal data governance practices to determine who is accountable for data security and enterprise-wide policy, which may include creating teams that blend technical and regulatory expertise. Zachary Jarvinen, head of technology strategy, AI and analytics, OpenText Data-as-a-Service will become a growing source of revenue for big companiesThe effective use of enterprise data for strategic decision making has become a key priority for all big companies in the last few years. As a consequence, companies have created high quality datasets and a sophisticated technology architecture to manage them and expose them to consumers. Companies have also invested heavily in automating their business processes for greater efficiency. In the new year, since many big companies will now own high-value, unique data and services, the next logical step is reusing this infrastructure in order to offer them to third-parties. For instance, we are already seeing telecommunications companies selling customers geolocation data for a variety of purposes. This trend will be significantly accentuated during 2020 in all major industries. From the investment standpoint, this will involve higher demand for the technologies involved in creating and exposing data as a service, like GraphQL, Data Virtualization and/or API management tools. Alberto Pan, chief technical officer, Denodo The emergence of global data standards and data-centric rolesData bloat is only one of the challenges facing organisations in 2020. The next most pressing will be data quality and efficiency of managing it. Not all companies take the same pains to optimise their data, resulting in repositories of unstructured data that are larger and less efficiently managed than they should be. While standards such as GDPR have started to make a positive impact on helping companies prioritise data hygiene and protection, there is no single, global framework that tells businesses how they should store, manage, classify, protect and secure their data. It's easy to become accustomed to the status quo, but this divergence in data practices only slows down the flow of data between organisations and forces many to waste added time and resources on data cleansing and management. Data has become the lifeblood of many sectors we can't afford to let it clot. That's why we'll see the beginnings of a concerted movement across industries to bring in legally enforceable standards for data quality. Arguably synthetic data will commonly be used as a mechanism to share intelligence without compromising the source or the subject of the data. A single, global data standard that crosses borders remains a pipedream, but we should expect to see many industries start to entrench good data practice for their members, regardless of their country of origin or location of their customers. The penalties for non-compliance may even include fines, the loss of industry accreditation or being banned from important associations. Of course, mileage and speed will vary from sector to sector already heavily regulated industries like banking and healthcare will likely take the lead but any progress means better data quality and fewer data dilemmas. The question is, who in the organisation will be charged with enforcing these new data standards? Many businesses already employ chief data officers (CDOs) and data protection officers (DPOs) to ensure their digital estate is secure and protected. However, the sheer amount of data they are responsible for, coupled with the growing awareness of data's importance across the entire business, means we are going to see data responsibility filter out rather than become more centralised. Rather than having a single CDO or DPO, different departments will begin to employ personnel with multiple competencies, including data expertise. Candidates with data experience in addition to the skillset traditionally expected for their role will only become more sought after as organisations hire for new hybrid roles. Other departments may take the alternate approach of hiring their own data specialist. Regardless, the time when data responsibility was passed off to IT or laid solely at the feet of the CDO will come to an end. Jasmit Sagoo, senior director, head of technology UK&amp;I at Veritas Technologies A flood of data privacy regulationsThe cybersecurity Magic 8 Ball indicates that 'all signs point to yes' when asking whether more regulations would come in 2020. CCPA and NY SHIELD foreshadow 2020's privacy and security trends. The United States Congress debated a federal privacy regulation in June 2019. Despite being derailed at the end of the year, businesses and congresspeople alike are pushing to create a single, cohesive federal law governing privacy and security. The United States isn't the only country looking to formalise and consolidate its privacy laws. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) cybersecurity framework in conjunction with the GDPR's extraterritorial impact pressures other Middle Eastern countries to update their privacy regulations. For example, the Dubai International Financial Centre Authority (DIFCA) sent out a call for public commentary in June 2019. 5. More than quantity also quality. If the GDPR and CCPA taught the cyber community one lesson in 2019, it would be that not all laws are created equally. While the GDPR and CCPA are testing just how far a 'local' law can reach, India's Personal Data Protection Bill and the failed New York Privacy Act test the standard of care companies need to provide. Both of these regulations use the term 'data fiduciary'. Traditionally used in terms of money, a fiduciary duty requires a company to act in someone else's (often shareholders') best interests. If regulations continue to use the term 'data fiduciary', organisations may be held to a higher standard of care than 'negligence'. If regulations begin to adopt the term 'data fiduciary' in 2020, we predict a cultural shift recognising information as a financially valuable asset. Alex Heid, chief research officer at SecurityScorecard Consumer rights, data privacy regulation and more lawsuitsCustomers are more aware now of the rights of GDPR and other data privacy regulations around the world. And as breaches hit the headlines every day, 2020 will be the year customers start to ask more questions and demand more control over where organisations are storing data and how they are protecting the data. In 2020, companies will pay nearly $3bn in fines and payouts from lawsuits, a 50% increase over 2019. As a results, data discovery, classification and remediation by protection sensitive data through automated workflows will become important and be an extremely important initiative for enterprises. Ashvin Kamaraju, CTO for cloud protection and licensing activity at Thales Corporate transparency to become a necessity2020 will require that companies make transparency a reality. Consumer demand for brands to be more open is clear. If they don't pull back the curtain on their business, they will lose trust and ultimately loyalty. Data transparency is the hottest topic, for sure. It's not easy for businesses to do, but they will need to find ways to be more open about the data they collect, how they use it, and how it impacts decisions. They also need to show how they're protecting it. Beyond personal data, proving the provenance of products from food to clothes and demonstrating ethical and environmental credentials will all become more important. The reason more transparency will be really important in 2020 is because demand for it is growing, and the technology/tools are available, so we're on the verge of someone being able to do it really well. Once one brand is able to redefine customer relations in this way, they will set the standard of expectations, and everyone else is instantly behind. And if they lag behind for too long, they might find themselves on the list of companies that couldn't survive in the digital era.

This is not a big investment for such companies, especially as they rarely pay tax in India. However, every time they have been asked to set up shop, they have raised issues ranging from problems acquiring land to electricity.Data should remain within India and be subject to Indian laws. Without such laws or regulations the threats by government to such companies are ring hollow. And, such breaches will only grow in future with India being the centre of expansion by these tech giants.The Government has also been talking about creating an Indian Google, but its been years now. There should be firms in India, like WeChat and Baidu in China, to counter these firms. We can follow the example set by China instead of doing lip service. We must back big India-owned e-commerce and mobility players to fight the Amazons and Ubers of the world.Tech is not the challenge, user-behaviour is. So, at the end of the day, it is time for action and not reaction.S Ronendra SinghSenior Assistant Editor </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-HIN104256152219962514625176500240</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIN-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYX-H9R1-F03R-N25J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"336\"/><timeReceived>1:13 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hindu Business Line</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Continue reading  Data protection and security need to be baked into strategy from the start </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paul Ryan of OpenX talks about the adtech industry and the importance of incorporating data protection into product development.</p><p>Paul Ryan is the CTO of adtech firm OpenX, where he oversees a global team of more than 150 engineers and data scientists to develop new programmatic advertising technology.</p><p>He was previously CTO and co-founder of mobile search company Zowdow, and has held senior technology roles at Yellow Pages Group, Leads360 and Overture. Here, he discusses how the adtech      industry is evolving and why data protection should be proactive rather than reactive.</p><p> Security needs a seat at the table in terms of corporate strategy <br/>  PAUL RYAN</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Describe your role and your responsibilities in driving tech strategy.</emphasis></h><p>Our products and our core technology platforms require tight strategic as well as tactical integration, so my role encompasses both tech and product strategy globally. This includes overseeing      everything from the product strategy and roadmap, leading the development of new products and features, all the way to ensuring everything runs smoothly with our internal IT help desk.</p><p>Additionally, as an adtech company, we process a high volume of transactions in the cloud including trillions of events that need to be tracked and reported on daily, so I spend a lot of time      thinking about how we evolve our high-volume production systems to address these specific needs of the company.</p><p>While CIOs traditionally focus on the supporting tech used to keep the organisation operating smoothly   covering internal tools, processes, procedure and all the internal networking   CTOs      typically focus much more on the actual products and how they tie into revenue. My role covers both.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are you spearheading any major product or IT initiatives you can tell us about?</emphasis></h><p>Last year, we undertook a huge project to migrate our entire high-volume infrastructure into the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This is not a hybrid cloud solution, but 100pc cloud-based.</p><p>This initiative was not a lift-and-shift exercise. We refactored major parts of the platform while supporting the old on-premises infrastructure and learning about the features, function and      idiosyncrasies of GCP.</p><p>Being in the cloud has brought us tremendous benefits, as we can now address scale and load, and handle peaks and dips in a way we weren t able to before. We also have access to the advanced      services of GCP like their AI and machine learning, which we re using to optimise and streamline the performance of our exchange.</p><p>On the product side, I m driving two major initiatives. First, the development of our OpenAudience product suite. We re organising and using data in an interesting and sophisticated way to      better enable one-to-one marketing in the programmatic universe. This will make it very easy for brands and advertisers to transact on audiences using their DSP (demand side platforms)      partners.</p><p>The other initiative is around Prebid.org, which is an open-source project aimed at helping publishers better manage their ad inventory. I am on the board of the organisation and our team      actively contributes code to enhance the value of the solution.</p><p>Open-source projects like Prebid are key for moving the adtech industry forward and we re regularly thinking through how we can continue to collaborate with others across the industry to build      solutions that help our partners navigate a rapidly evolving advertising ecosystem.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How big is your team? Do you outsource where possible?</emphasis></h><p>The product and engineering team at OpenX is around 120 people, with a significant portion of the team based in Krakow.</p><p>We outsource some 24/7 helpdesk efforts, a network operations centre and specific software-development projects that require unique expertise. We handle the majority of the software development      work in-house.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are your thoughts on digital transformation and how are you addressing it?</emphasis></h><p>OpenX exists in a completely digital ecosystem, and we ve operated this way for more than a decade. From a core infrastructure point of view, we re mostly digital and everything is SaaS-based.</p><p>Internally, we are using all of the latest and greatest tools to manage our processes. The sheer size of our platform compared to the number of people that support it means it s essentially      completely automated.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What big tech trends do you believe are changing the world and your industry specifically?</emphasis></h><p>Moving to the cloud is the top trend changing our industry. We made this bet last year and the way we look at it, when you think about the sheer volumes of data we deal with in digital      advertising   which is growing every day   it s almost impossible not to use a cloud-based infrastructure to support the business.</p><p>The second big trend is privacy. You need to take the time to understand it, and then you need to build it into your strategy and products. In the last few years, the adtech industry has had to      grapple with a number of changes introduced by GDPR and CCPA.</p><p>Both initiatives have provided complex new privacy frameworks to follow and as privacy continues to be top-of-mind for consumers, learning to navigate in this new regulatory landscape is      something that everyone in our space is thinking about.</p><p>Finally, while big data is not a new trend by any means, better management of data and particularly understanding the lifecycle of data has grown in importance.</p><p>With the abundance of data in our industry specifically, it s important to be smart about the data you re utilising and also the data you re not, and aggressively getting rid of data you don t      need. When petabytes of data accumulate each day, you have to be very good at understanding it, using it for what you need and then getting rid of it.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In terms of security, what are your thoughts on how we can better protect data?</emphasis></h><p>Security needs a seat at the table in terms of corporate strategy. The security team is often seen as the people in the room who are quick to say no or slow down product development, but taking      this view is the wrong approach.</p><p>Data protection and security need to be baked into strategy from the start. It needs to become second nature, and addressed regularly, so every year there isn t a rush to make updates to meet      the latest security requirements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis>http://http://<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.openx.com\">www.openx.com</url>/<br/>Contact Information:<br/>Ann<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2598932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-7G01-F08D-52PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1138\"/><timeReceived>2:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 16, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0007Q1J</classCode><className>YELLOW PAGES INCOME FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp; MAILING LIST PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

(6) Nothing in this section detracts from other rights, freedoms or legitimate interests in this Bill or any other primary or secondary legislation relating to P\u2019s personal data, employment, social security or social protection.\u201d       This new clause would create a right to an explanation in writing from an employer, prospective employer or agent giving the particulars of a decision to which the Right to algorithmic fairness at work applies.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        New clauses 7 and 8 to 11 touch on the question of how we ensure a degree of justice when it comes to decisions that are taken about us automatically. The growth in decisions that are made through automated decision making has been exponential, and there are risks to that. We need to ensure that the law is modernised to provide new protections and safeguards for our constituents in this new world.       I should say at the outset that this group of new clauses is rooted in the excellent work of the Future of Work commission, which produced a long, thought-provoking report. The Committee will be frustrated to hear that I am not going to read through that this afternoon, but, none the less, I want to tease out a couple of points.       The basket of new clauses that we have proposed are well thought through and have been carefully crafted. I put on record my thanks to Helen Mountfield QC, an expert in equality law, and to Mike Osborne, professor of machine learning. Along with Ben Jaffey QC, a specialist in data law, they have been looking at some of the implications of automated decision making, which were discussed at length by the Future of Work commission.226;128;\ufffd       Central to the new clauses is a concern that unaccountable and highly sophisticated automated or semi-automated systems are now making decisions that bear on fundamental elements of people\u2019s work, including recruitment, pay and discipline. Just today, I was hearing about the work practices at the large Amazon warehouse up in Dundee, I think, where there is in effect digital casualisation. Employees are not put on zero-hours contracts, but they are put on four-hour contracts. They are guided around this gigantic warehouse by some kind of satnav technology on a mobile phone, but the device that guides them around the warehouse is also a device that tracks how long it takes them to put together a basket.       That information is then arranged in a nice league table of employees of who is the fastest and who is slowest, and decisions are then taken about who gets an extension to their contracted hours each week and who does not. That is a pretty automated kind of decision. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) was describing to me the phenomenon of the butty man\u2014the individual who decided who on a particular day got to work on the docks or on the construction site. In the pub at the end of the week, he divvied up the earnings and decided who got what, and who got work the following week. That kind of casualisation is now being reinvented in a digital era and is something that all of us ought to be incredibly concerned about.       What happens with these algorithms is called, in the jargon, socio-technical\u2014what results is a mixture of conventional software, human judgment and statistical models. The issue is that very often the decisions that are made are not transparent, and are certainly not open to challenge. They are now quite commonly used by employers and prospective employers, and their agents, who are able to analyse very large datasets and can then deploy artificial intelligence and machine learning to make inferences about a person. Quite apart from the ongoing debates about how we define a worker and how we define employment\u2014the subject of a very excellent report by my old friend Matthew Taylor, now at the RSA\u2014there are real questions about how we introduce new safeguards for workers in this country.       I want to highlight the challenge with a couple of examples. Recent evidence has revealed how many recruiters use\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014Facebook to seek candidates in ways that routinely discriminate against older workers by targeting advertisements for jobs in a particular way. Slater and Gordon, which is a firm of excellent employment lawyers, showed that about one in five company executives admit to unlawful discrimination when advertising jobs online. The challenge is that when jobs are advertised in a targeted way, by definition they are not open to applicants from all walks of life, because lots of people just will not see the ads.       Women and those over the age of 50 are now most likely to be prevented from seeing an advert. Some 32% of company executives say that they have discriminated against those who are over 50, and a quarter have discriminated in that way against women. Nearly two thirds of executives with access to a profiling tool have said that they use it to actively seek out people based on criteria as diverse as age, gender and race. If we are to deliver a truly meritocratic labour market, where the rights of us all to shoot for jobs and to develop our skills and capabilities are protected, some of those practices have to stop. If we are to stop them, the law needs to change, and it needs to change now.226;128;\ufffd       This battery of new clauses sets out to do five basic things. First, they set out some enhancements and refinements to the Equality Act 2010, in a way that ensures that protection from discrimination is applied to new forms of decision making, especially when those decisions engage core rights, such as rights on recruitment, terms of work, or dismissal. Secondly, there is a new right to algorithmic fairness at work, to ensure equal treatment. Thirdly, there is the right to an explanation when a decision is taken in a way that affects core elements of work life, such as a decision to hire, fire or suspend someone. Fourthly, there is a new duty for employers to undertake an algorithmic impact assessment, and fifthly, there are new, realistic ways for individuals to enforce those rights in an employment tribunal. It is quite a broad-ranging set of reforms to a number of different parts of legislation.                    Daniel Zeichner (Cambridge) (Lab)           Share this contribution        My right hon. Friend is making a powerful case. Does he agree that this is exactly the kind of thing we ought to have been discussing at the outset of the Bill? The elephant in the room is that the Bill seems to me, overall, to be looking backwards rather than forwards. It was developed to implement the general data protection regulation, which has been discussed over many years. We are seeing this week just how fast-moving the world is. These are the kind of ideas that should have been driving the Bill in the first place.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Exactly. My hon. Friend makes such a good point. The challenge with the way that Her Majesty\u2019s Government have approached the Bill is that they have taken a particular problem\u2014that we are heading for the exit door of Europe, so we had better ensure that we get a data-sharing agreement in place, or it will be curtains for Britain\u2019s services exports\u2014and said, \u201cWe\u2019d better find a way of incorporating the GDPR into British law as quickly as possible.\u201d They should have thought imaginatively and creatively about how we strengthen our digital economy, and how we protect freedoms, liberties and protections in this new world, going back to first principles and thinking through the consequences. What we have is not quite a cut-and-paste job\u2014I will not describe it in that way\u2014but neither is it the sophisticated exercise in public law making that my hon. Friend describes as more virtuous.       I want to give the Committee a couple of examples of why this is so serious, as sometimes a scenario or two can help. Let us take an individual whom we will call \u201cMr A\u201d. He is a 56-year-old man applying for website development roles. Typically, if someone is applying for jobs in a particular sector, those jobs will be advertised online. In fact, many such roles are advertised only online, and they target users only in the age profile 26 to 35, through digital advertising or social media networks, whether that is Facebook, LinkedIn, or others. Because Mr A is not in the particular age bracket being targeted, he never sees the ad, as it will never pop up on his news feed, or on digital advertising aimed at him. He therefore does not apply for the role and does not know he is being excluded from applying for the role, all as a consequence of him being the wrong age. Since he is excluded from opportunities because of his age, he finds it much harder to find a role.226;128;\ufffd       The Equality Act, which was passed with cross-party consensus, prohibits less favourable treatment because of age\u2014direct discrimination\u2014including in relation to recruitment practices, and protects individuals based on their age. The Act sets out a number of remedies for individuals who have been discriminated against in that way, but it is not clear how the Bill proposes to correct that sin. Injustices in the labour market are multiplying, and there is a cross-party consensus for a stronger defence of workers. In fact, the Member of Parliament for the town where I grew up, the right hon. Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon), has led the argument in favour of the Conservative party rechristening itself the Workers\u2019 party, and the Labour party was founded on a defence of labour rights, so I do not think this is an especially contentious matter. There is cross-party consensus about the need to stand up for workers\u2019 rights, particularly when wages are stagnating so dramatically.       We are therefore not divided on a point of principle, but the Opposition have an ambition to do something about this growing problem. The Bill could be corrected in a way that made a significant difference. There is not an argument about the rights that are already in place, because they are enshrined in the Equality Act, with which Members on both sides of the House agree. The challenge is that the law as it stands is deficient and cannot be applied readily or easily to automated decision making.                    Gareth Snell (Stoke-on-Trent Central) (Lab/Co-op)           Share this contribution        My right hon. Friend is making a powerful case about the importance of the Equality Act in respect of the Bill, but may I offer him another example? He mentioned the Amazon warehouse where people are tracked at work. We know that agencies compile lists of their more productive workers, whom they then use in other work, and of their less productive workers. That seems like a form of digital blacklisting, and we all know about the problems with blacklisting in the construction industry in the 1980s. I suggest that the new clauses are a great way of combating that new digital blacklisting.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        My hon. Friend gives a brilliant example. The point is that employment agencies play an incredibly important role in providing workers for particular sectors of the economy, from hotels to logistics, distribution and construction. The challenge is that the areas of the economy that have created the most jobs in the 10 years since the financial crash are those where terms and conditions are poorest, casualisation is highest and wages are lowest\u2014and they are the areas where productivity is poorest, too. The Government could take a different kind of labour market approach that enhanced productivity and wages, and shut down some of the bad practices and casualisation that are creating a problem.       As it happens, the Government have signed up to some pretty big ambitions in that area. Countries around the world recently signed up to the UN sustainable development goals. Goal 8 commits the Government to reducing inequality, and SDG 10 commits them to reducing regional inequality. However, when I asked the Prime Minister what she was doing about that, my question was referred to Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury and the answer that came back from the Chancellor was, \u201cWe believe in raising productivity and growth.\u201d The way to raise productivity and growth is to ensure that 226;128;\ufffdthere are good practices in the labour market, because it is poor labour market productivity that is holding us back as a country.       If digital blacklisting or casualisation were to spread throughout the labour market in the sectors that happen to be creating jobs, there would be no increase in productivity and the Government would be embarked on a self-defeating economic policy. Although these new clauses may sound technical, they have a bearing on a much more important plank of the Government\u2019s economic development strategy.       Our arguments are based on principles that have widespread support on both sides of the House and they are economically wise. The consequences of the new clauses will be more than outweighed by the benefits they will deliver. I commend them to the Minister and I hope she will take them on board.              2.15 pm      Darren Jones (Bristol North West) (Lab)           Share this contribution        I want to add some further comments in support of the new clauses.       The Science and Technology Committee, one of the two Committees that I sit on, has had a detailed debate on algorithmic fairness. It is important to understand what the new clauses seek to do. There is a nervousness about regulating algorithms or making them completely transparent, because there are commercial sensitivities in the coding in respect of the way they are published or otherwise.       These new clauses seek to put the obligation on to the human beings who produce the algorithms to think about things such as equalities law to ensure that we do not hardcode biases into them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said on Second Reading. It is important to understand how the new clauses apply to the inputs\u2014what happens in the black box of the algorithm\u2014and the outputs. The inputs to an algorithm are that a human codes and sets its rules, and that they put the data into it for it to make a decision.       The new clauses seek to say that the human must have a consistent and legal obligation to understand the equalities impacts of their coding and data entry into the black box of the algorithm to avoid biases coming out at the other end. As algorithms are increasingly used, that is an important technical distinction to understand, and it is why the new clauses are very sensible. On that basis, I hope the Government will support them.                    The Chair           Share this contribution        I call the Minister, whose birthday it is today.                    The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Victoria Atkins)           Share this contribution        Thank you, Mr Streeter, and what a wonderful birthday present it is to be serving on the Committee.       It is a joy, actually, to be able to agree with the Opposition on the principle that equality applies not only to decisions made by human beings or with human input, but to decisions made solely by computers and algorithms. On that, we are very much agreed. The reason that we do not support the new clauses is that we believe that the Equality Act already protects workers 226;128;\ufffdagainst direct or indirect discrimination by computer or algorithm-based decisions. As the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill rightly said, the Act was passed with cross-party consensus.       The Act is clear that in all cases, the employer is liable for the outcome of any of their actions, or those of their managers or supervisors, or those that are the result of a computer, algorithm or mechanical process. If, during a recruitment process, applications from people with names that suggest a particular ethnicity were rejected for that reason by an algorithm, the employer would be liable for race discrimination, whether or not they designed the algorithm with that intention in mind.       The right hon. Gentleman placed a great deal of emphasis on advertising and, again, we share his concerns that employers could seek to treat potential employees unfairly and unequally. The Equality and Human Rights Commission publishes guidance for employers to ensure that there is no discriminatory conduct and that fair and open access to employment opportunities is made clear in the way that employers advertise posts.       The same principle applies in the provision of services. An automated process that intentionally or unintentionally denies a service to someone because of a protected characteristic will lay the service provider open to a claim under the Act, subject to any exceptions.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, not least because it gives me the opportunity to wish her a happy birthday. Could she remind the Committee how many prosecutions there have been for discriminatory advertising because employers chose to target their adverts?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        If I may, I will write to the right hon. Gentleman with that precise number, but I know that the Equality and Human Rights Commission is very clear in its guidance that employers must act within the law. The law is very clear that there are to be no direct or indirect forms of discrimination.       The hon. Member for Cambridge raised the GDPR, and talked about looking forwards not backwards. Article 5(1)(a) requires processing of any kind to be fair and transparent. Recital 71 draws a link between ensuring that processing is fair and minimising discriminatory effects. Article 35 of the GDPR requires controllers to undertake data protection impact assessments for all high-risk activities, and article 36 requires a subset of those impact assessments to be sent to the Information Commissioner for consultation prior to the processing taking place. The GDPR also gives data subjects the tools to understand the way in which their data has been processed. Processing must be transparent, details of that processing must be provided to every data subject, whether or not the data was collected directly from them, and data subjects are entitled to a copy of the data held about them.       When automated decision-making is engaged there are yet more safeguards. Controllers must tell the data subject, at the point of collecting the data, whether they intend to make such decisions and, if they do, provide meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences for the data subject of such processing. Once a significant decision has been made, that must be communicated to 226;128;\ufffdthe data subject, and they must be given the opportunity to object to that decision so that it is re-taken by a human being.       We would say that the existing equality law and data protection law are remarkably technologically agnostic. Controllers cannot hide behind algorithms, but equally they should not be prevented from making use of them when they can do so in a sensible, fair and productive way.                    Daniel Zeichner           Share this contribution        Going back to the point raised by my right hon. Friend, I suspect that the number of cases will prove to be relatively low. The logic of what the Minister is saying would suggest that there is no algorithmic unfairness going on out there. I do not think that that is the case. What does she think?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I would be guided by the view of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which oversees conduct in this area. I have no doubt that the Information Commissioner and the Equality and Human Rights Commission are in regular contact. If they are not, I very much hope that this will ensure that they are.       We are clear in law that there cannot be such discrimination as has been discussed. We believe that the framework of the law is there, and that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, with their respective responsibilities, can help, advise and cajole, and, at times, enforce the law accordingly. I suspect that we will have some interesting times ahead of us with the release of the gender pay gap information. I will do a plug now, and say that any company employing more than 250 employees should abide by the law by 4 April. I look forward to reviewing the evidence from that exercise next month.       We are concerned that new clauses 7 and 8 are already dealt with in law, and that new clauses 9 to 11 would create an entirely new regulatory structure just for computer-assisted decision-making in the workplace, layered on top of the existing requirements of both employment and data protection law. We want the message to be clear to employers that there is no distinction between the types of decision-making. They are responsible for it, whether a human being was involved or not, and they must ensure that their decisions comply with the law.       Having explained our belief that the existing law meets the concerns raised by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, I hope he will withdraw the new clause.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I think it was in \u201cCandide\u201d that Voltaire introduced us to the word \u201cPanglossian\u201d, and we have heard a rather elegant and Panglossian description of a perfect world in which all is fine in the labour market. I am much more sceptical than the Minister. I do not think the current law is sufficiently sharp, and I am concerned that the consequence of that will be injustice for our constituents.       The Minister raised a line of argument that it is important for us to consider. The ultimate test of whether the law is good enough must be what is actually happening out there in the labour market. I do not think it is good enough; she thinks it is fine. On the nub of the argument, a few more facts might be needed on both sides, so we 226;128;\ufffdreserve the right to come back to the issue on Report. This has been a useful debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.       Clause, by leave, withdrawn.       New Clause 13       Review of Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations       \u201c(1) The Secretary of State shall lay before both Houses of Parliament a review of the application and operation of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 in relation to the processing of personal data.       (2) A review under subsection (1) shall be laid before Parliament by 31 January 2019.\u201d\u2014(Liam Byrne.)       This new clause would order the Secretary of State to review the application and operation of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 in relation to the processing of data and lay that review before Parliament before 31 January 2019.       Brought up, and read the First time.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.       This is not normally my practice, but let me raise another area that is subject to a measure of cross-party consensus. There is widespread recognition that the e-commerce directive, which is used to regulate information services providers, is hopelessly out of date. It was agreed in around 2000. In effect, it allows information services providers to be treated as platforms rather than publishers. Since then, we have seen the growth of big tech and the new data giants that now dominate the digital economy, and they are misbehaving. Worse, they have become platforms for hate speech, social division and interference in democracy. It was intriguing to hear Mark Zuckerberg himself admit in the interview he gave yesterday that Facebook was indeed being used to try to corrupt elections. That is an extraordinary recognition by the head of one of the most important firms in the world.       The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport reminded us as recently as this morning that as we come out of the European Union we will have a new opportunity to update the e-commerce directive. The House basically must put in place a new framework to regulate information services providers in a new way. A debate is raging among our neighbours about what steps we need to take to shut down the hate speech that is dividing communities, and we need to get into that debate quickly. Germany recently passed laws that require companies such as Facebook to take down hate speech in a very short time window or face fines of up to \u20ac10 million and Ireland has created a new regulator to provide a degree of overwatch, so it is intriguing that we are falling behind some of our most important neighbours, who now lead this debate.       I began looking at this issue when I started researching new techniques in ISIS propaganda. In the excellent Scotland Yard counter-terrorism referral unit, I saw propaganda that was put together with the slickness of a pop video to incite people to commit the most heinous crimes, such as the one we commemorate today. Yet I think we all recognise that organisations such as Facebook and YouTube are simply not working quickly enough to take down that kind of material, which we simply do 226;128;\ufffdnot want people to see. I congratulate The Times, which has run a forensic campaign to shine a light on some of that bad practice. It is good finally to see advertisers such as Unilever beginning to deliver a tougher message to social media platforms that enough is enough.       We know we have to modernise those regulations. The commercial world and politicians on both sides are saying, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d We all fear the consequences of things going wrong with respect to the destabilisation of democracy in America\u2014but not just in America. We have seen it across the Baltics, in France, in Germany, across southern Europe and in eastern Europe. Among our NATO allies, we can see a vulnerability to our enemies using social media platforms to sow division.              2.30 pm    I was recently in NATO StratCom in Latvia, where I watched with horror as some of our soldiers, working with NATO colleagues, showed how Russia is trying to foment a race war in Britain. It is beginning to pick the messages from the two most divisive sides of an argument\u2014on one side, how radical Islam is destabilising Europe; on the other, how a new generation of neo-Nazis is on the rise\u2014and promote them. We have an unholy alliance of bad countries and bad companies coming together. We can sit on our hands or do something about it. I suggest we do something about it.  The new clause would set a deadline for Government proposals to modernise the e-commerce directive. We will have to have a debate and make a choice about how close we bring the obligations and the liabilities of social media firms to the regulations we have for newspapers. Despite the hopelessly weak regulatory regime that the Government are intent on delivering in this country, there is no way on earth that even an IPSO-regulated newspaper could get away with the kind of nonsense that we see on social media\u2014the kind of hate speech and viciousness that, more often than not I might add, is directed at women rather than men.  The new clause urges the Government to get on with that and states that by 31 January 2019\u2014a little under a year\u2019s time\u2014we would have not the final law or regulations, but a review and a set of proposals on how the e-commerce directive needed to be reformed.  To my friends in the technology industry\u2014as a former technology entrepreneur, I have many\u2014I often make the point that we did not have one factory Act during the 19th century; we had 17. As technology, the economy, and custom and practice in the workplace changed, we had to update and modernise the regulation in this country. Frankly, that is the journey we are now on.  The Secretary of State vividly and colourfully said in The Times, and in his podcast with Nick Robinson, which comes out tomorrow, that the wild west is over and a new order will descend. The new clause urges the Government to put some deeds behind those grand words.            The Minister of State, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (Margot James)           Share this contribution        I agree with everything the right hon. Gentleman has said, except that I do not think the Bill is the place for his proposals. The e-commerce directive and the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002, which transpose it into UK law, regulate services that are226;128;\ufffd       \u201cnormally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by means of electronic equipment133;and at the individual request of a recipient of a service\u201d.       Those services are known as information society services.       However, questions relating to the processing of personal data by information society services are excluded from the scope of the e-commerce directive and hence excluded from the scope of the 2002 regulations. That is because the processing of personal data is regulated by other instruments, including, from May, the GDPR. The review of the application and operation of the 2002 regulations solely in relation to the processing of personal data, as proposed by new clause 13, would therefore be a speedy review to undertake.       However, that does not address the substance of the right hon. Gentleman\u2019s concern, which we have already discussed in a delegated legislation Committee earlier this month. As I said then, the Government are aware of his concern that the e-commerce directive, finalised in 2000, is now outdated, in particular with regard to its liability provisions.       Those provisions limit, in specified circumstances, the liability that service providers have for the content on their sites. That includes social media platforms where they act as hosts. Social media companies have made limited progress on a voluntary basis, removing some particularly harmful content quickly and, in recent years, consistently. However, as we have seen in the case of National Action and its abhorrent YouTube videos, and many other lower-profile cases, there is a long way to go. We do not rule out legislation.       The Government have made it clear through our digital charter that we are committed to making the UK the safest place to be online, as well as the best place to grow a digital business. As the Prime Minister has said, when we leave the EU we will be leaving the digital single market, including the e-commerce directive. That gives us an opportunity to make sure that we get matters corrected for the modern age: supporting innovation and growth, and the use of modern technology, but doing so in a way that commands the confidence of citizens, protects their rights and makes their rights as enforceable online as they currently are offline.       The UK will be leaving the digital single market, but we will continue to work closely with the EU on digital issues as we build up our existing strong relationship in the future economic partnership. We will work closely with a variety of partners in Europe and further afield. Alongside that, our internet safety strategy will tackle the removal of harmful but legal content. Through the introduction of a social media code of practice and annual transparency report, we will place companies under an obligation to respond quickly to user reports and to ensure that their moderation processes are fit for purpose, with statutory backing if required. We have demonstrated that in the example of the introduction of age verification for online pornography.       There is an important debate to be had on the e-commerce directive and on platform liability, and we are committed to working with others, including other countries, to understand how we can make the best of existing frameworks and definitions. Consideration of the Bill in Committee and on Report are not the right places for that wide debate to be had. For those reasons, I request that the right hon. Gentleman withdraw the clause.                 226;128;\ufffd            Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I admire the Minister\u2019s concern and ambition for administrative tidiness. She reminds me of an old quote by Bevin, who said once, \u201cIf you are a purist, the place for you is not a Parliament; it is a monastery.\u201d                    Margot James           Share this contribution        A nunnery.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        In the case of the Minister, a nunnery, although Bevin was less enlightened than the hon. Lady. Here is a Bill; here is a new clause; the new clause is within scope. The object of the new clause is to deliver a Government objective, yet it is rejected. That is hard logic to follow. We have had the tremendous assurance, however, that there will be nothing less than a code of practice, so these huge data giants will be shaking in their boots in California, when they wake up. They will be genuinely concerned and no doubt already planning how they can reform their ways and stop the malpractice that we have grown all too used to. I am afraid that these amount to a collection of warm words, when what the country needs is action. With that in mind, I will push the new clause to a vote.       Question put, That the clause be read a Second time.                 Division 15  22 March 2018  <br/>The Committee divided:   Ayes: 7  Noes: 10   <br/>Question accordingly negatived.          Share this division    New Clause 16  Code on processing personal data in education  \u201c(1) The Commissioner must consult on, prepare and publish a code of practice on standards to be followed in relation to the collection, processing, publication and other dissemination of personal data concerning children and pupils in connection with the provision of education services, which relates to the rights of data subjects, appropriate to their capacity and stage of education.  (2) Before preparing a code or amendments under this section the Commissioner must consult the Secretary of State and such other persons as the Commissioner considers appropriate as set out in Clause 124 (3).  (3) In preparing a code or amendments under this section, the Commissioner must have regard\u2014  (a) that children have different capacity independent of age, including pupils who may be in provision up to the age of 25, and  (b) to the United Kingdom\u2019s obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  226;128;\ufffd       (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), \u201cthe rights of data subjects\u201d must include\u2014  (a) measures related to Articles 24(3) (responsibility of the controller), 25 (data protection by design and by default) and 32(3) (security of processing) of the GDPR;  (b) safeguards and suitable measures with regard to Articles 22(2)(b) (automated individual decision-making, including profiling), Recital 71 (data subject rights on profiling as regard a child) and 23 (restrictions) of the GDPR;  (c) the rights of data subjects to object to or restrict the processing of their personal data collected during their education, under Articles 8 (child\u2019s consent to Information Society Services), 21 (right to object to automated individual decision making, including profiling) and 18(2) (right to restriction of processing) of the GDPR;  (d) where personal data are biometric or special categories of personal data as described in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, the code should set out obligations on the controller and processor to register processing of this category of data with the Commissioner where it concerns a child, or pupil in education; and  (e) matters related to the understanding and exercising of rights relating to personal data and the provision of education services.\u201d\u2014(Liam Byrne.)  This new clause would require the Information Commissioner to consult on, prepare and publish a code of practice on standards to be followed in relation to the collection, processing, publication and other dissemination of personal data concerning children and pupils in connection with the provision of education services.  Brought up, and read the First time.            Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.       This is another entirely sensible new clause, which I hope the Government will take on board, either at this stage or on Report. We rehearsed earlier in Committee the debate about the reality and challenges of the fact that our education providers are now collecting, managing and often losing significant amounts of very personal data relating to children.       Any of us who has children at school will know the joys of ParentPay, which means that schools are collecting biometric data on our children. We know that schools are keeping exam results and all kinds of records and evaluations about our children online. Given the complexity of the GDPR and some of the costs and questions around implementing it, the complexity of the education system means that we urgently need a code of practice that schools can draw on to help them get the GDPR right, and to help our educators in their task of keeping our children\u2019s data safer than it is today.       In my argument, I will draw on the excellent contribution made on Second Reading by my noble Friend, Lord Knight, who said:       \u201cSchools routinely use commercial apps for things such as recording behaviour, profiling children, cashless payments, reporting\u201d       and so on. My noble Friend has long been an advocate of that kind of thing, but the point is that he knows, and the other place recognised, that the way school information systems operate means they are often cloud based and integrated into all sorts of other data systems. There will often be contracts in place with all sorts of education service providers, which will entail the transfer of data between, for example, a school and a third party. It could well be that that third party is based overseas. As my noble Friend said:226;128;\ufffd       \u201cSchools desperately need advice on GDPR compliance to allow them to comply with this Bill when it becomes law.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, House of Lords, 10 October 2017; Vol. 785, c. 185.]       Lord Storey rode in behind my noble Friend, saying that       \u201cyoung people probably need more protection than at any other time in our recent history.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, House of Lords, 10 October 2017; Vol. 785, c. 170.]       That is not something that has been debated only by the other place. UNICEF recently published a working paper entitled \u201cPrivacy, protection of personal information and reputation rights\u201d and said it was now       \u201cevident that children\u2019s privacy differs both in scope and application from adults\u2019 privacy\u201d       but that they experience more threats than any other group. The \u201cCouncil of Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2016-2021)\u201d echoed the same sentiment and observed:       \u201cParents and teachers struggle to keep up with technological developments\u201d.       I have a number of friends who are teachers and headteachers. They listen to me in horror when I explain that I am the shadow Minister for the Data Protection Bill, because they know this is looming and they are absolutely terrified of it. Why is that? Because they are good people and good educators; they go into teaching because they want to change the world and change children\u2019s lives, and they recognise the new obligations that are coming, but they also recognise the realities of how their schools operate today. Those people know about the proliferation of data that they and their staff are collecting. They know about the dangers and risks of that data leaking\u2014not least because most teachers I know who have some kind of pastoral care responsibility seem to spend half their time having to advise their children about what not to do with social media apps and what not to post. They are often drawn in to disputes that rage out of control on social media platforms such as Instagram.       Teachers are very alert to the dangers of this new world. They are doing a brilliant and innovative job of supporting children through it, but they are crying out now for good guidance to help them to implement the GDPR successfully.              2.45 pm      Gareth Snell           Share this contribution        I echo my right hon. Friend\u2019s points. My daughter is seven years old. I have an app on my phone that, at any time of the day, will tell me what she is doing at school. Her attendance, reward system, and school meal requirements are all recorded on it, and I can access it at any time. The school she goes to wants to keep a connection with parents, so that parents can interact comfortably. The new clause would go a long way towards allowing schools to keep that link, because the default position of schools, as I am sure my right hon. Friend would agree, is to protect children, even if that means not sharing information in the way that they would like to.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        That sounds like a terrifying application; my hon. Friend\u2019s daughter very much has my sympathies. He is absolutely right. Lord Knight made this point with such power in the other place. The technology is advancing so quickly, and schools know that if they can 226;128;\ufffdmonitor things in new, more forensic ways, that helps them to do their job of improving children\u2019s education. However, it has costs and consequences too. I hope that Her Majesty\u2019s Government will look sympathetically on the task of teachers, as they confront this 200-and-heaven-knows-what-page Bill.                    Darren Jones (Bristol North West) (Lab)           Share this contribution        Does my right hon. Friend share my concerns that, in response to a number of written parliamentary questions that I tabled, it became clear that the Government gave access to the national pupil database, which is controlled by the Government, to commercial entities, including newspapers such as The Daily Telegraph?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Yes. My hon. Friend has done an extraordinary job of exposing that minor scandal. I am surprised that it has not had more attention in the House, but hopefully once the Bill has passed it is exactly the kind of behaviour that we can begin to police rather more effectively.       I am sure that Ministers will recognise that there is a need for this. No doubt their colleagues in the Department for Education are absolutely all over it. I was talking to a headteacher in the Minister\u2019s own constituency recently\u2014an excellent headteacher, in an excellent school, who is a personal friend. The horror with which headteachers regard the arrival of the GDPR is something to behold. Heaven knows, our school leaders and our teachers have enough to do. I call on Ministers to make their task, their lives, and their mission that bit easier by accepting the new clause.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        Our schools handle large volumes of sensitive data about the children they educate. Anyone who has any involvement with the education system, either personally through their families, on their mobile phone apps, or in a professional capacity as constituency MPs, is very conscious of the huge responsibilities that school leaders have in handling that data properly and well, and in accordance with the law. As data controllers in their own right, schools and other organisations in the education system will need to ensure that they have adequate data-handling policies in place to comply with their legal obligations under the new law.       Work is going on already. The Department for Education has a programme of advice and education for school-leaders, which covers everything from blogs, a guidance video, speaking engagements, and work to encourage system suppliers to be proactive in helping schools to become GDPR-compliant. Research is also being undertaken with parents about model privacy notices that will help schools to make parents and pupils more aware of the data about children used in the sector. The Department for Education is also shaping a toolkit that will bring together various pieces of guidance and best practice to address the specific needs of those who process education data. In parallel, the Information Commissioner has consulted on guidance specifically addressing issues about the fair and lawful processing of children\u2019s data. Everyone is very alive to the issue of protecting children and their data.       At this point, the Government want to support the work that is ongoing\u2014already taking place\u2014and the provisions on guidance that are already in the Bill. Our 226;128;\ufffdconcern is that legislating for a code now could be seen as a reason for schools to wait and see, rather than continuing their preparations for the new law. But it may be that in due course the weight of argument swings in favour of a sector-specific code of practice. That can happen. It does not have to be in the Bill. It can happen because clause 128 provides that the Secretary of State may require the Information Commissioner to prepare additional codes of practice for the processing of personal data, and the commissioner can issue further guidance under her own steam, using her powers under article 57 of the GDPR, without needing any direction from the Secretary of State.       I hope that the ongoing work reassures the right hon. Gentleman and that he will withdraw the new clause at this stage.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am reassured by that and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.       Clause, by leave, withdrawn.       New Clause 17       Personal data ethics advisory board and ethics code of practice       \u2018(1) The Secretary of State must appoint an independent Personal Data Ethics Advisory Board (\u201cthe board\u201d).       (2) The board\u2019s functions, in relation to the processing of personal data to which the GDPR and this Act applies, are\u2014       (a) to monitor further technical advances in the use and management of personal data and their implications for the rights of data subjects;       (b) to monitor the protection of the individual and collective rights and interests of data subjects in relation to their personal data;       (c) to ensure that trade-offs between the rights of data subjects and the use of management of personal data are made transparently, inclusively, and with accountability;       (d) to seek out good practices and learn from successes and failures in the use and management of personal data;       (e) to enhance the skills of data subjects and controllers in the use and management of personal data.       (3) The board must work with the Commissioner to prepare a data ethics code of practice for data controllers, which must\u2014       (a) include a duty of care on the data controller and the processor to the data subject;       (b) provide best practice for data controllers and processors on measures, which in relation to the processing of personal data\u2014       (i) reduce vulnerabilities and inequalities;       (ii) protect human rights;       (iii) increase the security of personal data; and       (iv) ensure that the access, use and sharing personal data is transparent, and the purposes of personal data processing are communicated clearly and accessibly to data subjects.       (4) The code must also include guidance in relation to the processing of personal data in the public interest and the substantial public interest.       (5) Where a data controller or processor does not follow the code under this section, the data controller or processor is subject to a fine to be determined by the Commissioner.       (6) The board must report annually to the Secretary of State.

(9) The Secretary of State must, no later than one year after the day on which this Act receives Royal Assent, lay before both Houses of Parliament draft regulations in relation to the functions of the Personal Data Ethics Advisory Board as listed in subsections (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7) of this section.       (10) Regulations under this section are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.\u2019\u2014(Darren Jones.)       This new clause would establish a statutory basis for a Data Ethics Advisory Board.       Brought up, and read the First time.                    Darren Jones           Share this contribution        I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.       New clause 17 is in my name and that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill. I do not take it personally that my other hon. Friends have not signed up to it; that was probably my fault for not asking them to do so in advance.       The new clause would bring a statutory footing to the data and artificial intelligence ethics unit, which I am very pleased that the Government have now funded and established, through the spring statement, in the Minister\u2019s Department. It comes off the back of conversations with the Information Commissioner in Select Committee about the differing roles of enforcing legislation and of having a public debate about what is right and wrong and what the boundaries are in this ever-changing space. The commissioner was very clear that we need to have that debate with the public, but that it is not for her to do it. The ICO is an enforcer of legislation. The commissioner has a lot on her plate and is challenged by her own resource as it is. She felt that the new unit in the Department would be a good place to have the debate about technology ethics, and I support that assertion.       With no disrespect to any colleagues, I do not think that the House of Commons, and perhaps even the Select Committees to a certain extent, necessarily has the time, energy or resource to get into the real detail of some of the technology ethics questions, nor to take them out to the public, who are the people we need to be having the debate with.       The new clause would therefore establish in law that monitoring, understanding and public debate obligation that I, the ICO and others agree ought to exist in the new data ethics unit, but make it clear that enforcement was reserved for the Information Commissioner. I tabled the new clause because, although I welcome the Government\u2019s commitment to the data and AI ethics unit, I feel that there is potential for drift. The new clause would therefore put an anchor in the technology ethics requirement of the unit so that it understands and communicates the ethical issues and does not necessarily get sidetracked into other issues, although it may seek to do that on top of this anchor. However, I think this anchor needs to be placed.       Also, I recognise that the Minister and the Secretary of State supported the recommendation made previously under the Cameron Government and I welcome that, 226;128;\ufffdbut of course, with an advisory group within the Department, it may be a future Minister\u2019s whim that they no longer wish to be advised on these issues, or it may be the whim of the Treasury\u2014with, potentially, budget cuts\u2014that it no longer wishes to fund the people doing the work. I think that that is not good enough and that putting this provision in the Bill would give some security to the unit for the future.       I will refer to some of the comments made about the centre for data ethics and innovation, which I have been calling the data and AI ethics unit. When it was first discussed, in the autumn Budget of November 2017, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the unit would be established       \u201cto enable and ensure safe, ethical and ground-breaking innovation in AI and data-driven technologies. This world-first advisory body will work with government, regulators and industry to lay the foundations for AI adoption\u201d.       Although that is a positive message, it says to me that its job is to lay the foundations for AI adoption. I agree with that as an aim, but it does not mean that at its core is understanding and communicating the ethical challenges that we need to try to understand and legislate for.       I move on to some of the documents from the recruitment advertising for personnel to run the unit from January of this year, which said that the centre will be at the centre of plans to make the UK the best place in the world for AI businesses. Again, that is a positive statement, but one about AI business adoption in this country, not ethical requirements. It also said that the centre would advise on ethical and innovative uses of data-driven tech. Again, that is a positive statement, but I just do not think it is quite at the heart of understanding and communicating and having a debate about the ethics.       My concern is that while all this stuff is very positive, and I agree with the Government that we need to maintain our position as a world leader in artificial intelligence and that it is something we need to be very proud of\u2014especially as we go through the regrettable process of leaving the European Union and the single market, we need to hold on to the strengths we have in the British economy\u2014this week has shown that there is a need for an informed public debate on ethics. As no doubt all members of the Committee have read in my New Statesman article of today, one of the issues we have as the voice of our constituents in Parliament is that in order for our constituents to understand or take a view on what is right or wrong in this quickly developing space, we all need to understand it in the first place\u2014to understand what is happening with our data and in the technology space, to understand what is being done with it and, having understood it, to then to take a view about it. The Cambridge Analytica scandal has been so newsworthy because the majority of people understandably had no idea that all this stuff was happening with their data. How we legislate for and set ethical frameworks must first come from a position of understanding.       That is why the new clause sets out that there should be an independent advisory board. The use of such boards is commonplace across Departments and I hope that would not be a contentious question. Subsection (2) talks about some of the things that that board should do. The Minister will note that the language I have used is quite careful in looking at how the board should monitor developments, monitor the protection of rights and look out for good practice. It does not 226;128;\ufffdseek to step on the toes of the Information Commissioner or the powers of the Government, but merely to understand, educate and inform.       The new clause goes on to suggest that the new board would work with the commissioner to put together a code of practice for data controllers. A code of practice with a technology ethics basis is important because it says to every data controller, regardless of what they do or what type of work they do, that we require ethical boundaries to be set and understood in the culture of what we do with big data analytics in this country. In working with the commissioner, this board would add great value to the way that we work with people\u2019s personal data, by setting out that code of practice.       I hope that the new clause adds value to the work that the Minister\u2019s Department is already doing. My hope is that by adding it to the Bill\u2014albeit that current Parliaments cannot of course bind their successors and it could be legislated away in the future\u2014it gives a solid grounding to the concept that we take technology ethical issues seriously, that we seek to understand them properly, not as politicians or as busy civil servants, but as experts who can be out with our stakeholders understanding the public policy consequences, and that we seek to have a proper debate with the public, working with enforcers such as the ICO to set, in this wild west, the boundaries of what is and is not acceptable. I commend the new clause to the Committee and hope that the Government will support it.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising this very important subject. He is absolutely right. Data analytics have the potential to transform whole sectors of society and the economy\u2014law enforcement and healthcare to name but some. I agree with him that a public debate around the issues is required, and that is one of the reasons why the Government are creating the centre for data ethics and innovation, which he mentioned. The centre will advise the Government and regulators on how they can strengthen and improve the way that data and AI are governed, as well as supporting the innovative and ethical use of that data.              3.00 pm    The centre will look at issues relating to both personal and non-personal data. Lord Stevenson of Balmacara said in the other place that  \u201cit has not been possible to find a form of words for the powers that would be used to set up this advisory board\u201d\u2014  the board is mentioned in the new clause\u2014  \u201cwhich would be sufficiently broad to give a proper basis for the ambitions that we all share for it.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, House of Lords, 10 January 2018; Vol. 788, c. 297.]  I feel that the new clause brings us back to the point that Lord Stevenson said was problematic.  We plan to consult on the centre in the summer, after the chair has been appointed; we anticipate that appointment will be made in May. We would very much welcome the input of the hon. Member for Bristol North West, who is very knowledgeable on this issue.  The new clause would extend the commissioner\u2019s remit far beyond the application of what is required of her as the UK\u2019s supervisory authority for data protection. Given the breadth of the code that is set out in the new clause, it would essentially require the commissioner to 226;128;\ufffdbecome a regulator on a much more significant scale than at present, and it would also create an overlap with the Electoral Commission, which is a separate regulator.  Three is more here that we agree on than disagree on, but the centre for data ethics and innovation, which we are in the process of creating, will, I trust, be the answer to much of the issue raised by the hon. Gentleman in his new clause. I hope that he feels confident enough in that to withdraw it.            Darren Jones           Share this contribution        I thank the Minister for her co-operative words and for the invitation to be part of this developing area of public policy. Having already plugged my New Statesman article, I will plug a part of it, which is the news that, having worked with some of the all-party parliamentary groups, I am pleased that we will launch a commission on technology ethics with one of the Minister\u2019s colleagues, whose constituency I cannot quite remember, I am afraid, so I cannot make reference to him. But he is excellent.       We look forward to working with industry, stakeholders and politicians on a cross-party basis, to get into the debate about technology ethics. I accept the Minister\u2019s warm words about co-operating on this issue positively, so that hopefully the outcomes of this commission can perhaps help to influence the work of the unit, or centre, and the Government\u2019s response to it.       I would like this new unit to be given a statutory basis, to show its importance. It is vital that it has clout across Government and across Departments, so that it is not just a positive thing when we have Ministers who are willing to take part in and listen to this debate and instead is something that will go on with successive Ministers, should the current Minister be promoted, and with future Governments, too. However, in return for the Minister\u2019s warm words of co-operation, I am happy not to press the new clause to a vote today.                    Daniel Zeichner           Share this contribution        Very briefly, I declare an interest as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on data analytics. This is a subject, of course, that is very dear to our hearts. I will just say that there is a great deal of common ground on it. I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol North West for trying to put it into the Bill, because I, too, think it needs to be put on a statutory basis. However, I will just draw attention to a lot of the very good work that has been done by a whole range of people in bringing forward the new structures.       I will just say again that in general I think we are heaping a huge amount of responsibility on the Information Commissioner; frankly, we are now almost inviting her to save the world. She and her office will need help. So an additional body, with resources, is required.       The Royal Society and the British Academy have done a lot of work on this issue over the last few years. I will conclude by referring back to a comment made by the hon. Member for Gordon, because it is worth saying that the Royal Society and the British Academy state in the conclusions of their report:       \u201cIt is essential to have a framework that engenders trust and confidence, to give entrepreneurs and decision-makers the confidence to act now, and to realise the potential of new applications in a way that reflects societal preferences.\u201d       That is exactly the kind of thing we are trying to achieve. This body is essential and it needs to be set up as quickly as possible.                 226;128;\ufffd            Darren Jones           Share this contribution        I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.       Clause, by leave, withdrawn.       New Clause 20       Automated number plate recognition (No. 2)       \u201c(1) Vehicle registration marks captured by automated number plate recognition systems are personal data.       (2) The Secretary of State shall issue a code of practice in connection with the operation by the police of automated number plate recognition systems.       (3) Any code of practice under subsection (1) shall conform to section 67 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\u201d\u2014(Liam Byrne.)       This new clause requires the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice in connection with the operation by the police of automated number plate recognition systems, vehicle registration marks captured by which are to be considered personal data in line with the opinion of the Information Commissioner.       Brought up, and read the First time.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.       I will touch on this new clause only very briefly, because I hope the Minister will put my mind at rest with a simple answer. For some time, there has been concern that the way in which data collected by the police through automatic number plate recognition technology is not adequately ordered, organised or policed by a code of practice. A code of practice is probably required to put the police well and truly within the boundaries of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Bill.       With this new clause, we are basically asking the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice in connection with the operation by the police of ANPR systems under subsection (1), and we ask that it conform to section 67 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. I hope the Minister will just say that a code of practice is on the way so we can safely withdraw the new clause.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I hope Committee members have had the chance to see my response to the questions of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley on Tuesday about ANPR, other aspects of surveillance and other types of law enforcement activity.       I assure the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill that ANPR data is personal data and is therefore caught by the provisions of the GDPR and the Bill. We recognise the need to ensure the use of ANPR is properly regulated. Indeed, ANPR systems are governed by not one but two existing codes of practice. The first is the code issued by the Information Commissioner, exercising her powers under section 51 of the Data Protection Act 1998. It is entitled \u201cIn the picture: A data protection code of practice for surveillance cameras and personal information\u201d, and was published in June 2017. It is clear that it covers ANPR. It also refers to data protection impact assessments, which we debated last week. It clearly states that where the police and others use or intend to use an ANPR system, it is important that they226;128;\ufffd       \u201cundertake a privacy impact assessment to justify its use and show that its introduction is proportionate and necessary.\u201d       The second code is brought under section 29 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which required the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice containing guidance about surveillance camera systems. The \u201cSurveillance camera code of practice\u201d, published in June 2013, already covers the use of ANPR systems by the police and others. It sets out 12 guiding principles for system operators. Privacy is very much a part of that. The Protection of Freedoms Act established the office of the Surveillance Camera Commissioner, who has a number of statutory functions in relation to the code, including keeping its operation under review.       In addition, a published memorandum of understanding between the Surveillance Camera Commissioner and the Information Commissioner sets out how they will work together. We also have the general public law principles of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights. I hope that the two codes I have outlined, the Protection of Freedoms Act and the Human Rights Act reassure the right hon. Gentleman, and that he will withdraw his new clause.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am indeed mollified. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause.       Clause, by leave, withdrawn.

(2) The Commission may under this paragraph issue at any time a targeted dissemination disclosure notice, requiring disclosure of any settings used to disseminate material which it believes were intended to have the effect, or were likely to have the effect, of influencing public opinion in any part of the United Kingdom, ahead of a specific election or referendum, where the platform for dissemination allows for targeting based on demographic or other information about individuals, including information gathered by information society services.226;128;\ufffd       (3) This power shall not be available in respect of registered parties or their officers, save where they separately and independently fall into one or more of categories (a) to (i) of sub-paragraph (1).

Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am happy to end on a note of cross-party consensus. We agree that we need to modernise our hopelessly outdated election laws. The news a couple of hours ago that the Information Commissioner\u2019s application for a search warrant at Cambridge Analytica has been deferred\u2014suspended until tomorrow\u2014underlines the fact that the laws we have today for investigating malpractice that may impinge on the health of our democracy are hopelessly inadequate. The Information Commissioner declared to the world\u2014for some reason on live television on Monday\u2014that she was seeking a warrant to get into Cambridge Analytica\u2019s office. Five days later there is still no search warrant issued by a court. Indeed, the court has adjourned the case until tomorrow.       I suspect that Cambridge Analytica has now had quite enough notice to do whatever it likes to the evidence that the Information Commissioner sought. This basket of clauses seeks to insert common-sense provisions to update the law in a way that will ensure that the data protection regime we put in place safeguards the health and wellbeing of our democracy. We need those because of what we now know about allegedly bad companies such as Cambridge Analytica, and because of what we absolutely know about bad countries such as Russia. We have been slow to wake up to the reality that, since 2012, Russia has been operating a new generation of active measures that seek to divide and rule its enemies.       There is no legal definition of hybrid war, so there is no concept of just war when it comes to hybrid war. There is no Geneva convention for hybrid war that defines what is good and what is bad and what is legal and illegal, but most legal scholars agree that a definition 226;128;\ufffdof hybrid war basically touches on a form of intervening against enemies in a way that is deniable and sometimes not traceable. It contains a basket of measures and includes the kind of tactics that we saw deployed in Crimea and Ukraine, which were of course perfected after the invasion of Georgia. We see it in the Baltics and now we see it not just in America but across western Europe as well.       Such a technique\u2014a kind of warcraft of active measures\u2014has a very long history in Russia. Major-General Kalugin, the KGB\u2019s highest ranking defector, once described the approach as the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of Soviet intelligence. The challenge today is that that philosophy was comprehensively updated by General Gerasimov, the Russian Army\u2019s chief of staff, and it came alongside a very different world view presented by President Putin after his re-election as President in 2012 and in his first state of the union address in 2013. It was in that address that President Putin attacked what he called a de-Christianised morally ambivalent west. He set out pretty categorically a foreign policy of contention rather than co-operation.       Since 2012, we have seen what is basically a history of tactical opportunism. A little bit unlike the Soviet era, what we now have are sometimes authorised groups, sometimes rogue groups, seeking openings where they can and putting in place disruptive measures. They are most dangerous when they target the messiness of digital democracy. Here we have a kind of perfection of what I have called in the past a dark social playbook\u2014for example, hackers such as Cozy Bear or Fancy Bear attacked the Democratic National Committee during the American elections.       We also have a partnership with useful idiots such as WikiLeaks, an unholy alliance with what are politely called fake news sites such as Westmonster or indeed Russia Today or Breitbart, which spread hatred. We have a spillover into Twitter. Once a row is brewing on Twitter, we get troll farms such as the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg kicking in. Half of the tweets about NATO in the Baltics are delivered by robo-trolls out of Russia. It is on an absolutely enormous scale. Once the row is cooking on Twitter, we get the import into Facebook groups. They are private groups and dark groups, and it is perfectly possible to switch on dark money behind those ads circulating the hate material to thousands and thousands if not millions.       We know that that was standard practice in the German and French elections. There is a risk\u2014we do not know what the risk is because the Government will not launch an inquiry\u2014that such activity was going on in the Brexit campaign. I anticipate that there will be more revelations about that this weekend. However, the challenge is that our election law is now hopelessly out of date.              3.15 pm    There is a ban on political advertising on television, which is well established under section 321(2) of the Communications Act 2003. However, although political advertising is banned on television, psychographically targeted ads on Facebook are perfectly legal. In fact, the Advertising Standards Authority, which has long resiled from setting itself up as a truth commission that regulates political advertising, does not patrol or regulate political advertising on television. That is not an issue 226;128;\ufffdbecause there is no political advertising any on television, but there is a lot of it on social media platforms, where it basically goes unregulated.  In addition, we have no provisions to shut down material against hate speech, because the e-commerce directive is so out of date. The Electoral Commission has no power to pursue the foreign money coming in behind some of these dark social ads. When I pressed it on that, it was clear that it does not have the power to pursue things abroad. Ofcom, too, does not regulate the content of video on social media platforms. We therefore have a situation where none of the Electoral Commission, Ofcom and the ASA has the power needed to operate, police and regulate political advertising and political campaigns in the digital era. We learn today that the Information Commissioner does not even have the power to get a search warrant when she needs one to investigate bad behaviour when compelling evidence comes to light.  It is clear that the law is hopelessly outdated. I hope this is a subject on which we can agree. We are now at the receiving end of a new generation of active measures, which are one of the greatest threats to us since the emergence of al-Qaeda at the beginning of the century. We must redouble our defences, so the new clause would give the Electoral Commission the power to issue targeted disclosure notices that require those who seek to influence a political campaign to share with the world information about who is being targeted with what and\u2014crucially\u2014who is writing the cheques.            Margot James           Share this contribution        I will be brief in answering some of the serious matters raised by the right hon. Gentleman. The Information Commissioner, as the data regulator, is investigating alleged abuses as part of a broader investigation into the use of personal data during political campaigns. I have said many times that the Bill will add significantly to the commissioner\u2019s powers to conduct investigations, and I have confirmed that we keep an open mind and are considering actively whether further powers are needed in addition to those set out in the Bill.       The Electoral Commission is the regulator of political funding and spending. The commission seeks to bring transparency to our electoral system by enforcing rules on who can fund and how money can be spent, but new clause 21 is about sending the commission into a whole new field: that of personal data regulation. That field is rightly occupied by the Information Commissioner. We can debate whether she needs more powers in the light of the current situation at Cambridge Analytica, and as I have said we are reviewing the Bill.       While the Electoral Commission already has the power to require the disclosure of documents in relation to investigations under its current remit, new clause 21 would provide the commission with new powers to require the disclosure of the settings used to disseminate material. However, understanding how personal data is processed is outside the commission\u2019s remit.       The right hon. Gentleman suggested that his amendment would help with transparency on who is seeking to influence elections, which is very much needed in the current climate. The Government take the security and integrity of democratic processes very seriously. It is absolutely unacceptable for any third country to interfere in our democratic elections or referendums.226;128;\ufffd       On new clause 22, the rules on imprints in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 are clear. The current rules apply to printed election material no matter how it is targeted. However, the Secretary of State has the power under section 143 to make regulations covering imprints on other types of material, including online material. New clause 22 would therefore not extend the type of online material covered by such regulations. We therefore believe the new clause is unnecessary. The law already includes printed election material disseminated through the use of personal data gathered by whatever means, and the Government will provide further clarity on extending those rules to online material in due course by consulting on making regulations under the power in section 143(6).       On that basis, I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw his new clause.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        That is a deeply disappointing answer. I was under the impression that the Secretary of State said in interviews today that he is open-minded about the UK version of the Honest Ads Act that we propose. That appears to be in some contrast to the answer that the Minister offered.       What this country has today is an Advertising Standards Authority that does not regulate political advertising; Ofcom, which does not regulate video when it is online; an Electoral Commission without the power to investigate digital campaigning; and an Information Commissioner who cannot get a search warrant. Worse, we have a Financial Conduct Authority that, because it does not have a data sharing gateway with the Electoral Commission, cannot share information about the financial background of companies that might have been laundering money going into political and referendum campaigns. The law is hopelessly inadequate. Through that great hole, our enemies are driving a coach and horses, which is having a huge impact on the health and wellbeing of our democracy.       That is not a day-to-day concern in Labour constituencies, but it is for the Conservative party. Voter Consultancy Ltd took out targeted dark social ads aimed at Conservative Members, accusing some of them of being Brexit mutineers when they had the temerity to vote for common sense in a vote on Brexit in this House. Voter Consultancy Ltd, for those who have not studied its financial records at Companies House, as I have, is a dormant company. It has no accounts filed. There is no cash flowing through the books. The question that provokes is: where does the money come from for the 226;128;\ufffddark social ads attacking Conservative Members? We do not know. It is a matter of public concern that we should.       The law is out of date and needs to be updated. I will not press the matter to a vote this afternoon because I hope to return to it on Report, but I hope that between now and then the Minister and the Secretary of State reflect on the argument and talk to Mark Sedwill, the National Security Adviser, about why the national security strategy does not include an explicit objective to defend the integrity of our democracy. I hope that that change is made and that, as a consequence, further amendments will be tabled to ensure that our democracy is protected against the threats we know are out there.       I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.       Clause, by leave, withdrawn.       Question proposed, That the Chair do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.

(2) In this section, \u2018media organisation\u2019 means a body or other organisation whose activities consist of or include journalism.  (3) The guidance must include provision about relevant complaints procedures, including\u2014  (a) who runs them,  (b) what can be complained about, and  (c) how to make a complaint.  (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), relevant complaints procedures include procedures for making complaints to the Commissioner, the Office of Communications, the British Broadcasting Corporation and other persons who produce or enforce codes of practice for media organisations.  (5) The guidance must also include provision about\u2014  (a) the powers available to the Commissioner in relation to a failure to comply with the data protection legislation,  (b) when a claim in respect of such a failure may be made before a court and how to make such a claim,  (c) alternative dispute resolution procedures,  (d) the rights of bodies and other organisations to make complaints and claims on behalf of data subjects, and  (e) the Commissioner\u2019s power to provide assistance in special purpose proceedings. </p><p> (6) The Commissioner\u2014  (a) may alter or replace the guidance, and  (b) must publish any altered or replacement guidance.  (7) The Commissioner must produce and publish the first guidance under this section before the end of the period of 1 year beginning when this Act is passed.\u201d .\u2014(Matt Hancock.)  This new clause would be inserted after Clause 172. It requires the Information Commissioner to produce guidance about how individuals can seek redress where a media organisation (defined in subsection (2) of the new clause) fails to comply with the data protection legislation, including guidance about making complaints and bringing claims before a court.  Brought up, and read the First time.       1.49 pm      The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (Matt Hancock)           Share this contribution        I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.                    Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton)           Share this contribution        With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:       Government new clause 22\u2014Review of processing of personal data for the purposes of journalism.       Government new clause 23\u2014Data protection and journalism code.       New clause 18\u2014Data protection breaches by national news publishers\u2014       \u201c(1) The Secretary of State must, within the period of three months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed, establish an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 into allegations of data protection breaches committed by or on behalf of national news publishers and other media organisations.226;128;\ufffd       (2) Before setting the terms of reference of and other arrangements for the inquiry the Secretary of State must\u2014       (a) consult the Scottish Ministers with a view to ensuring, in particular, that the inquiry will consider the separate legal context and other circumstances of Scotland;       (b) consult Northern Ireland Ministers and members of the Northern Ireland Assembly with a view to ensuring, in particular, that the inquiry will consider the separate legal context and other circumstances of Northern Ireland;       (c) consult persons appearing to the Secretary of State to represent the interests of victims of data protection breaches committed by, on behalf of or in relation to, national news publishers and other media organisations; and       (d) consult persons appearing to the Secretary of State to represent the interests of news publishers and other media organisations (having regard in particular to organisations representing journalists).       (3) The terms of reference for the inquiry must include requirements\u2014       (e) to inquire into the extent of unlawful or improper conduct by or on behalf of national news publishers and other organisations within the media in respect of personal data;       (f) to inquire into the extent of corporate governance and management failures and the role, if any, of politicians, public servants and others in relation to failures to investigate wrongdoing at media organisations within the scope of the inquiry;       (g) to review the protections and provisions around media coverage of individuals subject to police inquiries, including the policy and practice of naming suspects of crime prior to any relevant charge or conviction;       (h) to investigate the dissemination of information and news, including false news stories, by social media organisations using personal data;       (i) to consider the adequacy of the current regulatory arrangements and the resources, powers and approach of the Information Commissioner and any other relevant authorities in relation to\u2014       (i) the news publishing industry (except in relation to entities regulated by Ofcom) across all platforms and in the light of experience since 2012;       (ii) social media companies;       (j) to make such recommendations as appear to the inquiry to be appropriate for the purpose of ensuring that the privacy rights of individuals are balanced with the right to freedom of expression.       (4) In setting the terms of reference for the inquiry the Secretary of State must\u2014       (k) have regard to the current context of the news, publishing and general media industry;       (l) must set appropriate parameters for determining which allegations are to be considered;       (m) determine the meaning and scope of references to national news publishers and other media organisations for the purposes of the inquiry.       (5) Before complying with subsection (4) the Secretary of State must consult the judge or other person who is likely to be invited to chair the inquiry.       (6) The inquiry may, so far as it considers appropriate\u2014       (n) consider evidence given to previous public inquiries; and       (o) take account of the findings of and evidence given to previous public inquiries (and the inquiry must consider using this power for the purpose of avoiding the waste of public resources).226;128;\ufffd       (7) This section comes into force on Royal Assent.\u201d       This new clause would require the establishment of an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 as recommended by Lord Justice Leveson for Part two of his Inquiry.       New clause 20\u2014Publishers of news-related material: damages and costs (No. 2)\u2014       \u201c(1) This section applies where\u2014       (a) a relevant claim for breach of the data protection legislation is made against a person (\u2018the defendant\u2019),       (b) the defendant was a relevant publisher at the material time, and       (c) the claim is related to the publication of news-related material.       (2) If the defendant was a member of an approved regulator at the time when the claim was commenced (or was unable to be a member at that time for reasons beyond the defendant\u2019s control or it would have been unreasonable in the circumstances for the defendant to have been a member at that time), the court must award costs against the claimant unless satisfied that\u2014       (d) the issues raised by the claim could not have been resolved by using an arbitration scheme of the approved regulator, or       (e) it is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case, including, for the avoidance of doubt\u2014       (i) the conduct of the defendant, and       (ii) whether the defendant pleaded a reasonably arguable defence, to make a different award of costs or make no award of costs.       (3) If the defendant was not an exempt relevant publisher and was not a member of an approved regulator at the time when the claim was commenced (but would have been able to be a member at that time and it would have been reasonable in the circumstances for the defendant to have been a member at that time), the court must award costs against the defendant unless satisfied that\u2014       (f) the issues raised by the claim could not have been resolved by using an arbitration scheme of the approved regulator (had the defendant been a member), or       (g) it is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case, including, for the avoidance of doubt\u2014       (i) the conduct of the claimant, and       (ii) whether the claimant had a reasonably arguable claim, to make a different award of costs or make no award of costs.       (4) This section is not to be read as limiting any power to make rules of court.       (5) This section does not apply until such time as a body is first recognised as an approved regulator.\u201d       This new clause would provide that court costs of non-abusive, non-vexatious, and non-trivial libel and intrusion claims would be awarded against a newspaper choosing not to join a Royal Charter-approved regulator offering low-cost arbitration, but that newspapers who do join such a regulator would be protected from costs awards even if they lose a claim.       New clause 21\u2014Publishers of news-related material: interpretive provisions (No. 2)\u2014       \u201c(1) This section applies for the purposes of section (Publishers of news-related material: damages and costs (No. 2)).       (2) \u201cApproved regulator\u201d means a body recognised as a regulator of relevant publishers.       (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), a body is \u201crecognised\u201d as a regulator of relevant publishers if it is so recognised by any body established by Royal Charter (whether established before or after the coming into force of this section) with the purpose of carrying on activities relating to the recognition of independent regulators of relevant publishers.226;128;\ufffd       (4) \u201cRelevant claim\u201d means a civil claim made in respect of data protection under the data protection legislation, brought in England or Wales by a claimant domiciled anywhere in the United Kingdom.       (5) The \u201cmaterial time\u201d, in relation to a relevant claim, is the time of the events giving rise to the claim.       (6) \u201cNews-related material\u201d means\u2014       (a) news or information about current affairs,       (b) opinion about matters relating to the news or current affairs, or       (c) gossip about celebrities, other public figures or other persons in the news.       (7) A relevant claim is related to the publication of news-related material if the claim results from\u2014       (d) the publication of news-related material, or       (e) activities carried on in connection with the publication of such material (whether or not the material is in fact published).       (8) A reference to the \u201cpublication\u201d of material is a reference to publication\u2014       (f) on a website,       (g) in hard copy, or       (h) by any other means,       and references to a person who \u201cpublishes\u201d material are to be read accordingly.       (9) A reference to \u201cconduct\u201d includes a reference to omissions; and a reference to a person\u2019s conduct includes a reference to a person\u2019s conduct after the events giving rise to the claim concerned.       (10) \u201cRelevant publisher\u201d has the same meaning as in section 41 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013.       (11) A relevant publisher is exempt if it satisfies Condition A or B.       (12) Condition A is that the publisher has a constitution which\u2014       (a) requires any surplus income or gains to be reinvested in the publisher, and       (b) does not allow the distribution of any of its profits or assets (in cash or in kind) to members or third parties.       (13) Condition B is that the publisher\u2014       (a) publishes predominantly in Scotland, or predominantly in Wales, or predominantly in Northern Ireland or predominantly in specific regions or localities; and       (b) has had an average annual turnover not exceeding 163;100 million over the last five complete financial years.\u201d       This new clause would provide that the penalty incentives in New Clause 20 would not apply to companies which publish only on a regional or local basis and have an annual turnover of less than 163;100m. It sets out that only data protection claims are eligible, and provides further interpretive provisions.

Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        The Data Protection Bill sets out a full new data protection regime for Britain, giving people more control over their data.       First, I wish to address new clauses 20 and 21, before turning to the other new clauses. These new clauses are essentially the provisions contained in sections 40 and 42 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, although they would apply only to breaches of data protection law and only in England and Wales.       Let me first set out exactly what these new clauses would mean and then our approach to them. They would set new cost provisions for complaints against the press, which means that any publication not regulated by Impress would have to pay the legal costs for any complaint against it, whether it won or lost. Many would object to that and say that it goes against natural justice. It is grounds enough to reject these new clauses on the basis that the courts would punish a publication that has done no wrong, but that is not the only reason. Let us consider the impact of these new clauses on an editor. Faced with any criticism, of any article, by anyone with the means to go to court, a publication would risk having to pay costs, even if every single fact in a story was true and even if there was a strong public interest in publishing. Let us take, for example, Andrew Norfolk, the admirable journalist who uncovered the Rotherham child abuse scandal. He said that section 40 would have made it \u201cnear impossible\u201d to do his job. He went on to say that it would have been \u201cinconceivable\u201d to run the front page story naming one of the abusers in a scandal that had ruined the lives of 1,400 innocent young people with disgusting crimes that had gone on for years and years and years. Without Andrew Norfolk\u2019s story, the scandal would have gone on for years and years more.                    Ian C. Lucas (Wrexham) (Lab)           Share this contribution        If the Secretary of State is so opposed to section 40, why did he support it?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I will come on to what has changed in the many years since 2013, not least of which is the fact that we now have a full-blown independent press regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which did not exist back then.                    Bill Wiggin (North Herefordshire) (Con)           Share this contribution        I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. First, IPSO is not a press regulator, because it does not comply with the requirements to be a regulator; it is merely a complaints handler. Secondly, he may have inadvertently misled the House, because it is not necessary to join Impress as he said earlier on. It is necessary for regulators to comply with the rules, which is slightly different.                 226;128;\ufffd            Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        There is no recognised press regulator other than Impress. As many journalists have pointed out, the truth is that these new clauses would have made it near impossible to uncover some of the stories of abuse, including the abuse of all those children in Rotherham. Another example is that of Mark Stephens, who represented phone hacking victims. He wrote today that the new clauses would       \u201creturn Britain to the legal Dark Ages and make it easier for wealthy people to suppress negative stories.\u201d       The impact on local newspapers, too, risks being catastrophic. I say do not just take my word for it. The editor of the Express &amp; Star, well known to the hon. Member for West Bromwich East (Tom Watson), said that the new clauses could spell the end of newspaper printing in this country on a large scale and are a       \u201cludicrous and patently unfair133;piece of legislation.\u201d                    Liam Byrne (Birmingham, Hodge Hill) (Lab)           Share this contribution        Will the Secretary of State confirm to the House that the BBC, Channel 4 and every other broadcaster operates under much more stringent rules, and yet nothing seems to have got in the way of their powers of interrogation and investigation? Does he think that they are operating second-class investigations today?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        We have three separate systems of media regulation in this country: a separate system for broadcasters; an essentially self-regulated system under IPSO for newspapers; and then there is the issue of how we make sure that what happens online is properly regulated as well. I will come on to that last point, because it is a very important part of the debate. The impact of the new clauses on the local press should not be underestimated. Two hundred local newspapers have already closed since 2005, and these new clauses would accelerate that decline. However, there is one national newspaper that is carved out in the small print of the new clauses as it only covers newspapers run for profit. Which newspaper is exempted? It is The Guardian. If those who tabled these new clauses thought that they were making friends with The Guardian, they were wrong. The Guardian has said that       \u201cthe Data Protection Bill should not be used as a vehicle for imposing an unfair and partial system on publishers.\u201d       It did not ask for the measures, and it, too, opposes them. Indeed, in a recent consultation, 79% of direct responses favoured full repeal of section 40, compared with just 7% who favoured full commencement.                    Chris Philp (Croydon South) (Con)           Share this contribution        The Secretary of State quoted The Guardian. In fact, its statement released this morning went even further. The Guardian News and Media said that these new clauses would       \u201cfurther erode press freedom and have a chilling effect on the news media.\u201d                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        It did, yes. I am trying to ensure that we have a debate on these measures that takes into account the fact that, yes, we want a free press that can hold the powerful to account, but also that it is fair. I know\u2014as does everyone in this House\u2014that there has been irresponsible behaviour by the press. Although I want to see a press that is free to report without fear or favour, to uncover wrongdoing and to hold the powerful to account, I also want to see a press that is fair and 226;128;\ufffdaccurate. I am determined that we have a strengthened system so that people have recourse to justice when things go wrong.                    Tom Tugendhat (Tonbridge and Malling) (Con)           Share this contribution        Does my right hon. Friend agree that, in many ways, there are two forms of media already operating in this country? One is printed, published and broadcast from reputable sources, which have assets in this country that we can take action against, or not, and the other form is websites that have either very low assets or no assets in this country with very different accountability. Bizarrely, could we not find ourselves in a position under this system where the only people who can get justice are those who are rich enough, such as Peter Thiel, to destroy the website Gawker, in this case, because it was acting against him, rather than those of us on more modest means who would have absolutely no recourse against these organisations, but yet all the news would have gone online because these regulations would force out our newspapers?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        My hon. Friend is completely right about the gap between online and print in terms of standards of regulation. That is because IPSO was brought into force\u2014I was glad to see it being introduced in 2014. He is also right that tackling the problems online is critical. Our internet safety strategy, which will be published in the next couple of weeks, will address that matter directly. I know that there are many Members who have concerns about the impact of content online, of abuse online, and of the ability to get redress online, and we will not let that rest. We will ensure that we take action to tackle the problems online in the same way that IPSO deals with the press and indeed that these new clauses deal with publications in the press.       I am glad that IPSO now has the power to require front page corrections as it did, for instance, just a couple of weeks ago with The Times. As the House knows, I have pushed IPSO to bring in further measures. It recently introduced a system of compulsory low-cost arbitration. This means that ordinary people who do not have large sums of money can take claims to newspapers for as little as 163;50. Almost all of the major national newspapers have signed up to it. That means that anyone who has been wronged by a national newspaper can, for the first time, ask for arbitration and the newspaper cannot refuse. The scheme applies not just to words, but to images. This must be the start of a tougher regime, and not the conclusion.                    Mr Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con)           Share this contribution        Is not one of the problems that the scheme does not include everyone? It is compulsory, but does not include everyone. When the MailOnline is excluded, does that not leave a whacking great hole in it?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I have a lot of sympathy with the views of my hon. Friend. The MailOnline is, of course, an online publication, and we are looking at that as part of our internet safety strategy. I am very happy to talk to him about how that can be done. Only in the past week, however, many publications have joined the IPSO low-cost arbitration scheme, which is binding on them, and I very much hope that more will join in the future.                 226;128;\ufffd            Mrs Anne Main (St Albans) (Con)           Share this contribution        Will my right hon. Friend also confirm that the new scheme will allow for a higher maximum level of damages of up to 163;60,000 and that it can be run for as little as 163;100?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        That is absolutely right. The minimum access cost will be 163;50, which means that everybody has access to justice at low cost. There is more to it than that, however. Some people argue that the 163;60,000 limit on damages is too low, but the arbitration scheme does not stop somebody going to court, so there is access to justice where damages should be higher. The arbitration scheme is an addition to, rather than a replacement for, going to court. It introduces a robust and fair system that is easy for everybody to access, so everyone can have access to justice.       The section 40 amendments would, ironically, have the opposite effect, because anybody with the means to take small newspapers to court could stop them publishing stories for fear of having to pay the costs, even if they get everything right.                    Dr Andrew Murrison (South West Wiltshire) (Con)           Share this contribution        Is it not the case that IPSO proposed its arbitration scheme only when a number of colleagues had tabled amendments that were distinctly unhelpful to the print media? Can we trust that organisation? Will my right hon. Friend be extremely careful about removing the boot from the neck of IPSO, particularly in relation to the review period? I know that he will come on to talk about that shortly, but will he consider tightening the review period, because at the moment it gives IPSO the best part of a decade before there is any prospect of further change if the industry does not behave itself?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I agree with the sentiment, which is that we have to ensure that the press remains free but also fair and reasonable, and that is the purpose of the amendment proposing a review period of four years. We will not let matters lie.       Some have asked, \u201cWhat happens if newspapers pull out of the IPSO scheme?\u201d I think that would send a terrible signal of the newspaper industry\u2019s attitude to the standards that it rightly ought to sign up to. The review is there precisely to address my hon. Friend\u2019s concerns.                    Vicky Ford (Chelmsford) (Con)           Share this contribution        I am pleased to hear the Secretary of State refer to a low-cost scheme. People have told me about their concern that 163;60,000 may be too low because there needs to be a deterrent. Will the four-year review also cover that 163;60,000 cap?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        Given that this is a Data Protection Bill, the review will consider data protection issues, but I would expect it to be as broad as necessary, to ensure that all those matters are considered.       We have listened to concerns raised during the passage of the Bill, including in this debate.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way just before he moves off the subject of IPSO. He has set out arguments in IPSO\u2019s defence. It is not just Mail Online that is outside the arbitration scheme; that is also true of Newsquest and Archant, so a significant chunk of the press are outside it. Brian 226;128;\ufffdLeveson said that the regulator needed to have independent board members, independence of operation, fair remedy for complaints, the ability to carry out investigations, the ability to issue fines, and universal arbitration. None of those conditions is put in place by IPSO, so which of those principles does the Secretary of State think should be retired?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        On the contrary, the scheme introduces new, compulsory, low-cost arbitration to ensure that people can have exactly the recourse to justice mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman. In order to address some of the concerns, we have tabled two new clauses. First, new clause 19 requires the Information Commissioner to publish information on how people can get redress. The point is to ensure that there is a plain English guide to help anyone with a complaint to navigate the system. Secondly, new clause 22 requires the Information Commissioner to create a statutory code of practice, setting out standards on data protection. The point is that, when investigating a breach of data protection law, the commissioner has to decide whether a journalist acted reasonably. When making that judgment, a failure to comply with the statutory code will weigh heavily against the journalist.                    Mr Jim Cunningham (Coventry South) (Lab)           Share this contribution        How binding is the arbitration, and how binding is the code of practice?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        The arbitration is binding on the newspapers, meaning that anybody who wants to get redress from a newspaper in the scheme can do so up to a limit of 163;60,000, and then the recourse is through the courts. The Information Commissioner\u2019s statutory code of practice is binding with respect to data protection standards; after all, this is a Data Protection Bill, so that is what is in scope.       Taken together, the changes from IPSO and the new clauses mean that Britain will have the most robust system we have ever had of redress for press intrusion and it will be accessible to all. It will achieve that and the benefits of high-quality journalism, without the negative effect that section 40 would have.                    Joanna Cherry (Edinburgh South West) (SNP)           Share this contribution        I thank the Secretary of State for giving way; he is being very generous in taking interventions. Before he finishes his peroration on the new clauses, will he confirm that they are purely procedural and will give members of the public, including our constituents, absolutely no new rights whatsoever?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        No, that is not right. The statutory code of practice for journalists must be a consideration in the Information Commissioner\u2019s judgments, and a failure to comply with the statutory code will weigh against the journalist in law. It has precisely the impact that we are trying to bring about.       New clause 18, tabled by the former Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband), requires the Government to, in effect, reopen the Leveson inquiry, but only in relation to data protection. I want to say something specific and technical about the new clause. Even on its own terms, it would not deliver Leveson 2 as envisaged. It focuses on 226;128;\ufffddata protection breaches, not the broad question of the future of the press. The new clause, therefore, is not appropriate for those who want to vote for Leveson 2.       The first Leveson inquiry lasted more than a year and heard the evidence of more than 300 people, including journalists, editors and victims. The inquiry was a diligent and thorough examination of the culture, practices and ethics of our press, in response to illegal and improper press intrusion. There were far too many cases of terrible behaviour, and having met some of the victims, I understand the impact that had. The inquiry was followed by three major police investigations, leading to more than 40 criminal convictions. More than 163;48 million was spent on the police investigations and the inquiry.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        This is probably a good point for the Secretary of State to remind the House about Brian Leveson\u2019s view of the future of the inquiry. Will he set that out for us?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        Sir Brian was very clear in his letter to me. He stated that he wanted the inquiry to continue on a different basis. I think, having considered his view and others, that the best approach is to ensure that we do the work necessary to improve the standards of the press, but we do it based on what is needed now to improve things in the future. I will come back to that.                    Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con)           Share this contribution        I am glad that my right hon. Friend acknowledges the diligence and hard work of Sir Brian Leveson in the inquiry. He highlighted the particular vice of corrupt police officers giving the names of persons\u2014perhaps whose premises are being searched\u2014to corrupt journalists who publish them before charge, and very often those people are never charged. No amount of redress can undo that damage. Will my right hon. Friend meet me and other concerned Members to consider revisions and what additional legal protection can be given to people post-charge to prevent this trade in muck and dirt, sometimes without anybody ever coming before a criminal court, which undermines the presumption in favour of innocence?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        Yes, I will. My hon. Friend makes a very important point. We are discussing the rules around the disclosure of the names of people who are under investigation before arrest. This is a sensitive area, and we have got to get it right. I want to work with colleagues and others to explore the reporting restriction rules further, and I look forward to meeting him and any others who share those concerns.                    Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) (Con)           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way; it is very generous of him. Some years ago, I put forward a private Member\u2019s Bill calling for anyone who was accused to keep their anonymity until they were charged. It is all there\u2014it is effectively good to go. I too would very much like to meet the Secretary of State, because this is the right thing to do. People should not be named before they are even charged, unless a judge orders otherwise.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I am aware of my right hon. Friend\u2019s proposals, and I look forward to meeting her. Getting the details of this right is incredibly important, and I am happy to take that forward.                 226;128;\ufffd            Mr Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe) (Con)           Share this contribution        To go back to the key question of holding an inquiry, the Secretary of State rather implies that the first Leveson inquiry is closed and we now face the possibility of starting a new one. Does he not accept that, from the moment it was set up, the Leveson inquiry was always going to be in two parts? That was the commitment of the Government in which he and I served. It was only suspended so that police operations could take place, and it was quite clearly agreed that part 2 of the inquiry would then resume. The case he has to make is: why is he cancelling a previously promised inquiry endorsed by Leveson? What on earth is the reason for stopping investigations into the kind of things we are all talking about? No one would stop investigations of this kind against any other body in this country.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I have a huge amount of respect for my right hon. and learned Friend. I was about to come on to precisely the reason for that. The reason is that inquiries are not costless, and not just in terms of taxpayers\u2019 money; that is one consideration, but inquiries also take hours of official time and ministerial time. They divert energy and public attention\u2014[Interruption.] Hold on. The question for the House is this: given all the other challenges facing the press, is this inquiry the right use of resources?       There is something in the calls to reopen the inquiry that implies that the problem is that we do not know what happened, but we do know what happened, and then we had police investigations and the convictions. It is fundamental that we get to the bottom of the challenges that the press face today. I want to divert our attention and resources to tackling and rising to the problems of today and ensuring we have a press that is both free and fair.                    Mr Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford and Woodford Green) (Con)           Share this contribution        In answer to the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke), surely the question here is not that further issues should not be settled, such as those that have been raised, but how one should go about it. An open-ended continuation of this inquiry will not necessarily resolve those issues but could travel into all sorts of areas, which would take time. Will the Secretary of State commit to dealing with all these issues raised in a more effective way, rather than just opening a further point in the inquiry? That is the point.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        Yes, and my right hon. Friend has pre-empted what I was about to say, which is that the choice is not between doing something and doing nothing, but between doing something and doing something better. New clause 18 calls on us to go into a backward-looking inquiry when what we need to do is ensure that we allow the press to rise to the challenges we face today.                    Paul Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab)           Share this contribution        I thank the Secretary of State for giving way, not least in view of what I am going to say. Is the truth not that he has broken promises to the victims, ignored the opinions of Sir Brian Leveson and ridden roughshod over the cross-party, unanimous opinion of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee? Much has happened since Leveson 1, and one thing that Leveson 2 could establish is who told 226;128;\ufffdSir Brian the truth and nothing but the truth the first time round. Why is the Secretary of State afraid of establishing the truth?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I want to focus on the challenges we face now. That is my job as Secretary of State, and it is my judgment as to what the proposals I have put forward do, and do in a better way than re-establishing the inquiry.              2.15 pm      Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset) (Con)           Share this contribution        Has this not been decided in the jewel of our legal system\u2014that is to say, in front of a jury? Some people accused of things that would have been part of Leveson 2 have been acquitted, and a very few have been convicted, but once someone has been tried in front of a jury, it is fundamentally unfair, unjust and a question of double jeopardy if they are then brought before another tribunal and put once more on oath to repeat evidence that they have given before and then been acquitted for. It would be against British justice to proceed in that way.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        The police inquiries and the prosecutions that followed were exhaustive, so much so that in 2015, the Director of Public Prosecutions said that the end had been reached of the need to inquire further into those criminal acts. Of course, the criminal acts were punished, and people were convicted and went to prison.       Crucially, the arrival of the internet has fundamentally changed the landscape. That was not addressed at the core of the first Leveson inquiry, but it must be addressed. Later this month we will publish our internet safety strategy, as I mentioned, in which we will set out the action we need to take to ensure that the online world is better policed. Many colleagues have raised with me huge concerns about online abuse and the inability to get redress. That is a significant challenge for the future, and we must address it.       However, the internet has also fundamentally undermined the business model of our printed press. Today\u2019s core challenge is how to ensure a sustainable future for high-quality journalism that can hold the powerful to account. The rise of clickbait, disinformation and fake news is putting our whole democratic discourse at risk. This is an urgent problem that is shaking the foundations of democracies worldwide. Liberal democracies such as Britain cannot survive without the fourth estate, and the fourth estate is under threat like never before. These amendments would exacerbate that threat and undermine the work we are doing through the Cairncross review and elsewhere to support sustainable journalism.       The terms of reference of part 2 of the inquiry have already largely been met. Where action is needed, I do not back down from taking it. The culture that allowed phone hacking to become the norm has changed fundamentally and must stay that way. We have already seen reforms of police practices, with a new code of conduct for the College of Policing. As I said, we are discussing rules around disclosure. I can confirm that we have asked Her Majesty\u2019s inspectorate of constabulary to undertake a new review of how police forces are adhering to new media relations guidance, as recommended by Sir Brian, and we will not hesitate to strengthen the rules further if that is needed.                 226;128;\ufffd            Andy Slaughter (Hammersmith) (Lab)           Share this contribution        The Secretary of State has talked about victims of abuse, but he seems to have forgotten that Leveson was set up because of the victims of press harassment and abuse in the first place. Many of those victims have written to Members on both sides of the House, rejecting the ridiculous IPSO scheme and asking for part 2 of Leveson to proceed. He has heard concerns from Members on both sides of the House today, so why will he not think again? What has changed his mind about those victims over the last three or four years?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        In the period in which people have raised concerns and said that they must be looked into in Leveson 2, every one that has been raised with me was covered in Leveson 1. Leveson 1 was exhaustive, and there were then police investigations, which went further. My judgment is about what is right now, and the challenges the press face now are fundamentally different.                    Christine Jardine (Edinburgh West) (LD)           Share this contribution        Does the Secretary of State accept that many of the challenges that the press face now are the result of the behaviour that led to Leveson 1 and undermined public confidence? The fact that the victims are not perceived as having had justice further undermines the press, and we would be helping the future of the press in this country if we continued along the lines of Leveson 2 and looked at how best to implement the recommendations of Leveson 1.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I think the representations from the press themselves show that they are not looking for help of that sort. Let us, however, look at the public: there is not a great public cry for this. In response to the consultation, 79% of direct responses favoured the full repeal of section 40. It is my job to address what we face now and the needs of the country now.                    Ian Paisley (North Antrim) (DUP)           Share this contribution        The Secretary of State has made the very interesting point that he will try to address some of the grievances and outcomes by way of a review. Doing so specifically in relation to Northern Ireland was in effect precluded by the first part of Mr Leveson\u2019s inquiry. Will the Secretary of State tell us how he will try to resolve this problem in Northern Ireland?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        Through new clause 23, as I have mentioned, we will require the Information Commissioner to conduct a statutory review of media compliance with the new law over the next four years. Alongside that review, we propose to have a named person review the standards of the press in Northern Ireland, and we will take that forward as part of and alongside new clause 23.                    Ian Paisley           Share this contribution        I thank the Secretary of State for his generosity. Would it be fair for me to characterise that review as a Leveson for Northern Ireland?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I would characterise it as a review aligned with new clause 23, which we are bringing in for the whole country, specifically to look at the effects in Northern Ireland. The crucial point is that we will make sure, through the review in new clause 23, that the future of the press is both free and reasonable, that its 226;128;\ufffdbehaviour is reasonable, and yet that it is not subject to statutory regulation. I want to see a press that is both free and fair.                    Edward Miliband (Doncaster North) (Lab)           Share this contribution        This is an extraordinary way to make policy. Will the Secretary of State explain to us why there can be a Leveson for Northern Ireland, but not for the rest of the United Kingdom?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I have explained that new clause 23, which I hope the right hon. Gentleman supports, will bring in a review in the future of behaviour following the new system that we are putting into place. That is true here, and it is true right across the country.                    Ian C. Lucas           Share this contribution        May I bring the Secretary of State back to the United Kingdom and to Manchester last year? The Kerslake review said:       \u201cThe panel was shocked and dismayed by the accounts of the families of their experiences with some of the media.\u201d       That happened last year, so the Secretary of State should not represent the threats posed by press misbehaviour as being from the past; this is a real and pressing problem now. Will he keep his promise to the victims who have suffered from this in the past and are continuing to suffer from it?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        New clause 23 is for the whole of the UK, which includes Northern Ireland. On the hon. Gentleman\u2019s broader point, I have read the Kerslake review, and we asked to see all the evidence that fed into it, but we have not received specific allegations. The crucial point is that the low-cost IPSO arbitration is precisely to make sure that everybody has access to justice and that the press improves the way in which it behaves so that it is both free and fair, and that is what we want to achieve.                    Dr Lisa Cameron (East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow) (SNP)           Share this contribution        The Secretary of State may not be aware of this, but my daughter, aged seven, was spoken to and recorded by a journalist in 2016. The incident, which was in our own garden, traumatised her greatly, as has been stated by her school and by her doctor, but it was ignored by IPSO. Will he meet me and my daughter to explain how children like her will be protected by his amendments and what he is trying to do, because she has no faith in the system?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        Yes, I absolutely will. This is the sort of thing that I am trying to put right. It is about making sure that the system is right now: rather than going over the past\u2014there is an enormous amount of evidence of what happened in the past\u2014this is about making sure that we look to the future.       The hon. Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley) mentioned Northern Ireland and the review I have committed to in Northern Ireland will take place at the same time as the review under new clause 23 for the UK that is before the House.                    Tom Watson (West Bromwich East) (Lab)           Share this contribution        Further to the point made by the hon. Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley) about the special review for Northern 226;128;\ufffdIreland, may I ask the Secretary of State in reference to the Hurst case\u2014the former Army intelligence officer whose computers were hacked by newspaper journalists working for newspapers in England about his activities protecting our state in Northern Ireland\u2014whether his review will also examine such criminal activity?                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        If there are allegations of criminal activity\u2014the hon. Gentleman has just made such an allegation\u2014then that is a matter for the courts.                    Tom Watson           Share this contribution        A newspaper group has admitted liability for criminally hacking the computers of a former Army intelligence officer.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        In a way, the hon. Gentleman has summed up my case. My case is that we want a press that is free and that is fair. Statutes already exist to ensure that, when there are cases of wrongdoing, people can be brought to account through the courts. That already exists, and we now also have a system of compulsory, low-cost arbitration to make sure everybody can get recourse.       I am focused on ensuring that we have high-quality political discourse and a press that can survive and thrive, with high-quality journalists who can hold the powerful to account, and on ensuring that we face the challenges of today rather than those of yesterday. That is what we want to work towards, and new clauses 18, 20 and 21 would make it harder to find solutions to today\u2019s real problems.                    Ian Paisley           Share this contribution        The Secretary of State will correct me if I am wrong, but new clause 23, to which he has referred at the Dispatch Box, looks at cases going forward; it is not retrospective\u2014I hope I am correct. Therefore, it addresses some of the deficiencies in the other new clauses before the House about having just a consultation process on what has happened previously.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        New clause 23 is about ensuring that in the future there is a review of activity from now onwards, and alongside it we will ensure that there is a named person to ensure that the issues in Northern Ireland are looked into properly.       Overall, I want to ensure that the law that applies to the press is applied fairly, and that we have a free press and one that is responsible. I therefore oppose new clauses 18, 20 and 21, which would make that more difficult, not easier, and I urge every Member of the House to do the same.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I rise to support in particular new clause 18, in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband), and indeed our new clause 20 and the consequential amendments.       The background to this is fairly well rehearsed, but it is worth remembering the level of shock we all felt when the revelations about phone hacking first became public. It is worth remembering the shock we felt when we heard that Milly Dowler\u2019s phone had been hacked. It does not often happen in this House that Members on both sides unite to try to construct a shared way forward through an extremely difficult problem, yet that is exactly what we managed to do with the Leveson inquiry.226;128;\ufffd       That was very difficult, but it was always going to be a game of two halves. There were too many cases coming to court at the time; there was too much evidence still under wraps; and there was too much that had to be left in the dark. As the Father of the House so rightly pointed out, it was never a question of opening a new inquiry; this is about letting the existing inquiry actually finish its work.       When the previous Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, having spoken to victims, made a statement, the point he wanted to impress on Members on both sides of the House was the need for Leveson to finish the job:       \u201cOne of the things that the victims have been most concerned about is that part 2 of the investigation should go ahead\u2014because of the concerns about that first police investigation and about improper relationships between journalists and police officers. It is right that it should go ahead, and that is fully our intention.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, 29 November 2012; Vol. 554, c. 458.]       The then Prime Minister was not speaking simply on his own behalf; he was speaking on behalf of Government Members, including members of today\u2019s Government Front Bench such as the Chief Whip, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith), who wrote not too long ago to one of his constituents:       \u201cThe Government has been clear all along that the status quo is not an option and I, personally, am determined to see Lord Justice Leveson\u2019s principles implemented.\u201d       Where has that commitment gone this afternoon?              2.30 pm      Paul Farrelly           Share this contribution        May I add another voice? There is no journalist more respected on these shores than Sir Harold Evans, the former editor of The Sunday Times. He wrote to everybody today in support of the previous Government\u2019s promises:       \u201cWhatever your party, I and many of my associates, look to you to honour that commitment. To renege would be an affront to every citizen who suffered intrusion, but also the many independently-minded journalists of talent and integrity.\u201d       Is it not time today for fair and independently minded MPs to vote as Sir Harry advises?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. What strengthens his argument is the way in which the Secretary of State has sought to bring forward one argument after another, all of which have been knocked down.       When we were first told that Leveson 2 could not proceed, we were told that there had been a day, sometime in about 2010, when magically, all of a sudden, all the abuse that we had ever heard about before categorically, unequivocally and without doubt ceased. We were all quite surprised about that. We were even more surprised, therefore, when John Ford presented his evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 13 March. It is worth setting out what Mr Ford said, because not everyone luxuriates in membership of that Committee:       \u201cI illegally accessed phone accounts, bank accounts, credit cards, and other personal data of public figures133; My targets included politicians of all parties. In most cases, this was done without any legitimate public interest justification.\u201d       Mr Ford goes on to reflect on whether the practice had magically ended, as the Secretary of State asserted, or whether it was ongoing. He was asked directly to 226;128;\ufffdreflect on the Secretary of State\u2019s assertion that it was all over\u2014nothing more to see; time to walk on by. Mr Ford writes in his letter:       \u201cI am sorry to inform you that Mr Hancock is totally wrong\u201d.       Who can imagine such a thing? He goes on to say that       \u201chaving spent 15 years in the business, it is no surprise133;that I still know people in the illegal data theft industry, and specifically,\u201d\u2014       this is the nub of the argument\u2014       \u201cthat I know individuals who are still engaged in these activities on behalf of newspapers.\u201d       The idea that magically this bad behaviour suddenly stopped and is not ongoing is argument one that has been knocked down.                    Peter Heaton-Jones (North Devon) (Con)           Share this contribution        As reprehensible as those activities are, the fundamental point is that they are criminal acts. They are against the law. The right hon. Gentleman is wrong to conflate that point with the question of press regulation. Those are criminal acts to be dealt with by the courts.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Actually, it is not wrong to conflate press regulation with these matters, because the purpose of press regulation, in case the hon. Gentleman has not spotted it, is to try to stop such offences happening again. That is how public policy tends to be made in this country.                    Ian C. Lucas           Share this contribution        Is it not extremely relevant that one of the main aims of Leveson 2 was to investigate the relationship between the police and the press, because the police are the people who look into illegal acts and there has been evidence in the past of corruption involving the exchange of information between the police and the press, some of which has affected how Government Members have been presented? Independent-minded Members of the House should be looking into that, not suppressing it. Is it not right that that is looked into?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        My hon. Friend is precisely right. We heard a couple of different arguments from the Secretary of State this afternoon, but they boil down to this: \u201cInquiries are expensive and time consuming, and officials have a lot of better work to do, unless you live in Northern Ireland, in which case we will crack on with the job now.\u201d                    Hannah Bardell (Livingston) (SNP)           Share this contribution        Are not culture and criminality very closely linked in these matters and the changes proposed by Opposition Members fair and proportionate? I was disappointed to hear the Secretary of State\u2019s very loose sense of history\u2014of what is more recent and what is in the past. The families of Kirsty Maxwell and Julie Pearson, two of my constituents who were both killed abroad, were harassed by the press. In the case of Kirsty Maxwell, a particular tabloid harassed the family to the detriment of other good and decent journalists, because the family were too scared to speak to the press. Any fair-minded and decent journalist will support these changes.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        That point is well put by the hon. Lady. If there is one ambition that we share in this House, it should be not only for a free press, but for a clean press. The idea that there is nothing to see and that we should all walk on by has collapsed.                 226;128;\ufffd            Simon Hoare (North Dorset) (Con)           Share this contribution        I am following what the right hon. Gentleman is saying with great interest. I think he is saying that he appreciates that a lot of the activities that he is talking about are illegal, but that they have still been done by journalists and others. Where I am not joining the dots, as he clearly is, is on why Leveson 2, were it to reopen, would make journalists and others more cognisant of those things that are already illegal and change their behaviours.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        For a very simple reason: we have evidence that bad behaviour is still ongoing. When the Secretary of State originally decided to cancel Leveson 2, he said that the bad behaviour was in the past. Actually, the evidence is that it is ongoing. What is more, there was much evidence that could not be considered by Lord Leveson because of the court cases that were ongoing. Crucially, that evidence included allegations of collusion between the press and the police. I would have thought that we should scrutinise that to bits in this House, not just walk on by.                    Simon Hoare           Share this contribution        It is obviously me; I still do not get why the reopening of Leveson\u2014                    Kevin Brennan (Cardiff West) (Lab)           Share this contribution        It is not a reopening.                    Simon Hoare           Share this contribution        Sorry, the reconvening. I do not get why the reconvening of Leveson would make things that are currently illegal any more illegal than they already are. The courts and the prosecution services have the power to bring those cases when illegality takes place. We do not need Leveson 2 to achieve that, surely.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The point of inquiries is to get to the nub of the truth. There was much that the first half of the Leveson inquiry could not consider because of the courts cases that were ongoing. As a Member of this House, I want to know whether the press regulation system that we are setting up takes account of what we have learned about the sins of the past. I do not think that those sins should be buried and forgotten, and that we should walk on by\u2014unless, of course, people are lucky enough to live in Northern Ireland.                    Ian Paisley           Share this contribution        I know that the right hon. Gentleman thinks that people in Northern Ireland can be treated with the back of his hand with comments like that, but I should make it clear that the Northern Ireland press were exempt from proper scrutiny by Leveson. That is why people feel aggrieved. Many Members whose phones were hacked, like myself, were completely ignored by that process. Now, perhaps, we will have the chance of fairness. Quite frankly, there has been no fairness up until this point.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am listening very jealously to the hon. Gentleman. I would like the privileges he has just secured for Northern Ireland for the rest of the country, because the victims who live in England and Wales deserve the same rights.                    Ian Paisley           Share this contribution        I understand that new clause 23 applies to the whole United Kingdom. I live in the United Kingdom.                 226;128;\ufffd            Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The hon. Gentleman may be assured by the process that he has been offered by the Secretary of State this afternoon, but the Opposition are not. We want Lord Leveson to be given the right to finish the job and do the work that he was commissioned to do by the last Prime Minister.                    Mr Duncan Smith           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for being so generous in giving way. I want to follow up on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Simon Hoare). What I do not understand about the Labour new clauses is what he and those in his party who want phase 2 of Leveson, if we want to call it that, think they will learn that they have not and could not learn from the court cases and all the evidence that is already in the open. Is there not enough evidence for us to make the necessary changes, without going through the interminable process of opening it up? Is there some specific area of the criminal law he does not understand that Lord Leveson may be able to explain to him?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        What I want to learn is the truth. I want to learn the truth about police-press collusion and I want to know how we improve our press regulation in the future, so that we have not just a free press but a clean press.       Let me make some progress. The Secretary of State offered us a second line of argument that has now collapsed. I am not quite sure of the exact words he used when he came to the House, but most of us walked away thinking that Lord Leveson was pretty content that the whole thing was going to be shuttered. The House can therefore imagine our surprise when Sir Brian Leveson said that he \u201cfundamentally disagreed\u201d with the Government\u2019s decision to end part two of the inquiry. When Lord Leveson said that he wanted the terms to be revised, he meant that he wanted them to be expanded, not cancelled all together. The Secretary of State says that malpractice is in the past and that there is nothing more to see, officials are busy, inquiries are expensive and so we must move on. He intimated that Lord Leveson agreed with him when that was not in fact the case.       A third line of attack from the Secretary of State was that the review looked to the past and ignored the challenges for the press in the future. That was a legitimate challenge and if he studies carefully the words of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich East (Tom Watson), he will see that there is a new ambition to get into some of the challenges around fake news that were looked at by Brian Leveson. That was not enough to satisfy the Secretary of State, however. In a letter to Conservative Members\u2014I did not receive a copy\u2014he offered some more objections, each one of which we can knock down.       The Secretary of State, in his letter to his colleagues, says that the first half of Leveson was \u201cfull and broad\u201d when in fact it was partial and incomplete. He says that newspaper margins are under pressure, as if economic hardship is now some sort of defence against the full glare of justice. He says that the effect of the proposals will be \u201cchilling\u201d, when he knows that our fine broadcasters in this country operate under far more rigorous regulation than newspapers and that does not stop them pursuing the most extraordinarily brilliant investigations. He says that Sir Joe Pilling has \u201ccleared\u201d the IPSO scheme, but Joe Pilling was appointed by IPSO and IPSO itself says 226;128;\ufffdit does not comply with Leveson. He says that IPSO now has a low-cost arbitration scheme, but as the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) pointed out, MailOnline, Newsquest and Archant are all outside it, so it is not a universal scheme in the way the Secretary of State has tried to present it to the House this afternoon.       The final line of argument is that officials are very busy and inquiries are very expensive, and we should therefore just walk on by. I just do not think that that is good enough.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        rose\u2014                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am happy to hear from the Secretary of State why he thinks I am wrong.                    Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman is not making much progress. He is implying that broadcasters are under regulation but there is no chilling effect. The description of a chilling effect, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp), is the expected impact of section 40, under which anybody would be able to take a newspaper to court and get costs awarded against the newspaper even if they did not have anything in their case. The broadcasters do not have to deal with anything like that. On the point about things being brought to light, will he confirm that the case of Mr Ford, which he raised and was raised in an argument for Leveson 2, was in fact raised in the original Leveson inquiry and was therefore covered?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Mr Ford\u2019s activity was, but not Mr Ford\u2019s allegations that the activity is already under way.       Let me come on to the point the Secretary of State made about the future of press regulation. The scheme he voted for\u2014it was elegantly designed, I think, by the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Sir Oliver Letwin)\u2014was a good scheme. There have been a couple of important objections to it made by many of our constituents, but more importantly by many journalists in our local media. The first objection is that a royal charter is somehow tantamount to a state authorised, state-operated regulator, which will somehow impede free speech. Royal charters have for centuries been the basis by which we have given stature to universities and learning societies like the Royal Society. None of them confront restrictions on free speech in any way whatever. That argument, frankly, is fanciful.              2.45 pm    There was then the argument about the dangers of cost shifting. That is why new clause 20 would create a threshold of about 163;100 million, along with other proposals, to ensure that good newspapers, which would not necessarily be able to withstand these kinds of risks, are protected. We have listened hard to the debate.            Mrs Main           Share this contribution        On a point of clarification, does the right hon. Gentleman know of any other scenario within the civil courts where the costs have to be paid regardless?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The point is that this was well debated at the time and the argument presented by those on the Treasury Bench was that there was no point in setting up a new regulator and then doing nothing to create incentives to join that regulator. That was the proposal the Secretary of State voted for the first time around.                 226;128;\ufffd            Joanna Cherry           Share this contribution        I was not in the House at the time, so correct me if I am wrong. Am I right in thinking that Brian Leveson recommended that incentivisation to encourage the publishers to sign up to an independent regulator?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Absolutely. It was a very delicate job. The structure put in place was designed to minimise any dangers to free speech but create incentives for the press to move to a scheme that gave low-cost arbitration and access to justice for victims. That is at the core of this debate.       I want to conclude with two points. The first is, I suppose, a plea to the House. If we have learned one thing from the scandals of the past 10 to 12 years\u2014whether the expenses scandal, Hillsborough or Orgreave\u2014it is that it is never the right thing to look at a scandal and decide that it is too expensive or that we are too busy to get to the bottom of what happened. That is the core of the argument to let Brian Leveson finish his job.       I want to give the last word to the father of Madeleine McCann. When Gerry McCann found out that the Government were proposing to scrap the second half of the Leveson inquiry, he said:       \u201cThis Government has abandoned its commitments to the victims of press abuse to satisfy the corporate interests of large newspaper groups133; This Government has lost all integrity when it comes to policy affecting the press.\u201d       I hope that we can reflect on those harsh words this afternoon and rescue the integrity that is currently endangered by the Government\u2019s determination to sweep aside the lessons of history.

Before I call the next speaker, I remind colleagues that this debate has to end at four o\u2019clock and I know a lot of people want to speak.                    Mr John Whittingdale (Maldon) (Con)           Share this contribution        Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will take heed of your reminder about the time limit.       It is now over 10 years since the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, of which I was Chair at the time, first conducted an inquiry into phone hacking. We conducted several subsequent inquiries, which helped to bring out the truth about the extent of phone hacking and other illegal practices. Without the work of the Committee, those would not have been revealed, although I pay tribute to The Guardian\u2019s brilliant piece of investigative journalism. A lot of this debate concerns investigative journalism.       I think all of us were shocked by the revelation of phone hacking and we were determined that action should be taken to prevent anything like that happening again. In the 10 years that have passed, however, a lot has changed. The News of the World closed down as a result of the revelations. There were prosecutions, with 10 journalists convicted for illegal practices, although it is worth bearing in mind that 57 were cleared.       Obviously, we had the Leveson inquiry. Even if it did not complete all that it originally wanted to complete because of the ongoing criminal cases, it still took over a year and cost 163;49 million. It produced a swathe of recommendations, although the royal charter was not one of them. My right hon. Friend the Member for 226;128;\ufffdWest Dorset (Sir Oliver Letwin) had the brainchild of the royal charter and accompanying that, sanctions in the Crime and Courts Act 2013 for newspapers that did not sign up to a regulator recognised under the royal charter.       Since that time, two major changes have taken place. When the royal charter was designed and the recognition panel was established, I do not think anybody in Parliament ever expected that not a single newspaper\u2014certainly no national newspaper and virtually no local newspaper\u2014would be willing to sign up to a regulator that applied for recognition under the royal charter. It was not just the usual whipping boys; the News International papers, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror. The Financial Times, The Guardian, The Independent and all the local newspapers refused. I have met the publications that have agreed to join IMPRESS, but they are micro-publishers. No major publisher was willing to go along with the royal charter. We originally invented the idea of sanctions with the view that one newspaper, or perhaps two, might stand out against the rest. We never intended to bring in a sanction that would punish, in what seems an incredibly unjust way, every single publisher. Their refusal to join is on a matter of principle, and we have to respect that.       What did happen was that they created a new regulator called IPSO, which has steadily evolved. To begin with, it was deficient in some ways. I had talks with IPSO and pointed out to it the areas where I felt that it needed to make changes, particularly through the introduction of an arbitration scheme, which was one of the key requirements under Leveson and which did not exist. However, IPSO has now made a lot of changes, including, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out, the inclusion of an arbitration scheme, which is compulsory for members who sign up to it. Those that are outside it are the local newspapers, against which virtually no complaint has ever been made, and which face the greatest peril from the economic situation that exists for newspapers.                    Paul Farrelly           Share this contribution        The Select Committee, of which the right hon. Gentleman was a wonderful Chair, recently recommended unanimously, cross-party, the partial commencement of section 40 to give those publications protections\u2014to protect investigative journalism\u2014if they joined the approved regulator. That was one of the options in the consultation. What is wrong with that course?                    Mr Whittingdale           Share this contribution        The hon. Gentleman is an old friend\u2014we sat together on the Committee for 10 years\u2014and I have some sympathy with what he says. When I talked to the publications that had joined IMPRESS, they said that one reason they had done so was because of the possible protection offered if they were part of a recognised regulator, in that they would not have to pay costs even if they lost. That is a separate matter, but in this debate we are talking about the introduction of an amendment to provide not the carrot, but the stick\u2014the punishment for newspapers that do not wish to sign up to a Government-approved regulator.                    Mr Bone           Share this contribution        Does my right hon. Friend think, deep in his heart, that anything has changed since IPSO was introduced?                 226;128;\ufffd            Mr Whittingdale           Share this contribution        Deep in my heart, yes I do. As I was about to say, I believe that there is a different climate. Of course, it does not mean that no newspaper ever does something that is a cause for complaint or invades people\u2019s private lives\u2014I have suffered at the hands of the press, but that is the price we pay in this place. However, I believe that the imposition of sanctions of the type that are proposed under the amendments would be deeply damaging to a free press.       In terms of what has changed, I challenge those who criticise IPSO to say where it now fails to meet the requirements under the royal charter. I have been through the royal charter, and there are perhaps three tiny sections where we could say that the wording of the IPSO codes is not precisely in line with the royal charter, but those are incredibly minor. They make no substantial difference whatever. IPSO has not applied for recognition under the royal charter, not because it does not comply, but because there is an objection in principle on the part of every single newspaper to a Government-imposed system, which this represents.                    Peter Heaton-Jones           Share this contribution        The fundamentally worrying thing is that this seeks to make a connection between local media organisations having to join the state regulator and their facing, if they do not, the awful costs that they might have to pay even if they win a court case. The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne) described that as an incentive, but it is not\u2014it is coercion. It is only an incentive inasmuch as a condemned man on the gallows has an incentive not to stand on the trapdoor.                    Mr Whittingdale           Share this contribution        Of course, I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, and I am glad that he focused on local newspapers, because I referred to two changes. The first is the establishment of IPSO, which I believe in all serious respects is now compliant with what Lord Leveson wanted. The second is the complete change in the media landscape that has taken place in the last 10 years.       My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned the number of local newspapers that have gone out of business. We are seeing more continue to do so. There is likely to be further consolidation within the newspaper industry and the economics are steadily moving against newspapers. That is a real threat to democracy, because newspapers employ journalists who cover proceedings in courts, council chambers and, indeed, in this place. The big media giants who now have the power and influence\u2014Google, Facebook and Twitter\u2014do not employ a single journalist, so my right hon. Friend is absolutely right to have established the examination into the funding and future of the press. It is about looking forward, and that is where the House should be concentrating its efforts. It should not be looking backwards and going over again the events of more than 10 years ago; the world has changed almost beyond recognition.                    Damian Collins (Folkestone and Hythe) (Con)           Share this contribution        My Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee colleague, the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly)\u2014I call him my hon. Friend\u2014raised the recommendations of the Committee last year. One was that for IPSO to be considered compliant in any way with the spirit of Leveson, it should have a compulsory industry-funded arbitration scheme. While IPSO might not be perfect, does my right hon. Friend the Member 226;128;\ufffdfor Maldon (Mr Whittingdale) agree that this is one of the most significant areas where IPSO has responded to pressure to try to make itself more compliant?                    Mr Whittingdale           Share this contribution        I agree very much with my hon. Friend. Indeed, I would have found it far harder to make the argument that IPSO was basically now compliant with Lord Leveson had it not introduced the scheme that is now in place. That was the biggest difference between the system as designed by my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset in the royal charter and IPSO, and that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins) said, has rightly been removed.       What we do in this debate is being watched around the world. This country is seen as a bastion of freedom and liberty, and a free press is an absolutely essential component of that. I say to those who are proposing these amendments: do not just listen to the newspaper industry, which is, as I say, united against this\u2014that includes The Guardian, despite the efforts of Labour Front Benchers to somehow exclude them. Listen to the Index on Censorship, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2014campaigning organisations that are fighting oppression of the press around the world. They say that if this House brings in this kind of measure it would send a terrible signal to those who believe in a free press. I therefore hope that the amendments will be rejected.                    Edward Miliband           Share this contribution        I shall speak in support of new clause 18, which stands in my name and that of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke) and four Members from four other parties across the House. I have tabled the new clause for one overriding reason: to keep a promise that everyone in this House made to the victims of phone hacking and other unlawful conduct.       I well remember the day when I, David Cameron and Nick Clegg went to meet the victims\u2014the McCanns, the Dowlers and all the others. You know what we said to them? We said, \u201cThis time it will be different. This time we won\u2019t flinch. We promise you we\u2019ll see this process through.\u201d Painstakingly, with the victims, we designed a two-part Leveson process\u2014let us be under no illusions about that. The first part was to look at the general issues around the culture and ethics of the press and the relationship with politicians, and the second part, promised back then, was to look, after the criminal trials were over, at, in the words of Sir Brian, who did what to who and why it happened. Who covered it up? Did the police? Did politicians? Did other public servants?              3.00 pm    Leveson was to be a two-part process, and here is what David Cameron said, when part 1 of Leveson was completed in November 2012:  \u201cOne of the things that the victims have been most concerned about is that part 2 of the investigation should go ahead133;It is right that it should go ahead, and that is fully our intention.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, 29 November 2012; Vol. 554, c. 458.]  No ifs, no buts, no maybes\u2014a clear promise to victims of the press. And here we come today, and we have the Government saying, \u201cLet\u2019s dump this promise. It\u2019s too expensive\u2014it\u2019s a distraction.\u201d How dare they? How dare they say that to the McCanns, the Dowlers and all 226;128;\ufffdthe other victims? How can we be here? I say to Members across the House, in whatever party, that this is about our honour\u2014this is a matter of honour, of a promise we made.            Mr Rees-Mogg           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman mentions what David Cameron, Nick Clegg and he did. It seems to have escaped his attention that David Cameron is no longer Prime Minister, that Nick Clegg is no longer Deputy Prime Minister, and that two former MPs and one still-existing MP cannot bind their successors. A new Parliament has the right to consider these matters afresh, and that is what is rightly being done today after countless police investigations and prosecutions, many of which ended in acquittal.                    Edward Miliband           Share this contribution        I give way to the hon. Gentleman\u2019s constitutional knowledge, but I do not give way to him on morality\u2014and this is a question of morality and of promises we made. Remember the furore about all these events? Remember how people looked at us? Remember how all of us\u2014Labour Governments too\u2014were too close to the press, and how we said we would learn lessons? I take my responsibility too. We should have acted earlier. All Governments should take responsibility. To break this promise would be contemptible.                    Anna Soubry           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman is making a powerful case, and he is right about morality and the promises made, most importantly, to victims. I am struggling to support him, however, because while those are powerful arguments, I am actually more interested in the outcome. Is there a genuine purpose that can be achieved other than\u2014and it is a strong argument\u2014keeping a promise to victims? It will be a hollow promise if it is nothing more than a talking shop.                    Edward Miliband           Share this contribution        Other people have asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t the police just do it?\u201d That suggests that whenever there is a police inquiry there cannot be a public inquiry. My answer is this: there is no substitute for the breadth of a public inquiry and its ability to see what happened. A lot has emerged even since Leveson 1. At that time, people said the hacking and improper behaviour were just at the News of the World. There have now been revelations at The Sun, allegations about The Sunday Times and a decade of blagging by John Ford\u2014a whole range of allegations that we need to get to the bottom of. Crucially, we need to learn lessons for the future. The useful thing that can come out of this is to prevent there being future victims like the McCanns and the Dowlers. That is why so many victims have written to the Prime Minister, saying it is important to get to the truth\u2014not just for them but to prevent it from ever happening again.                    Ian Paisley           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman is making a very compelling argument\u2014one that I am not turned off by\u2014but when I read new clause 18 dispassionately I see that it offers me a consultation process with parties in Northern Ireland and an Assembly that is not functioning. It offers me very little, although it promises me something. In new clause 23, the Government from the Dispatch Box today have offered me an actual inquiry. I ask him, then, to put himself in my shoes: should we take what we have or a promise of what we might get?                 226;128;\ufffd            Edward Miliband           Share this contribution        If the new clause was agreed today, the Secretary of State would within three months have to trigger an inquiry covering Northern Ireland. The point about consultation is precisely to consult with Members of the Assembly, Ministers, if they are in place, and those in Scotland as well. That is simply a point about consultation. I know the hon. Gentleman cares passionately about these issues.       I believe that the case is stronger, not weaker, than it was when a two-part inquiry was envisaged. Sir Brian says we should go ahead. When else do we put a presiding judge in charge of an inquiry and then ignore his advice? Frankly, it is extraordinary. As I said to the right hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), the wrongdoing turned out to be more widespread than we thought. I urge hon. Members, in the time left before the vote, to look at the Kerslake report on what happened in Manchester, because it is a shocking indictment of what a minority\u2014I emphasise that it is a minority besmirching the good name of the whole press\u2014did. I quote from it briefly:       \u201cOne mother, who was herself seriously injured as was her daughter, spoke of the press ringing her on her mobile whilst she was recovering in hospital133;The child of one family was given condolences on the doorstep before official notification of the death of her mother.\u201d       This is what some of the relatives of the victims said:       \u201cBy far the worst thing was the press\u201d,       \u201cThey...are a disgrace, they don\u2019t take no for an answer, they have a lack of standards and ethics,\u201d       \u201cThe press were not respectful of grief.\u201d       It is all very well people saying, \u201cEverything\u2019s changed\u201d, but to my mind, I\u2019m afraid, that report is proof that not enough has changed, because the same intrusion into the lives of innocent people is carrying on.                    Mr Bone           Share this contribution        I remember David Cameron, as I do the right hon. Gentleman, on this subject. It was one of David Cameron\u2019s best moments. I have not yet heard an argument from the Government to explain why we cannot have Leveson 2. If it is money, that argument is ridiculous. Why does he think the Government do not want Leveson 2?                    Edward Miliband           Share this contribution        That is a very good point, and I will come to it in a moment, because it is important to answer it.       I want to make another point about the case for carrying on with Leveson 2. I do not believe, I am afraid, that the regulator we have, IPSO, is nearly good enough. It bears too much resemblance to its predecessor, the Press Complaints Commission. Just think about this regulator: it has not imposed a single fine, demanded a single equal-prominence front page correction or launched a single systematic inquiry, as it has the power to do. The Home Affairs Select Committee heard testimony in February on Islamophobia, and I think I am right in saying that under section 12 of the editors code, on discrimination, hate speech and so on, IPSO has received 8,000 complaints and upheld one. The Chair of the Committee and its members seemed rather shocked by that.       I return now to the very pertinent question from the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone). Why might the Government not be going ahead with Leveson 2? Let us look at their issues briefly. They say it is about press freedom. I believe that a free critical press is an 226;128;\ufffdessential part of our society, and that includes being critical of politicians, but, as everyone agreed after Milly Dowler, that freedom does not include the ability to barge into the lives of innocent people. The press themselves said that was wrong. On press freedom and Leveson 2, the National Union of Journalists said in March that the decision not to allow Lord Leveson to complete his task was       \u201cbad for politics, bad for journalism and bad for the public.\u201d       The NUJ says it is not an attack on press freedom!       The Government have also said that the inquiry would go over ground already coved by the police, but as I said, it was always understood that Leveson 2 could only start after the police inquiries had been completed, and that there was no substitute for a broad public inquiry. It is claimed that it misses the big important issues of Facebook and fake news, but those are in the terms of reference as recommended by Sir Brian Leveson. It is said that local papers will be affected, but we have specifically written the terms of reference to exclude local papers, so that there can be no question of their being affected. It is said that this is all backward- looking, but in any other area of public life, would the press really be saying that the truth is time-limited, and that we do not need to get to the truth because it was all a few years ago? Lastly, there is the argument about cost, which I think is a terrible argument. Leveson 1 cost 163;5 million. That is a substantial sum, but I have to say that, given decades of abuse and broken promises in relation to the press, I think that it is worth spending such a sum to get to the truth.       Now I will answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Wellingborough. I set out the reasons adduced by the press and, indeed, the Government for the cancellation of this inquiry, but let us be absolutely honest: there is one overriding reason for the Government\u2019s decision to abandon it, and that needs to be discussed. It is quite simple. It is fear: fear about the wrath of the press. That is why the Government have made this decision. The press do not want the inquiry to go ahead, and the Government fear attacks on them by the press. That is why the last Labour Government did not take action against the press: they too feared the consequences. But what did we also say after 2011? We said, \u201cNever again will we succumb to fear and make the wrong decisions, which are not in the public interest.\u201d       Fear of the powerful is not a good reason to allow them to trample on the powerless when we have it in our hands to do something about it. It goes against everything that we promised in 2011. It goes against everything that we said to the victims and everything that we told the public. We should remember the words of the current Prime Minister\u2014the current Prime Minister\u2014who said on the steps of Downing Street:       \u201cWhen we take the big calls, we\u2019ll think not of the powerful, but you.\u201d       I say, \u201cThink of the public, not the powerful, today.\u201d There is still a chance that this time it will be different. We can learn the lessons of failed reform and no change. We can keep our promises to the victims and make change happen, and the way to do that is by voting for new clause 18.                    Mr Kenneth Clarke           Share this contribution        I rise to support new clause 18, and I shall try to do so as briefly as possible as we are running out of time. I have also put my name to amendment 14, which I hope the hon. Member for 226;128;\ufffdSunderland Central (Julie Elliott) will press to a Division if she catches your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker. However, new clause 18 and Leveson 2 are my main concern because, as the then Justice Secretary, I was personally involved in setting up the Leveson inquiry.       I have the highest regard for Sir Brian Leveson, and I share his indignation that the House is going back on previous commitments about the completion of that inquiry. Sir Brian is now the president of the Queen\u2019s Bench division. He is the head of criminal justice in this country. He does not think that his inquiry completed its work or inquired into all the matters into which it was supposed to be inquiring. He said in his public letter that he \u201cfundamentally\u201d disagreed with the proposal to cancel the inquiry now and prevent it from going any further. I share his views, and I do not think that the House should lightly set them aside.       It was always clear when the inquiry was established that there would have to be a second part. In his statement when the inquiry was first announced, the then Prime Minister said:       \u201cThe second part of the inquiry will examine the extent of unlawful or improper conduct at the News of the World and other newspapers, and the way in which management failures may have allowed it to happen. That part of the inquiry will also look into the original police investigation and the issue of corrupt payments to police officers, and will consider the implications for the relationships between newspapers and the police.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, 13 July 2011; Vol. 531, c. 312.]       Those are the things that we are saying that we perhaps do not want to inquire into any further, for what seem to me\u2014with great respect to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who made a valiant effort to put forward the case on behalf of the Government\u2014 to be quite inadequate reasons.       When the first part of Leveson was completed, the then Government recommitted to holding the second part. I cannot recall anyone in the House objecting to the idea that we were waiting for the inquiry to be completed once the police inquiries were over. On 29 November 2012, the then Prime Minister said:       \u201cWhen I set up the inquiry, I also said that there would be a second part to investigate wrongdoing in the press and the police, including the conduct of the first police investigation. That second stage cannot go ahead until the current criminal proceedings have concluded, but we remain committed to the inquiry as it was first established.\u201d       That was the commitment of the Government of whom I was a member, of whom my right hon. Friend was a member, and of whom half the present Government were members. No one objected to that in the House. Indeed, I think that my right hon. Friend took pride in rebutting what was eloquently described by the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband) as the fear\u2014the craven fear\u2014that most Governments have felt of Her Majesty\u2019s press during much of the time that I have been in Parliament.              3.15 pm    When the Prime Minister announced that there was to be a second inquiry, he quoted Lord Leveson as saying:  \u201cover the last 30-35 years and probably much longer, the political parties of UK national Government and of UK official Opposition, have had or developed too close a relationship with the press in a way which has not been in the public interest.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, 29 November 2012; Vol. 554, c. 446.]  226;128;\ufffd       He rejected that, and I do not think the House should put aside that rejection too lightly.  In the present mad climate of political debate, I think that quite a lot of people\u2014for one reason or another, as has always been the case in politics\u2014are currying favour with the proprietors and editors of newspapers, or are fearful of those proprietors and editors. It is difficult to deny that that may have played a part in the sudden decision that we do not want to know any more about matters such as relationships between the police and the press.            Mr Bone           Share this contribution        Will my right hon. and learned Friend give way?                    Mr Clarke           Share this contribution        I do not want to take too long, but I will give way.                    Mr Bone           Share this contribution        What my right hon. and learned Friend has said was the crux of David Cameron\u2019s point. Political parties have got too close to the press. The only reason I can see for abandoning Leveson 2 would be if that had stopped. Does my right hon. and learned Friend think that it has stopped?                    Mr Clarke           Share this contribution        I fear that my hon. Friend is probably right, although I should give some credit to my right hon. and hon. Friends in government. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but my suspicions are as strong as those of my hon. Friend.                    Paul Farrelly           Share this contribution        The Government also asked the public what they thought. When they announced the results of the consultation, it quickly became clear that the Secretary of State had set aside two petitions signed by more than 200,000 people who were in favour of Leveson 2, but counted 62,000 pro forma newspaper coupons that were against it, just because they had been returned in envelopes. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman think that that is a rather odd way in which to judge the outcome of a consultation, and perhaps a little biased?                    Mr Clarke           Share this contribution        I personally will give my right hon. and hon. Friends the benefit of the doubt\u2014I am sure that every representation was considered extremely carefully\u2014but, in the end, it is for the House to decide what goes on.       The first argument that seems to be raised is about the lapse of time and the fact that we are talking about such a long time ago\u20142012; 2011\u2014that we cannot spend public money on reopening former issues. It has already been said that quite a lot has happened since then. At the time of Leveson 1, I do not think that anyone knew that that The Sun was involved in hacking. I do not think that anyone realised that Trinity Mirror was as mired in criminality as News International, and that it had gone in for hacking. They have tried to cover up the details since then by settling every civil claim that has been brought against them because they do not wish to give any evidence in public, or to have any evidence heard in public against them.       The other issue that has not gone away, about which the right hon. Member for Doncaster North, the former Leader of the Opposition, spoke very eloquently, is the treatment of the victims. There have been other incidents since that time. The Manchester bombing is a plain and obvious example. Victims of tragic occasions such as terrorist outrages still find, far too often, that their gardens fill with photographers. Weeping relatives find 226;128;\ufffdthat their doors are being knocked on so that they can be asked for comment. They are interviewed when they are plainly still badly shaken up, and probably not yet able to cope with the pressures.       I think that quite a lot has happened, but it has taken some time. It is not actually that long, in my aged recollection, since 2012. This consideration has never been applied to any other public inquiry, and we have lots of public inquiries. When trying to refute the moves against them, the press go back to 1961 in order to attack Mr Mosley and resurrect his activities as a student\u2014they were fairly startling\u2014with his notorious father.       The sexual offences inquiry\u2014a very important inquiry\u2014is making very slow progress. It is inquiring into allegations against public figures now dead, going back for decades. In any other context, shock would be expressed about a scandal of the scale we had in the case of the behaviour of the press. To say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s too late now; it\u2019s all gone by and we do not wish to know any more about it,\u201d would be greeted with outrage and treated as a ridiculous argument, and I really do not think that we should accept it.       The Independent Press Standards Organisation is a big improvement on what we had before, but it is plainly not an independent regulator. If we had a group of people with the authority of those involved in part one of the Leveson inquiry recommending a new independent regulator, no other public body\u2014none of the utilities, for instance\u2014would be allowed to turn around and say, \u201cWe refuse to comply. We will be regulated, but only by a regulator whom we appoint and can change at any stage.\u201d That would be dismissed.       The Government can address all the unworthy suspicions we have that their decision is motivated by a combination of fear and desire to curry favour. They should recover their courage and let the process go ahead, and we will see whether the press really have anything much to fear. I do not think that legitimate journalism and the very many honest journalists have anything to fear. As has been said\u2014I am sure this is true in the House of Commons\u2014everybody in public life in this country thinks that a free and fearless press is a key part of our liberties, and it is a joke to start presenting any moves to investigate as a threat to the freedom of the press.       The final argument that has been used against the proposal is that as the press are under great commercial pressures and face lots of challenges, we should not allow this to go ahead. I cannot think of any other body of organisations of such public importance that could claim, \u201cWe are under a bit of pressure, and there is a lot of competition; it is worse than it was a few years ago.\u201d We should certainly tackle the digital market. I think it is quite obvious that Facebook and others are publishers. We should get away from the fiction that they are not publishers, and they should be subject to equivalent regulation as publishers, but that is another issue.       I supported Leveson when it was set up and I believe it should be completed. Leveson should not be cancelled. There are probably policemen still serving who are hoping that their corrupt relationship with the media will not be investigated further because they have got away with it so far. There are probably journalists still working\u2014editors, even, still in post\u2014who knew perfectly well that they were acting illegally in sourcing private 226;128;\ufffdinformation about public figures not just in politics, but in sport and theatre\u2014anybody who achieves B-list celebrity status in this country. It is still the case that nothing sells newspapers like celebrity sex and scandal\u2014no doubt long may that continue\u2014but we must have a look at the ethical standards that should be applied to every possible sort of story.       This is not just about the law; it is also about ethics. We want more respect for our free press, and a proper Leveson 2 could eventually lead to that being achieved.                    Julie Elliott (Sunderland Central) (Lab)           Share this contribution        It is a real pleasure to follow the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband), with whom I agree entirely on Leveson 2. I shall address my remarks to amendment 14, which stands in my name and those of colleagues.       First, let us consider the situation now. We have two self-regulatory bodies for the British press and news publishers: IPSO and Impress. These regulators each have standards codes that apply to their members in the news publishing industry. One of the standards codes is listed in the Bill. The Government are happy to give publishers following that code a qualified exemption from the laws that apply to most other professions and industries. Those publishers are, in short, more free to process people\u2019s personal data. That is right, and it allows for, and supports, investigative journalism in the public interest. The other code is not in the Bill, and publishers following that code are less free to process personal data, to conduct investigations and to hold the powerful to account.       People might be surprised to learn which regulator has that statutory recognition. It is not Impress, the new regulator that meets all the requirements of the royal charter on press regulation in the way that this Parliament hoped for after Leveson. The regulator to which the Government are giving these privileges is IPSO, the regulator that has set its face against Parliament and will have nothing to do with statutes or charters.       The cross-party amendment 14 has been tabled in the spirit of the consensus in the House five years ago. It simply says that there must be fair and equal rights for members of Impress. As the first and only regulator approved under the framework that Parliament supported, Impress has worked hard to meet the standards that Leveson set. It has an independently appointed board. It wrote its own code, after extensive public consultation, and it receives funding from a charity, the Independent Press Regulation Trust. IPSO\u2019s arrangements have been subject to no such scrutiny.       Impress is open to the world. Its funding arrangements, appointments, code and regulatory scheme have been published and pored over. In October 2016, the Press Recognition Panel, an arm\u2019s length public body established by royal charter, confirmed that Impress does indeed meet the Leveson standards. That decision was challenged in the courts by the News Media Association, and every single objection that it made was thrown out. That was not widely reported, because most national newspapers choose only to publish bad news, smears and innuendoes about Impress. I believe that the Government have been influenced by those news reports and have chosen to adopt a non-co-operation attitude to Impress.                 226;128;\ufffd            Chris Philp           Share this contribution        Will the hon. Lady give way?                    Julie Elliott           Share this contribution        No; there is not enough time.       It is because of the Government\u2019s intransigence that we are debating the amendment. I wish that we did not need to take up parliamentary time with this issue. I wish that the Government had dealt with it long before now. However, as the Secretary of State says, we are where we are: the odd situation in which IPSO, the regulator that turns its back on Parliament and the public, is listed in the Data Protection Bill, but Impress, the regulator that is publicly accountable, is not. The Government have stonewalled every attempt by Impress for inclusion in the list of journalism codes in schedule 2 or existing legislation since 2016. For a long time, they refused even to consider the issue. Last September, they finally accepted Impress\u2019s application. Since then, they have simply said that the issue is \u201cunder consideration\u201d. I now ask the Government to give the case that has been made in this debate proper consideration. I will not press amendment 14 to a Division, but I would be grateful for a full response from the Minister.                    Mr Andrew Mitchell (Sutton Coldfield) (Con)           Share this contribution        I draw the House\u2019s attention to my entry in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests. I want to make a few general comments, particularly on new clause 18, where the House faces a fine judgment on which way to proceed.       The arguments in favour of new clause 18 are strong. David Cameron promised what it proposes. I was in the Cabinet at the time and remember him making that promise and it was unequivocal, which is reflected in the new clause. Brian Leveson has confirmed his belief that another inquiry should go ahead. In the House of Lords, Lady Hollins set out persuasively the three reasons why the inquiry should proceed. There was also Lord Kerslake\u2019s powerful testimony following the Manchester tragedy that lessons have still not been learned about press intrusion. While Lord Kerslake appears to have found a new role adjacent to the Labour Front-Bench team, he remains one of Britain\u2019s most senior and distinguished former civil servants and his views cannot be idly dismissed. In addition, as has been alluded to by several Members, the victims affected by what we are trying to address today may find it, frankly, rather distasteful that a bunch of politicians appear to be rushing to ingratiate ourselves with the media for fear that they will persistently trawl through our dustbins.              3.30 pm    Those arguments seem to be valid reasons in support of new clause 18, but there are other points that have not yet been adequately weighed up by some of those who so eloquently proposed the new clause. We need to consider whether another all-singing, all-dancing inquiry, with the enormous public expense of teams of lawyers, will tell us much that we do not already know. We must also disaggregate issues affecting the police from those affecting the press. They are different things, and in some ways they are mutually contradictory.  First, the written media is already facing serious financial challenges, and I am not only talking about the national newspapers. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke) made too light of that point. On the \u201cToday\u201d programme this 226;128;\ufffdmorning, we heard from Marc Reeves, the editor of the Birmingham Mail. Sutton Coldfield used to have two excellent local newspapers. Our constituents trust the veracity of the local media far more than the national media, but they do not buy local newspapers. The Royal town of Sutton Coldfield lost its second newspaper some time ago, and the Royal Sutton Coldfield Observer, which is owned by Trinity Mirror, has been seriously cut. This week, the paper sees the departure of the distinguished, award-winning editor, Mr Gary Phelps, who has been in post for 16 years, and I genuinely fear for the paper\u2019s future. The question is whether the media has learned its lessons, whether there is anything seriously new to be learned and whether yet further digging up of issues by the roots holds real public benefit.  Secondly, it is worth bearing in mind the importance to all citizens of the preservation of the right to a free press, and I do not think that the House has adequately reflected on that. In all the time that I have been involved in international development, in government and in opposition, I have learned that the key ingredient for development, good governance, stability and accountability is transparency. Last week, the House agreed that the overseas territories must accept open registers of ownership, and the information that was critical to convincing many of us came through British investigative journalism exposing corruption and dishonesty through the Panama and Paradise papers. Across the developing world, Britain has championed and strongly supported, with taxpayers\u2019 money, the development of a free media, but it matters here in Britain, too. I think it was a US President who said that if he had to choose between democracy and a free press, he would go for the latter. I conclude that a disrespectful, raucous, cynical, irreverent, suspicious media is the ineluctable price that we pay for our freedoms and rights and also the way in which we hold the rich and the powerful to account.  There is a final point that cuts across new clause 18: a powerful press is all too often itself the way in which we hold the police to account. In Britain, we give the police great power and great trust. We also\u2014unwisely in my view\u2014leave them largely to police themselves. All too often it is the media that exposes police corruption, rather than the organs of the state, and there are numerous examples of that. We should remember the role of the media in exposing the truth behind the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, the appalling events at Hillsborough and the heartbreaking way in which the Lawrence family were treated by the police. The Times played a role in exposing the Rotherham child abuse scandal, and The Guardian revealed sexual predators in the police both in 2012 and more recently. Journalists and, indeed, Members of this House played a role in exposing the appalling police corruption in the fitting up of the Birmingham Six, an event which is still to achieve closure in Birmingham as the families strive to achieve justice through the ongoing coroner\u2019s inquiry.  It is the role of the free media fearlessly to expose wrongdoing, and we would not be serving the interests of our constituents if, by our action today, we took steps that could diminish their ability to do that. Members of the House will make up their own minds on the new clause. This seems to be the nub of the issue, but it is a very fine judgment as to which way our votes should fall.  226;128;\ufffd            Christine Jardine           Share this contribution        I rise to speak in support of new clause 18, which my friend the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband) has so eloquently described. I would like to bring three words to the House\u2019s attention: fairness, justice and honour. I say this not as a politician\u2014although I hope that we would all hold those things in high regard\u2014but because they were the things that originally attracted me to a career in journalism. That career involved challenging the establishment, questioning power and holding politicians, big business and powerful vested interests in the media to account. Standing here today, I do not believe that any good ethical journalist or publication in this country has anything to fear from revisiting the Leveson 2 inquiry. Indeed, I feel that they have much to gain.       The right hon. Member for Doncaster North talked about going with David Cameron and Nick Clegg to speak to the victims of hacking, and about the promise that was made to them. I respect the fact that this Parliament should not be held by promises made by another Parliament, but it would say a lot about this House if we were to hold to that promise. It would disappoint the public who are watching us today, hoping that we will live up to those standards of fairness, justice and honour, if we did not do so. That promise was about redressing the balance of power between the vested interests of the press and the ordinary public in this country. The ordinary public deserve the right of redress, and they deserve to have the confidence that everything has been done to safeguard their rights.       We have heard from the Secretary of State that time has moved on and that we live in a different culture, but the fact that we have moved on should not prevent us from learning the lessons of the past. If history teaches us nothing else, it teaches us that if we do not learn the lessons of the past, we will repeat our mistakes in the future. Today, we have an opportunity to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes that led to the hacking of phones, to the intrusion into the lives of innocent members of the public and to the hounding of people who were already suffering, such as the family of Madeleine McCann.       More than that, this is an opportunity to reassure members of the public who, as we have heard time and again over the past few years, feel detached from politics. They feel that we have somehow let them down and that we are not listening to them, but this is an opportunity to tell them that we are listening and that we hear their outrage at the way in which members of the public have been treated by the press\u2014not all the press, but certain elements of it. I also understand the pressures on the press, as a former journalist and the wife of a journalist. I lived through my late husband\u2019s employer announcing redundancies five years in a row, every year at Christmas. That is the reality of life in the modern media, but that is an economic pressure. It is not a pressure brought about by any ethical standard. It is the modern reality of the changes in technology that the industry is learning to deal with.       The Secretary of State said that we had moved on and that the culture had changed, but I would like to remind him of the Kerslake inquiry, and of the behaviour in Manchester that we have heard about. Unfortunately, the truth is that there are unethical individuals in every walk of life and in every profession. However, every other profession in this country\u2014dentistry, medicine, 226;128;\ufffdthe law\u2014has a regulatory body that is underpinned by statute and that holds its members to a standard. Why should newspapers be exempt? I say that not as somebody who wants any restriction on freedom of the press; I believe that the fourth estate is a fundamental pillar of a free and democratic society. But it also has to be answerable, because freedom of the press should not mean freedom to intrude, to harass or to manufacture stories about individuals; it should mean freedom to be responsible and to be held to account, by the law and by the politicians who make the law.       Friends, the victims of the hacking scandal will be watching today to see whether we live up to the promise that was made to them by the right hon. Member for Doncaster North, by David Cameron and by Nick Clegg. I appeal to Members, please do not be found wanting.                    Bill Wiggin (North Herefordshire) (Con)           Share this contribution        May I say what a sad day this is? I pay tribute to the Government Chief Whip, who has worked exceptionally hard to try to protect the Government, which is particularly difficult, given that in 2013, 530 MPs voted for section 40 and only 13 voted against it. That vote was for the Courts and Crime Act 2013, which enshrined in law the low-cost access to justice that Lord Justice Leveson had agreed was necessary. That was first suggested by Lord Justice Leveson and then agreed to almost unanimously by all parties in Parliament. However, it was never commenced. Successive Secretaries of State have refused to commence the cost-shifting provisions that are so necessary for access to justice.       Section 40 is not about punishing newspapers that do not sign up to Impress; it is about ensuring low-cost access to justice for vulnerable victims of press abuse. The first part of the Leveson inquiry uncovered the horrific scale of abuse, which was endemic in the press, and there have been many court cases and convictions since. Section 40 ensures that publishers that are members of an independently approved regulator that provides low-cost arbitration do not face expensive court costs. It also ensures that victims of press abuse who have been attacked by publications that are not members of an independently approved regulator can access justice via the courts without having to be extremely wealthy.       There are myths about section 40. The first myth is that it would damage the freedom of the press. That is not true. The press recognition panel is independent and was created by royal charter. The charter enshrines press freedom into law. Criteria 8 states that any regulator       \u201cmust take into account the importance of freedom of speech, the interests of the public133; the need for journalists to protect confidential sources of information, and the rights of individuals.\u201d       Criteria 17 states that such a regulator\u2019s board       \u201cshould not have the power to prevent publication of any material, by anyone, or at any time\u201d.       The only way to change the charter would be by a 66% super-majority in both Houses, plus the unanimous agreement of the press recognition panel\u2019s board. This is not state regulation of the press, or even state regulation of the press regulators; it is the creation of an independent body that will apply Leveson\u2019s criteria for a press regulator to potential self-funded press regulators.       The second myth is that it would threaten the existence of local newspapers. Again, that is not true. New clause 20 would protect all local newspapers that have a turnover of less than 163;100 million and exempt them from section 226;128;\ufffd40. Local newspapers were generally omitted from the criticisms of Leveson 1, and they are rightly protected from costs shifting, which they might be unable to afford.                    Mike Wood (Dudley South) (Con)           Share this contribution        Does my hon. Friend recognise that condition B would still leave 85% of local newspapers covered by the costs-shifting provisions, directly threatening their ability to conduct the investigative journalism that so many of them do so well?                    Bill Wiggin           Share this contribution        I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. What he is saying is that businesses with a turnover of over 163;100 million should be protected, which I think is probably not quite right.                    Richard Drax (South Dorset) (Con)           Share this contribution        Does my hon. Friend find it odd that the lesser-off papers, as I think he phrased it, get away with some things and the better-off papers do not? Is that not discriminatory and completely against British justice?              3.45 pm      Bill Wiggin           Share this contribution        No, it is not, because it is designed to ensure that victims get access to justice. My hon. Friend will find the local papers that may come under section 40 are owned by large companies. The exemption is designed for the charitable sector, which I will come to in just a moment.       One myth is that The Guardian would not be covered. The Daily Mail claimed that The Guardian would be exempt from the section 40 provisions, which is not true. The Guardian would not be covered by condition A, which is necessary to protect the not-for-profit publications that cannot afford cost-shifting\u2014that is the sector my hon. Friend is interested in protecting. The Guardian would be covered because it declares dividends to its members, so it would not be exempted as the Daily Mail suggested.       The next myth about section 40 is that newspapers would have to sign up to Impress, which again is simply not true. The press are at liberty to create their own regulator, which would simply have to fulfil all 29 of Leveson\u2019s criteria in order to become approved. Becoming approved does not require any sort of Government or political approval. It is entirely independent, and there is nothing to stop IPSO applying to become an approved regulator, except that it does not want to provide the low-cost access to justice that is so necessary. IPSO is a press protector, not a press regulator. I say that because it has introduced what it calls a compulsory low-cost arbitration scheme, but that is not right. IPSO\u2019s scheme is voluntary, and the Financial Times, MailOnline and other newspapers not regulated by IPSO have not signed up. Newspapers may leave the scheme whenever they choose. Although I am delighted that IPSO has admitted that low-cost arbitration is necessary, to add to the express view of both Houses and the recommendation of Lord Leveson, this version of it is not right.       If we choose not to vote for section 40 today, we will once again be trusting the newspapers to reform themselves. They say we should trust them and that IPSO is reforming, coincidentally at exactly the same time as we vote on this important new clause. The newspapers have shown again and again that they cannot be trusted, and we must vote to ensure that all victims have access to 226;128;\ufffdlow-cost justice, which is so necessary. Lord Leveson, both Houses of Parliament and, now, IPSO have all agreed this is necessary. Section 40 has been on the statute book for five years, and it is now time it was commenced.                    Brendan O'Hara (Argyll and Bute) (SNP)           Share this contribution        Time is tight, so I will be brief. I rise to speak in support of new clause 18 because the Scottish National party has been clear throughout that all individuals should be able to seek redress when they feel they have been the victim of press malpractice. It benefits each and every one of us to have a media that is both transparent and accountable.       The Scottish National party is committed to ensuring that the practices that led to the Leveson inquiry never happen again. We have been equally clear, however, that if there is to be a second part of the Leveson inquiry, the distinct Scottish legal context must be taken into account and the Scottish Government must be consulted on the scope and scale of any future inquiry.       Both my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) and I raised that on Second Reading and again in Committee, and we put on record our dismay at the wholly inappropriate, indeed lazy, amendments made in the other place that sought to impose a blanket, one-size-fits-all, Truro-to-Thurso policy without any cognisance of the devolution settlement or of the fact that matters of press regulation and criminal justice are wholly devolved to the Parliament in Holyrood. I do not think it unreasonable to expect the House of Lords to know that both criminal justice and press regulation, and all the associated issues of the culture, practice and ethics of the press, fall under devolved competence, and that any blanket UK-wide proposal could only negatively impact on devolution.       Scottish National party Members have said repeatedly that, as long as the Scottish Government are consulted and the Scottish legal system is taken into account, we would be happy to support a Leveson inquiry.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am following the hon. Gentleman\u2019s argument closely. He is right to say that we need to ensure the sins of the past are not repeated, which is why we need new clause 20. Can he confirm whether his party\u2019s position is to support new clause 20 today or, as I have heard, to abstain on it?                    Brendan O'Hara           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman may push that to the vote, but new clause 20 seeks to impose on Scotland a system of press regulation from Westminster, even though this is wholly devolved. I appreciate the work that he and others in Hacked Off have tried to do to square that circle, but it has not been able to be squared. Therefore, we cannot support a system of press regulation that will be imposed from Westminster on Holyrood. That is why I am so pleased that new clause 18 is presented in such a way that it takes on board all of our concerns. I am extremely grateful for the efforts made by the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband) in fashioning the new clause in a way that allows the second part of the Leveson inquiry to take place while recognising the devolution settlement and the distinct position in Scotland. I commend the passion with which he put across his argument this afternoon.226;128;\ufffd       There will be some who will say that part 2 of Leveson is now out of date\u2014indeed, the Secretary of State said as much when he announced his plans to scrap it. People are right to say that much has changed since 2011, which was before Brexit or the fake news agenda dominated the newspapers, but we need to ask ourselves how much has really changed since the height of the phone hacking scandal. The Government are convinced that a step change has taken place, but I question whether it really has. The Secretary of State has pointed out that the world has changed, but these concerns are as relevant now as they were then.       We have seen how much social media is now part and parcel of everyday life. Surely the time is right, with this second part of Leveson, to investigate the role of social media companies\u2014Facebook, Twitter and others\u2014in spreading fake news and disinformation. I would like to think that this inquiry would look to build on the outstanding work being done by the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins) and his Select Committee in pursuing fake news and the spread of disinformation.       On behalf of the Scottish National party, I am delighted to have added my name to new clause 18 because I believe any reasonable person would agree that the terms of reference for this part of the Leveson inquiry have not yet been met.                    Mr Rees-Mogg           Share this contribution        The freedom of the press is so overwhelmingly precious that we should preserve it even if sometimes the press upsets us. It is amazing how many people who have had run-ins with the press have suddenly found that they think it should be more tightly regulated. Fascinatingly, the Daily Mail carried out a survey of their lordships House and discovered that more than a third of those who voted to shackle the press had been embarrassed by the press. May I therefore pay all the greater tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) for his impressive speech? He has suffered at the hands of the press, yet he recognises that the value of the free press is one of the great jewels in the crown of our constitutional settlement. But it is a jewel that has become tarnished because of actions taken by us; in four years, we have fallen in the rank of free nations from 30th to 40th, so that now we are behind Trinidad and Tobago, and, perhaps most insultingly, even below the French in freedom of the press. The clauses before us today should fill us with shame because they go to the heart of what we should believe in, in terms of our liberties, our freedoms and the rule of law.       New clause 18 seeks to have double jeopardy. Why did Leveson 2 not go ahead in the first place? It was because of a fear that trials could be made unfair by an inquiry going ahead at the same time. But those trials have now gone ahead and juries have returned verdicts. Interestingly, what verdicts did they return? It was not the ones the establishment expected. By and large, the journalists were found not guilty\u2014not guilty of misusing any public office\u2014but the police who gave them information were found guilty.       Was that not proper justice at work? The receiving of information as a journalist is your job, but the giving of information as a policeman is against the law. They 226;128;\ufffdhave had justice, they have had the inquiry and they have been through the process, but now people want to put those found innocent through it again. They want to call them in front of a tribunal, to put them on oath, to put them in the stocks, and to let them be quizzed, questioned and interrogated so that the freedom of the press can be undermined and pressurised by those who have sometimes had the sharp lash of the press\u2019s tongue against them. It reeks of self-interest.                    Richard Drax           Share this contribution        Will my hon. Friend give way?                    Mr Rees-Mogg           Share this contribution        I will not because time is so short.       Let me move on to new clause 20, the Max Mosley amendment. A man more cynical than I am might think that 163;540,000 donated to a certain political party might have had some influence on the desire to support Impress\u2014on the desire to support the creation of a known racist, a man who went on anti-Semitic rallies with his father. A party suffering from accusations of anti-Semitism wishes to be in bed with a man who gave it 163;540,000 to pursue his cause, which is to make Impress the regulator of our free press, in the pocket of one of the most disreputable figures in this nation. IPSO has made leaps and bounds to ensure that it is a proper self-regulator. It is self-regulator free from the taint of state approval, state authorisation and state regulation\u2014                    Bill Wiggin           Share this contribution        And from responsibility.                    Mr Rees-Mogg           Share this contribution        The freedoms and liberties that we hold so dear should be preserved, even when they are inconvenient to us. The House may not have heard what my hon. Friend next to me just said. Baldwin\u2019s line was that the press had the \u201cprerogative of the harlot\u201d\u2014power without responsibility. That was his line, but I would rather have a free press in that condition than a Government-approved, propagandised press that took away all our ancient liberties. These new clauses must be wiped out and cut from the legislative book. We must preserve our freedoms.                    Ian C. Lucas           Share this contribution        This has been an excellent debate. I wish to tell the House about a victim of press intrusion. Twenty-one years ago, I represented the bodyguard who survived the crash that killed the Princess of Wales. I made clear to the press at the time that neither he nor his family wished to be pressured, followed or traced by journalists. They completely disregarded my advice and treated someone who was gravely ill, and his family, appallingly.       When I saw the statements in the Kerslake inquiry last year, I saw that, contrary to what the Secretary of State has said, the situation has not changed. Individuals who were the victims of grave crimes were abused, their privacy invaded and their lives turned around by press intrusion. That was after Sir Brian Leveson had conducted his inquiry, and after he, a greatly respected judge, had told the Government that he fundamentally disagreed with their decision not to proceed with the second part of the Leveson inquiry.       Earlier, I intervened on the Secretary of State and asked him why the Conservative party previously supported the terms of section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which it now opposes. For all the eloquence we have just heard, the position is that the Conservative party is breaking a promise that was made to victims of crime by a Prime Minister of this great country, the United 226;128;\ufffdKingdom. Anyone who supports the Government today should be ashamed of themselves, because those victims of crime are the powerless who need protection from the powerful. The powerful are the people who are too close to those who have governmental power.       As my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband) said, we know why this decision is being made\u2014why the Conservative party is backing away from the promise made by a Conservative Prime Minister: it is frightened of the press and its influence. It is a shameful step that it is taking. I appeal to all individual and independent Members of this House to stand up for the powerless against the powerful and to support new clause 18. I implore the Secretary of State to be straightforward with the House.       Question agreed to.       New clause 19 accordingly read a Second time, and added to the Bill.              4.00 pm    Proceedings interrupted (Programme Order, this day).  The Deputy Speaker put forthwith the Questions necessary for the disposal of business to be concluded at that time (Standing Order No. 83E).  New Clause 22  Review of processing of personal data for the purposes of journalism  \u201c(1) The Commissioner must\u2014  (a) review the extent to which the processing of personal data for the purposes of journalism complied with the data protection legislation during the review period,  (b) prepare a report of the review, and  (c) submit the report to the Secretary of State.

(5) The Secretary of State must\u2014  (a) lay the report before Parliament, and  (b) send a copy of the report to\u2014  (i) the Scottish Ministers,  (ii) the Welsh Ministers, and  (iii) the Executive Office in Northern Ireland.\u201d ).\u2014(Matt Hancock.)  This new clause would be inserted after Clause 172. It requires the Information Commissioner to carry out a review of, and report on, the extent to which the processing of personal data for the purposes of journalism complied with the data protection legislation during the first 4 years of its operation. The Secretary of State must lay the report before Parliament and send a copy of the report to the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers and the Executive Office in Northern Ireland (formerly the office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland.

(5) In this section\u2014  \u201cgood practice in the processing of personal data for the purposes of journalism\u201d means such practice in the processing of personal data for those purposes as appears to the Commissioner to be desirable having regard to\u2014  (a) the interests of data subjects and others, including compliance with the requirements of the data protection legislation, and  (b) the special importance of the public interest in the freedom of expression and information;  \u2018trade association\u2019 includes a body representing controllers or processors.\u201d ).\u2014(Matt Hancock.)  This new Clause would be inserted after Clause 123. It requires the Commissioner to prepare a code of practice giving guidance about the processing of personal data for the purposes of journalism. Clauses 124 to 126 (approval, publication and effect) would apply to the code (see amendments 146, 147, 148, 149 and 150).  Brought up, and added to the Bill.  New Clause 18  Data protection breaches by national news publishers  \u201c(1) The Secretary of State must, within the period of three months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed, establish an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 into allegations of data protection breaches committed by or on behalf of national news publishers and other media organisations.

Margot James           Share this contribution        I shall start by addressing the Government amendments\u2014[Interruption.]                    Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing)           Share this contribution        Order. Will people who are leaving the Chamber please do so quietly? The Minister is making an important speech and people want to hear it. It is just rude to make a noise\u2014unless you happen to be in the Chair.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I propose to start my remarks by addressing the Government amendments to strengthen the powers of the Information Commissioner.       The investigation of the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office into Cambridge Analytica is unprecedented in its scale and complexity. It has, necessarily, pushed the 226;128;\ufffdboundaries of what the drafters of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the parliamentarians who scrutinised it could have envisaged. Although we recognise that the Bill already expands and enhances the commissioner\u2019s ability to enforce the requirements of the data protection legislation in such circumstances, the Government undertook to consider whether further provision was desirable in the light of the commissioner\u2019s experience. Following extensive discussions with the commissioner and in Committee, we concluded that such provision is desirable. Our amendments will strengthen the commissioner\u2019s ability to enforce the law, while ensuring that she operates within a clear and accountable structure. I will give a few examples.       First, amendments 27 and 28 will allow the commissioner to require any person who might have knowledge about suspected breaches of the data protection legislation to provide information. Previously, information could be sought only from a data controller or a data processor. That might be important where, for example, a former employee has information about the organisation\u2019s processing activities.       Secondly, new clause 13 will allow the commissioner to apply to the court for an order to force compliance when a person fails to comply with a requirement to provide information. Organisations that might previously have been tempted to pay a fine for non-compliance instead of handing over the information will find themselves at risk of being in contempt of court if they do not comply.       Thirdly, amendments 30 and 45 will allow the commissioner to require controllers to comply with information or enforcement notices within 24 hours in some very urgent cases, rather than the seven days provided for in the existing law. Amendment 38 will allow the commissioner, in certain circumstances, to issue an assessment notice that can have immediate effect. Those amendments will allow the commissioner to obtain information about a suspected breach or put a stop to high-risk processing activities in a prompt and effective way. They will also allow her to carry out no-notice inspections without a warrant in certain circumstances.       Fourthly, new clause 14 will criminalise the behaviour of any person who seeks to frustrate an information or assessment notice by deliberately destroying, falsifying, blocking or concealing evidence that has been identified as relevant to the commissioner\u2019s investigation.       Finally, we have taken this opportunity to modernise the commissioner\u2019s powers. Storing files on an office server is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Amendment 79 will enable the commissioner to apply for a warrant to access material that can be viewed via computers on the premises but that is held in the cloud.       When strengthening the commissioner\u2019s enforcement powers, we have been mindful of the need to provide appropriate safeguards and remedies for those who find themselves under investigation. For example, when an information, assessment or enforcement notice containing an urgency statement is served on a person, new clause 15 will allow them to apply to the court to disapply the urgency statement. In effect, they will have a right to apply to the court to vary the timetable for compliance with the order. A court considering an application from the commissioner for an information order will be able to take into account all the relevant circumstances at 226;128;\ufffdthe time, including whether an application has been brought by the person concerned under new clause 15 and whether the person has brought an appeal against the notice itself in the tribunal. These amendments have been developed in close liaison with the Information Commissioner. We are confident that they will give her the powers she needs to ensure that those who flout the law in our increasingly digital age are held to account for their actions.       I now turn to the representation of data subjects. I am very grateful to Baroness Kidron for her continued engagement on this subject. In particular, we agree that children merit special protection in relation to their personal data and that the review the Government will undertake shall look accordingly at the specific barriers young people and children face in enforcing their rights. Government new clause 16, as well as amendments 61, 62, 63, 70 and 75, ensures that they will.       &amp;emsp;Government new clause 17 concerns maintaining contact with ex-regular reserve forces. This will allow Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs to share contact detail information with the Ministry of Defence to ensure that the MOD is better able to locate and contact members of the ex-regular reserve.       New clause 12, on data sharing by health bodies, is in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee. I know she and the Committee have significant and legitimate concerns about the operation of the memorandum of understanding between NHS Digital and the Home Office, which currently allows the sharing of non-clinical information, principally address information, for immigration purposes. The Select Committee has argued for the suspension of the MOU pending the outcome of a review into its impact by Public Health England. New clause 12 seeks to adopt a more long-term approach by narrowing the ability of NHS Digital to disclose information in connection with the investigation of criminal offences. The aim is to narrow the MOU\u2019s scope, so that it only facilitates the exchange of personal data in cases involving serious criminality.       The Government have reflected further on the concerns put forward by my hon. friend and her Committee. As a result, and with immediate effect, the data sharing arrangements between the Home Office and the NHS have been amended. This is a new step and it supersedes the position set out in previous correspondence between the Home Office, the Department for Health and Social Care and the Select Committee.       I know my hon. Friend and her colleagues have been particularly exercised by the contents of a letter dated 23 February from both the above-mentioned Departments to her Select Committee, in which it is stated that       \u201ca person using the NHS can have a reasonable expectation when using this taxpayer-funded service that their non-medical data, which lies at the lower end of the privacy spectrum, will not be shared securely between other officers within government in exercise of their lawful powers\u201d.       The bar for sharing data will now be set significantly higher. By sharing, I mean sharing between the Department of Health and Social Care, the Home Office and, in future, possibly other Departments. No longer will the names of overstayers and illegal entrants be sought against health service records to find current address details. The data sharing, relying on powers under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the National Health 226;128;\ufffdService Act 2006 and the Health and Social Care Act 2008, will only be used to trace an individual who is being considered for deportation action having been investigated for, or convicted of, a serious criminal offence that results in a minimum sentence of at least 12 months in prison.       The Government have a long-held policy on what level of serious criminality is deserving of deportation, given statutory force by the UK Borders Act 2007. When a custodial sentence of more than 12 months has been given, consideration for deportation must therefore follow. Henceforth, the Home Office will only be able to use the memorandum of understanding to trace an individual who is being considered for deportation action having been convicted of a serious criminal offence, or when their presence is considered non-conducive to the public good\u2014for example, when they present a risk to public security but have yet to be convicted of a criminal offence.              4.30 pm      Alison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP)           Share this contribution        Can the Minister give me more reassurance about the Home Office and its activity in this regard? At the moment, I have constituents who, under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules, face being deported for making legitimate changes to their tax return through HMRC data being accessed. Will she reassure me about what the Home Office can do to make sure that this is not abused and misused for the purposes of meeting immigration targets?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I will write to the hon. Lady and I hope to give her reassurance. This new higher bar concerns NHS data and that would obviously not catch within it errors on a tax return.       As now, the memorandum of understanding would also continue to operate when there are concerns about the welfare and safety of a missing individual\u2014for example, vulnerable children and adults. That has always been the case. Personal information will only be disclosed to the Home Office or agencies under the purview of the Home Office. This is a significant restriction on the Home Office\u2019s ability to use data held by the NHS. It is estimated that the change will exclude over 90% of the requests that have been satisfied to date.                    Sir Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton) (LD)           Share this contribution        The Minister talks about a memorandum of understanding giving reassurance to the House. I refer her to part 2 of schedule 2, which talks about exemptions from the general data protection regulation in respect of crime and taxation. Surely, the rights of individuals to have their data protected under that provision would address all these issues, and it would potentially supersede the memorandum of understanding.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I will come on to the exemptions in terms of criminal activity and immigration in a wider context than NHS information in due course.       My right hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration is committed to sending a copy of an updated MOU to the Health and Social Care Committee shortly, but as I have indicated, the significant narrowing of the MOU will have immediate effect. This commitment is consistent with the intention underpinning new clause 12. I trust 226;128;\ufffdthat on that basis, my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes and her colleagues will not press new clause 12. I am sure that if she has any questions, she will intervene on me, or that when she makes her remarks later, I might be invited to intervene on her. I thank my hon. Friend and all her Committee members for their work to establish higher principles in this area.       I turn to Opposition amendments 16 and 15 and Government amendments 141 and 142, on immigration. Amendment 15 would remove the provisions relating to effective immigration control in schedule 2. In responding to the amendment, I want to address some of the continued misunderstandings that have arisen around the purpose and scope of the provision, and I hope to persuade the House that this is a necessary and proportionate measure to protect the integrity of our immigration system. It has been suggested that the provisions have no basis in the GDPR, but article 23 expressly allows member states to restrict certain specified rights for the purpose of safeguarding       \u201cother important objectives of general public interest of a133;Member State\u201d.       The maintenance of effective immigration control is one such objective.                    Sir Edward Davey           Share this contribution        Will the Minister confirm that article 23 of the GDPR does not specify immigration?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        It does not rule out immigration and it does allow the restriction of certain specified rights\u2014not wholesale restrictions\u2014for the purpose of safeguarding       \u201cother important objectives of general public interest\u201d.       The purpose is to provide a derogation for member states wide enough that they can pursue an overall Government policy in the general public interest. I would conclude that immigration is one such example. It has been suggested that the provisions represent a blanket carve-out of all a data subject\u2019s rights. That is certainly not the case. I would like to reassure the right hon. Gentleman that we are being very selective about the rights that could be disapplied. The exemption will be applied only on a case-by-case basis and only where it is necessary and proportionate.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Has the Minister learnt nothing from the Windrush scandal? Here we have a Department of State that is not fantastic at keeping records. The idea of selectively carving out particular rights of particular people who need this information to fight tribunal cases strikes me as lunacy, given what we have learnt about the dysfunction at the Home Office.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        Perhaps if I continue my remarks, I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman that of course lessons have been learnt, not least by the Home Office itself, as both the former Home Secretary and the current Home Secretary have made abundantly clear to the House.       The exemption in the amendment is to be applied only on a case-by-case basis and only where it is necessary and proportionate. It cannot and will not be used to target any group of people. Nor does the application of the exemption set aside all a data subject\u2019s rights; it sets aside only those expressly listed. A further limitation is that it can be applied only where compliance with the relevant rights would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of effective immigration control.                 226;128;\ufffd            Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Effective safeguards for crime prevention are already written into the Bill, which gives the Minister the power she is seeking to fulfil the purpose she is setting out for the House. If we selectively discard rights for selected people, we come pretty close to arbitrary decision making, and it is practically impossible to do that consistently and in way defendable in a judicial review. These provisions will result in injustice and cases that the Home Office loses, so just dump them now!                    Margot James           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman should know that different structures govern crime and immigration. I reiterate that we are disapplying these rights selectively\u2014the data subjects will hang on to the majority of their rights\u2014but it cannot be right for the Home Office to have to furnish someone who is in contravention of immigration law with information it has been given.                    Yvette Cooper (Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford) (Lab)           Share this contribution        I am shocked by what the Minister is saying. These provision were drafted before the Windrush scandal broke, and she is not learning the lessons at all. She says she wants these decisions made on an individual basis and in a way that is necessary and proportionate, but necessary and proportionate to achieve what? None of us knows what her definition of immigration control is. Does it mean meeting the net migration target, which is what we normally hear Ministers say? Necessary and proportionate to meet the net migration target could mean anything.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I understand that it is a matter of interpretation. I also understand that the Home Office is considering these matters in the fallout from the Windrush case. I am sure that, as Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, the right hon. Lady will have ample opportunity to question the new Home Secretary on exactly what he might mean by \u201cnecessary and proportionate\u201d. When someone is seeking access to data from the Home Office to prove their immigration history, such as in the Windrush cases, there will be no basis for invoking the immigration exemption in the Bill. I trust that that provides the right hon. Lady with some comfort.

We are being invited to pass an important piece of legislation which hands important new powers to Her Majesty\u2019s Home Office, yet there is not a Home 226;128;\ufffdOffice Minister on the Front Bench to respond to the points that we are making about the details of that legislation. What steps can we take to summon a Home Office Minister this afternoon, so that our questions can be answered?                    Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing)           Share this contribution        I understand the right hon. Gentleman\u2019s point of order, but the fact is that the Minister, who is a very capable Minister, speaks for the Government, who are seamless. The Minister who is currently at the Dispatch Box is in a position to speak for all Ministers on this matter, which is why she has this responsibility and is responding to the questions that are currently being asked of her.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I might as well give way to the right hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Sir Edward Davey) now.                    Sir Edward Davey           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the Minister. To help other Members consider amendment 15, let me point out that one of the data protection provisions that are being exempted for immigration purposes is the right to make subject access requests. It is critical to the rule of law for people and their representatives to know on the basis of what information the Home Office has made its decisions. The Bill provides no safeguards, no balance, and no restrictions to the use of that law by Home Office officials. As we heard from the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), those are simply not in the Bill. It is entirely wrong for the House to be asked to pass a Bill that does not contain real safeguards for the people involved, given what happened in the Windrush cases.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I will continue to make some progress, as I feel that those points have already been made.       The application of the exemption does not set aside all data subjects\u2019 rights, but only those expressly listed. A further limitation is that exemptions can be applied only where compliance with the relevant rights would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of effective immigration control.                    Sir Edward Davey           Share this contribution        What does that mean?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        It is an established term. It is used in the Immigration Act 2014 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 uses a similar term, namely \u201coperation of immigration controls\u201d.                    Mr Ranil Jayawardena (North East Hampshire) (Con)           Share this contribution        Without this immigration exemption, might not the Home Office have to disclose sources of tip-offs, which would not be conducive to ensuring that illegal immigration is properly controlled?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I think it highly likely that if, for example, someone were to undertake a full data subject review of whatever information the Home Office held about them\u2014as was posited earlier by the right hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton\u2014the review would contain sources of information as well as the information itself. A further limitation is that exemptions can be applied only where compliance with the relevant rights would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of immigration control. This \u201cprejudice\u201d test must be applied first, and 226;128;\ufffdas a result the situations in which the exemption can be used are limited. The Government recognise the concerns that have been expressed in this debate.              4.45 pm      Stuart C. McDonald (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East) (SNP)           Share this contribution        Can the Minister give us a couple of examples to illustrate why these additional powers are necessary, and where the other powers in the Bill\u2014in relation to criminal offences and investigations, for example\u2014would not already suffice to do everything that the Home Office wishes?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        We are permitted under GDPR to make these exemptions and are doing so in a very selective way and on a case-by-case basis, so it will not result in a widespread denial of people\u2019s data rights.       The exemption should be as limited as possible, which is why we have brought forward amendments 141 and 142. These amendments will ensure that migrants enjoy the rights afforded under all of the data protection principles, except where a restriction on those principles is a consequence of restricting one of the other rights coming within the scope of the exemption.       I now turn to Opposition amendments 18 and 19 on primary care providers and Government amendments 22 to 24 on parish councils. Parish and community councils are not exempt from the new law. None the less, by describing parish and community councils as \u201cpublic authorities\u201d the Bill gives these councils additional obligations above and beyond those placed on other small organisations, including that they must appoint a data protection officer. We have been working to minimise the impact of this requirement, and have concluded that as parish and community councils process very little personal data, the burden they would face would be disproportionate. Amendments 22, 23 and 24 therefore take these councils out of the definition of \u201cpublic authorities\u201d for data protection purposes.                    Mr Jayawardena           Share this contribution        I commend my hon. Friend the Minister on amendment 24, which recognises that councils are often so tiny\u2014indeed, some are not even parish councils, and some do not employ any staff\u2014that it would be wholly disproportionate to treat them in the way originally intended. I commend the Minister for listening to so many Members who made these points and recognising that parish councils must be treated separately.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. He and other colleagues across the House made these arguments, and given that such organisations are often very small and process only small amounts of personal data, we have decided to take parish councils out of the definition of \u201cpublic authorities\u201d for data protection purposes. Their status in respect of other legislation, including the Freedom of Information Act, is unaffected, however.       Similar arguments have been advanced in respect of primary care providers, but although I have sympathy with amendments 18 and 19, primary care providers are different from parish councils in that they process sizeable quantities of sensitive health data, whether that be an 226;128;\ufffdindividual\u2019s mental health status, the fact that they are pregnant, or details of their prescription for a terminal illness. All of these matters are highly personal, and in the world of health, data protection is rightly paramount.       The Dean Street Express case in 2015 illustrates the potential harm that even a single data breach can cause. In that incident, the names and email addresses of almost 800 people, many living with HIV, were disclosed to other recipients. It does not seem unreasonable that bodies who process that kind of data should have a single point of contact on data protection matters.       Government amendments 139 and 140 relate to legal professional privilege. We recognise the importance of protecting legal professional privilege and that is why in the Bill we have replicated the existing measures and exemptions for legal professional privilege found in the Data Protection Act 1998, which have worked well for many years.       Amendments 10 and 11 seek to widen the legal professional privilege exemptions found in schedules 2 and 11. They offer some thoughtful changes that are intended to recognise the broader range of material covered by a lawyer\u2019s ethical duty of confidentiality. We agree that the Bill could be clearer, and have tabled amendments 139 and 140 in response.                    Sir Mike Penning (Hemel Hempstead) (Con)           Share this contribution        It is interesting that we are making lots of exemptions for the Government, parish councils, lawyers and so on. I spoke to some lawyers this morning, and they were not convinced by the measures either. However, small businesses seem to be disproportionately affected, and there is real confusion out there. As I say, a lot of work has been done to protect the Government, parish councils and lawyers, but what about the little people\u2014the people who make this country grow? There is even confusion in the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, which gave the wrong advice in briefings here to MPs\u2019 staff only the other week. What are we going to do to protect the small people? They think that they are doing the right thing, but they have probably been ill advised. They are spending a lot of money trying to get things right, but there is real confusion out there.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        My right hon. Friend raises several important points. As for the effect on small businesses, he will be reassured to learn that the issues with the processing of highly personal data that I was discussing do not apply to the majority of SMEs. They will not have to appoint a data protection officer, so that is one comfort.       As for training and guidance, I am sorry that colleagues and their research staff attended courses that were put together before the Bill was even in Committee, and thus did not take numerous amendments into account\u2014not least the amendment clarifying the rights of Members of Parliament and other elected individuals. I apologise for that confusion.       I draw businesses\u2019 attention to the excellent ICO website, which contains good sources of guidance for SMEs, including frequently asked questions. The ICO also provides an advice line for any follow-up questions on subjects that businesses might not be clear about. Ultimately, there is a need for better data protection, and that is not just what is set out in the GDPR. Dreadful examples, such as the case of 226;128;\ufffdFacebook and Cambridge Analytica, have demonstrated the need for more rigorous data rights and for greater security of data.                    Sir Mike Penning           Share this contribution        The Minister is being ever so generous in giving way not just to me, but to Members from across the House, and I thank her. Returning to the parliamentary stuff\u2014we are only a small part of all this\u2014some of the staff present at the briefing I mentioned left in tears, and I know that for a fact, because a member of my staff was there. Believe it or not, even though the ICO knew that the briefing was completely flawed, it has today issued certificates of attendance saying that it was the right thing for staff to have done.       More important, however, are the SMEs. Small businesses have approached me today to tell me that they have been told to delete all their data unless they get permission from the relevant people. Companies that did work for people three, four or five years ago\u2014even last year\u2014must get permission to hold their addresses so that they can fulfil, for example, warranty agreements. Other companies are getting completely different advice, and the lawyers are getting different advice. There seems to be a rush to protect Government agencies, local government, parish councils and lawyers, but not enough is being done to protect the small people of this country\u2014the people who account for so much of our money.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I thank my right hon. Friend for his points. I want to reassure the small businesses that he mentions. I sympathise with businesses that are getting conflicting advice, and with those that are approached by firms of consultants who appear to be exaggerating the scale of the task of complying with the legislation. I am afraid that that always happens when there is change; people think that they can exaggerate the impact and the implications of a change and\u2014who knows?\u2014perhaps they will be remunerated for helping businesses to comply.       I also want to reassure my right hon. Friend about the specific case that he mentioned, in which companies were being advised that they needed to delete all the data for which they did not have consent. I want to reassure him that the vast majority of businesses will not have to delete the personal data that they hold. If they have gained the personal data lawfully, there are five, if not six, lawful bases on which they can process that personal data, of which consent is only one. I draw his attention particularly to legitimate interests, which is a lawful basis for processing data. For example, if a small firm has been supplying a much-needed service to people for a number of years, it is in the pursuit of its legitimate interests to communicate with its database of customers or new prospects, and it does not need to have consent. I would advise people not to delete their data without very careful consideration, or without consultation with the ICO website in particular.                    Anna Soubry           Share this contribution        Will the Minister give way?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I will give way to my right hon. Friend in a second. I want to respond to my right hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Sir Mike Penning) on the alleged discrimination involved in our taking steps to protect lawyers, parliamentarians, local councillors and so on but not to protect small businesses. The reason is that small businesses are less affected, in the sense that most of them do not process huge quantities of personal data. They therefore come under the purview 226;128;\ufffdof the ICO to a lesser extent, and enforcement is less likely to focus on organisations that do not process highly personal data. Those organisations do not need to appoint a data protection officer. I hope that I have gone some way towards allaying my right hon. Friend\u2019s\u2014                    Sir Mike Penning           Share this contribution        rose\u2014                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I will come back to my right hon. Friend in a moment, but I did say that I would give way to my right hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry).                    Anna Soubry           Share this contribution        I thank my hon. Friend for that information, but it was mainly complete news to me, as I suspect it was to my right hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead too. We have a really serious problem here. I just cannot underestimate the amount of concern among small businesses. Medium-sized businesses with more than 250 employees have the benefit of a team of people, but this is a real crisis for small businesses and I am afraid that the lack of information is truly troubling. There are solutions, and perhaps we should discuss them in a different debate, but as a Government we have an absolute duty to get this right. There are devices available\u2014HMRC sends out tax returns, for example\u2014and there are many opportunities to get this information out there. At the moment, however, there is a lot of disinformation, and as my right hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead says, these businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They do not know what is happening, and they are worried.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I sympathise with the points that my right hon. Friend has raised. In fact, we have secured almost 163;500,000 to launch an information campaign to bolster what the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is already doing for small businesses. I also draw her attention to the need for this legislation, and to the need for businesses and all of us in public life to respect people\u2019s data rights. The landscape has changed. We now live in a digital world, and there is so much abuse of people\u2019s privacy and data that I must bring her attention back to the need for the Bill. Of course she is right, however, to say that people need to be properly informed, and that is what the ICO is doing and what the Government campaign that we are about to launch will also do.                    Sir Mike Penning           Share this contribution        What the Minister said at the Dispatch Box a moment ago was also news to me. I have been campaigning and pushing on this for months\u2014I spoke to the Secretary of State over the bank holiday weekend\u2014and I was going to vote against the Bill this evening. Yes, we need data protection, but we do not want to destroy or frighten our businesses in the process. However, I take my hon. Friend at her word, and I will vote for the legislation this evening.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I quite agree. In fact, both the Secretary of State and I were small business owners before entering this place, so I feel what my right hon. Friend says very deeply. I must commend my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Worcestershire (Nigel Huddleston) on the excellent advice that his office has put together on what it will be doing in this respect. For the benefit of my staff, I have set out exactly what my office will be doing to comply with the legislation. If my right hon. Friend has any concerns about his own situation\u2014                 226;128;\ufffd            Sir Mike Penning           Share this contribution        I am not worried about us; I am worried about small businesses.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        In that case, I will proceed no further down that path. I am glad that I have been able to reassure my right hon. Friend and thank him for raising those important points.              5.00 pm      Chi Onwurah (Newcastle upon Tyne Central) (Lab)           Share this contribution        I thank the Minister for that clarification, but I am not sure that it is clear enough. She will undoubtedly be aware that the Windrush documents were supposedly destroyed as a result of data protection requirements. There remains a significant possibility that there will be a wholesale destruction of data, some of which might be important, useful and legitimately kept, unless the Government take further action.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I commend the hon. Lady for that observation, because she has a fair point. I will raise her concern with the Information Commissioner. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said that some businesses have been advised that they should delete their data, so I can see where the hon. Lady is going on that. It raises the prospect that some organisations might use this as an excuse to delete data that it would be in the data subject\u2019s interests to preserve.       I have not been able to address every amendment in the time available, but I am mindful of the number of colleagues who wish to contribute, and we have less than 60 minutes remaining. I have addressed most of the matters that came up in the Public Bill Committee, and the Government\u2019s position will remain the same on many of them.       In short, we have enhanced the ICO\u2019s enforcement powers, we have changed the way we share data, we have reached out to parish councils, we have narrowed the immigration exemption and we have responded to calls to better protect lawyer-client confidentiality. We have also dealt\u2014effectively, I hope\u2014with the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes about the sharing of data between the Department of Health and Social Care and the Home Office.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        May I start by welcoming the new powers for the Information Commissioner, which we called for in Committee? Nobody who observed the debacle of the investigation into Cambridge Analytica will have needed persuading that that those powers are necessary\u2014it took the court five or six days to issue the requisite search warrants, and that time might well have been used by Cambridge Analytica to destroy evidence\u2014so I am glad that the Minister has heeded our calls and introduced the proposals this afternoon. We are happy to give them our support.       I will speak to a number of new clauses and amendments in the group, particularly new clause 4, which is our enabling clause for creating a bold and imaginative Bill of data rights for the 21st century. I want to make the case for universal application of those rights, including their application to newcomers, who need rights in order to challenge bad decisions made by Governments, which is why our amendment 15 would strike out the immigration provisions that have so unwisely been put into the Bill. I will also say a few 226;128;\ufffdwords about new measures that are needed in the Bill to defend the integrity of our democracy in the digital age.       The Minister took the time to make a comprehensive speech, which included an excellent explanation of the Government amendments, so I will be brief. Let me start with the argument for a Bill of data rights. Every so often we have to try to democratise both progress and protections. In this country we are the great writers of rights\u2014we have been doing it since Magna Carta. Over the years, the universal declaration of human rights, the UN convention on the rights of the child, the charter of fundamental rights, the Human Rights Act 1998, the Equality Act 2010 and, indeed, the original Data Protection Act have all been good examples of how good and wise people in this country have enshrined into charters and other legal instruments a set of rights that we can all enjoy, that give us all a set of protections, and that help us to democratise progress.                    Chi Onwurah           Share this contribution        My right hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Does he share my astonishment that the Government are not taking the opportunity to update our rights for the digital age? Does he think that that is because they are too captured by the tech giants, because they are too confused by Brexit to invest in change, or because they are too ideologically constipated regarding the free market that they can do nothing about it?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        My hon. Friend hits the nail on the head. The answer, of course, is that it is because of all three of those reasons that we do not have before us an imaginative bill of digital rights, but the times do call for it.       In the early days, when we were writing great charters such as Magna Carta, the threats to ordinary citizens were from bad monarchs. We needed provisions such as Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights and the Glorious Revolution to protect the citizens of this country and their wealth from bad monarchs who would seek to steal things that were not theirs.       What we now confront is not a bad monarch\u2014we have a fantastic monarch\u2014but the risk of bad big tech. The big five companies now have a combined market capitalisation of some $2.5 trillion, and they are up to all sorts of things. They are often protected by the first amendment in the United States, but their business\u2014their bad business\u2014often hurts the data rights of citizens in this country.       That is why we need this new bill of rights. We have to accept that we are on the cusp of radical and rapid changes in legislation and regulation. I often make the point that over the course of the 19th century there was not one Factory Act but 17 Factory Acts. We had to legislate and re-legislate as technology, economics and methods of production changed, and that is the point we are at now. We will have to regulate and re-regulate, and legislate and re-legislate, again and again over the decades to come. Therefore, if we are to give people any certainty about what the new laws will look like, it would be a sensible precaution if we were to write down now the principles that will form the north star that guides us as we seek to keep legislation up to date.                    Mr Jim Cunningham           Share this contribution        I am that sure my right hon. Friend has received correspondence from constituents who are worried about the use of personal data. My 226;128;\ufffdconstituents have a lot of sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston) about this. Does my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne) agree?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        My hon. Friend is right. We have been at the receiving end of a huge number of data breaches in this country\u2014really serious infringements of basic 21st-century rights\u2014which is why we need a bold declaration of those rights so that the citizens of this country know what they are entitled to. Unless we get this right, we will not be able to build the environment of trust that is the basis of trade in the digital economy. At the moment, trust in the online world is extremely weak\u2014that trust is going down, not up\u2014so we need to put in place measures now, as legislators, to fix this, turn it around and put in place preparations for the future.       The Government\u2019s proposal of a digital charter is a bit like the cones hotline approach to public service reform. The contents of the charter are not really rights but guidelines. There are no good methods of redress or transparency. Frankly, if we try to introduce rights and redress mechanisms in that way, they will basically fail and will not lead to any kind of change. That is why we urge the Government to follow the approach that we are setting out.       I put on record my profound thanks to Baroness Kidron and the 5Rights movement. Her work forms the basis of the bill of rights we are proposing to the House: the right to remove data, as enshrined in the GDPR\u2014that right is very important to children\u2014the right to know; the right to safety and support; the right to informed and conscious use; and the right to digital literacy. Those are the kinds of rights we should now be talking about as the rights of every child and every citizen.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman makes some good points. I agree with the rights he is talking about, but those rights exist under the GDPR and are intrinsic to the Bill, so I see no need for his amendment.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        There is no right to digital literacy under the Bill, which is why we propose the five rights as the core of new schedule 1 in which, as the Minister knows, we go much further. The provision sets out rights to equality of treatment, security, free expression, access, privacy, ownership and control, the right not to be discriminated against as a result of automated decision making, and rights on participation, protection and removal.       Rights are sometimes scattered through thousands and thousands of pages of legislation, which is where we are on data protection today. That is why from time to time, as a country, we decide to make bold declaratory statements of what principles should guide us. These are methods of simplification and consolidation, and we are pretty good at that in this country. When we press our proposal to enable the creation of such a bill of rights to a Division a little later, we hope that it will be the call that the Government need to begin the process of consultation, thought, argument and debate about the digital rights that we need in this century and what they need to look like. Rights should not be imposed from the top down; they should come from the grassroots up, and the process of 226;128;\ufffdconversation and consultation is long overdue. To help the Government, we will accelerate that debate during this year.       The second point I wish to make is about amendment 15, which would ensure that the rights set out in the GDPR would stretch to everyone in this country. It would mean that the Government would not be permitted to knock out selective rights for certain people who just happen to be newcomers to this country. The proposal to withhold data rights from migrants and newcomers is a disgrace and does not deserve to be in the Bill. In Committee, Ministers were unable to tell us why the Bill\u2019s crime prevention provisions could not be stretched to accommodate their ambitions for immigration control. The Minister has not been able to give us a succinct definition of \u201cimmigration control\u201d today, and we have not been able to hear about the lessons learnt from Windrush. Frankly, the debate has been left poorly informed, and we have had promises that letters will sent to hon. Members long after tonight\u2019s vote.                    Sir Edward Davey           Share this contribution        I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman\u2019s point. He says that this is about newcomers and immigrants, and I am sure he will agree that it also applies to British citizens\u2019 ability to get their immigration file. Can he confirm that that is the case?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am not sure that that is the case. British citizens have confirmed rights under the GDPR\u2014that is safeguarded under EU legislation\u2014but the risks I am worried about are the same ones as the right hon. Gentleman. I spent two and a half years in the Home Office. I recognised many of the errors that were made by the former Home Secretary in the situation that we inherited back in 2006, so I do not think that lessons have been learnt from Windrush, or that many lessons have been learnt from errors over the past eight to 10 years. The Home Office is a great Department of State, with tremendous strengths. It has fantastic civil servants who do an amazing job, without the resources to so it properly and very often without the level of support they need from their Ministers, but it is a human institution and such institutions make mistakes. To correct those, we have tribunals and courts through which people can test decisions made by officials without the disinfectant of sunlight. Unless we equip those individuals with everything they need to make their case effectively, we risk injustice. After our debates over the past month, we must do everything we can so that we never run that risk again.                    Mr Jim Cunningham           Share this contribution        To pursue those rights, people also need legal aid, and in some circumstances, they are denied legal aid. The state should not have the right to give private information about its citizens to anybody, or even to sell it to organisations.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Correct. In my first months at the Home Office, I spent a lot of time in immigration tribunals. I used to go to the courts up in Islington to sit, watch and listen so that I could learn the basic mechanisms of justice in this country. The thing that struck me was the inequality of arms that comes to bear in these tribunals. On the one side, there is a Home Office lawyer, who is sometimes there, sometimes not. Home Office lawyers are backed by teams and have well-constructed cases and all the information they need. On the other side of 226;128;\ufffdthe argument are people without money or access to lawyers, but now the Government propose to deny some of them the information that they need to argue and win their cases. It is a recipe for injustice.              5.15 pm      Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green)           Share this contribution        I very much agree with the points that the right hon. Gentleman is making. Does he agree that we ought to consider the way in which the crime exemption in the Bill will be invoked in respect of low-level offences under immigration law? Is it really acceptable for data rights to be suspended in relation to normal activities such as driving\u2014just being here\u2014that are currently criminalised under immigration law?                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Those are real risks, which is why amendment 15 would delete such an important chunk of the Bill and therefore improve it.       I know that when I was a Home Office Minister, I took decisions that sometimes were wrong, and those decisions were corrected through the tribunal system. Tribunal cases were often successfully prosecuted by those who had rights that we were seeking to deny because subject access requests had been used to get the information necessary to win the argument. If we switch off that access, injustice will follow, so I urge the Government to think again and I urge Members from all parties to support amendment 15.       The last measure to which I shall speak is new clause 6, which is our proposal for a UK version of the Honest Ads Act that is currently being debated in the United States Congress. I do not want to rehearse the background to the debate for long, because for six months now a hardy group of us has been seeking to raise and unpack the new risks that we confront from countries such as Russia that are aiming at us a new panoply of active measures, including all kinds of bad behaviour online. Right now, we do not have good measures to defend the integrity of our democracy. Indeed, the most recent edition of the national security strategy did not even include the defence of the integrity of democracy among its core strategic aims.       We have to bring our election law into the 21st century as it is hopelessly out of date. We have an Electoral Commission that is unable effectively to investigate donations and money coming from abroad. The Information Commissioner has only this afternoon been given the powers that it needs. Ofcom will not investigate videos on social media and the Advertising Standards Authority does not investigate political advertising. We have a massive lacuna in which there should be good, robust legislation to police elections in the 21st century.       If we look at what is going on throughout the west, we see that we have to wake up to this risk. Giving the Electoral Commission new powers to require information about money that is used to run campaigns that try to influence votes is now a de minimis provision for a modern democracy in the digital age. We hope that the Minister will listen to us and take our ideas on board.                    Several hon. Members rose\u2014           Share this contribution                          226;128;\ufffd            Madam Deputy Speaker (Mrs Eleanor Laing)           Share this contribution        Order. We have only 40 minutes left to debate this group and around 10 Members wish to speak. If everybody speaks for four to five minutes, everybody will get in; if not, some people will not get to speak at all.                    Dr Sarah Wollaston (Totnes) (Con)           Share this contribution        I rise to speak to new clause 12, which was tabled in my name, that of my colleague, the hon. Member for Stockton South (Dr Williams), and those of other Members of the Health and Social Care Committee of and Members from all parties.       I wish to speak about the importance of medical confidentiality, because it lies at the heart of the trust between clinicians and their patients, and we mess with that at our peril. If people do not have that trust, they are less likely to come forward and seek the care that they need. There were many unintended consequences as a result of the decision enshrined in a memorandum of understanding between the Home Office, the Department of Health and NHS Digital, which allowed the sharing of addresses at a much lower crime threshold than serious crime. That was permitted under the terms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, but patients were always protected, in effect, because the terms of the NHS constitution, the guidance from the General Medical Council and a raft of guidance from across the NHS and voluntary agencies protected the sharing of data in practice.       This shift was therefore particularly worrying. There were many unintended consequences for the individuals concerned. The Health and Social Care Committee was also deeply concerned about the wider implications that this might represent a shift to data sharing much more widely across Government Departments. There was a risk, for example, that the Department for Work and Pensions might take an interest in patients\u2019 addresses to see whether people were co-habiting for the purpose of investigating benefit fraud. There was a really serious risk of that.       I am afraid that the letter that we received from the Department of Health and Social Care and the Home Office declining to withdraw from the memorandum of understanding made the risk quite explicit. I would just like to quote from the letter, because it is very important. I also seek further clarification from the Minister on this. The letter states that       \u201cit is also important to consider the expectations of anybody using the NHS\u2014a state provided national resource. We do not consider that a person using the NHS can have a reasonable expectation when using this taxpayer-funded service that their non-medical data, which lies at the lower end of the privacy spectrum, will not be shared securely between other officers within government in the exercise of their lawful powers in cases such as these.\u201d       I profoundly object to that statement. There was no such contract in the founding principles of the NHS. As I have said, it is vital that we preserve that fundamental principle of confidentiality, including for address data. I was delighted to hear the Minister\u2019s words at the Dispatch Box, but can she just confirm for me absolutely that that statement has now been superseded?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        Yes, I can confirm absolutely that the statement that my hon. Friend quoted from the letter of 23 February has been superseded by today\u2019s announcements.                 226;128;\ufffd            Dr Wollaston           Share this contribution        I thank the Minister for that reassurance. There is much more that I could say, but I know that there are very many other colleagues who wish to speak. With that reassurance, I am happy not to press my amendment to a vote.       I would like to make one further comment on protecting patients. At a time when confidence in data sharing is so important, especially around issues such as research, we all rely on the role of NHS Digital. Set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 as a non-departmental public body at arm\u2019s length from Government, NHS Digital has the specific duty robustly to stand up for the interests of patients and for the principles of confidentiality. As a Committee, we were deeply disappointed that, despite the clear concern set out from a range of bodies, including Public Health England, all the medical royal colleges, very many voluntary agencies, the National Data Guardian and others, the organisation seemed to have just the dimmest grasp of the principles of underpinning confidentiality. I wish to put it on the record that we expect the leadership of NHS Digital to take its responsibilities seriously, to understand the ethical underpinnings and to stand up for patients. With that, I will close my remarks. I thank the Minister for the time that she has taken to listen to our concerns and for her response.                    Yvette Cooper           Share this contribution        I wish to speak briefly to amendment 15 and to say to those on the Front Bench that this is their opportunity to actually do something as Ministers. I urge them to make a late change and not just to drift on with legislation that was drawn up before the Windrush scandal. They can go and talk to the Secretary of State\u2014have a discussion with him\u2014and decide now to accept amendment 15. I really urge Ministers to do that, because what the Bill is doing is immensely serious. The Bill is incredibly widely drawn. This exemption allows the Home Office to refuse subject access requests in immigration cases and to put in place data sharing without proper accountability in any case where it meets the maintenance of effective immigration control or the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective control, and yet, repeatedly, we have had no explanation from Ministers as to what effective immigration control means. That is because, in truth, it is immensely broad. It could mean meeting the net migration target, sustaining the hostile environment and enabling a deportation that the Home Office thinks is justified, even if in practice it has made a mistake. It could mean decisions being taken by immigration removal centres, G4S, Serco or any of the many private companies contracted by the Home Office to deliver its so-called effective immigration control.       The Home Office has made an objective of reducing the number of appeals and removing the right to appeal in immigration cases. If a subject access request makes an appeal more likely, why does preventing that SAR in order to prevent a potential appeal not count as immigration control under the Home Office\u2019s definition? That would be unjustified and wrong, but it is made possible by the Bill. If the Government do not want that to be the case, they should change their proposed legislation and accept amendment 15.       Ministers do not have to go ahead with this right now. An immigration Bill is going to come down the track at some future point and it will give them and the Home Secretary the opportunity to reflect on the Windrush 226;128;\ufffdscandal. The Immigration Minister told the Home Affairs Committee yesterday that the culture of the Home Office, including that of casework and decision making, needs to change. The Home Secretary and the former Home Secretary recognise that substantial changes need to be made. We are told that huge lessons have been learned and we have been promised inquiries that will report back and have independent oversight. None of them have yet taken place, but the Windrush scandal has had shocking and devastating consequences for individual lives, as so many Members on both sides of the House acknowledge. I therefore ask Ministers to not make future Windrush scandals more likely and to not deny people the information they need about their case in order to prove their circumstances and ensure that a Home Office mistake or error can be overturned.       Michael Braithwaite came here from Barbados in 1961. He is a special needs teacher who has lived here for more than 50 years, and yet he was sacked from his job because the Home Office got it wrong. His lawyer\u2019s application for a subject access request formed part of the process for clearing up and sorting out his case, but the Bill will make it much more difficult to make such a request. Subject access requests are already often resisted by the Home Office. Whether inadvertently or intentionally, the Home Office has a bad record in complying swiftly and fully with subject access requests, so why on earth does this Bill make that more likely and further allow the Home Office to simply not give people the information they need to make sure that justice is done?       There are huge concerns about the way in which targets have operated. The Home Secretary and other Ministers will have to look into that in depth. In the meantime, however, they should not allow a situation to develop whereby the operation of those targets could end up with subject access requests being denied because meeting those targets is seen as part of effective immigration control.       The Home Office does get things wrong. There are huge strengths and skills within the Home Office. There are people who work immensely hard to try to get things right, but we know that a Department that size gets things wrong and we have seen the evidence, to terrible effect, in the Windrush cases. There have been 60 cases of unlawful detention in the past few years, even before the Windrush cases. Nearly half of the cases that go to appeal go against the Home Office because it got those decisions wrong. Sampling by the immigration inspectorate found that 10% of the data that the Home Office gave to banks, telling them to close people\u2019s accounts because they were here illegally, was in fact wrong and that those people should not have had their bank accounts closed. Given that level of errors and mistakes, why on earth would we prevent the kind of transparency that subject access requests deliver? Some 39,000 people were wrongly sent texts telling them that they were here unlawfully. The Home Office makes mistakes, and we need transparency and subject access requests to be able to challenge those mistakes.              5.30 pm    I say to Ministers: take this exemption out of the Bill. We do not need it. We did not have this kind of exemption from previous data protection Acts, so we do not need it from this one. They can revisit it in the 226;128;\ufffdimmigration Bill once they have had time to do a proper consultation and consider all the options, but they should not do this now.  Let me give the House one final reason why amendment 15 is so important. We are storing up further problems that could prevent us from fighting crime and injustice through international security co-operation. After Brexit, we need a co-operation agreement\u2014a data adequacy agreement\u2014with the EU, so that our police and law enforcement agencies can continue to legally share the data they need to solve crimes, stop criminals and prevent terror attacks. However, this whopping great exemption to the GDPR lying at the heart of the Bill will, as the Home Affairs Committee has warned, make it harder for us to get the data adequacy agreement that we need.  I am immensely worried about what will happen if that data adequacy agreement is delayed, and the Government should be much more worried than they appear to be about the consequences for our security and crime fighting if that data adequacy agreement is not secured. So I say to them: do not make it harder. Do not keep this exemption in the Bill. Remove it, not just for the sake of future security and crime co-operation, but for the sake of preventing more injustices like Windrush.            Damian Collins           Share this contribution        The significance of the Bill and the importance of data and data protection to the economy and the whole of society is reflected in this debate. The fact that amendments have been tabled on Report through the work of three different departmental Select Committees shows how wide-ranging this issue is.       I principally want to talk about amendments 20 and 21, which stand in my name and those of other members of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee and which are addressed by Government amendments, too. Before I do so, I want to add that the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), made a very important point about the fact that some people\u2014particularly those involved in immigration cases\u2014may not have full access to the data rights enjoyed by others. If the Minister can provide any further clarification, I will be happy to give way before I move on.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        After the exchange I had with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah), I wanted to confirm that the Home Office will certainly not destroy any data for which there is still a legitimate and ongoing need not just for the Home Office but for data subjects.                    Damian Collins           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the Minister for that further clarification.       Amendments 20 and 21 get to the heart of an issue that has been raised by a number of Members, which is the power of the Information Commissioner to act in data investigations. The Minister, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne) and others have referenced the Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal, which is a very good example of why these additional powers are needed. We raised that in the Select Committee with the Secretary of State. The Information Commissioner raised it with us and it was raised on the Floor of the House on Second Reading.226;128;\ufffd       The ability to fine companies for being in breach of data rules is important, but what is most significant is that we get hold of the data needed by investigators, so that we understand who is doing what, how they are doing it and how wide-ranging this is. It is crucial that the Information Commissioner has the enforcement powers she needs to complete those investigations.       In the case of Cambridge Analytica, an information notice was issued by the Information Commissioner to that company to comply with requests for data and information. Not only did Cambridge Analytica not comply, but Cambridge Analytica and Facebook knew that. That information notice expired at 5 o\u2019clock on the evening of the day when that deadline was set; it was the beginning of the week. Before the notice had expired and a warrant could even be applied for, Facebook had sent in its own lawyers and data experts to try to recover data that was relevant to the Information Commissioner\u2019s request.       The Information Commissioner found out about that live on \u201cChannel 4 News\u201d and then effectively sent a cease and desist note to Facebook, telling it to withdraw its people. She might very well not have been made aware of what Facebook was doing that evening, and data vital for her investigation could have been taken out of her grasp by parties to the investigation, which would have been completely wrong. Not only did that happen\u2014thankfully, Facebook stood down\u2014but a further five days expired before a warrant could be issued\u2014before the right judge in the right court had the time to grant the warrant to enable her to complete her work. We live in a fast-moving world, and data is the fuel of that fast-moving world, so we cannot have 19th or even 20th-century legal responses. We must give our investigatory authorities the powers they need to be effective, which means seizing data on demand, without notice, as part of an investigation, and having the ability to see how data is used in the workplace or wider environment.       The Government are bringing forward amendments, which I think have the support of the House, that will give us one of the most effective enforcement regimes in the world. They will give us the power to do something we have not been able to do before, which is to go behind the curtain to see what tech companies, even major tech companies, are doing and make sure they comply with our data rules and regulations. Without that or an effective power to inspect, we would largely be in the position of having to take their word for it when they said they were complying with the GDPR. Particularly with companies such as Facebook that run closed systems\u2014they have closed algorithms and their data is not open in any way\u2014there are very good commercial reasons for doing so, but there are also consumer safety reasons. We must have the power to go in and check what they are doing, so the amendments are absolutely vital.       There are further concerns. The shadow Minister, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, was right to raise concerns about honesty and transparency in political advertising. Both the Information Commissioner and the Electoral Commission are examining the use of data in politics, as well as looking at who places the ads. It is already a breach of the law in the UK, as it is in other countries, for people outside our jurisdiction to run political advertising during election campaigns in this country.226;128;\ufffd       In the case of Facebook, it is unacceptable that its ad check teams have not spotted such advertising and stopped it happening when someone is breaking the law. If this were about the financial services sector, we would not let a company say, \u201cWell, we thought someone was breaking the law, but we weren\u2019t told to do anything about it, so we didn\u2019t\u201d. We would expect such a company to spot it and to take effective action. We need to see a lot more progress on this, particularly in relation to the placement of micro-targeting ads and dark ads. The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising has called for a moratorium on the micro-targeting of political ads, which may be seen only by the person who receives an ad and the person who places it.       When the chief technology officer of Facebook, Mike Schroepfer, gave evidence to the Select Committee, I asked him whether, if someone set up a Facebook page to run ads during a campaign and micro-targeted individual voters before taking down the page at the end of the campaign and destroying the adverts, Facebook would have any record that that advertising had ever run, he said that he did not know. We have written to him and Mark Zuckerberg saying that we need to know, because unless we know, a bad actor could run ads in huge volumes, investing a huge amount of money in breach of electoral law, and if they did not declare it, there would be no record of that advertising ever having been placed.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The Chair of the Select Committee is doing a brilliant job with his investigation, but the argument must stretch further than simply political advertising. For example, when Voter Consultancy Ltd ran attack ads against Conservative Members, accusing some of them of being Brexit mutineers, it was running an imprint for a company that was actually filing dormant accounts at Companies House. There are real questions not just about political ads in the narrow traditional sense, but about how to get to the bottom of who is literally writing the cheques.                    Damian Collins           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and that throws up two really important points.       The first point is that the Information Commissioner is also currently investigating this, which links to the right hon. Gentleman\u2019s point about where the money comes from and who the data controllers are in these campaigns. Although Facebook is saying that it will in future change its guidelines so that people running political ads must have their identity and location verified, we know that it is very easy for bad actors to fake those things. It would be pretty easy for anyone in the House to set up a Facebook page or account using a dummy email address they have created that is not linked to a real person, but is a fake account. This is not necessarily as robust as it seems, so we need to know who is running these ads and what their motivation is for doing so.       Secondly, the Information Commissioner is also looking at the holding of political data. It is already an offence for people to harvest and collect data about people\u2019s political opinions or to target them using it without their consent, and it is an offence for organisations that are not registered political parties even to hold such data. If political consultancies are scraping data off social media sites such as Facebook, combining it with other data that helps them to target voters and 226;128;\ufffdmicro-targeting them with messaging during a political campaign or at any time, there is a question as to whether that is legal now, let alone under the protection of GDPR.       As a country and a society, we have been on a journey over the past few months and we now understand much more readily how much data is collected about us, how that data is used and how vulnerable that data can be to bad actors. Many Facebook users would not have understood that Facebook not only keeps information about what they do on Facebook, but gathers evidence about what non-Facebook users do on the internet and about what Facebook users do on other sites around the internet. It cannot even tell us what proportion of internet sites around the world it gathers such data from. Developers who create games and tools that people use on Facebook harvest data about those users, and it is then largely outside the control of Facebook and there is little it can do to monitor what happens to it. It can end up in the hands of a discredited and disgraced company like Cambridge Analytica.       These are serious issues. The Bill goes a long way towards providing the sort of enforcement powers we need to act against the bad actors, but they will not stop and neither will we. No doubt there will be further challenges in the future that will require a response from this House.                    Brendan O'Hara           Share this contribution        I will be very brief, Madam Deputy Speaker, because we are incredibly tight for time.       There is so much in the Bill that I would like to talk about, such as effective immigration control, delegated powers and collective redress, not to mention the achievement of adequacy, but I will concentrate on amendment 5, which appears in my name and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) and the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas).       The amendment seeks to provide protection for individuals where automated decision making could have an adverse impact on their fundamental rights. It would require that, where human rights are or could be impacted by automated decisions, ultimately, there will always be a human decision maker at the end of the process. It would instil that vital protection of human rights in respect of the general processing of personal data. We believe strongly that automated decision making without human intervention should be subject to strict limitations to promote fairness, transparency and accountability, and to prevent discrimination. As it stands, the Bill provides insufficient safeguards.       I am talking about decisions that are made without human oversight, but that can have long-term, serious consequences for an individual\u2019s health or financial, employment, residential or legal status. As it stands, the Bill will allow law enforcement agencies to make purely automated decisions. That is fraught with danger and we believe it to be at odds not just with the Data Protection Act 1998, but with article 22 of the GDPR, which gives individuals the right not to be subject to a purely automated decision. We understand that there is provision within the GDPR for states to opt out, but that opt-out does not apply if the data subject\u2019s rights, freedoms or legitimate interests are undermined.226;128;\ufffd       I urge the House to support amendment 5 and to make it explicit in the Bill that, where automated processing that could have long-term consequences for an individual\u2019s health or financial, employment or legal status is carried out, a human being will have to decide whether it is reasonable and appropriate to continue. Not only will that human intervention provide transparency and accountability; it will ensure that the state does not infringe an individual\u2019s fundamental rights and privacy\u2014issues that are often subjective and are beyond the scope of an algorithm. We shall press the amendment to the vote this evening.

I would like to voice my support and that of the SNP for amendment 15 on effective immigration control. We believe that the exemption is fundamentally wrong, disproportionate and grossly unfair, and we call on the Government to stop it.                    Colin Clark (Gordon) (Con)           Share this contribution        I am conscious of the time, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I will not take too long.       This country is committed to remaining a global leader on data protection. The fundamental principle behind the Bill is to bring our data protection and information laws up to speed in the digital age. If we are to keep pace with technology and restore accountability in this area, we need a strong Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. I am therefore pleased that the Government have brought forward new clauses 13 and 14. Remarkably, 11.5% of global data flows through the UK. It is vital that the UK plays a key role in ensuring compliance.              5.45 pm    The Bill strikes a balance between individuals\u2019 protection and organisations. It creates a bespoke framework for law enforcement, which is vital to our security services. I welcome the Minister\u2019s comments giving comfort to businesses. In my constituency, they were deeply concerned about some of the claims made by organisations.  New clause 13 ensures that the Information Commissioner can seek a court order to enforce an information notice, given under clause 141 of the Bill, should someone fail to comply. New clause 14 makes it an offence, as the Minister said, for someone to destroy, dispose of, conceal, block or falsify information required by the Information Commissioner. The new clauses will ensure that companies and individuals subject to an Information Commissioner\u2019s Office assessment notice are truly accountable.  The recent scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, mentioned by several hon. Members, shone a spotlight on this area of the law. Cambridge Analytica has been repeatedly accused of holding back data. The story is so concerning because it reached the very corridors of power in which we work. Political parties and campaigns from various countries, and even in this country, sought out Cambridge Analytica\u2019s help. The UK Government\u2019s new clauses and amendments will ensure that the Bill does exactly what they intend it to do.  226;128;\ufffd            Sir Edward Davey           Share this contribution        The right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) made a very powerful speech in favour of amendment 15, and I would like to associate myself and my party with all the comments she made. In particular, I underline the point she made that the Home Office powers in the Bill have no limit and are completely subjective.       The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins), is sitting on the Government Back Benches, talking to a colleague. She is a respected lawyer who has practised law. Imagine if she had a client who was being denied reunification with their family, was not allowed to work, was being deported from this country and was not able to have access to the information on which that decision was made. That would go against all the principles of the rule of law of which this country is proud and which this House has upheld century after century, yet she, as a Home Office Minister, is allowing that to happen.       I urge the hon. Lady to think about that and, as the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford said, go to the new Home Secretary, who said he would take a new approach and sweep away some of the past, and ask him to think again and allow amendment 15 to proceed tonight. As the right hon. Lady said, there will be another opportunity with another immigration Bill coming up soon. The Home Office Minister and the Home Secretary can rest assured that the powers under paragraph 2 in schedule 2 relating to criminal actions would cover all the examples that Ministers in Committee, on Second Reading and in the other place have given for why they think this proposed legislation is required.                    Yvette Cooper           Share this contribution        The Secretary of State for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is now back is in his place. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it would simply take a phone call between him and the Home Secretary to agree that this measure could be suspended? The whole issue could be revisited in the immigration Bill coming down the track in due course. It could be removed from this Bill now for the sake of the Windrush generation.                    Sir Edward Davey           Share this contribution        The right hon. Lady is absolutely right, and it is the Windrush generation who should be in our minds above all.       The right hon. Lady mentioned the need\u2014this will be dependent on the EU negotiations\u2014to ensure that we have access to data for national security and for fighting crime. That is in the Government\u2019s interests as they negotiate Brexit, in particular with respect to the rights of EU citizens. I am fairly convinced that when the Commission really wakes up to the implications of paragraph 4 in schedule 2, it will say that this is acting in bad faith. The Government have agreed a settlement for the 3 million EU citizens in this country and the EU citizens who may wish to come to this country in the years ahead. The Bill will take away the rights they thought they would have. I therefore say to Ministers on the Front Bench and those on the Back Benches that they have just a few minutes or so to think again before it is too late.                    Daniel Zeichner (Cambridge) (Lab)           Share this contribution        I want to endorse new clause 4, which was so ably set out my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam 226;128;\ufffdByrne) from the Opposition Front Bench. I went on the Bill Committee with a sense of optimism and excitement, perhaps naively, because it seemed that so much needed to be done at the moment. Almost every day new issues arise\u2014I hardly need to say that for me, \u201cCambridge\u201d and \u201canalytics\u201d is an unfortunate combination. In the past few days, there have been facial recognition issues in the Welsh police and Amnesty International has raised the issue of gang lists. I hoped that we could rise to the challenge. However, I fear that although the Bill is hundreds and hundreds of pages long\u2014in the pre-digital age, it would probably have been described as being the size of a telephone book\u2014as Members have observed, does anyone really know what it means? That is why we needed a simple set of rights that people could understand. The sad thing is that people in the wider world are doing such good work and we should be looking at it. Look at what Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt are doing to try to transfer the data away from the big tech companies to make it our data. That is key, and it is the underlying principle of the GDPR, but I am not sure that we have been able to translate it into legislation.       I make two final observations. First, the golden thread running through much of this is data adequacy, which was referred to by the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, my right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford. In too many places there are genuine concerns, not just from Opposition Members but from Members in the other place, about our being tripped up on data adequacy, which is so important.       Finally, on the Information Commissioner\u2019s role, a huge amount is being passed to her. We can have every confidence in her, but does she really have the resources, power and expertise? Most importantly, we are outsourcing some huge, really important judgments to the Information Commissioner, but I think it should be the role of this place to make those judgements in future, and I fear that we will come back to those points later in the day.                    Dr Paul Williams (Stockton South) (Lab)           Share this contribution        It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner). I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), who is an extremely capable Chair of the Health and Social Care Committee and has shown real resolution and persistence on new clause 12.       In the sanctity of the consulting room, patients tell doctors, nurses and NHS staff all kinds of things. I have had all kinds of private and confidential issues disclosed to me in the 22 years that I have worked as a doctor, but the protection that the NHS gives to this information is absolutely fundamental. For years, the NHS has, on request from the Home Office, been sharing the address details of some patients that have ultimately been used to deport an unknown number of people over many years.       I recently visited a clinic run by the excellent charity, Doctors of the World, in Bethnal Green. I heard stories there of vulnerable people being afraid to approach NHS services because they cannot be certain that the information that they are asked to give will be treated confidentially. I heard about pregnant women not going for antenatal care, people with HIV not getting treatment and people who are afraid to take their children to the GP. The bond of trust between the NHS and its patients 226;128;\ufffdrelies on the truth being told in both directions. Sadly, people have been avoiding the NHS because they do not trust it. That is bad for the reputation of the NHS, bad for the health of individual patients and bad for public health.       Doctors, nurses and other health professionals do not want information that is given to the NHS by patients to be shared except in the most extreme cases, when there is a significant risk to individuals or to the public. I am pleased that the Government have found a way to assure the House this evening that NHS information will be shared only in the event of a conviction or an investigation for a serious crime. This is the only way to preserve the integrity of the NHS and the immeasurable, vital and precious bond of trust between NHS staff and their patients.                    Caroline Lucas           Share this contribution        Like others, I would like to associate myself with the very powerful arguments that have been made in favour of amendment 15, but I want to speak briefly to amendment 16 to extend the debate about the conditions under which someone\u2019s rights can be breached. It would prevent the crime exemption in the Bill being invoked in relation to low-level offences under immigration law.       Few of us would dispute the overall principle that data might be shared in some circumstances\u2014for example, to prevent a serious crime or to apprehend an offender\u2014but when the crimes in question are not serious and arise simply because of someone\u2019s immigration status, we have to question whether the grounds for suspending data protection rights really do stack up. It is clear that the majority of offences under immigration law are not serious crimes. Most result only in a custodial sentence of two years or less, or a fine. Rather, they are the mundane activities of people doing what they must to survive. The effect is already forcing undocumented migrants to avoid sending their children to school, visiting the GP, presenting to homelessness services and seeking social support, for fear they might risk detention and removal by doing so.       Last year, a woman who was five months pregnant went to report being repeatedly raped to the police but was subsequently arrested at a rape crisis centre on immigration grounds. My amendment 16 seeks to better protect her and all others like her whose data protection rights are routinely being breached just because they are undocumented migrants and who are therefore being automatically criminalised just for leading their lives. There must be a firewall between Home Office immigration control and other Departments if we are serious about ending the current hostile immigration environment.                    Stuart C. McDonald           Share this contribution        I echo the criticisms of the outrageous immigration exemption in the Bill and am pleased to add my name to amendment 15.       Little has been said today about international transfers of personal data by intelligence services, despite the serious concerns raised in Committee. I will therefore speak briefly to new clause 24, which it is all the more important we debate, given the moves by the Trump Administration in the USA to roll back on safeguards on the targeting of drone strikes and the significant increase in their use of lethal force outside armed conflict zones. These developments mean an increased risk of strikes being in breach of international human 226;128;\ufffdrights law, and we know that UK intelligence personnel are involved in the transfer of data that could be used in such drone strikes, so it is all the more important that there be safeguards and accountability on when and how information can be transferred and that legal certainty be provided for our personnel.       As the Joint Committee on Human Rights said in its 2016 report,       \u201cwe owe it to all those involved in the chain of command for such uses of lethal force133;to provide them with absolute clarity about the circumstances in which they will have a defence against any possible future criminal prosecution, including those which might originate from outside the UK.\u201d       The Bill fails to provide those safeguards and clarity. Clause 109 places no realistic restriction on such transfers, referring simply to necessity and proportionality in pursuit of statutory goals. The new clause would provide a clear bar on transfers for use in unlawful operations and introduce accountability and transparency by requiring that written reasons be provided for any transfer thought to be lawful, that there be ministerial sign-off, that certain information be provided to the Information Commissioner and the Investigatory Powers Commissioner and that guidance on transfers be laid before Parliament. The new clause would not hinder but help our personnel working in this area and ensure that the UK is seen as complying with the rule of law and its international obligations. This is an important debate to which we will have to return in the future.       Question put and agreed to.       New clause 13 accordingly read a Second time, and added to the Bill.       New Clause 14       Destroying or falsifying information and documents etc       \u201c(1) This section applies where a person\u2014       (a) has been given an information notice requiring the person to provide the Commissioner with information, or       (b) has been given an assessment notice requiring the person to direct the Commissioner to a document, equipment or other material or to assist the Commissioner to view information.       (2) It is an offence for the person\u2014       (a) to destroy or otherwise dispose of, conceal, block or (where relevant) falsify all or part of the information, document, equipment or material, or       \u201c(b) to cause or permit the destruction, disposal, concealment, blocking or (where relevant) falsification of all or part of the information, document, equipment or material,       with the intention of preventing the Commissioner from viewing, or being provided with or directed to, all or part of the information, document, equipment or material.       (3) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (2) to prove that the destruction, disposal, concealment, blocking or falsification would have occurred in the absence of the person being given the notice.\u201d\u2014(Margot James.)       This new clause would be inserted after Clause 145. It provides that, where the Information Commissioner has given an information notice (see Clause 141) or an assessment notice (see Clause 144) requiring access to information, a document, equipment or material, it is an offence to destroy or otherwise dispose of, conceal, block or (where relevant) falsify it.       Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.226;128;\ufffd       New Clause 15       Applications in respect of urgent notices       \u201c(1) This section applies where an information notice, an assessment notice or an enforcement notice given to a person contains an urgency statement.       (2) The person may apply to the court for either or both of the following\u2014       (a) the disapplication of the urgency statement in relation to some or all of the requirements of the notice;       (b) a change to the time at which, or the period within which, a requirement of the notice must be complied with.       (3) On an application under subsection (2), the court may do any of the following\u2014       (a) direct that the notice is to have effect as if it did not contain the urgency statement;       (b) direct that the inclusion of the urgency statement is not to have effect in relation to a requirement of the notice;       (c) vary the notice by changing the time at which, or the period within which, a requirement of the notice must be complied with;       (d) vary the notice by making other changes required to give effect to a direction under paragraph (a) or (b) or in consequence of a variation under paragraph (c).       (4) The decision of the court on an application under this section is final.       (5) In this section, \u201curgency statement\u201d means\u2014       (a) in relation to an information notice, a statement under section141(7)(a),       (b) in relation to an assessment notice, a statement under section144(8)(a) or (8A)(d), and       (c) in relation to an enforcement notice, a statement under section147(8)(a).\u201d\u2014(Margot James.)       This new clause would be inserted after Clause 160. It enables a person who is given an information notice, assessment notice or enforcement which requires the person to comply with it urgently to apply to the court for variation of the timetable for compliance. It replaces the provision in Clauses 159(2) and 160(5) for appeals to the Tribunal. See also Amendments 54, 56 and 60.       Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.       New Clause 16       Post-review powers to make provision about representation of data subjects       \u201c(1) After the report under section 182(1) is laid before Parliament, the Secretary of State may by regulations\u2014       (a) exercise the powers under Article 80(2) of the GDPR in relation to England and Wales and Northern Ireland,       (b) make provision enabling a body or other organisation which meets the conditions in Article 80(1) of the GDPR to exercise a data subject\u2019s rights under Article 82 of the GDPR in England and Wales and Northern Ireland without being authorised to do so by the data subject, and       (c) make provision described in section182(2)(e) in relation to the exercise in England and Wales and Northern Ireland of the rights of a data subject who is a child.       (2) The powers under subsection (1) include power\u2014       (a) to make provision enabling a data subject to prevent a body or other organisation from exercising, or continuing to exercise, the data subject\u2019s rights;       (b) to make provision about proceedings before a court or tribunal where a body or organisation exercises a data subject\u2019s rights;226;128;\ufffd       (c) to make provision for bodies or other organisations to bring proceedings before a court or tribunal combining two or more claims in respect of a right of a data subject;       (d) to confer functions on a person, including functions involving the exercise of a discretion;       (e) to amend sections162 to164,173,180,194,196 and197;       (f) to insert new sections and Schedules into Part 6 or 7;       (g) to make different provision in relation to England and Wales and in relation to Northern Ireland.       (3) The powers under subsection (1)(a) and (b) include power to make provision in relation to data subjects who are children or data subjects who are not children or both.       (4) The provision mentioned in subsection (2)(b) and (c) includes provision about\u2014       (a) the effect of judgments and orders;       (b) agreements to settle claims;       (c) the assessment of the amount of compensation;       (d) the persons to whom compensation may or must be paid, including compensation not claimed by the data subject;       (e) costs.       (5) Regulations under this section are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.\u201d\u2014(Margot James.)       This new clause would be inserted after Clause 182. It contains the provisions currently in subsections (4) to (7) of Clause 182, modified to take account of the changes made to that Clause by Amendments 61 and 62 (see subsections (1)(c) and (3) of this new Clause).       Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.       New Clause 17       Reserve forces: data-sharing by HMRC       \u201c(1) The Reserve Forces Act 1996 is amended as follows.

(2) HMRC may supply contact details to which subsection (1) applies to the Secretary of State for the purpose of enabling the Secretary of State\u2014       (a) to contact a member of an ex-regular reserve force in connection with the person\u2019s liability, or potential liability, to be called out for service under Part 6;       (b) to contact a person to whom section 66 applies in connection with the person\u2019s liability, or potential liability, to be recalled for service under Part 7.       (3) Where a person\u2019s contact details are supplied under subsection (2) for a purpose described in that subsection, they may also be used for defence purposes connected with the person\u2019s service (whether past, present or future) in the reserve forces or regular services.       (4) In this section, \u201cHMRC\u201d means Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs.       125B Prohibition on disclosure of contact details supplied under section 125A       \u2018(1) A person who receives information supplied under section 125A may not disclose it except with the consent of the Commissioners for Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (which may be general or specific).       (2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence.226;128;\ufffd       (3) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that the person reasonably believed\u2014       (a) that the disclosure was lawful, or       (b) that the information had already lawfully been made available to the public.       (4) Subsections (4) to (7) of section 19 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 apply to an offence under this section as they apply to an offence under that section.       (5) Nothing in section 107 or 108 (institution of proceedings and evidence) applies in relation to an offence under this section.       125C Data protection       \u2018(1) Nothing in section 125A or 125B authorises the making of a disclosure which contravenes the data protection legislation.       (2) In this section, \u201cthe data protection legislation\u201d has the same meaning as in the Data Protection Act 2018 (see section 3 of that Act).\u201d\u2014(Margot James.)       This new clause would be inserted after Clause 186. It provides for HMRC to supply the Secretary of State with the contact details of members of the ex-regular reserve force and former members of the armed forces so that they may be contacted regarding their liability to be called out or recalled for service under the Reserved Forces Act 1996. The details supplied may also be used for defence purposes connected with their service in the forces (whether past, present or future). It is an offence for the details supplied to be disclosed without the consent of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs.       Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.              6.00 pm    Proceedings interrupted (Programme Order, this day).  The Deputy Speaker put forthwith the Questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be concluded at that time (Standing Order No. 83E).  New Clause 4  Bill of Data Rights in the Digital Environment (No. 2)  \u201c(1) The Secretary of State shall, by regulations, establish a Bill of Data Rights in the Digital Environment.  (2) Before making regulations under this section, the Secretary of State shall\u2014  (a) consult\u2014  (i) the Commissioner,  (ii) trade associations,  (iii) data subjects, and  (iv) persons who appear to the Commissioner or the Secretary of State to represent the interests of data subjects; and  (b) publish a draft of the Bill of Data Rights.  (3) The Bill of Data Rights in the Digital Environment shall enshrine\u2014  (a) a right for a data subject to have privacy from commercial or personal intrusion,  (b) a right for a data subject to own, curate, move, revise or review their identity as founded upon personal data (whether directly or as a result of processing of that data),  (c) a right for a data subject to have their access to their data profiles or personal data protected, and  (d) a right for a data subject to object to any decision made solely on automated decision-making, including a decision relating to education and employment of the data subject.  (4) Regulations under this section are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.\u201d\u2014(Tom Watson.)

Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton)           Share this contribution        I will now suspend the House for no more than five minutes in order to make a decision about certification. The Division bells will be rung two minutes before the House resumes. Following certification, a Minister will move the appropriate consent motion, copies of which will be available in the Vote Office and will be distributed by Doorkeepers.              6.41 pm    Sitting suspended.       6.43 pm    On resuming\u2014  226;128;\ufffd            Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton)           Share this contribution        I can now inform the House that I have completed certification of the Bill, as required by the Standing Order. I have confirmed the view expressed in the Speaker\u2019s provisional certificate issued on 8 May. Copies of the final certificate will be made available in the Vote Office and on the parliamentary website.       Under Standing Order No. 83M, a consent motion is therefore required for the Bill to proceed. Copies of the motion are available in the Vote Office and on the parliamentary website, and have been made available to Members in the Chamber. Does the Minister intend to move the consent motion?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        indicated assent.       The House forthwith resolved itself into the Legislative Grand Committee (England and Wales) (Standing Order No. 83M).       [Dame Rosie Winterton in the Chair]              6.44 pm      The Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means (Dame Rosie Winterton)           Share this contribution        I remind hon. Members that if there is a Division, only Members representing constituencies in England and Wales may vote. As the knife has fallen, there can be no debate.       Motion made, and Question put forthwith (Standing Order No. 83M(5)),       That the Committee consents to the following certified clauses of the Data Protection Bill [Lords]       Clauses certified under SO No. 83L(2) as relating exclusively to England and Wales and being within devolved legislative competence       Clause 190 of the Bill, as amended in Public Bill Committee (Bill 190).\u2014(Margot James.)       Question agreed to.       The occupant of the Chair left the Chair to report the decision of the Committee (Standing Order No. 83M(6)).       The Deputy Speaker resumed the Chair; decision reported.                    Pete Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire) (SNP)           Share this contribution        On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I hope the House takes the time to consider very seriously the fact that once again English Members have not had the opportunity to debate the critical issues in clause 190, which has been certified. What can you do, Madam Deputy Speaker, to ensure that English Members in the English Parliament get the opportunity to debate those critical English-only issues?                    Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton)           Share this contribution        That is not a point of order.       Third Reading       Queen\u2019s and Prince of Wales\u2019s consent signified.              6.46 pm      Matt Hancock           Share this contribution        I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.       What a great pleasure this is. The Bill gives people more power and control over their lives online while supporting innovation and entrepreneurship in the digital age. It will deliver real benefits across the country and help our businesses to compete and trade abroad. Strong data protection laws give customers confidence in the products and services that they buy, and that is good for 226;128;\ufffdbusiness. The Bill provides a full data protection framework as we leave the EU, consistent with the general data protection regulation.       We have heard many things during our debates in the Chamber and in Committee, including concerns about small businesses. I reassure colleagues that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has produced specific advice for them, as well as detailed advice for charities and local government.       The Bill provides a bespoke tech framework that is tailored to the needs of our criminal justice agencies and the intelligence services. That will protect the rights of victims, witnesses and suspects while making sure that we can tackle the changing nature of the global threats that the UK faces.       The Bill has received coverage from around the world, including Australia, the Philippines and, indeed, Suffolk. Let me be clear: the Bill is about preparing Britain for the future. As we leave the EU, the Bill sets out full spectrum data protection legislation, and I hope that the House will give it its Third Reading.       I am very grateful for the way in which the House has engaged with the Bill. I want to put on record my thanks to many people: my hon. Friend the Minister for Digital and the Creative Industries, in particular, for her sterling work day in, day out; my predecessor, who is now Northern Ireland Secretary, who worked hard with me on the Bill before her promotion; the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins), for grappling with the Bill in a brand new brief; the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, whose members made many contributions; the Public Bill Committee; the Information Commissioner herself, with whom we have worked very closely on the Bill and who is a great star; and the Whips, Clerks, Committee Chairs, Mr Speaker and the Deputy Speakers. They have all been of great assistance. I also thank the Front-Bench teams of Her Majesty\u2019s loyal Opposition, the Scottish National party and other parties for, on the whole, their highly constructive attitude to this important legislation.       The Bill that we send back to the other place has been improved in three key respects. First, we have made good on the promises made by Lord Ashton in the other place. For instance, we have delivered certainty for patient support groups\u2014a cause passionately championed by my noble Friend Baroness Neville-Jones. We have provided reassurance for those on the frontline, safeguarding the emotional, physical and mental health of some of our most vulnerable citizens. We have legislated for a statutory review of the private enforcement provisions of the Bill, which will ensure that we leave no stone unturned in our search for strong and effective oversight of data controllers, particularly where children are concerned.       Secondly, the House has ensured that we have learned the lessons from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exploded during the passage of the Bill. The ongoing investigation into that is unprecedented in its scale and importance. We have increased the powers of the Information Commissioner to ensure she has enough resources. Some say that that scandal put data protection at the top of the news. Some even say it made data protection sexy. With the Bill, we can be assured that the Information Commissioner will have the powers that she needs to ensure that those who flout the law are 226;128;\ufffdheld to account for their actions. I want particularly to thank the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee for its proposals, which we took on board to strengthen the Bill in response to that scandal. Finally, we have ensured that when it comes to the freedom of the press, we are prepared for the future, not stuck in the past.       The Bill will give people more control over their data, support businesses in their use of data and prepare Britain for Brexit. Over a generation, the Data Protection Act 1998, which this Bill replaces, has commanded broad public consensus and cross-party support. That has been one of its strengths. I hope that this Bill will gain cross-party support on Third Reading so that no matter the debate on some of the points of detail, we will have a broad consensus behind our data protection approach here in the UK for the years to come, because that is one of the strengths of our digital economy\u2014a digital economy that is powering ahead. I hope that the Bill can add to the fundamental underpinnings of the strength of our economy and our society for the future. I commend it to the House.              6.52 pm      Tom Watson           Share this contribution        I refer hon. Members to my entry in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests. I want to thank all the individuals and organisations that submitted evidence and participated in the discussions about what we all know to be a fiendishly complicated Bill. I am grateful to the Clerks, the Hansard reporters and the Doorkeepers for making the passage of the Bill possible.       Given that this is a fiendishly complicated Bill, we put forward our best team on the Public Bill Committee. I particularly thank my Labour Front-Bench colleagues\u2014my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne) and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Louise Haigh)\u2014who are both the brightest of their generation. I would also like to thank my hon. Friends the Members for Ogmore (Chris Elmore), for Bristol North West (Darren Jones) and for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner), and Members of other Opposition parties, who made great contributions to the Bill. The contributions in today\u2019s debate from my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband), the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke) and the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine) were intelligent, wise and moving.       Our position has always been that we do not oppose the Bill. We recognise that it contains a number of measures that need to be passed into law by the end of this month, and we have never had any interest in standing in the way of the broad thrust of the Bill or most of its contents. However, we have had a number of specific concerns, and we have sought to improve some parts of the Bill. We have little time to dwell on those issues, but I would like to mention a couple.       We believe that the proposals for a data bill of rights were strong and had merit. They would have created a statutory code of enforceable rights, including the right of the individual to access all their data held or controlled by organisations and large social media companies. With our SNP colleagues, we have also debated how the Home Office will receive a wide exemption when processing the data of newcomers to this country. Given its recent 226;128;\ufffdrecord, the Home Office is not a Department to which we want to give new sweeping powers over personal data. Keeping this exemption is a continuation of the hostile environment, and we should be ashamed that it remains in the Bill.       Our biggest disappointment, however, is that we did not convince enough Members to commence part 2 of the Leveson inquiry. The victims were solemnly promised that this inquiry would be completed, and today this House has let them down. However, we consider this unfinished business, and I have to say to the Secretary of State that when he is in the twilight of his political career\u2014careers in this place always end in such a way\u2014he will come to regret his decision to side so stridently with the press barons against the victims.       To conclude, the Bill is necessary, but there have been missed opportunities. There has been a missed opportunity to correct the sins of the past on Leveson, and also a failure to look at how we should begin to deal with the future of data capitalism and its impact on people in the new digital age. I hope that the Government will continue to engage on these issues in the coming weeks and months, and we will continue to press them on the subject of citizens\u2019 data rights.              6.56 pm</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-RLPMN813111420180514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SB1-5GV1-J9XT-P19J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"65255\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 14, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This amendment is consequential on Amendments 79, 82 and 90.\u2014(Margot James.)       2.00 pm    Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.            The Chair           Share this contribution        I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing Government amendments 77 to 83 and 87 to 91.       Amendment 76 agreed to.       Amendments made: 77, in schedule 1, page 124, line 24, leave out from \u201csubject\u201d to end of line 25.       In paragraph 8 of Schedule 1, sub-paragraph (3) contains an exception from the condition in sub-paragraph (1). This amendment would remove from the exception the requirement that the processing is carried out without the data subject\u2019s consent.       Amendment 78, in schedule 1, page 124, line 36, at end insert\u2014       \u201cRacial and ethnic diversity at senior levels of organisations       8A (1) This condition is met if the processing\u2014       (a) is of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,       (b) is carried out as part of a process of identifying suitable individuals to hold senior positions in a particular organisation, a type of organisation or organisations generally,       (c) is necessary for the purposes of promoting or maintaining diversity in the racial and ethnic origins of individuals who hold senior positions in the organisation or organisations, and       (d) can reasonably be carried out without the consent of the data subject,       subject to the exception in sub-paragraph (3).       (2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(d), processing can reasonably be carried out without the consent of the data subject only where\u2014       (a) the controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the consent of the data subject, and       (b) the controller is not aware of the data subject withholding consent. </p><p>      (3) Processing does not meet the condition in sub-paragraph (1) if it is likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual.       (4) For the purposes of this paragraph, an individual holds a senior position in an organisation if the individual\u2014       (a) holds a position listed in sub-paragraph (5), or       (b) does not hold such a position but is a senior manager of the organisation.226;128;\ufffd       (5) Those positions are\u2014       (a) a director, secretary or other similar officer of a body corporate;       (b) a member of a limited liability partnership;       (c) a partner in a partnership within the Partnership Act 1890, a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 or an entity of a similar character formed under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom.       (6) In this paragraph, \u201csenior manager\u201d, in relation to an organisation, means a person who plays a significant role in\u2014       (a) the making of decisions about how the whole or a substantial part of the organisation\u2019s activities are to be managed or organised, or       (b) the actual managing or organising of the whole or a substantial part of those activities.       (7) The reference in sub-paragraph (2)(b) to a data subject withholding consent does not include a data subject merely failing to respond to a request for consent.\u201d.       Part 2 of Schedule 1 describes types of processing of special categories of personal data which meet the requirement in Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR (processing necessary for reasons of substantial public interest) for a basis in UK law (see Clause 10(3)). This amendment adds to Part 2 of Schedule 1 certain processing of personal data for the purposes of promoting or maintaining diversity in the racial and ethnic origins of individuals who hold senior positions in organisations.       Amendment 79, in schedule 1, page 125, line 3, at end insert\u2014       \u201c( ) If the processing consists of the disclosure of personal data to a competent authority, or is carried out in preparation for such disclosure, the condition in sub-paragraph (1) is met even if, when the processing is carried out, the controller does not have an appropriate policy document in place (see paragraph 5 of this Schedule).\u201d.       This amendment, and Amendment 80, provide that where processing falling within paragraph 9 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 (preventing or detecting unlawful acts) consists of, or is carried out in preparation for, the disclosure of personal data to a competent authority, the condition in that paragraph is met even if the controller does not have an appropriate policy document in place when the processing is carried out.

Part 2 of Schedule 1 describes types of processing of special categories of personal data which meet the requirement in Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR (processing necessary for reasons of substantial public interest) for a basis in UK law (see Clause 10(3)). This amendment adds to Part 2 of Schedule 1 certain processing of personal data for the purposes of complying with, or assisting others to comply with, a regulatory requirement.       Amendment 82, in schedule 1, page 125, line 35, at end insert\u2014       \u201c( ) The condition in sub-paragraph (1) is met even if, when the processing is carried out, the controller does not have an appropriate policy document in place (see paragraph 5 of this Schedule).\u201d.

The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Victoria Atkins)           Share this contribution        I beg to move amendment 84, in schedule 1, page 126, line 27, leave out \u201ca reason\u201d and insert \u201cone of the reasons\u201d.       This amendment amends paragraph 14(1)(b) of Schedule 1 for consistency with paragraphs 18(2) and 19(2) of that Schedule.                    The Chair           Share this contribution        With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments 85, 86, 116 and 117.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hanson. I am pleased to introduce this group of amendments, which relate to data processing for safeguarding purposes. The amendments respond to an issue raised in an amendment tabled by Lord Stevenson on Report in the Lords in December. In response to that amendment, Lord Ashton made it clear that the Government are sympathetic to the points Lord Stevenson raised and undertook to consider the matter further. Amendments 85, 116 and 117 are the result of that consideration.       I am grateful to Lord Stevenson for raising this issue, and for his contribution to what is probably the most important new measure that we intend to introduce to the Data Protection Bill. The amendments will ensure that sensitive data can be processed without consent in certain circumstances for legitimate safeguarding activities that are in the substantial public interest. We have been working across government and with stakeholders in the voluntary and private sectors to ensure that the amendments are fit for purpose and cover the safeguarding activities expected of organisations responsible for children and vulnerable adults.       The Government recognise that statutory guidance and regulator expectations place moral, if not legal, obligations on certain organisations to ensure that measures are in place to safeguard children and vulnerable adults. Amendment 85 covers processing that is necessary for protecting children and vulnerable adults from neglect or physical or mental harm. This addresses the gap in relation to expectations on, for example, sports governing bodies.       The Government have produced cross-agency and cross-governmental guidance called \u201cWorking Together to Safeguard Children\u201d, which rightly places the responsibility of safeguarding children on all relevant professionals who come into contact with children and families. For example, it creates an expectation that those volunteering at a local sports club will assess the needs of children and, importantly, will take action to protect them from abuse.       Amendment 85 permits the processing of sensitive personal data, which is necessary to safeguard children from physical, emotional, sexual and neglect-based abuse. 226;128;\ufffdAmendment 84 makes a consequential drafting change, while amendments 116 and 117 make an analogous change to the regimes in parts 3 and 4 of the Bill. This is aimed at putting beyond doubt a controller\u2019s ability to safeguard children and people at risk.       I thought an example might help the Committee to understand why we place such an emphasis on the amendments. An example provided by a sports governing body is that a person may make an allegation or complaint about a volunteer that prompts an investigation. Such investigations can include witness statements, which reference sensitive personal data, including ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation and health data.       In some instances, the incident may not reach a criminal standard. In those cases, the sports body may have no legal basis for keeping the data. Keeping a record allows sports bodies to monitor any escalation in conduct and to respond appropriately. Forcing an organisation to delete this data from its records could allow individuals that we would expect to be kept away from children to remain under the radar and potentially leave children at risk.       Amendment 86 deals with a related issue where processing health data is necessary to protect an individual\u2019s economic wellbeing, where that individual has been identified as an individual at economic risk. UK banks have a number of regulatory obligations and expectations which are set out in the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s rules and guidance. In order to meet best practice standards in relation to safeguarding vulnerable customers, banks occasionally need to record health data without the consent of the data subject.       An example was given of a bank which was contacted by a family member who was alerting the bank to an elderly customer suffering from mental health problems who was drawing large sums of money each day from their bank account and giving it away to a young drug addict whom they had befriended. The bank blocked the account while the family sought power of attorney. Again, the amendment seeks to clarify the position and give legal certainty to banks and other organisations where that sort of scenario arises or where, for example, someone suffers from dementia and family members ask banks to take steps to protect that person\u2019s financial wellbeing.       The unfortunate reality is that there still exists a great deal of uncertainty under current law about what personal data can be processed for safeguarding purposes. My brief of crime, vulnerability and safeguarding means that all too often\u2014perhaps in the context of domestic abuse\u2014agencies will gather, sadly, to conduct a domestic homicide review and discover that had certain pieces of information been shared more freely, perhaps more action could have been taken by the various agencies and adults and children could have been safeguarded.       These amendments are aimed at tackling these issues. We want to stop the practice whereby some organisations have withheld information from the police and other law enforcement agencies for fear of breaching data protection law and other organisations have been unclear as to whether consent to processing personal data is required in circumstances where consent would not be reasonable or appropriate. The amendments intend to 226;128;\ufffdaddress the uncertainty by providing relevant organisations with a specific processing condition for processing sensitive personal data for safeguarding purposes. I beg to move.                    Liam Byrne (Birmingham, Hodge Hill) (Lab)           Share this contribution        I rise to put on record my thanks to the Minister for listening carefully to my noble Friend Lord Stevenson. There was strong cross-party consensus on these common-sense reforms.       We all know that in our own constituencies there are extraordinary people doing extraordinary things in local groups. They are the life-blood of our communities. Many of them will be worried about the new obligations that come with the general data protection regulation and many of them will take a least-risk approach to meeting the new regulations. Putting in place some common safeguards to ensure that it is possible to keep data that allow us to spot important patterns of behaviour that can lead to appropriate investigations is very sensible and wise. These amendments will therefore be made with cross-party support.       Amendment 84 agreed to.       Amendments made: 85, page 126, line 38 [Schedule 1], at end insert\u2014       \u201cSafeguarding of children and of individuals at risk       14A (1) This condition is met if\u2014       (a) the processing is necessary for the purposes of\u2014       (i) protecting an individual from neglect or physical, mental or emotional harm, or       (ii) protecting the physical, mental or emotional well-being of an individual,       (b) the individual is\u2014       (i) aged under 18, or       (ii) aged 18 or over and at risk,       (c) the processing is carried out without the consent of the data subject for one of the reasons listed in sub-paragraph (2), and       (d) the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.       (2) The reasons mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(c) are\u2014       (a) in the circumstances, consent to the processing cannot be given by the data subject;       (b) in the circumstances, the controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the consent of the data subject to the processing;       (c) the processing must be carried out without the consent of the data subject because obtaining the consent of the data subject would prejudice the provision of the protection mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a).       (3) For the purposes of this paragraph, an individual aged 18 or over is \u201cat risk\u201d if the controller has reasonable cause to suspect that the individual\u2014       (a) has needs for care and support,       (b) is experiencing, or at risk of, neglect or physical, mental or emotional harm, and       (c) as a result of those needs is unable to protect himself or herself against the neglect or harm or the risk of it.       (4) In sub-paragraph (1)(a), the reference to the protection of an individual or of the well-being of an individual includes both protection relating to a particular individual and protection relating to a type of individual.\u201d       Part 2 of Schedule 1 describes types of processing of special categories of personal data which meet the requirement in Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR (processing necessary for reasons of substantial public interest) for a basis in UK law (see Clause 10(3)). This amendment adds to Part 2 of Schedule 1 certain processing of personal data which is necessary for the protection of children or of adults at risk. See also Amendments 116 and 117.226;128;\ufffd       Amendment 86, page 126, line 38 [Schedule 1], at end insert\u2014       \u201cSafeguarding of economic well-being of certain individuals       14B (1) This condition is met if the processing\u2014       (a) is necessary for the purposes of protecting the economic well-being of an individual at economic risk who is aged 18 or over,       (b) is of data concerning health,       (c) is carried out without the consent of the data subject for one of the reasons listed in sub-paragraph (2), and       (d) is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.       (2) The reasons mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(c) are\u2014       (a) in the circumstances, consent to the processing cannot be given by the data subject;       (b) in the circumstances, the controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the consent of the data subject to the processing;       (c) the processing must be carried out without the consent of the data subject because obtaining the consent of the data subject would prejudice the provision of the protection mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a).       (3) In this paragraph, \u201cindividual at economic risk\u201d means an individual who is less able to protect his or her economic well-being by reason of physical or mental injury, illness or disability.\u201d\u2014(Victoria Atkins.)       Part 2 of Schedule 1 describes types of processing of special categories of personal data which meet the requirement in Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR (processing necessary for reasons of substantial public interest) for a basis in UK law (see Clause 10(3)). This amendment adds to Part 2 of Schedule 1 certain processing of personal data which is necessary to protect the economic well-being of adults who are less able to protect their economic well-being by reason of a physical or mental injury, illness or disability.                    Louise Haigh (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab)           Share this contribution        I beg to move amendment 150, page 126, line 38, at end insert\u2014       \u201cRegister of missing persons       14A This condition is met if the processing\u2014       (a) is necessary for the establishment or maintenance of any register of missing persons, and       (b) is carried out in a manner which is consistent with any guidance which may be issued by the Secretary of State or by the Commissioner on the processing of data for the purposes of this paragraph.\u201d       It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hanson. Amendment 150 seeks to provide a similar exemption to the one that the Minister has just laid out. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill said, we completely support the principles behind this exemption to schedule 1. As the Minister made clear, too often serious case reviews or reviews after an incident of this nature, particularly in child protection cases, show clearly that if the data had been shared more effectively\u2014often in health cases\u2014the child could have been protected and their life might have been saved.       We tabled this amendment because of the increase in the number of missing persons and missing children over the past few years. As the shadow Police Minister, I approach this issue from a policing perspective. It is important that all data handlers fully understand their obligations and the powers that are bestowed on them. Too often, under the existing legislation, they hide behind data protection to avoid sharing data, and we fear that that tendency will become even stronger under the Bill.       Sharing data relating to missing persons is important for a number of reasons. The demand on police services from such cases has rocketed over the past few years. 226;128;\ufffdPolice officers spend only 17% of their time responding to crime, so 83% of police time is spent responding to non-crime demand. That includes mental health call-outs, but largely it relates to missing persons. Some police forces tell me that missing persons place the greatest demand on their time.       In the west midlands, since 2015 the number of missing person incidents has doubled to nearly 13,000 cases a year. In Northumbria\u2014one of the smallest police forces in the country\u2014as of this minute there are 43 men and 20 women missing. For such a small police force, that is a significant number of people to be out looking for. Last year alone, such investigations cost the police service more than 163;600 million. One fifth of those missing persons are children in care, more than 50% are children, and a significant proportion are elderly people missing from care. Crucially, about one third are reported missing on more than one occasion. It is those individuals we seek to address with the register.       There are various reasons for the increase, one of which is certainly better police reporting. Our ageing population means that more people are in care and are going missing from care. The police have responded to that issue in various ways, including by tagging elderly individuals who go missing from care repeatedly \u2014we have tabled amendments to explore the issues arising from that. Cuts to other public services mean that the increasing demand, which previously would have fallen elsewhere\u2014in particular, on local authorities\u2014is now landing on the police. We are seeing a higher tolerance of risk across the care sector, and possibly the health sector too, and a tendency to pass the buck for these issues and other vulnerabilities on to the police, who have a very low risk threshold and nowhere to pass them on.       I believe we need a review of all agencies that are involved with safeguarding to ensure that they are taking seriously their responsibilities in this regard. When the issue relates to resources, they must make the case for those resources, rather than merely pass the problem on to the police. I have heard stories about private children\u2019s care homes where staff may see that the child is outside their window or down the street, but because they are five minutes over curfew they ring the police and say that the child is missing. That passes on the responsibility, but has very serious implications for the police. It diverts resources from tackling crime and from responding to genuine cases of missing children and high-risk missing persons.       Estimates of the time associated with this activity suggest that approximately 18 hours of police time is needed for a medium-risk missing persons investigation. In 2015-16, that equated to more than 6 million investigation hours, or more than 150,000 officers occupied full time with that activity. Not being dealt with by the appropriate agency and not being responded to correctly has real implications for the individual. Going missing can be a precursor to various aspects of significant harm, such as abuse, exposure to criminal activity and mental ill-health. There are enough issues relating to police forces sharing data among themselves, let alone with other agencies. As a result, various criminal activities exploiting those weaknesses have developed. In the past, the Minister and I have discussed county lines at length, which is a criminal activity whereby organised criminal gangs exploit children. They take them, internally traffick them across the country, set them up in another vulnerable adult\u2019s 226;128;\ufffdhome and leave them to deal drugs on their behalf. That is a very profitable criminal activity, but the perpetrators have been able to evade real enforcement because of the weaknesses in data sharing and cross-agency working between police forces and agencies. The amendment will ensure that the police and all appropriate safeguarding agencies have access to the relevant data to ensure that at-risk missing people are found as quickly and safely as possible, and have their needs dealt with in the most appropriate way.              2.15 pm    I know that the Government are supportive of that idea and proposal. In their \u201cTackling child sexual exploitation: progress report\u201d they recognise the need to improve the early identification of and initial response to children and young people at risk. They have committed to extend their programme of work into child safeguarding, and a key deliverable was the development of a national missing persons register. This amendment seeks to probe the Government about the establishment of that register, and about the information that it should include.  We believe\u2014the Children\u2019s Society has made representations on this\u2014that if designed well, key information and intelligence could be stored in one place, making the sharing of vital information about missing people in real time possible across different local areas. The information available should include previously identified risks, where people go missing from and to, and who they go missing with. Furthermore, the register should include provision for local authorities or return-home interview service providers commissioned by local authorities to input and store relevant information from those interviews, to inform risk assessment and local intelligence on missing children.  In 2016, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary found serious inconsistencies between and within forces regarding data sharing and responding to missing children and high-risk missing adults. This issue has been highlighted by the inspectorate, and I am sure that the Minister understands the urgency of getting such a register in place. The case for the amendment is clear: it supports principles that have been outlined by the Government, and it would support our most vulnerable people and go some way towards relieving pressure on the police when responding to those high-risk missing            Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley for affording me the opportunity to update the Committee on our progress in establishing a national register of missing persons, and to touch on the missing children and adults strategy that the Government are currently working on, which I hope will be published shortly. It will address many of the themes that the hon. Lady drew on in her speech, particularly the deliberate targeting of vulnerable children by county lines gangs, children who go missing\u2014usually, sadly, from care homes\u2014and the exploitation that occurs.       As the hon. Lady said, this is an important subject because each year more than 337,000 calls are made to police stations in England and Wales about missing and absent people. Happily, the vast majority are found within 24 hours, but 2% or thereabouts remain missing for more than a week. Anyone who has ever met the 226;128;\ufffdparents of children who go missing knows the heartache that those parents face, not just on an annual basis, but on a daily, minute-by-minute basis. They feel that pain constantly.       People who go missing are often the most vulnerable in society, and it is vital that those tasked with investigating their disappearance have the most accurate and up-to-date information available. We accept that the current technology available to frontline staff to deal with missing persons is insufficient. For example, the police national computer identifies only those currently reported as missing, while the National Crime Agency database includes only those missing for more than 72 hours. We know that the search must start the moment that a child or vulnerable person is identified as missing; we cannot wait for 72 hours. There is no national record of the history of missing persons in England and Wales.       The Government\u2019s \u201cTackling child sexual exploitation: progress report\u201d published in February last year set out our commitment to deliver a national missing persons register. This will enable police officers to access up-to-date data about missing people across force boundaries and take appropriate action when they investigate missing person incidents or encounter a missing person who is away from his or her home force area. The register is being established as part of the national law enforcement data programme, which will replace the police national computer and the police national database with a new national data service. The current timetable, agreed with the police, is to launch the capability for forces to record manually missing and associated found incidents from mid-2019 with releases thereafter, including automation and establishing the ability to share controlled information beyond policing to other agencies.       In terms of the way in which the register and the scheme interplay in the Bill, the processing of the personal data held on the database will take place under either the GDPR or part 3 of the Bill. Processing of the data by the police will often be for a law enforcement purpose, including the prevention, investigation or detection of a criminal offence and any sensitive processing would fall within paragraph 3 of schedule 8, which enables processing where necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another individual, or under the new safeguarding condition, which we have just debated. Where the processing is undertaken under the GDPR, the conditions in respect of protecting the vital interests of the data subject, or preventing or detecting unlawful acts, may apply. Again, the new safeguarding condition may also be applicable.       Given those provisions and the very clear timetable that the Government and police have for their programme, we are of the view that the amendment is unnecessary, but I am, of course, very appreciative that the hon. Lady has raised this in the Committee. Obviously, I will keep her informed of progress on the new register.                    Louise Haigh           Share this contribution        That is fantastic news. It is a very ambitious deadline for a police IT transformation programme. I know that South Yorkshire is going through the transformation on the CONNECT programme at the moment; it is woefully behind the timescale envisaged and over budget, as every IT transformation in the history of any Government, of any colour, has always been. I wonder, therefore, given the urgency of this issue, whether it is possible for this information to be recorded on the PNC for the time being.                 226;128;\ufffd            Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I am looking at my officials and they will stop me if I am wrong, I hope. If she prefers, may I write to her? I do not think that the PNC has the capability at the moment. That is why we are having to develop this new programme, but we will write to the hon. Lady in any event. As I say, I will keep her up-to-date with progress. But I invite her to withdraw the amendment, please.                    Louise Haigh           Share this contribution        Given that the Minister asked so nicely, I will. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.       Amendments made: 87, in schedule 1, page 127, line 30, at end insert\u2014       \u201c( ) The reference in sub-paragraph (4)(b) to a data subject withholding consent does not include a data subject merely failing to respond to a request for consent.\u201d       This amendment clarifies the intended effect of the safeguard in paragraph 15(4) of Schedule 1 (processing necessary for an insurance purpose).       Amendment 88, in schedule 1, page 127, line 39, at end insert\u2014       \u201c( ) is of data concerning health which relates to a data subject who is the parent, grandparent, great-grandparent or sibling of a member of the scheme,\u201d.       This amendment provides that the condition in paragraph 16 of Schedule 1 (occupational pension schemes) can only be relied on in connection with the processing of data concerning health relating to certain relatives of a member of the scheme.       Amendment 89, in schedule 1, page 128, line 6, at end insert\u2014       \u201c( ) The reference in sub-paragraph (2)(b) to a data subject withholding consent does not include a data subject merely failing to respond to a request for consent.\u201d       This amendment clarifies the intended effect of the safeguard in paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 1 (processing necessary for determinations in connection with occupational pension schemes).       Amendment 90, in schedule 1, page 131, line 14, at end insert\u2014       \u201c( ) If the processing consists of the disclosure of personal data to a body or association described in sub-paragraph (1)(a), or is carried out in preparation for such disclosure, the condition in sub-paragraph (1) is met even if, when the processing is carried out, the controller does not have an appropriate policy document in place (see paragraph 5 of this Schedule).\u201d       This amendment provides that when processing consists of the disclosure of personal data to a body or association that is responsible for eliminating doping in sport, or is carried out in preparation for such disclosure, the condition in paragraph 22 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 (anti-doping in sport) is met even if the controller does not have an appropriate policy document in place when the processing is carried out.       Amendment 91, in schedule 1, page 133, line 17, leave out from \u201cinterest\u201d to end of line 21.\u2014(Margot James.)       This amendment removes provisions from paragraph 31 of Schedule 1 (extension of conditions in Part 2 of Schedule 1 referring to substantial public interest) which are unnecessary because they impose requirements which are already imposed by paragraph 5 of Schedule 1.                    The Minister of State, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (Margot James)           Share this contribution        I beg to move amendment 92, page 134, line 18 [Schedule 1], leave out \u201con the day\u201d and insert \u201cwhen\u201d.       This amendment is consequential on Amendment 71.                    The Chair           Share this contribution        With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:226;128;\ufffd       Government amendments 107, 108, 111, 113, 114, 21, 29 to 40, 43 to 46, 118 to 121, 48, 49, 53, 55, 56, 123 to 125, 59 and 71.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        Following engagement with local government stakeholders, we have recognised that the maximum time period permitted for responses to the subject access request set out in parts 3 and 4 of the Data Protection Bill subtly differs from that permitted under the GDPR and part 2 of the Bill. That is because the GDPR and, by extension, part 2 rely on European rules for calculating time periods, whereas parts 3 and 4 implicitly rely on a more usual domestic approach. European law, which applies to requests under part 2, says that when one is considering a time period in days, the day on which the request is received is discounted from the calculation of that time period. In contrast, the usual position under UK law, which applies to requests under parts 3 and 4 of the Bill, is that that same seven-day period to respond would begin on the day on which the request was received. In a data protection context, that has the effect of providing those controllers responding to requests under parts 3 and 4 with a time period that is one day shorter in which to respond.       To provide consistency across the Bill, we have decided to include a Bill-wide provision that applies the European approach to all time periods throughout the Bill, thus ensuring consistency with the directly applicable GDPR. Having a uniform approach to time periods is particularly helpful for bodies with law enforcement functions, which will process personal data under different regimes under the Bill. Without these amendments, different time periods would apply, depending on which regime they were processing under. Ensuring consistency for calculating time periods will also assist the information commissioner with her investigatory activities and enforcement powers, for example by avoiding the confusion and potential disputes that could arise relating to her notices or requests for information.       Amendment 71 provides for a number of exemptions to the European approach where deviating from our standard approach to time periods would be inappropriate. For example, where the time period refers to the process of parliamentary approval of secondary legislation, it would clearly not be appropriate to deviate from usual parliamentary time periods. The unfortunate number of amendments in this group comes from the need to modify existing language on time periods, currently worded for compliance with the usual UK approach, so that it applies the approach of the EU rules instead. I hope that this has provided the Committee with sufficient detail on the reasons for tabling this group of amendments.       Amendment 92 agreed to.       Question proposed, That the schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        We had a useful debate this morning about the whys and wherefores of whether the article 8 right to privacy should be incorporated into the Bill. Although we were disappointed by the Minister\u2019s reply, what I thought was useful in the remarks she made was a general appreciation of the importance of strong data rights if the UK is to become a country with a strong environment of trust within which a world of digital trade can flourish.       I will briefly alert the Minister to a debate we want to have on Report. The reality is that we feel schedule 1 is 226;128;\ufffdnarrowly drawn. It is an opportunity that has been missed, and it is an opportunity for the Minister to come back on Report with a much more ambitious set of data rights for what will be a digital century. When we look around the world at the most advanced digital societies, we can see that a strong regime of data rights is common to them all.       I was recently in Estonia, which I hope the Minister will have a chance to visit if she has not done so already. Estonia likes to boast of its record as the world\u2019s most advanced digital society; it is a place where 99% of prescriptions are issued online, 95% of taxes are paid online and indeed a third of votes are cast online. It is a country where the free and open right to internet access is seen as an important social good, and a good example of a country that has really embraced the digital revolution and translated that ambition into a set of strong rights.       The Government are not averse to signing declaratory statements of rights that they then interpret into law. They are a signatory to the UN universal declaration of human rights and the UN convention on the rights of the child; the Human Rights Act 1998 is still in force\u2014I have not yet heard of plans to repeal it\u2014and of course the Equality Act 2010 was passed with cross-party support. However, those old statements of rights, which date back to 1215, were basically to correct and guard against dangerous imbalances of power. Things have moved on since 1215 and the worries that the barons had about King John. We are no longer as concerned as people were in 1215 about taking all the fish weirs out of the Thames, for example.              2.30 pm    The reality today is that we are not worried about the unchecked powers of sovereigns, but we are more and more concerned about the power of big tech companies. As of last Friday, the fearsome five data giants had a combined market capitalisation of about $2.4 trillion. They are very, very powerful players. They capture data from us and process it in a way that we do not really understand, with effects that we do not really appreciate. The Government have nodded towards that concern with the idea of setting up a digital charter, which is very much from the cones hotline school of public service reform. The problem with a digital charter is that it will contain vague commitments associated with vague frameworks, without much legislative bite. We think the Government can do much better.  Of course, that is brought into focus most sharply with regard to children. Children are not a marginal issue in this debate; they are about a third of internet users. We were grateful that the Government acquiesced in amendments moved by Baroness Kidron. She is one of the architects of the 5Rights movement, which says that children should have the right to remove content they do not want to be online anymore; the right to know who is targeting them and for what purposes; the right to safety and support, because children are often upset or abused online; the right to informed and conscious use, and the right to digital literacy. The 5Rights movement has helpfully set out those good, strong digital rights for children, but we urge the Government to build on the basic charter of digital rights in schedule 1 and go much further.  226;128;\ufffd       The amendments we tabled that were not selected for debate\u2014we hope we will be able to come back to them at a later stage\u2014include the following. One relates to the right to equality of access: every data subject should have the right to access and participate in the digital environment on equal terms, and internet access should be open and free. Another is about equality of treatment: every data subject should have the right to fair and equal treatment in the processing of his or her personal data, in a way that is encompassed by many amendments to the Bill. A third relates to security: every data subject should have the right to security and protection of their personal data and information systems, and Governments should not misuse their ability to access that information without checks and safeguards.  There should be rights to free expression through data, to privacy and to ownership of data. Every data subject should have the right to own and control their personal data and therefore should be entitled to a proportionate share of the income or other benefit derived from it. Every data subject should have the right to transparent and equal treatment in the processing of their personal data by an algorithm or an automated system. Every data subject should have the right to deploy their personal data to communicate, in pursuit of their fundamental right to freedom of association. There should be strong rights to protection online, and to remove data.  We think that a more ambitious and assertive schedule 1 could be the foundation of a strong digital Bill of Rights for the 21st century, which would go some way to creating a stronger environment of trust online. Trust is breaking down, because cyber-crime is multiplying, because public services such as the NHS have shown their vulnerability to cyber-attacks and because of the proliferation of fake news. There is wide appreciation that our children in particular are vulnerable, and I am afraid there is concern that the Government hitherto have been too reluctant to act.  Although the digital charter takes the debate on somewhat, we would encourage the Government, in the best traditions of this country and in the best tradition of our contribution to the debate about strong rights, to be more assertive and more ambitious in schedule 1 and to accommodate the amendments we will table on Report.            The Chair           Share this contribution        To make matters clear to hon. Members and in particular who are new to the Committee, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill tabled a number of amendments\u2014171 to 175 and 177 to 178\u2014that were not selected because they were tabled only yesterday. We need to have several days\u2019 notice before selection can be considered. Had they been tabled earlier, we could have debated and voted on those amendments now. I have given the right hon. Gentleman leeway to widen his arguments about schedule 1, and it is up to him whether he wishes to table those amendments on Report. He is perfectly in order to do so. The debate today is on schedule 1, and the points that the right hon. Gentleman has made in relation to potential amendments are a heads-up for the future or for the Minister to respond to at this point.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill covered a lot of important ground. He mentioned the digital charter. We are bringing forward the digital charter and we do not intend for it to be set 226;128;\ufffdin stone. We recognise that this is a fast-changing environment and so it is deliberately something that will evolve over time. We both share the concerns that he expressed with regard to fake news and the rights and protections needed for children and young people who, as he says, make up a third of internet users. We will address many of the things he highlighted as part of our internet safety strategy, and I look forward to debating them further with him on Report.       To add to what we have already discussed under schedule 1, article 9 of the GDPR limits the processing of special categories of data. Those special categories are listed in article 9(1) and include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, health, political opinions and religious beliefs. Some of the circumstances in which article 9 says that special category data can be processed have direct effect, but others require the UK to make related provision.       Clause 10 introduces schedule 1 to the Bill, which sets out in detail how the Bill intends to use the derogations in article 9 and the derogation in article 10 relating to criminal convictions data to permit particular processing activities. To ensure that the Bill is future-proof, clause 10 includes a delegated power to update schedule 1 using secondary legislation. Many of the conditions substantively replicate existing processing conditions in the 1998 Act and hon. Members may wish to refer to annexe B to the explanatory notes for a more detailed analysis on that point.                    Darren Jones           Share this contribution        I want to make one point about schedule 1. Amendment 9, which was made this morning, allows democratic engagement to be a purpose under article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR\u2014namely, that consent is not required for the processing of data for public interest or the exercising of official authority and the purposes of democratic engagement. I wonder whether the definitions of political parties and politicians under schedule 1 could be used to restrict that amendment, so that organisations other than political parties and politicians are not able to process data in the public interest for democratic engagement without consent. For example, if Leave.EU or Open Britain wanted to process our personal data, they ought to do so with consent, not using the same public interest for democratic engagement purposes as politicians or parties.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I understand the hon. Gentleman\u2019s concerns. The GDPR requires data controls to have a legal basis laid down in law, which can take the form, for example, of a statutory power or duty, or a common-law power. Any organisation that does not have such legal basis would have to rely on one of the other processing conditions in article 6. With regard to the amendment that was agreed to this morning, we think that further restricting clause 8 might risk excluding bodies with a lawful basis for processing. However, the hon. Gentleman is free to raise the issue again on Report.       Question put and agreed to.       Schedule 1, as amended, accordingly agreed to.       Clauses 11 to 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The amendments touch on what I am afraid will become an increasing part of our lives in the years to come: the questions of what decisions can be taken by algorithms; where such decisions are taken, what rights we have to some kind of safeguards, such as a good old-fashioned human being looking over the decision that is taken and the outcomes that arise; and whether we are content to acquiesce in the rule of the robots.       In a number of areas of our lives\u2014particularly our economic and social lives\u2014such algorithms will become more and more important. Algorithms are already used to screen job applications, for example, and to create shortlists of candidates for interview. Insurance companies use them to adjudge what premiums someone should enjoy, or whether they should be offered insurance at all. The challenge of algorithms was put best by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge on Second Reading: the great risk of such developments is that old injustice is hard-coded into new injustice.       That is particularly troubling when we think about the provisions and exemptions the Government have brought forward that allow the automatic processing of data in public services. Many public servants around the world are beginning to look at predictive public services and how algorithms can scan great swathes of, for example, health data and crime data, and make decisions about where police should attend, who should or should not get bail, who should be added to police 226;128;\ufffddatabases such as the gangs matrix, and how healthcare should be targeted in parts of the country or to what kinds of families. There are great risks in algorithms taking decisions in ways ungoverned by us. As parliamentarians, we have a particular duty to ensure that the appropriate safeguards are in place.       Clauses 14 and 15 allow automated processes where they are authorised by law. That creates the obligation of giving notice and what is, in effect, an ex post facto right of appeal. The Opposition\u2019s argument is somewhat different: it is better not to take decisions on the basis of automatic processing of data where those decisions affect our human rights.       They say that to err is human, but to really mess things up you need a computer. We all know from our casework, whether about the benefits or the social care system or any other kind of system that constituents might name, that sometimes the most terrible, egregious errors are made. We also know that sometimes it is very difficult for citizens to seek remedies for those problems. Very often, the reason they have come to see us in our surgeries is because, as they so often say to us, we are the last port of call and the last hope that is kicking around; if we cannot fix it, frankly, our constituent is about to give up. That is an unfortunate situation that we do not want to see multiply.              2.45 pm    The great risk with automatic processing of data and the use of algorithms, whether in the public or private sector, where there is an ex post facto right of review, is that our surgeries end up as the final court of appeal. It will then fall to us to intervene either with the company or indeed with the public agency to say, \u201cLook, this has been really fouled up. I\u2019m sorry, but either the data that went into the algorithm is wrong, or the conduct of the algorithm is wrong.\u201d We think it would be better if we stopped the potential for that snowballing of problems in future by stopping the ability of algorithms to take decisions where human rights are engaged.  The Minister may say that there are lots of nice safeguards in the Bill, such as that it is permitted only where it is authorised by law. Frankly, that is a hopeless safeguard, particularly when it comes to policing, because the police are authorised to do so much by law. The police can stop people, search people and put through procedures that would deny people bail. The police can add people to databases. If those decisions are taken by an algorithm, all sorts of problems will arise. We think that there should be much stronger safeguards.  Through the amendments, basically we want to try to separate the business of automatic data processing from the possibilities of automatic decision taking. It is fine for data to be processed using algorithms in a way that is automated, but not for decision taking to be automated. We want to leave unfettered the rights of businesses and the Government to process data in an automatic way, but we want fetters around the business of decision taking. It is okay to use algorithms to inform decisions but not to take decisions. The idea of a post hoc review, as many of us know from our own casework, is a nice idea that is not a reality open to many citizens in this country. There is no substitute for preventing a decision being wrong in the first place.  226;128;\ufffd       This debate will grow over the years to come. We hope that the Government can take the opportunity now to incorporate some fairly common-sense safeguards into the Bill, because none of us on this Committee wants old injustices to be hard-coded into new injustices. That is the risk that the Bill is running.            Brendan O'Hara (Argyll and Bute) (SNP)           Share this contribution        I will speak to amendments 130, 133 and 135, which appear in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East. Our amendments seek to provide protection for individuals who are subject to purely automated decision making, specifically where we believe that it could have an adverse impact on their fundamental rights. The amendments would require that where human rights are or possibly could be impacted by automated decisions, ultimately there are always human decision makers. The amendments would instil that vital protection of human rights with regard to the general processing of personal data.       The amendments seek to clarify the meaning of a decision that is based solely on automated processing, which is a decision that lacks meaningful human input. That reflects the intent of the GDPR, and provides clarification that purely administrative human approval of an automated decision does not make that decision a human one. It is simply not enough for human beings to process the information in a purely administrative fashion, but to have absolutely no oversight or accountability for the decision that they process. We strongly believe that automated decision making without human intervention should be subject to strict limitations to ensure fairness, transparency and accountability, and to safeguard against discrimination. As it stands, there are insufficient safeguards in the Bill.       As the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill said, we are not talking about every automated decision. We are not talking about a tech company or an online retailer that suggests alternatives that someone may like based on the last book they bought or the last song they downloaded. It is about decisions that can be made without human oversight that will or may well have long-term, serious consequences on an individual\u2019s health, financial status, employment or legal status. All too often, I fear that automated decisions involve an opaque, unaccountable process that uses algorithms that are neither as benign nor as objective as we had hoped they would be, or indeed, as we thought they were when we first encountered them.       We are particularly concerned about elements of the Bill that allow law enforcement agencies to make purely automated decisions. That is fraught with danger and at odds with the Data Protection Act 1998, as well as article 22 of the GDPR, which states:       \u201cThe data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing\u201d.       Although there are provisions in the GDPR for EU member states to opt out of that, the opt-out does not apply if the data subject\u2019s rights, freedoms or legitimate interests are undermined.       I urge the Government to look again at the parts of the Bill about automated decision making, to ensure that when it is carried out, a human being will have to decide whether it is reasonable and appropriate to continue on that course. That human intervention will provide 226;128;\ufffdtransparency and capability, and it will ensure that the state does not infringe on an individual\u2019s freedoms\u2014those fundamental rights of liberty and privacy\u2014which are often subjective. Because they are subjective, they are beyond the scope of an algorithm.       There are serious human rights, accountability and transparency issues around fully automated decision making as the Bill stands. Amendment 130 says that any human involvement has to be \u201cmeaningful\u201d. We define meaningful human oversight as being significant, of consequence and purposeful. As I have said, that is far beyond the scope of an algorithm. If an individual\u2019s rights are to be scrutinised and possibly fundamentally affected, it is an issue of basic fairness that the decision is made, or at least overseen, by a sentient being. I hope the Government accept the amendments in the faith in which they were tabled.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        The amendments relate to automated decision making under the GDPR and the Bill. It is a broad category, which includes everything from trivial things such as music playlists, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute, and quotes for home insurance, to the potentially more serious issues outlined by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill of recruitment, healthcare and policing cases where existing prejudices could be reinforced. We are establishing a centre, the office for artificial intelligence and data ethics, and are mindful of these important issues. We certainly do not dismiss them whatsoever.       Article 22 of the GDPR provides a right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automatic processing of data that results in legal or similarly significant effects on the data subject. As is set out in article 22(2)(b), that right does not apply if the decision is authorised by law, so long as the data subject\u2019s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests are safeguarded.       The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, mentioned those safeguards, but I attribute far greater meaning to them than he implied in his speech. The safeguards embed transparency, accountability and a right to request that the decision be retaken, and for the data subject to be notified should a decision be made solely through artificial intelligence.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The Minister must realise that she is risking an explosion in the number of decisions that have to be taken to Government agencies or private sector companies for review. The justice system is already under tremendous pressure. The tribunal system is already at breaking point. The idea that we overload it is pretty optimistic. On facial recognition at public events, for example, it would be possible under the provisions that she is proposing for the police to use facial recognition technology automatically to process those decisions and, through a computer, to have spot interventions ordered to police on the ground. The only way to stop that would be to have an ex post facto review, but that would be an enormous task.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman should be aware that just because something is possible, it does not mean that it is automatically translated into use. His example of facial recognition and what the police could do with that technology would be subject to controls within the police and to scrutiny from outside.                 226;128;\ufffd            Louise Haigh           Share this contribution        The case that my right hon. Friend raises is certainly not hypothetical. The Metropolitan police have been trialling facial recognition scanning at the Notting Hill carnival for the last three years with apparently no legal base and very little oversight. We will move on to those issues in the Bill. That is exactly why the amendments are crucial in holding law enforcement agencies to account.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        As the hon. Lady says, the police are trialling those things. I rest my case\u2014they have not put them into widespread practice as yet.       Returning to the GDPR, we have translated the GDPR protections into law through the Bill. As I said, the data subject has the right to request that the decision be retaken with the involvement of a sentient individual. That will dovetail with other requirements. By contrast, the amendments are designed to prevent any automated decision-making from being undertaken under article 22(2)(b) if it engages the rights of the data subject under the Human Rights Act 1998.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Will the Minister explain to the Committee how a decision to stop and search based on an automated decision can be retaken? Once the person has been stopped and searched, how can that activity be undone?                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I am not going to get into too much detail. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley mentioned an area and I said that it was just a trial. She said that facial recognition was being piloted. I do not dispute that certain things cannot be undone. Similar amendments were tabled in the other place. As my noble Friend Lord Ashton said there, they would have meant that practically all automated decisions under the relevant sections were prohibited, since it would be possible to argue that any decision based on automatic decision making at the very least engaged the data subject\u2019s right to have their private life respected under article 8 of the European convention on human rights, even if it was entirely lawful under the Act.              3.00 pm    Amendment 130 also seeks to clarify what is meant by a decision  \u201cbased solely on automated processing\u201d  to ensure that human intervention must be meaningful. We consider the amendment unnecessary, as the phrase, especially when read with recital 71 of the GDPR, already provides for this. As my noble Friend Lord Ashton stated in the other place,  \u201cmere human presence or incidental human involvement is not sufficient\u201d\u2014[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 December 2017; Vol. 787, c. 1581.]  to change the basis of a decision. I am very happy to put that on the record once more. However, even if it were not the case, we could not go around altering definitions under the GDPR; it is not in our gift to do so.            Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I fear that the Minister is taking some pretty serious gambles on the application of this technology in the future. We think it is the business of this place to ensure that our citizens have strong safeguards, so we will put the amendment to a vote.226;128;\ufffd       Question put, That the amendment be made.

The Chair           Share this contribution        The hon. Gentleman can press the amendment to a vote now. If it is carried, it will be part of the Bill. If it is defeated, it will not be, and it may then be moved on Report, subject to the Speaker\u2019s discretion. If the hon. Gentleman does not press the amendment now, it may be that there is more of a likelihood of its being picked on Report, but that is a matter for the Speaker.                    Brendan O'Hara           Share this contribution        In that case, I will not press the amendment now.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I beg to move Government amendment 10, in clause 14, page 8, line 4, leave out \u201c21 days\u201d and insert \u201c1 month\u201d.       Clause 14(4)(b) provides that where a controller notifies a data subject under Clause 14(4)(a) that the controller has taken a \u201cqualifying significant decision\u201d in relation to the data subject based solely on automated processing, the data subject has 21 days to request the controller to reconsider or take a new decision not based solely on automated processing. This amendment extends that period to one month.                    The Chair           Share this contribution        With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments 11, 12, 23, 24, 27, 28, 41 and 42.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        Amendments 10, 11 and 12 relate to clause 14, which requires a data controller to notify a data subject of a decision based solely on automatic processing as soon as is reasonably practicable. The data subject may then request that the data controller reconsider such a decision and take a new decision not based solely on automated processing.       The purpose of the amendments is to bring clause 14 into alignment with the directly applicable time limits in article 12 of the GDPR, thereby ensuring that both data subjects and data controllers have easily understandable rights and obligations. Those include giving the data 226;128;\ufffdsubject longer to request that a decision be reconsidered, requiring that the controller action the request without undue delay and permitting an extension of up to two months where necessary.       Furthermore, to ensure that there is consistency across the different regimes in the Bill\u2014not just between the Bill and the GDPR\u2014amendments 23, 24, 41 and 42 extend the time limit provisions for making and responding to requests in the other regimes in the Bill. That is for the simple reason that it would not be right to have a data protection framework that applies one set of time limits to one request and a different set of time limits to another.       In a similar vein, amendments 27 and 28 amend part 3 of the Bill, concerning law enforcement processing, to ensure that controllers can charge for manifestly unfounded or excessive requests for retaking a decision, as is permitted under article 12 of the law enforcement directive. To prevent abuse, amendment 28 provides that it is for the controller to be able to show that the request was manifestly unfounded or excessive.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        It would be useful if the Minister could say a little more about the safeguards around the controllers charging reasonable fees for dealing with requests.       It is quite easy to envisage situations where algorithms take decisions. We have some ex post facto review; a citizen seeks to overturn the decision; the citizen thinks they are acting reasonably but the commercial interest of the company that has taken and automated the decision means that it wants to create disincentives for that rigmarole to unfold. That creates the risk of unequal access to justice in these decisions.       If the Minister is not prepared to countenance the sensible safeguards that we have proposed, she must say how she will guard against another threat to access to justice.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman asks a reasonable question. I did not mention that data subjects have the right of complaint to the Information Commissioner if the provisions are being abused. I also did not mention another important safeguard, which is that it is for the data controller to show that the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. So the burden of proof is on the data controller and the data subject has the right of involving the Information Commissioner, if he or she contests the judgment taken in this context, concerning unfounded or excessive requests in the opinion of the data controller. I hope that satisfies the right hon. Gentleman.       Amendment 10 agreed to.       Amendments made: 11, in clause 14, page 8, leave out line 10 and insert \u201cwithin the period described in Article 12(3) of the GDPR\u2014\u201d       This amendment removes provision from Clause 14(5) dealing with the time by which a controller has to respond to a data subject\u2019s request under Clause 14(4)(b) and replaces it with a requirement for the controller to respond within the time periods set out in Article 12(3) of the GDPR, which is directly applicable.       Amendment 12, in clause 14, page 8, line 16, at end insert\u2014       \u2018(5A) In connection with this section, a controller has the powers and obligations under Article 12 of the GDPR (transparency, procedure for extending time for acting on request, fees, manifestly unfounded or excessive requests etc) that apply in connection with Article 22 of the GDPR.\u201d \u2014(Margot James.)226;128;\ufffd       This amendment inserts a signpost to Article 12 of the GDPR which is directly applicable and which confers powers and places obligations on controllers to whom Clause 14 applies.       Clause 14, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.       Clause 15       Exemptions etc.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        I beg to move amendment 13, in clause 15, page 8, line 31, after \u201c21\u201d insert \u201cand 34\u201d       This amendment is consequential on Amendment 94.                    The Chair           Share this contribution        With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments 14, 93 to 106, 109, 110 and 112.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        Schedule 2 allows for particular rights or obligations contained in the GDPR to be disapplied in particular circumstances, where giving effect to that right or obligation would lead to a perverse outcome. To do that, it makes use of a number of derogations in the GDPR, including articles 6(3) and 23(1).       Amendments 93, 95 and 109 permit article 19 of the GDPR to be disapplied for the purposes in parts 1, 2 and 5 of schedule 2.       When a data controller corrects or deletes personal data following a request from a data subject, article 19 of the GDPR requires them to inform all persons to whom the personal data has been disclosed. Additionally, if requested, the data controller must inform the data subject about those persons to whom the data has been disclosed. Following the introduction of the Bill, we have had further representations from a range of stakeholders, including the banking industry, regulators and the media sector, about the problems that article 19 might create in very particular circumstances.       The amendments will ensure that, for example, where a bank may have shared personal data about one of its customers with the National Crime Agency because of a suspected fraud, it will not have to tell the data subject about that disclosure when the customer changes their address with the bank. That will ensure that the data subject is not tipped off about the suspected fraud investigation.       Several amendments in the group are designed to ensure that a valuable provision of the GDPR\u2014article 34\u2014does not have unintended consequences for controllers who do the right thing by seeking to prevent or detect crime, assist with the assessment or collection of tax or uncover abuses in our society. Article 34 requires data controllers to inform a data subject if there has been a data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of an individual. In normal operation, this is an important article, which we hope will prompt a step change in the way organisations think about cyber-security.       However, article 23(1) enables member states to create laws to restrict the scope of the obligations and rights for which article 34 provides in the minority of cases where it conflicts with other important objectives of general public interest. The amendments seek to do that in the Bill. Amendment 94 responds to the concerns of the finance sector that compliance with article 34 may result in persons under investigation for financial crime being tipped off. Amendment 110 serves a similar purpose for media organisations.226;128;\ufffd       Article 85(2) creates scope for member states to provide exemptions from chapter 4 of the GDPR, which includes article 34, if they are necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression. The amendment intends to ensure that processing data for a special purpose that is in the public interest is not prejudiced\u2014for example, by a controller having to notify the data subject of a breach in relation to pre-publication undercover footage. Importantly, data controllers will still be required, for the first time, to report a breach to the Information Commissioner under article 33 of the GDPR. That will ensure that she is well placed to take all the necessary steps to ensure data subjects\u2019 rights are respected, including by monitoring compliance with these new exemptions.       On the more general question of who can make use of the exemptions in schedule 2 and when, amendment 96 broadens the exemption in paragraph 7 of the schedule, which relates to the protection of members of the public. As drafted, the exemption applies to personal data processed for the purposes of discharging a function that is designed to protect members of the public against dishonesty, malpractice or incompetence by persons who carry out activities that bring them into contact with members of the public. We have identified an issue with that wording: a number of public office holders, including police staff, do not carry out activities that necessarily bring them into contact with members of the public. Amendment 96 broadens the scope of the exemption to include processing in relation to individuals who work for those organisations in a behind-the-scenes capacity.       We have also had representations from several regulators on the need to make additional provisions to protect the integrity of their activities. Amendment 97 provides the UK\u2019s Comptroller and Auditor General, and their counterpart in each of the devolved Administrations, with an exemption from certain GDPR provisions where these are likely to prejudice their statutory functions. That will prevent certain individuals who suspect they may be under scrutiny from trying to use their rights under the GDPR, such as article 15 (confirmation of processing) as a way of confirming that their data is being processed, or from using article 17 (right to erasure) and article 18 (restriction of processing) to undermine the effectiveness of an audit.              3.15 pm    Likewise, amendment 98 provides an exemption for the Bank of England from the list of GDPR provisions, where these may inhibit its ability to exercise its functions. This amendment ensures the Bank of England can continue its work as a monetary authority without undue restriction from the GDPR. Amendments 99 and 100 are technical changes, which clarify that the table in paragraph 9 of schedule 2 refers to persons rather than bodies, to reflect the legal characteristics of the listed regulators. Amendment 101 adds section 244 of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 to the list of legislation that confers processing functions on the Information Commissioner. Section 244 requires the commissioner to audit compliance, with certain obligations imposed by part 4 of the Investigatory Powers Act. This amendment would therefore exempt the commissioner from certain provisions of the GDPR in respect of those oversight functions. Hon. Members will agree that the commissioner\u2019s powers of oversight are vital to 226;128;\ufffdher being an effective regulator. This amendment will allow her to use her investigatory powers in an unrestricted manner, to ensure compliance with the rules around the retention of data.  Amendment 102 provides an exemption for the Scottish Information Commissioner. A similar provision already exists for the UK Information Commissioner. This was included to address the risk to the UK commissioner\u2019s functions under the various access to information regimes, which could be prejudiced in some circumstances if she were to comply with a full range of the data subject\u2019s rights. The Scottish commissioner has confirmed that the same rights exist when carrying out his functions under equivalent Scottish legislation. We have therefore drafted this amendment to provide the Scottish Information Commissioner with an equivalent exemption to that of the UK Information Commissioner in relation to these functions.  Amendment 104 creates protection for the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. Clearly such protection is necessary for the integrity of our financial services\u2019 regulatory landscape. Amendment 105 extends the exemptions in schedule 2 to the Charity Commission\u2019s functions under the Charities Act 1992, the Charities Act 2006 and the Charities Act 2011. Again, these exemptions apply only where a right or obligation would be likely to prejudice the ability to discharge a function conferred on them by statute. Amendments 106 and 112 relate to schedule 3, which provides for restrictions from certain GDPR provisions where this is necessary for health, education and social work purposes.  Paragraph 16 provides an exemption from certain GDPR provisions in relation to educational records in Northern Ireland. It currently applies only to information processed by or on behalf of the board of governors or a teacher at a grant-aided school. This amendment extends the exemption so that it includes records of information processed by or on behalf of grant-aided and independent school regardless of their governance arrangements.

Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I beg to move amendment 156, in schedule 2, page 136, line 30, leave out paragraph 4.       This amendment would remove immigration from the exemptions from the GDPR.       We are trying to provide some careful and considered constraints on the exemptions that the Government are asking for, in particular the exemptions that Ministers seek for the purposes of immigration control.       The Bill has been drafted essentially to enable the Home Office to do two things: win cases and create a hostile environment for those who are here illegally, where it has no capacity to trace and deport individuals. In conducting its work, the Home Office draws on a wide range of private providers, from G4S to Cifas. They have a mixed record, including on data protection. The carve-out that the Government seek for immigration purposes has caused widespread concern. It has drawn concern from the other place, the Information Commissioner and the Joint Committee on Human Rights.       The Minister will try to assure us by saying there are safeguards wrapped around the exemption and that there are limits on the way it can be used, but those limits are drawn so vaguely and broadly that they are not safeguards at all. They have been drafted to apply where matters are likely to prejudice immigration control. Who gets to judge the likelihood of prejudicing immigration control is not terrifically clear. In my Home Office days, we used to call that carte blanche.       Through the powers and exemptions in the Bill, the Home Office seeks to collect data for one purpose and then use it without informed consent. Where the rubber hits the road is that, crucially, the effect will be to ensure that subject access requests are basically put beyond the scope of someone seeking information that they might be able to use either in representations that we all might make to Ministers or, more importantly, in an immigration tribunal.       I want to sound a warning note to the Minister, as I hinted on Second Reading. I was brought into the Home Office as a Minister in 2006 and, after a glorious fortnight as Minister for Police and Counter-terrorism, I was moved by my boss John Reid to become Immigration Minister, where I was asked to conduct the biggest shake-up of our immigration system for 40 years.       I created the UK Border Agency; I took UK visas out of the Foreign Office; I took Customs out of the Treasury. We created a Border Agency that could run a biometric visa programme abroad, checking fingerprints against police national computers before anyone got on a train, plane or boat to our country. We introduced much stronger controls at the border, increasing those nice new blue signs, creating smart uniforms for immigration officials, and we increased immigration policing by around 163;100 million a year       I said earlier that to err is human but it takes a computer really to foul things up. That is a lesson that I learned with some force during my time at the Home Office. The dedicated, fantastic officials in the Home Office and the extraordinary officers who work in what was the UK Border Agency\u2014it has since been revised a couple of times\u2014do an amazing job. They are dramatically 226;128;\ufffdunderfunded by the Treasury. They have been underfunded by the Treasury under this Government and, in my view, we did not get enough out of the Treasury in my day.       However, they are human and make mistakes. That is why we have such a complicated immigration tribunal system, where people can take their complaints to a first tier tribunal but very often need to seek a judicial review down the line. The challenge is that, if the Home Office wants to create a process and an administration for making the right decision, which can be defended in a tribunal and in a judicial review case, that process must be robust. When we streamlined the immigration tribunal system, we realised that we had to change, improve and strengthen the way that we took decisions in the Home Office because too many were made in a way that was not JR-proof. We were losing JRs and therefore denying justice to those who brought a legitimate claim against the Crown.       There were occasions when I lost cases because of information that was disclosed to the applicant through a subject access review. SARs are one of the most powerful instruments by which anybody in this country, whether a citizen or someone applying to become a citizen, or applying for a legal right to remain, can acquire information that is crucial to the delivery of justice. Many of us are incredibly sympathetic to the job that the Home Office does. Many of us will want a tougher regime in policing immigration, in particular illegal immigration, but I suspect every member of the Committee is also interested in the good conduct of justice and administrative justice. As someone who served in the Home Office for two years, I had to take some very difficult decisions, including to release subject access request information that I absolutely did not want to go into the public domain. Sometimes it was right to release that information because it helped ensure that justice was done in the courts of this land.       The Minister has some very strong safeguards in the Bill. There are strong safeguards that create exemptions for her where the interest is in crime prevention, such as, for example, illegal immigration. However, the power that the provision seeks, at which we take aim in our amendments, is a step too far and risks the most terrible injustices. It risks the courts being fouled up and our being challenged in all sorts of places, including the European Court of Human Rights in the years to come. It is an unwise provision. If I were a Home Office official, I would have tried it on\u2014I would have tried to get it through my Minister and through the Houses of Parliament, but it is unwise and a step too far. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment and delete the provisions.                    Brendan O'Hara           Share this contribution        I will speak in favour of amendment 156. On Second Reading, I said that I would raise this matter again in Committee and I make no apologies for doing so. We regard this new exemption as extremely concerning. It permits the Government to collect and hold data for the purposes of what they describe as \u201ceffective immigration\u201d.       It also concerns me that nowhere in the Bill does there seem to be a legal definition of effective immigration control. I am worried that \u201ceffective immigration control\u201d is highly subjective and highly politicised. It exposes individuals, weakens their rights and makes them vulnerable to whatever change in the political tide happens to come 226;128;\ufffdalong next. This broad-ranging exemption is fundamentally unfair. It is open to abuse and runs contrary to safeguarding basic human rights. I believe that the UK\u2019s proposed immigration exemption goes much further than the scope of restrictions afforded to member states under GDPR, with all the consequences of that, which we discussed in such great detail this morning around adequacy decisions.              3.30 pm    The exemption would introduce a new and unprecedented removal of an individual\u2019s data protection rights and it is as unnecessary as it is disproportionate. Under this exemption, the Government will remove any obligation they have under data protection to inform an individual that their data has been transferred to the Home Office for immigration control purposes. That individual would not know if their data was being held or whether they were under investigation. That individual would have no right to know what data was being held by the Home Office or why. They would have no way of checking the accuracy of the information being held and therefore no way of correcting any mistakes in the information, which could then be used by the Home Office to decide whether they could live in this country or not.            Ian Murray (Edinburgh South) (Lab)           Share this contribution        The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful case against this particular exemption. He will know as well as me as a constituency Member of Parliament that one of the first things checked when someone comes to seek our advice is whether the Home Office has the correct information on an individual. Nine times out of 10, because of sheer workload, the Home Office just has it wrong. Then the visas and so on can be processed. Am I right in saying that, under this exemption, we would be unable to do that?                    Brendan O'Hara           Share this contribution        The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct; I was just getting on to the point about the information held by the Home Office. If it cannot be checked and if it is wrong at source, it is wrong at the end of the process. As far as I can see, there are no safeguards against that. He is absolutely correct that one early error in data collection and processing becomes an irrefutable and indisputable fact by the time it reaches the Home Office. The Home Office could then base its case against an individual on that wrong information.       The hon. Gentleman is right\u2014as constituency MPs, there is not one of us, I am sure, who is not painfully aware of wrong information being held not just by the Home Office, but by a whole range of Departments. That makes the exemption fundamentally unfair. This is an issue of basic fairness and there is little wonder it has been so loudly and roundly condemned by civil liberties groups and many in the legal profession. If we go ahead with the schedule as it stands, it fundamentally changes how we can operate and how we can help people who require our assistance.       At the moment, we have subject access requests. As matters stand, the Home Office and the subject or their legal representative have a right to access the same information, on which legal claims and challenges are based. Surely, if both sides do not have access to the same information, the fairness of any legal proceedings is inevitably compromised. Subject access requests are 226;128;\ufffdoften the only route through which a legal professional can make representations on very complicated issues on behalf of their client. Indeed, for clients who have been victims of domestic abuse and are fleeing an abusive partner, sometimes a subject access request is all that stands between them and a successful application to remain.       This exemption will reduce legal representatives\u2019 ability to best represent their clients and it removes a fundamental tool for holding the Home Office to account when it either gets things wrong or chooses to ignore or misrepresent the facts. The exemption is fundamentally unfair and as unnecessary as it is disproportionate. I urge the Government to reconsider.                    Darren Jones           Share this contribution        I support the amendment tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends, because there are some harsh realities about this exemption for effective immigration control, including the harsh reality that such an exemption right does not exist under the GDPR. Indeed, it is a new exemption compared with the law that exists today under the Data Protection Act 1998.       This broad, undefined exemption really must be restricted. I declare an interest. My wife is Australian and is here on a spousal visa. I therefore assume that, as a British citizen, I too could be subject to my rights being exempted for the effective control of immigration in order to understand what my wife is up to. I should declare for the record that her staying here in the UK is perfectly legitimate. This is a wide-ranging exemption that could apply to EU citizens, non-EU citizens and, as I say, British citizens who are connected with those who are subject to immigration controls.       This is not just an issue for the Home Office; there is data across various Departments that could be of use to the Home Office for the effective control of immigration. Indeed, we have been waiting for quite some time for the Government to publish the biometric strategy, setting out how they intend to use lots of biometric data across Government Departments. We have been waiting for a couple of years to see how the Government intend to do that.       My understanding is that if all the photographs held on our passports and driving licences were collated, in essence the Government would have the power to have a virtual ID card for the bulk of the adult population in this country. How on earth would that information be used for the effective control of immigration, which would potentially be applied to so many people here in the UK?       This exemption creates a derogation for many rights: the right to information, the right to access, the right to explanation, the right to erasure, the right to restriction of processing, the right to data portability, the right to object, and all the principles set out in article 5 of the GDPR. This is an enormous derogation from rights that our colleagues in Europe think are important. Again, this relates to the risk of failing to seek adequacy in our negotiations with the EU.       I seek not only to support the amendment but to ask the Minister to clarify something. If the Government do not support the amendment, how does the exemption fit within the language of article 23 of the GDPR, which states that it can only exist       \u201cwhen such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights\u201d\u2014226;128;\ufffd       which we have already noticed today are being repealed by this Government\u2014       \u201cand freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society\u201d?       My assertion is that this exemption goes too far and, therefore, that the amendment tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends is perfectly sensible. I look forward to it receiving Government support.                    Stuart C. McDonald (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East) (SNP)           Share this contribution        We have already heard three very good speeches in support of the amendment. I will not take too long to support pretty much everything that has been said so far. As a former troublesome immigration lawyer from back in the day\u2014in fact, when the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill was busy making his reforms in the Department\u2014I do not think that I could have lived it down if I had not said a few words in support of the amendment.       We must remember that the context for all this is that we have a Department\u2014the Home Office\u2014where, as the most recent statistics show, half of all immigration decisions that are challenged in a tribunal are overturned, which is a record high. The Home Affairs Committee has recently expressed grave concerns about the poor quality of decision making in far too many areas and the functioning of a hostile environment, for example in the area of bank checks, where there is something like a 10% error rate. We also live in a world where the creeping reach of the Home Office\u2019s information tentacles is almost being seen to put off migrants from accessing necessary public services such as health, creating a public health danger.       To provide a massive and almost unlimited exemption from many of the key protections, as has been described, is not only unjustified but counterproductive, because rather than fixing the fundamental problems with Home Office decision making, it will make them worse by hiding them from view and from scrutiny. The Home Office, not for the first time, is being pretty greedy with the powers that it seeks, because even if we take out the exemption, as this amendment proposes, the Home Office will still have plenty of scope\u2014perhaps too much scope\u2014to do what it wants to do. Recent immigration Acts have created myriad criminal offences in the sphere of immigration law, so the Home Office can already rely on other exemptions within the Bill where necessary. What is absolutely lacking is any explanation of why the exemption is needed. Will the Minister explain what it is about current data protection laws that has unacceptably hindered Home Office operations? I have seen no evidence of that at all.       Another concern is that it is not just the Home Office that will benefit from this exemption but other organisations that are involved in immigration control, such as G4S in its operation of detention centres. There is no justification for that, but there are serious risks, harms and injustices that might be created by the proposed exemption.       As we have heard, subject access requests are regularly a crucial part of representing a migrant caught up in the immigration system. They can be used to establish statuses that have not been communicated or have been lost. They can be used to establish other crucial facts that have not been known to that individual or their representatives. They can, of course, be absolutely crucial in establishing that the Home Office has made errors, as all too many hon. Members will have experienced.226;128;\ufffd       Members of the Committee have been provided with a host of examples by the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association and others. Those are real-life examples occurring day in, day out. Quite simply, the failure to allow those individuals access to data protection rights is not only a denial of those rights but a denial of access to justice altogether. This part of the Bill desperately needs reconsideration by the Government.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I feel I should defend all the hardworking people both in the Home Office and Border Force who do their best to do their jobs, day in, day out, to ensure that we have an effective, fair and proportionate immigration system. They have come under a bit of an attack in this debate.                    Ian Murray           Share this contribution        I do not think anybody on the Committee would disagree with the statement that the staff work incredibly hard. Would it not be a show of solidarity with those staff to give them the resources they require to do the job properly?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        The hon. Gentleman is starting the debate in very sparky form.                    Ian Murray           Share this contribution        You started it.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I didn\u2019t start it. The point is that, when people talk obliquely about the Home Office, it is people working in the Home Office who have to make these decisions day in, day out and who have to apply the law and do their best. I think we need to bear that in mind when we are talking about the Home Office system and how bad it is.       The provision relating to data processing for the purposes of immigration control in paragraph 4 of schedule 2 has been the subject of much debate. I would like to address some of the misunderstandings that have clearly arisen during the course of the Bill around both the purpose and scope of the provision. I hope I can persuade the Committee that this is a necessary and proportionate measure to protect the integrity of our immigration system.                    Mr Alister Jack (Dumfries and Galloway) (Con)           Share this contribution        Opposition Members have expressed concern, which I would like to emphasise, that this exemption is too wide. Can the Minister provide an assurance that that is not the case?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        Very much so. I will take it slowly because it is complicated and I want to ensure that the points raised today have been addressed. First, I was asked who decides the definition of effective immigration control in the schedule. That is an established term of art. It is used, for example, in the Immigration Act 2014. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 uses a similar term, namely       \u201cthe operation of the immigration controls\u201d.       In the context of the schedule, we have adopted a wraparound term such as that, rather than set out a detailed list of specific immigration-related functions to which the exemption might be applied. Given the undoubted complexity of immigration legislation, there is a danger that any such list would be incomplete and would need to be regularly reviewed and updated. The term is either 226;128;\ufffdthe precise term or similar to those already in law, such as in the Freedom of Information Act, which has been law for 18 years.       The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute seems concerned that once the Home Office system has accessed some of this information, it is lost forever and will not be revealed to the person whom it concerns. I will give case examples later, but I reassure him that the way in which we describe this exemption in the Home Office is that it is a pause on two of the data protection principles. Once the pause is lifted, because the end has been achieved\u2014the person has been found or whatever\u2014all those rights kick back in again, and they are able to make requests for the information that the hon. Gentleman set out. We see it as a pause, not as a long-standing and permanent exemption. It is just for the precise circumstances of enabling the immigration system and its protections.              3.45 pm      Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The Under-Secretary of State will know better than anybody that there are very tight time limits over the windows within which people can ask for entry clearance officer reviews or reconsideration, either by an immigration official or, in extremis, by the Minister. How long will the pause last, and can she guarantee the Committee today that the pause will never jeopardise the kick-in of time limits on an appeal or a reconsideration decision?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        The reason for the pause is\u2014I will give case studies of this\u2014to enable the immigration system to operate. If someone has gone missing, requests for data will be required to find that person. Once that person is found, and there is no longer a need to apply the exemption, it will be lifted.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        That is not an answer to my question. I am asking for a guarantee to the Committee this afternoon that the pause will never jeopardise somebody\u2019s ability to submit a valid request for a reconsideration or an appeal with the information that they need within the time windows set out by Home Office regulations\u2014yes or no.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I am asked whether this will have an impact on someone\u2019s application, either at appeal or reconsideration. Of course, information is obtained so that a person can be brought in. As I say, I will make it clear with case studies, so perhaps I can answer the right hon. Gentleman in more detail when I give such an example, but the purpose of this is generally to find a person. When the need, as set out under the exemption, no longer exists, the rights kick back in again. This relates only to the first two data protection principles under the GDPR. Again, I will go into more detail in a moment, but this is not the permanent exemption from rights as perhaps has been feared by some; it is simply to enable the process to work. Once a person has been brought into the immigration system, all the protections of the immigration system remain.                    Stuart C. McDonald           Share this contribution        The circumstances that the Minister describes for using the exemption are much narrower than the way the exemption is actually drawn. It seems to me that if that is the only way in which the Home Office wants to use the exemption, it could frame it in a much narrower way and possibly gain cross-party support.                 226;128;\ufffd            Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I will move on to the case studies in a moment, as I have given way several times. First, I will lay out the titles, then I will come on to article 23. Again, our analysis is that the provision fits within one of the exemptions in article 23. That is precisely the reason that we have drawn it in this way.       We very much welcome the enhanced rights and protections for data subjects afforded by the GDPR. The authors of the GDPR accepted that at times those rights need to be qualified in the general public interest, whether to protect national security, the prevention and detection of crime, the economic interests of the country or, in this case, the maintenance of an effective system of immigration control. Accordingly, a number of articles of the GDPR make express provision for such exemptions, including article 23(1)(e), which enables restrictions to be placed on certain rights of data subjects. Given the extension of data subjects\u2019 rights under the GDPR, it is necessary to include in the Bill an explicit targeted but proportionate exemption in the immigration context.       The exemption would apply to the processing of personal data by the Home Office for the purposes of       \u201cthe maintenance of effective immigration control, or133;the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective immigration control\u201d.       It would also apply to other public authorities required or authorised to share information with the Department for either of those specific purposes.       Let me be clear on what paragraph 4 of schedule 2 does not do. It categorically does not set aside the whole of the GDPR for all processing of personal data for all immigration purposes. It makes it clear that the exemption applies only to certain GDPR articles. The articles that the exemption applies to are set out in paragraph 4(2) of schedule 2. They relate to various rights of data subjects provided for in chapter 3 of the GDPR, such as the rights to information and access to personal data, and to two of the data protection principles\u2014namely the first one, which relates to fair and transparent processes, and the purpose limitation, which is the second one.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        As I understand it, the derogations that are sought effectively remove the right to information in article 13; the right to information where data is obtained from a third party in article 14; the right of subjects\u2019 access in article 15; the right to erasure in article 17; the right to restriction of processing in article 18; the right to object in article 21(1); the principle of lawful, fair and transparent processing in article 5; the principle of purpose limitation in article 5(1)(b); and the data protection principles in article 5 of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, confidentiality and accountability to the extent that they correspond to the rights above. That is a pretty broad set of rights to be cast out.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        Those are not the data protection principles. If one continues to read on to paragraph 4(2)(b) of schedule 2, it sets out the two data protection principles that I have just highlighted. The provisions set out in sub-paragraph (2)(a) relate to the data protection principles of fair and transparent processing and the purpose limitation. As I say, this is not a permanent removal. This is, as we describe it, a pause. There is not a free hand to invoke the permitted exception as a matter of routine.226;128;\ufffd       All of the data protection principles, including those relating to data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation and integrity and confidentiality, will continue to apply to everyone. So, too, will all the obligations on data controllers and processors, all the safeguards around cross-border transfers, and all the oversight and enforcement powers of the Information Commissioner. The latter is particularly relevant here, as it is open to any data subject affected by the provisions in paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner that the commissioner is then under a duty to investigate. Again, I hope that that addresses some of the concerns that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute raised.       Contrary to the impression that has perhaps been given or understood, paragraph 4 does not give the Home Office a free hand to invoke the permitted exceptions as a matter of routine. The Bill is clear that the exceptions may be applied only to the extent that the application of the rights of data subjects, or the two relevant data protection principles, would be likely to prejudice       \u201cthe maintenance of effective immigration control, or133;the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective immigration control\u201d.       That is an important caveat.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        The Minister will know that in paragraph 2(1)(a) we already have a set of exemptions that relate to the prevention or detection of a crime, including, presumably, all of the crimes that fall into the bucket of organising or perpetrating illegal immigration. Despite constant pressing during the debate in the other place and here, we have not yet had a clear answer as to why additional powers and exemptions are needed, over and above the powers expressly granted and agreed in paragraph 2(1)(a).                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for raising that issue, because it allows me to get to the nub of how we approach the immigration system. We do not see the immigration system as some form of criminality or as only being open to the principles of criminal law. He will know that we deal with immigration in both the civil law and criminal law contexts. The exemption he has raised in terms of paragraph 2 of the schedule deals with the criminal law context, but we must also address those instances where the matter is perhaps for civil law.       We know that in the vast majority of immigration cases, people are dealt with through immigration tribunals or through civil law. They are not dealt with through criminal law. That is the point; we must please keep open the ability to deal with people through the civil law system, rather than rushing immediately to criminalise them. If, for example, they have overstayed, sometimes it is appropriate for the criminal law to become involved, but a great number of times it is for the civil law to be applied to deal with that person\u2019s case either by way of civil penalty or by finding an arrangement whereby they can be given discretion to leave or the right to remain. We have the exemption in paragraph 4 so that we do not just focus on the criminal aspects that there may be in some immigration cases. We must ensure that we also focus on the much wider and much more widely used civil law context.       It is important to recognise that the exemptions will not and cannot be targeted at whole classes of vulnerable individuals, be they victims of domestic abuse or human 226;128;\ufffdtrafficking, undocumented children or asylum seekers. The enhanced data rights afforded by the GDPR will benefit all those who are here lawfully in the United Kingdom, including EU citizens. The relevant rights will be restricted only on a case-by-case basis where there is evidence that the prejudice I have mentioned is likely to occur.                    Peter Heaton-Jones (North Devon) (Con)           Share this contribution        The Minister specifically mentioned EU citizens. There have been concerns that the exemption will impact those EU nationals who are already here and who, as we have already heard, are contributing hugely to the UK. Can she assure us that the exemption is not targeted at them?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        Absolutely. The exemption will not be enacted on the basis of nationality. It is enacted on a case-by-case basis to uphold the integrity of the immigration system. There will be no question of EU nationals being in any way targeted by it. Indeed, we know the great effect that EU nationals and other people from other countries have had in this country, and we certainly would not be looking to target them on the basis of nationality.                    Darren Jones           Share this contribution        Is it not right to say that EU citizens will be part of the immigration system? They will be immigrants with immigration rights as part of the Brexit process. These rules could therefore apply to them, could they not? Secondly\u2014                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I will answer the first one\u2014yes. The hon. Gentleman asked whether EU citizens would be targeted. Once we leave the European Union, we will have our own immigration policy. There will clearly be no distinction between EU and non-EU, because everyone will be outside of the UK, if I may put it that way, very inelegantly.                    Darren Jones           Share this contribution        But they would still be subject to the right to exempt them from their data protection rights. I welcome the Minister\u2019s comments on the time-limited nature of the intention of using the rules, but can she point me to the section of the Bill that defines that time limit, because I am struggling to find it?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        If I may, I will come back to that point in a moment. In the case of subject access requests, each request would need to be considered on its own merits. For example, we could not limit the information given to visa applicants on how their personal data would be processed as part of that application. Rather, the restrictions would be applied only where there was a real likelihood of prejudice to immigration controls as a result of disclosing the information concerned.              4.00 pm    It is equally important to shed light on another concern that has been voiced. Some of the briefing that has been circulated suggests that the Bill creates new information sharing gateways. That is simply not the case. As I have indicated, schedule 2 sets out certain exceptions from GDPR. It does not of itself create new powers to share data between data controllers. However, where personal data is shared between controllers for the limited immigration purposes specified in 226;128;\ufffdparagraph 4, it means that the data subject does not need to be notified, if to do so would be prejudicial to the maintenance of effective immigration control.  It may assist the Committee if I explain the kind of information that it may be necessary to withhold from data subjects. The classes of information that the Home Office may wish to withhold include a description of the data held, our data sources, the purposes for which that data is being processed, and the details of the recipients to whom the data has been disclosed. There will be circumstances in which the disclosure to a data subject of such information could afford him or her the opportunity to circumvent our immigration controls. A couple of examples will serve to illustrate where the disclosure of such information may have precisely that adverse effect.  In the case of a suspected overstayer, if we had to disclose, in response to a subject access request, what we are doing to track their whereabouts with a view to effecting administrative removal\u2014that is the difference from the paragraph 2 point that the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill highlighted\u2014evidently, that would tip them off, and thus undermine such enforcement action.            Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        If someone has overstayed, they have committed a crime. Therefore, paragraph 2(1)(a) absolutely bites. We are seeking to prevent that crime. Someone who has overstayed their visa has committed a crime. It is kind of as simple as that.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        In that scenario, we may well effect their removal administratively. It does not mean that it is going through the criminal courts.       By way of a second example, take a case where the Home Office is considering an application for an extension of leave to remain in the UK. It may be that we have evidence that the applicant has provided false information to support his or her claim. In such cases, we may need to contact third parties to substantiate the veracity of the information provided in support of the application. If we are then obliged to inform the claimant that we are taking such steps, they may abscond and evade detection.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        If someone has submitted false information in support of an application to the Government, and signed it, as they must, that is called fraud. That is also a crime, and is covered by paragraph 2(1)(a).                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I take the right hon. Gentleman\u2019s point, particularly in relation to the overstayer, but as the purpose of processing personal data in many immigration areas is not generally the pursuit of criminal enforcement action, it is not clear that it would be appropriate in all cases to rely on crime-related exemptions, where the real prejudice lies in our ability to take administrative enforcement action. It may well be that in some cases a crime has been committed, but that will not always be the case.       Criminal sanctions are not always the correct and proportionate response to people who are in the UK without lawful authority. It is often better to use administrative means to remove such a person and prevent re-entry, rather than to deploy the fully panoply of the criminal justice system, which is designed to rehabilitate members of our communities. As the purpose 226;128;\ufffdof processing personal data in such cases is not generally the pursuit of a prosecution, it is not clear that we could, in all cases, rely on that exemption relating to crime.                    Stuart C. McDonald           Share this contribution        So far we have had some hypothetical examples about what might happen in the future, but given that we have a data protection regime in place already, it would be useful to know whether the Minister can give us examples of situations that have arisen in which the Home Office has been hindered by the current data protection regime. We have not heard anything like that so far.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        If I may, I will continue with my speech, because I have more information to give. Perhaps at the end I can deal with the hon. Gentleman\u2019s point.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I just want to dissolve one confusion in the Minister\u2019s remarks. The nature of the Home Office response, whether it is a prosecution through a civil court, a civil sanction or a civil whatever else, does not affect the nature of the offence that is committed. The Home Office has a range of sanctions and choices in responding to an offence, but that does not stop the offence being an offence. The offence is still a crime, and is therefore covered by paragraph 2(1)(a).                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        The right hon. Gentleman is assuming that each and every immigration case that will be covered by these provisions necessitates the commission of a crime.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        We are preventing crime.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I would not make that assumption. The vast majority of immigration cases are dealt with in a civil context.                    Darren Jones           Share this contribution        Will the Minister give way?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        No, forgive me. I have been very generous with interventions. I am going to make some progress, and then no doubt others will intervene on me in due course.       I turn to the charge that the exemption has no basis in EU law. Article 23 of the GDPR allows member states to restrict the application of certain provisions of the regulation to safeguard important objectives of general public interest. Immigration control constitutes one such objective. We see immigration as an important matter of public interest, and the GDPR allows member states to exempt rights where that is the case. We are not alone in our belief that immigration is an important matter of general public interest. The Irish Government clearly stated that in their own Data Protection Bill. Clause 54 of the Irish Bill gives powers to make regulations restricting certain rights and obligations under the GDPR to safeguard important objectives of general public interest. The list of such objectives in the Bill includes matter relating to immigration.       Opposition Members have talked about their concerns about the fact that these provisions may be covered by paragraph 2 of the schedule. I want to reflect on the outcome of the debate on this provision in the House of Lords, which contains many noble Lords who are extremely 226;128;\ufffdlearned in the law, have much experience of campaigning on immigration rights and so on. We listened very carefully to the concerns raised at Lords Committee stage, and as a result the Government tabled amendments at Lords Report stage to narrow the scope of the exemption so that it no longer covers the right to rectification and data portability. In response to those amendments, Lord Kennedy of Southwark said:       \u201cThe amendments tabled by the Government provide important clarification on what is exempt, limit the power in Bill and seek to address the concerns highlighted during the previous debate and today133;I am happy to support their amendments.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 December 2017; Vol. 787, c. 1590.]       Furthermore, in a Division on a Liberal Democrat amendment to strike out the immigration exemption, the official Opposition abstained. I wonder what has changed between their abstaining on that amendment and accepting that the Government\u2019s amendments were sufficient, and today. Nothing has changed since the Bill left the Lords, so perhaps the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill can help us with why their position has changed.       I hope I have been able to satisfy the Committee that this provision is necessary and important.                    Gareth Snell (Stoke-on-Trent Central) (Lab/Co-op)           Share this contribution        It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hanson. Will the Minister give a tangible example, as she has done in other cases, of where an immigration case may require exemption under paragraph 4\u2014in other words, a case in which a crime has not been committed and therefore would not be covered under paragraph 2(2)? The cases she has mentioned so far would, on the face of it, be covered by paragraph 2(2), because a criminal act had taken place or was about to take place.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        There may be occasions when there is a person we have lost track of whose status is irregular. If we know they have a child, we will seek from the Department for Education assistance to find the whereabouts of the child. That child has not committed a criminal offence, so I would be very concerned to ensure that the Home Office, Border Force or whoever else acted lawfully when seeking that data in order to enable them to find the parent or whoever is the responsible adult, as part of the immigration system.                    Louise Haigh           Share this contribution        In that example, would the exemption not be covered under the safeguarding exemption, as brought by the Government amendment to schedule 1?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        I have to say, that had not occurred to me as an obvious\u2014                    Louise Haigh           Share this contribution        A missing child?                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        No\u2014the child is not missing, but the parent is; so we seek advice from the Department for Education about where the child is. It may be that cleverer lawyers than me in the Home Office will find an exemption for that, but the point of this exemption of paragraph 4 is to cover the lawfulness of the Home Office in seeking such information in order to find parents or responsible adults who may have responsibility, and either to regularise their stay or to remove them.       I encourage the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill to withdraw his amendment, as we believe that it is not the wholesale disapplication of data subjects\u2019 226;128;\ufffdrights, and it is a targeted provision wholly in accordance with the discretion afforded to member states by the GDPR and is vital to maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of our immigration system.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        Anyone who was not alarmed by this provision certainly will leave this Committee Room thoroughly alarmed by the Minister\u2019s explanations.       First, we were invited to believe that we could safeguard due process and the rights of newcomers to this country by suspending those rights and pursuing people through civil court. We were then asked to believe that the Home Office\u2019s ambition to deal with these cases with civil response rendered inoperable the powers set out in paragraph 2(1)(a), confusing the response from the Home Office and the nature of the offence committed up front. Then, we were invited to believe that this was not a permanent provision\u2014even though that safeguard is not written into the Bill\u2014but a temporary provision. What is not clear is when those temporary provisions would be activated and, crucially, when they would be suspended.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        rose\u2014                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am happy to give way in a moment. Most of us here who have done our fair share of immigration cases\u2014I have done several thousand over the last 14 years\u2014know that on some occasions, the Home Office interpretation of time is somewhat different from a broadly understood interpretation of time. I have cases in which a judge has ordered the issue of a visa, and six months later we are still chasing the Home Office for the issue of the visa. I will not be alone in offering these examples.       Perhaps when the Minister intervenes, she could set out what \u201ctemporary\u201d means, where it is defined and where are the limits, and she still has not answered my question whether she will guarantee that the implementation of this pause will not jeopardise someone\u2019s ability to submit either a request for an entry clearance officer review or an appeal within the legally binding time windows set out in Home Office regulations.                    Victoria Atkins           Share this contribution        The key to this is the purpose for which we are processing the data. Even if there are criminal sanctions, that does not mean that we are processing for that purpose, particularly where we are not likely to pursue a prosecution. The primary purpose is often immigration control\u2014that does not fit under paragraph 2 as he has described it\u2014rather than enforcing the criminal justice system. That is the point. It is for the purpose of processing the data. The crime-related provisions in the Bill refer to the importance of identifying the purposes of the processing. Where the primary purpose is immigration related, it is not clear that we could rely on the crime-related exemptions. That is why paragraph 4 is in the schedule.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am really sorry to have to say this, but that is utter nonsense. The idea that the Home Office will seek to regularise someone\u2019s immigration status by denying them access to information that might support their case is, frankly, fanciful.       This is not a new debate; we last had it in 1983. The Home Office tried to sketch this exemption into legislation then, it failed, and we should not allow the exemption 226;128;\ufffdto go into the Bill, especially given that all the explanations we have heard this afternoon are about cases where paragraph 2(1)(a), or the safeguarding provisions drafted by the Government, would provide the necessary exemptions and safeguards in the contingencies that the Minister is concerned about.              4.15 pm      Darren Jones           Share this contribution        I feel for the Under-Secretary, because she is on a bit of a sticky wicket given the Government\u2019s drafting, but does my right hon. Friend agree that it is concerning that I asked twice to be pointed to specifics\u2014I asked first how the pause is drafted in the Bill, and secondly where the word \u201cimmigration\u201d appears under article 23 of the GDPR\u2014but on neither occasion was I was pointed to them? We ought also to draw the Committee\u2019s attention to the report on the Bill by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which states:       \u201cThe GDPR does not expressly provide for immigration control as a legitimate ground for exemption.\u201d                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        My hon.

The wording is in line 35 of paragraph 4:       \u201cto the extent that the application of those provisions would be likely to prejudice any of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b).\u201d       To reassure the hon. Member for Bristol North West, that is the end point.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for clarifying a point that was not at issue. No one is concerned about what rights kick back in at the end of a process. We are worried about how long the process will last, who will govern it, what rights newcomers to this country or courts will have to enforce some kind of constraint on the process and how we will stop the Home Office embarking on unending processes in a Jarndyce v. Jarndyce-like way, which we know is the way these cases are sometimes prosecuted. The Home Office is full of some of the most amazing civil servants on earth, but perhaps, a little like the Under-Secretary, they are sometimes good people trapped in bad systems and, dare I say it, bad arguments.

Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I beg to move amendment 170, in schedule 2, page 151, line 8, at end insert\u2014       \u201c(f) in Chapter IX of the GDPR (provisions relating to specific processing situations), Article 89(1) (safeguards and derogations relating to processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes).\u201d       This amendment adds the restrictions imposed on archiving by the GDPR and the Bill to the list of matters in the Bill that benefit from the Journalism, Art and Literature exemption.       The purpose of this amendment is to protect some of our important national archives. We in this country are some of the greatest collectors on earth; the tradition established by Sir Hans Sloane all those centuries ago inspired many generations that followed him. Our ability and our tradition of collecting mean that this country is now home to some of the greatest collections on the planet.       It is fantastic to see many of these institutions now rapidly digitalising those archives. I was privileged to be able to visit the Natural History Museum recently, which I think is home to something like 83 million different specimens. It is now beginning to digitalise those archives in a way that opens them up not only to our schoolchildren, but to citizens of this country and those around the world who are keen on science.       The point of this amendment is that we cannot simply preserve those archives in aspic. They must be dynamic resources; they must be added to, and our success or failure in that task has a crucial bearing on the health of our democracy and our ability to, dare I say it, reflect on past mistakes and do better. I think it was the legendary Karl Popper who once said, \u201cTo err is human, to correct divine.\u201d       We make mistakes. It is important that we reflect on the mistakes we have made in the past, in order to do better next time around. Many of the more contemporary archives, particularly news archives, have had a crucial bearing on inquiries into historical child abuse, the injustices perpetrated at Hillsborough and at Orgreave, 226;128;\ufffdand HIV-contaminated blood. All those inquiries relied on records that were not necessarily historical; many were contemporary.       A range of crucial organisations entrusted with the delicate task of keeping our archives up to date are seriously worried about the provisions in the GDPR. In fact, they believe the inadequacy of the derogations and exemptions in the GDPR, as it is proposed that we draft it into law, means that they will be quickly put out of business. In particular, that will bite on thousands of smaller archives.       The point they have consistently made to us is that, although we have such great collections and archives in this country and a public interest culture around protecting some of those archives, we do not have any of the kind of legal protections that they enjoy in countries such as France. We do not have the defendable protections around archives that those abroad benefit from.       The challenge in this Bill is a lack of precision. I do not want to pretend that this is a black-and-white case. Sometimes news archives in particular will be required to draw something of a grey line, and I am afraid the Minister has to earn her pay and be the one to decide where to draw that grey line. Sometimes there will be information stored in those archives that absolutely should be subject to the GDPR provisions. But if we are in effect granting a carte blanche for people to make requests of archives that require those archives to dip deep into the historical record, correct things and go through challenging processes to ensure they are right, I am afraid it will put a number of our archives out of business, and that will damage the health of our democracy.       We have drafted this amendment with a number of aims. We want to try to create a statutory definition for organisations that archive in the public interest. We have had a first attempt at drawing that in a narrow way, so it does not infringe on material that is stored that absolutely should be subject to general GDPR provisions. We have done our best to ensure that the archiving exemptions are proportionate to the public interest nature of the material being archived. We wanted to offer an amendment worded hopefully in such a way that, frankly, it excludes Google, Facebook and others from enjoying the exemptions sought here.       This is the first place in the Bill where the debate rears its head. I am grateful to the range of museums, archives and the BBC that have helped us to craft this amendment. It should not be particularly controversial. There should be agreement across the Committee on the need to protect our great collections, yet keep some companies, such as Google and Facebook, subject to the provisions in the Bill.       We offer the amendment as a starter for 10. Obviously, we would be delighted if the Government accepted it; we would be even more pleased if they could perfect it.                    The Chair           Share this contribution        I have just had a request to remove jackets, because of the warm temperature in the room. I give my permission to do so. I call the Minister.                    Margot James           Share this contribution        Thank you, Mr Hanson. I agree with the tribute paid by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill to the custodians of some of the most wonderful archives in the world. I will comment on his proposals with regard to such archives shortly, but I hope that recent debates have left no doubt in 226;128;\ufffdhon. Members\u2019 minds that the Government are absolutely committed to preserving the freedom of the press, and maintaining the balance between privacy and freedom of expression in our existing law, which has served us well for so many years.       As set out in the Bill, media organisations can already process data for journalistic purposes, which includes media archiving. As such, we believe that amendment 170 is unnecessary and could be unhelpful. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it is crucial that the media can process data and maintain media archives. In the House of Lords, my noble Friend Lord Black of Brentwood explained very well the value of media archives. He said:       \u201cThose records are not just the \u2018first draft of history\u2019; they often now comprise the only record of significant events, which will be essential to historians and others in future, and they must be protected.\u201d\u2014[Official Report, House of Lords, 10 October 2017; Vol. 785, c. 175.]       However, recital 153 indicates that processing for special purposes includes news archiving and press libraries. Paragraph 24 of schedule 2 sets out the range of derogations that apply to processing for journalistic purposes. That includes, for example, exemption from complying with requests for the right to be forgotten. That means that where the exemption applies, data subjects would not have grounds to request that data about them be deleted. It is irrelevant whether the data causes substantial damage or distress.       However, if media organisations are archiving data for other purposes\u2014for example, in connection with subscriber data\u2014it is only right that they are subjected to the safeguards set out in article 89(1), and the Bill provides for that accordingly. For that reason, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman agrees to reconsider his approach and withdraw his amendment.                    Liam Byrne           Share this contribution        I am happy to withdraw the amendment, although I would say to the Minister that the helpful words we have heard this afternoon will not go far enough to satisfy the objections that we heard from organisations. We reserve the right to come back to this matter on Report. We will obviously consult the organisations that helped us to draft the amendment, and I urge her to do the same. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.       Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.       Schedule 2, as amended, agreed to.
