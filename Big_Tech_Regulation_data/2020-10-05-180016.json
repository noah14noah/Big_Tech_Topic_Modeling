But the playful news hoaxes of yesteryear, while undoubtedly fooling many, were relatively harmless.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The same cannot be said of the deliberate, systematic disinformation that masquerades as news today - where a leaked email about <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>can quickly escalate into a bizarre (and false) conspiracy about a child sex ring operating out of the basement <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-05/fake-news-story-led-man-to-shoot-inside-pizza-shop:-police/8094310\">of a Washington pizzeria</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But solving the puzzle of fake news has to begin with acknowledging our complicity in proliferating stories that are false.</p><p>In all likelihood, most of us have shared content with friends that we have not read or properly scrutinised.</p><p>Confirmation bias, a tendency to believe something is true just because it accords with our personal values, can lead to a suspension of our scepticism.</p><p>Furthermore, Facebook's \"filter bubble\" algorithm means information that reinforces, rather than challenges, our existing beliefs is what fills our news feeds. And we enthusiastically pass it on.</p><p>It's not just Trump's supporters</p><p>During the US presidential election campaign a <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>quote, purportedly sourced from a 1998 People magazine interview, was omnipresent in social media news feeds.</p><p>\"If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.\"</p><p>The quote, it turns out, is a fabrication. But it's still hanging around online, despite being fake news.</p><p>Andy Carvin, who made his reputation tweeting breaking news during the Arab Spring, says he continues to meet journalists who believe the quote is real.</p><p>One message seems to be: beware of your own biases.</p><p>Carvin spoke last week at a public forum organised by the ABC, the University of Technology and the US not-for-profit First Draft News, which works on issues of truth and trust in the digital age.</p><p>Can we leave it to Facebook to fix?</p><p>With big tech companies now assuming the role as the gatekeepers of news, Facebook's chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has come under pressure.</p><p>\"<person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>got a bit of shock when he wrote that post a week after the election saying: 'We didn't have any impact, fake news didn't have an impact,'\" says Claire Wardle, the director of research and strategy at First Draft News.</p><p>\"Very quickly, about a week later, he was like: 'Maybe it had an impact.' And a week later, it's like: 'OK, it had an impact and here's all the things we're doing.'</p><p>\"He's definitely on a journey.\"</p><p>But so far, the big technology companies are struggling to develop a technological fix to eradicate, or at least limit, the presence of fake news on their platforms.</p><p>Is regulation the answer?</p><p>The New York Times's Malachy Browne, a pioneer of investigative reporting via eyewitness media and community engagement, says broadcasters evolved in a legal framework where they had to subscribe to certain rules and standards.</p><p>\"The same thing doesn't apply to the social networks.

Not everything is black and white.\"</p><p>In practical terms, then, how do platforms like Facebook become arbiters of the truth, especially given the vast amount of information they host, across a variety of languages, countries and jurisdictions?</p><p>Wardle has some sympathy for Facebook. They are, she says, \"taking the fake news challenge seriously\". But the task is immense.</p><p>\"It's hard for us to imagine the scale,\" she says.</p><p>\"People get angry. 'You should say you're a media organisation!' And they say they're a tech platform. They're actually a hybrid. We've never had one of these things before.\"</p><p>What about journalists?</p><p>The surge in social media driven news dissemination has paralleled a decline in public trust in mainstream news institutions and journalists.</p><p>We are now more likely to trust our friends rather than institutions, says Kim Bui, editor-at-large with NowThis news.</p><p>\"A recent research study found [that] people trust - not organisations - but they trust people who share,\" she says. \"I can share something false and people will trust it because it's from me, and they trust me.\"</p><p>(Bui hastens to point out the news she shares is, in fact, true.)</p><p>But if consumers of news are vesting more trust in individuals and friends, while losing faith in institutional media gatekeepers, then it's incumbent on all of us who share content to be worthy of that trust.</p><p>And according to Carvin, the role of journalists needs to change.</p><p>\"Our role as journalists needs to take seriously the idea that we teach people the media literacy skills so they become good bullshit detectors in their own right,\" he says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-8390236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N63-4F41-JCM0-6363-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><timeReceived>4:14 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 27, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Facebook however continues to allow its clients to serve political ads, with no fact-checking, to selected groups of its nearly 3bn users, based on characteristics ranging from their postcode to their political leanings.</p><p>The company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, initially dismissed as \u201ccrazy\u201d the idea that fake news had any bearing on the 2016 election. But then evidence came to light of co-ordinated interference, spearheaded by a Kremlin-backed outfit called the Internet Research Agency, which created fake accounts and pages on social media, and targeted disinformation or provocative material at people using keywords like \u201cpatriotism\u2019\u2019. While it spent a mere $100,000 on Facebook advertising, its ads reached 11.4m Americans, according to data shared by Facebook with Congress.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s security chief at the time, Alex Stamos, acknowledged that the ads, about a quarter of which were geographically targeted, \u201cappeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum\u201d.</p><p>Some marketing experts question whether Facebook has disclosed all the information it has on these Russian campaigns. They note that the click through rates for some of the Russian adverts \u2014 the proportion of people who go on to click on advertisements \u2014 were far higher than the industry average: sometimes as much as 10 per cent versus an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/28/facebook-advertising-benchmarks\"> average click-through rate of 0.9 per cent</url> for Facebook adverts across all industries, according to search marketing group Wordstream. </p><p>Some say the explanation could lie in microtargeting.</p><p>\u201cThe reported click-through rate is inconsistent with the general broad advertising targeting information which Facebook shared with Congress,\u201d argued an online marketing executive who declined to be identified. \u201cThis apparent disconnect between the ads\u2019 high impact and their low cost suggests a much higher degree of targeting than previously disclosed.\u201d</p><p>Such critics ask whether Russian trolls had access to electorally sensitive US voter data, and targeted Americans using Facebook\u2019s custom audiences tool which targets groups of individuals specified by the advertiser.</p><p>Facebook admits that the now notorious British analytics group Cambridge Analytica, wielding the data of 87m Facebook users it bought from researchers, did use the custom audiences tool in its work for the Trump campaign in 2016. Separately, information was stolen from Democratic party and Clinton campaign servers by <url normalizedValue=\"https://fsi-live.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/potemkin-pages-personas-sio-wp.pdf\"> Russian military intelligence</url>. </p><p>Damian Collins, until December 2019 head of the UK parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, has questioned whether the Cambridge Analytica data made its way into the hands of the Russia disinformation operations, which might explain the high click through rate. </p><p>\u201cIt is possible that the Russians had the [Cambridge Analytica] data set,\u201d says Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who is now a vocal critic of the company and called the data the \u201cbest custom audience ever created for politics\u201d. Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie said he believed Russian intelligence did have access to the data.</p><p>\u201cIn order to swing an election you don\u2019t need to blanket the entire country with Facebook ads the way, for example, Mike Bloomberg [the billionaire candidate for the Democratic nomination] is currently doing,\u201d says the online marketing executive. \u201cCombining granular data \u2026with Facebook\u2019s microtargeting capabilities, you could target a relatively small number of households in the key counties that make all of the difference.\u201d</p><p>But Facebook denies that the Russian campaigns brought their own data set for targeting. </p><p>Asked by the Financial Times whether Facebook would allow a third party to look at the targeting instructions for the Internet Research Agency\u2019s adverts, a spokesperson refused, saying the company had \u201cturned over what we have\u201d to Congress. </p><p>Targeting instructions are kept on Facebook servers in perpetuity for all advertising clients, with third party inspection rights granted to the likes of ad agencies and others involved in an advertising campaign.</p><p>Either way, critics are still sceptical. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that Facebook shared all the information they had around data and political advertising in that period of time,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive officer of Digital Content Next, a US trade association for online publishers, referring to the Internet Research Agency and related activities beyond paid advertising.</p><p>The key, argued the marketing executive, is for regulators to insist on verification and disclosure rather than try to limit rapidly evolving technologies, a task for which they are \u201cill-equipped\u201d: \u201cIf Facebook is unwilling to take a basic step like providing inspection access to the Russian accounts, what would they be doing? Protecting the privacy rights of the Russian operatives?\u201d</p><p>On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Commission, seen by many in the US as a more potent regulator of Big Tech, said Facebook\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d of algorithms used in political advertising should be opened up to researchers and other third parties. </p><p>\u201cThere should be the possibility to check how the algorithms are designed and how they work and the people should have control over that,\u201d said the Czech commissioner, adding she \u201chad nothing against\u201d microtargeting as \u201ca fantastic instrument to sell more goods to consumers\u201d.</p><p>The EU\u2019s executive body would even consider asking to inspect targeting instructions kept on Facebook servers for all campaigns if foul play were suspected, an EU official said, adding that regulators are keen to discover information wherever it might be stored. </p><p>\u201cThe algorithmic amplification of outrage and fear, and microtargeting\u2026the combination of those two things allows for manipulation of attention, but also choices,\u201d said Mr McNamee.</p><p>Facebook says its decision is not financial; political advertising will account for just 0.5 per cent of its sales this year, or $400m, according to Mr Zuckerberg, who came <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/20/facebook-republican-shift/\"> under pressure from the campaign to re-elect Donald Trump</url> not to drop a service the US president credits with aiding his 2016 victory. </p><p>Proponents argue microtargeting is a vital tool for allowing campaigns, big or small, to reach their audiences. \u201cIt\u2019s a key tactic and most political campaigns\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009spend a lot of time and money building up their in-house email list of supporters and donors and volunteers, and that\u2019s a hugely valuable asset,\u201d said Grace Briscoe, vice-president of ad-tech platform Centro\u2019s candidates and causes group. \u201cWithout that ability to target the sort of \u2018potential\u2019 and \u2018somewhat likely\u2019 support, if you have to blanket the entire market, you might have to spend twice as much to reach the people who want to.\u201d </p><p>Others remain unconvinced. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how microtargeting is largely being justified on grounds that it\u2019s \u201ccost-effective\u201d, retorts Ellen Weintraub, chair of the US Federal Election Commission. \u201cYou know what else is cost-effective? Child labor. Dumping sewage into rivers. Fraud.\u201d In a recent Twitter post, she added: \u201cI strongly urge Facebook to go back to the drawing boards and come back with something much more robust. This will not do.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-87651b8ae9e311e9aefba946d2463e4b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9D-MSC1-DXP9-937N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1364\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The oldest of these companies, Apple, was founded in 1976, and just a decade ago all four were seen as scrappy-if fast-growing-outsiders. Today, even after Apple's recent market travils, they are four of the biggest companies on the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Any set of companies growing so big this rapidly would be cause for concern. But in the case of the technology giants, \"concern\" doesn't quite cut it. Facebook is the biggest platform on the planet, and has been implicated in efforts from Russia and others to poison the online information ecosystem. Retailers and suppliers alike fear Amazon's market power, while Google's dominance of search feels all but unassailable-and Apple has shown its ability to flex its power over app and music markets, not just the mobile phone market it most obviously plays in.</p><p>No surprise, then, that columnists, campaigners and multiple parliaments around the world have floated the idea that the tech giants need to be broken up. But what might that look like? And is it even the right answer? We might, I'd suggest, do better to focus on something even bigger than the scale of these companies themselves. Namely, the unimaginably vast scale of the data-terabytes and terabytes of it-on which the foundation of each of these empires is built. This is data about us, our lives, our interests, our locations, and our connections. And it is the single thing we need to keep in mind if we want to come up with a practical plan to keep the tech giants' power in check.</p><p>The internet poses the biggest threat of monopoly in over a century, since the height of the Gilded Age. That period, from the 1870s to the early 1900s, was born on the back of the railways, a technological innovation that was not only at risk of monopoly itself, but which also created monopolies. By speeding up, and making vastly more efficient, the transportation of materials-in much the same way that the web has facilitated the dissemination of information-the railway economy hugely increased the potential for profit. And with the ability to offer different carriage fees to different companies, rail companies could directly help to build monopolies in steel, coal and other industries.</p><p>These revolutionary changes encouraged concentration in all sorts of markets, but along with the growth of new industrial giants and riches to match came a new suspicion of big business. Congress passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act in 1890, other legislation would follow in the early 20th century, together with President Teddy Roosevelt's pose as a trust buster-using competition laws to bring to heel, and sometimes break up, the outsized corporations.</p><p>There are indeed many parallels in relation to the problems we face with the internet: not only do we need to be worried about who controls the network itself, but how the technological changes reward scale and, increasingly, reward incumbents too.</p><p>Break them up</p><p>Given their scale and dominance, you can understand the urge to tame the giants by breaking them up. That is not impossible. At the simplest level, almost all of the biggest tech companies could be split, either by operating division, or by spinning off the various companies they have each been buying up. Part of the motivation for such purchases could be seen as anti-competitive. Today's tech giants try to avoid being toppled by the sort of smaller disruptors that they once were, not so long ago. In many ways these companies are now often structured like classic conglomerates, essentially collections of loosely connected businesses owned by the same holding company.</p><p>In 2015, Google all but made this official in its case, creating a new holding company-Alphabet-separating out its core business from its long-shot and long-term businesses. The additional interests of the parent range across the field of innovation from AI to driverless cars. Google itself still contains a search engine, an advertising network, a video network (YouTube) and more. There is no theoretical reason many of these couldn't be separated, even if it would be fiendishly complicated due to their tightly-integrated systems.</p><p>Similarly, Facebook could sell or spin-off Instagram and WhatsApp-a huge photo-led social network and messaging service, respectively-and this would, on paper at least, cause a real reduction in its market power. This would also prove fairly viable: in practice, engineers who have worked at the company have said-at least at the time-that the various systems remain quite separate, meaning it would not be impossibly complex to separate the companies.</p><p>This might restore competition to the social and messaging sectors, but breaking peripheral limbs off a giant will generally leave its core untouched. It would, for example, do nothing to address the scale of the main Facebook service itself. Going for the core with this particular giant might mean breaking Facebook into, say, four networks of 500m people instead of one network of two billion. But that's not a workable idea: if you get sent to one and your friends are scattered across the other three, you'll soon have a far less usable product-and an inevitable backlash.</p><p>There are still some roles and functions within Facebook proper that might be split off-you could, for example, separate out its event planning feature into a standalone app or company. Likewise, one could-in theory-separate, say, Google's video or new search functions from searches of other types. But even here there will be some loss of utility for the users, and other practical problems: would we really want to say that no advertising company could also operate internet video, and that no social network could help you plan events? And would we attempt to impose general rules, which presumably selectively bite on the best-designed sites and networks that attract the most users, or would we apply these rules as a one-off on today's giants? Wouldn't that be a</p><p>bit arbitrary?</p><p>This fear of unintended consequences alarms Jeff Jarvis, an open internet advocate and the director of the Tow-Knight Centre for Entrepreneurial Journalism at City University, New York. Advertising is intrinsic to an internet that's open to everyone, he argues. \"Separating Google's services from its advertising business makes no sense, for then there'd be no support for all the wonderful, free services we enjoy-and there'd be less of a motive for Google to offer them, gaining targeting data in the process.</p><p>\"Consumer revenue\"-or, in plainer parlance charging for services-then \"becomes the only option on the table and that means that the services will be redlined for the privileged. I fear building the internet for the 1 per cent.\" Jarvis also opposes splitting WhatsApp or Instagram from Facebook, as neither service generates nearly enough revenue to continue operating (Whats\u00adApp is entirely ad-free), meaning they effectively survive from Facebook's subsidy.</p><p>Whether or not you accept Jarvis's arguments, there is a significant hurdle to splitting big tech in practice: the law. The obvious available mechanism here would be competition law: if we could demonstrate that not only did the tech giants have unprecedented power and scale, but that they'd also been abusing that power, then there would be the prospect of forcing them to take action to remedy it.</p><p>In practice, there are only really two bodies strong enough to have a hope of making such a decision stick-the EU and the US, as they represent the only markets large enough that the companies couldn't simply withdraw to avoid the decision and scare off other countries from taking action.</p><p>Any hopes that the US will take tough regulatory action against big tech are slim: the companies have extensive lobbying operations, and are viewed in Washington as an extension of American power. There is another problem: US competition law has been vastly curtailed since the early days of the Sherman laws and trust-busting presidents, when excessive size was conceived as being almost inherently at odds with fair competition and the public interest. The libertarian Chicago School of Economics led a successful charge through the courts and the executive through the 1970s and 1980s, championing a much narrower definition of harm based solely on the interests of consumers, with any interests of competitors disregarded; everything turns on whether or not the company was charging customers higher prices than a competitive market would. It is a fiendishly difficult standard to prove. More pertinently, it just doesn't work for big tech. Who could argue Google is a monopoly under these terms, when it's free to email, to search, and to watch YouTube?</p><p>EU competition authorities have proven more aggressive: the EU Commission has launched several major actions against the technology companies, with attempts to impose multi-billion euro fines. In recent years, though, these have been tightly focused on specific aspects of the companies' activities. In June 2017, the Commission imposed a ??2.4bn fine on Google for promoting its own shopping comparison service in search results, while in July 2018 it levied ??4.3bn (against which Google is appealing) over how the company licences its Android mobile phone software. In September, it launched an inquiry into Amazon, which sells its own goods in its stores alongside third-party brands, investigating whether Amazon abuses its power to promote its own-brand goods. While the penalty numbers look large, these inquiries are limited and technocratic. For those suspicious of the giants, these limits are frustrating. But the Commission is just responding to the realities of the law.</p><p>According to Professor Ariel Ezrachi, director of the Oxford University Centre for Competition Law and Policy, competition law doesn't exist to punish companies for being big, but rather for acting improperly once they are. It's designed to force a change in their behaviour; not to make breaking big firms up an end in itself.</p><p>According to Ezrachi, competition authorities could only order a \"structural\" fix-such as breaking up a company-when they can absolutely prove that no other solution could work. In principle it would be possible to rewrite the law to focus more on size as a problem in itself, or to make breaking companies up a recourse of first, rather than last, resort. But companies get big for good as well as bad reasons-to run more efficiently, to innovate and develop expertise. That is true not just in tech, but across the economy as a whole. So we should be careful what we wish for. And if the law needs rewriting anyway, why use the old laws at all?</p><p>Regulate their data</p><p>If breaking up big tech is so legally fraught and risks unintended consequences-whether making some companies more profitable or making the internet worse for us to use-does that mean we have to accept its dominance?</p><p>Not necessarily, according to one expert: she says splitting up giants into more firms isn't thinking too big-it's thinking too small. \"I try not to get drawn on the question of \"~do we break them up?'\" says Julia Powles, a research fellow at NYU's Information Law Institute. \"Something much more substantial is required.\" Her proposal is that we learn how to think about these companies in a new way-and to tell a different story. What really makes the companies so big and so unassailable? It's the data that they hold.</p><p>Take Google. The reason it's almost impossible to compete with is not that it is big-its size alone doesn't preclude anyone else setting up a new search engine. Rather, it is that it has 20 years of data on what we search for and what we subsequently click. How could any would-be competitor acquire a trove of data so rich? In Facebook's case, the all-important asset is again the data it holds-on our social connections, messaging,</p><p>and more.</p><p>Though rarely thought of this way, big data is a close analogue of intellectual property. Society has a well-established set of rules for that, and they don't involve giving unlimited power to the property owner; instead they balance a range of competing interests, ideally in the way that best serves the overall public good. Yes, there are rewards for innovation-that is needed to provide a spur. But if someone designs a new drug that could save millions of lives, the patent they get for that innovation is time limited. Copyright eventually runs out.</p><p>As with words, inventions and ideas, data is what economists call \"non-rival in consumption\"-a resource which, in principle, one person or company can use without there being any of it less available for anyone else. But unlike words and ideas, the companies that own data own it forever, and it is barely regulated beyond some easily-dodged rules on privacy and security.</p><p>The patents that powered the great revolutions of the industrial past are now long expired, available for the whole world to use. We already know that big data is set to reshape sectors from health, to transport to energy and yet we currently have no plan to ensure that it can ever be put to use for general good. Instead, the firms who own big data can milk it for all it's worth-and stop others from doing the same.</p><p>Perhaps it is, as Powles explains, \"because we don't know how to value data, we have allowed these data monopolies to grow and we don't have a useful mechanism to deal with it.\" We can only ever touch the edges of this problem with competition laws that focus on consumer prices.</p><p>Then there are privacy rules-which are very important-but they are all about protecting the rights of the individual, and information held specifically on them, against the company or the state. That is an entirely different problem from ensuring that all the companies and individuals have access to the potential public good represented by the data in aggregate. And yet, as Powles explains, this really matters: \"The biggest asset for the world's biggest companies is data, and it has [virtually] no liabilities, no value at origin-but huge value once it's hoarded.\"</p><p>Big data, especially when mined by AI, is now solving all manner of practical problems that in the past might have had to await the spark of some brilliant human invention-even if it is also creating some new ones. We should approach it in the same spirit that we have shown towards human genius in the past. Its value should, in a carefully calibrated way, be shared around. This could be achieved by putting rules on how it can and (importantly) can't be passed on, likely including time limits on its exclusive use so that the first-mover in an industry need not be the only one.</p><p>There cannot be a free for all. There must be rewards for those with the ingenuity to build valuable stores of data in the first place, and-for privacy reasons-limits on access to specific information on individual people, and checks that data can't be de-anonymised. But beyond that, data regulation could look at making algorithms public, and finding ways of forcing the sharing of truly anonymised data after a period of years. There is precedent for this. Academic researchers are often granted access to medical or official records like tax, but in formats that safeguard the anonymity of the individuals involved. There is no reason in principle why this approach cannot be extended to data that is collected by big tech as opposed to the state.</p><p>Indeed, there are already some examples in the private sector for regulated data sharing to improve competition. UK banks must share data to enable personal finance apps, and to make moving current accounts easy (without this, you'd have to transfer all direct debits manually). A first step in regulating big tech could be doing this with our social media data, and our online presence-making it transferable by law.</p><p>In banking, this is done through open standards and public specifications on how data is held and stored. For social media, at minimum, Facebook could share details on how it stores user data, thus making it possible for a user to authorise transferring that data to a new start-up with one click. We could further require companies to share well-anonymised data after a certain period with academic and rival commercial researchers, to make it easier for new competitors to make use of it.</p><p>For any of this to work, it needs the support of the US government. Not likely, perhaps, under Donald Trump. But under a different administration, Washington might develop a more enlightened understanding of its own interests. The hegemony of the American giants won't last forever-indeed, one reason why Apple's stock nose-dived recently was concern about Chinese competition, both inside and outside the People's Republic. It is surely better for the US to set the right rules, while it is still holding the ring.</p><p>With creative and careful thinking, plus some legislative courage, many other steps could be taken. It can't come too soon. \"We need some sort of response,\" Powles concludes. \"We're in the total dark ages about data's true value and what we do about it.\"</p><p>First, however, we need to take a clear look at the real problem with big tech. Yes, the challenge the giants pose touches on the efficiency and fairness across our fast-changing economy-in that sense it is exactly the equivalent of the one faced by the trust busters of 100 years ago. And scale remains important. Beyond that, however, we shouldn't be bewitched by the parallels: new eras need new rules.</p><p>The thing to worry about this time around is less the scale of the companies per se, than the scale of the data they are hoarding. Regulation must find new ways to allow the wider community to tap this extraordinary asset. Changing circumstances require changing solutions-and, in our times, nothing is changing things faster than big data.</p><p>James Ball is an award-winning journalist with a special interest in tech</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSPEC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRSPEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCN-BVH1-JD7N-H010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2997\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Prospect Magazine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Prospect</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"43160\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 31, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Frompovich[1] I AM, INDEED, DR. ROBERT EPSTEIN. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU TO KNOW OF ME IS THAT I'M THE FATHER OF FIVE WONDERFUL CHILDREN. AS IT HAPPENS, I'M A RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST AT THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE BEEN CENTER, CENTER LEFT MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE. BUT I VALUE MY COUNTRY AND DEMOCRACY MORE THAN I VALUE ANY PARTY OR CANDIDATE. THAT IS WHY I'M SPEAKING OUT TODAY. I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN WHY GOOGLE POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, HOW MONITORING SYSTEMS CAN PROTECT US FROM COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE AND HOW CONGRESS CAN IMMEDIATELY END GOOGLE'S WORLDWIDE MONOPOLY ON SEARCH. MY PLAN FOR ENDING THAT MONOPOLY WAS PUBLISHED JUST YESTERDAY IN 'BUSINESS WEEK.' I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT MY ARTICLE BE ENTERED INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, IT'S ATTACHED TO MY FULL TESTIMONY.

Dr. Epstein's research work, since 1981, has been centered on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other topics. 'Some of my research has focused on Google; on the company's massive surveillance operations, censorship capabilities and unprecedented ability to manipulate the thinking of 2.5 billion people, soon to be 4+ billion.' [1]  [.] 'I reach out to diverse audiences, because I believe the threats posed by Google and to a lesser extent, Facebook are so serious that everyone needs to know about them.' [1] 'Here are just three disturbing findings from my research, which adheres to the very highest standards of scientific integrity: '1. In 2016, Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that shifted at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton, whom I supported. [.] [1] '2. On Election Day in 2018, the 'Go Vote' reminder that Google displayed on its homepage gave one political party, at least 800,000 more votes than it gave the other party. That reminder was not a public service. It was a vote manipulation. [1] '3. In the weeks leading up to the 2018 election, bias in Google search results may have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes, spread across many races to the candidates of one political party. This number is based on bias in data captured by my 2018 monitoring system, which preserved more than 47,000 election-related searches, conducted by a diverse group of American voters. [1] 'I know how to stop Big Tech in its tracks and that brings me briefly here to monitoring systems and the proposal I published yesterday. (i.e., To Break Google's Monopoly on Search, Make Its Index Public, The tech giant doesn't have to be dismantled. Sharing its crown jewel might reshape the internet. (2) [.] 'Back in 2015, a telephone call from Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, prompted me to start a years-long project in which I learned to monitor what Big Tech companies are showing real users. In early 2016, I launched my first large-scale, Neilsentype monitoring system that allowed my team to look over people's shoulders and, with user permission, to capture the search results they were seeing on their computer screens before those results disappeared (Epstein, 2018d). I successfully deployed such systems in 2016 and 2018, and I'm raising funds now to build a much larger and more comprehensive system in early 2020 - one that will allow us to catch Big Tech companies in the act - to instantly spot when Google is showing people politically biased search results; when Twitter is suppressing tweets sent by the President, Ann Coulter, or Elizabeth Warren; when Facebook is sending out 'Register to Vote' reminders only to members of one party. [1] 'This system must be built to keep an eye on Big Tech in 2020 because if these companies all support the same candidate - and that's likely, needless to say - they will be able to shift upwards of 15 million votes to that candidate with no one knowing and without leaving a paper trail. [1] 'To let Big Tech companies get away with invisible manipulation on this scale would be to abandon the free-and-fair election, a cornerstone of democracy. It would make democracy meaningless, even if your chosen candidate prevailed. A worldwide network of passive monitoring systems must be built to protect humanity and democracy from manipulations by today's Google and the Googles of tomorrow. Only tech can fight tech; laws and regulations will never keep up (Epstein, 2018d). [1] 'Finally, yesterday I published an article explaining how Congress can quickly end Google's worldwide monopoly on search (Epstein, 2019d). The solution to The Google Problem is to declare Google's massive search index - the database the company uses to generate search results - to be a public commons, accessible by all, just as a 1956 consent decree forced AT...o share all its patents. There is precedent in both law and in Google's own business practices to justify taking this step.

How?  Congress with oversight; lamestream media with publishing the FACTS, not fake news; and voters, how about boycotting GOOGLE and all its affiliate enterprises [3] if we want to live with a sense of freedom, plus not being surveilled and bombarded with non-thermal RF-radiation 24/7/365 ad infinitum! Undoubtedly, it was GOOGLE that messed with the 2016 elections, and probably not the Russians! If GOOGLE and other Internet platforms are censoring the entire EMF/RF spectrum pertaining to Artificial Intelligence and the surveillance 'trend' in the USA, do we live in a free country?

The announcement followed news reports that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have divvied up antitrust oversight of tech's biggest players, including Google parent Alphabet and Amazon.com, perhaps in advance of formal probes. Google already faces billions of dollars in antitrust fines in the European Union, and presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren is among those calling for breaking up big tech companies. As antitrust worries intensified, a one-day tech rout in early June sent Facebook shares down 8%, Google down 6% and Amazon down 5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index briefly dipped into official correction territory, down 10% from its high. As of mid June, the stocks had essentially recovered. </p><p>More challenges ahead. Antitrust issues aren't the only regulatory hurdles facing tech, and internet-focused firms in particular. Concerns about privacy and control of consumer data led to a strict new law in Europe last year. Another will take effect in California next year, and debate over federal data protection measures continues to heat up. </p><p>Meanwhile, tech companies have been put on the defensive with challenges to their corporate governance ranging from pay practices to diversity and discrimination issues to share-class structure, says Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity strategy at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. \" A panoply of issues is cropping up for tech companies,\" she says. \" It looks like a sector that's had a free ride for the past two or three decades and is only now starting to register with the U.S. government as a potential area for more regulation.\" </p><p>In another corner of tech land, semiconductor makers are smack-dab in the middle of the trade war with China, as are companies such as Apple, which both assembles hardware components in China and depends on sales there. Apple shares lost 12% in May before recovering. </p><p>See Also: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t058-s001-6-tech-stocks-to-china-proof-your-portfolio/index.html\">6 Tech Stocks to China-Proof Your Portfolio</url></p><p>It's a lot to keep track of. \" We spend 99% of our waking world thinking about these risks,\" says Matt Sabel, portfolio manager of MFS Technology Fund. If you own tech stocks in the regulatory crosshairs, be prepared for volatility and size your holdings in accordance with your risk tolerance, he says. </p><p>In the long run, Amazon, Facebook and Google have a lot to offer both consumers and investors, says Sabel, who owns the stocks. \" But the jury is out on a lot of these regulations, and uncertainty is never good for the multiples on stocks.\" </p><p>If you don't want the drama, you might want to focus on other parts of the tech market.

The misbegotten link tax and upload filter provisions of the EU copyright directive have survived the convoluted EU legislative gantlet[1]. My prediction: the link tax will fail because Google wants it to fail, but the upload filter will succeed because Google wants YouTube's competitors to fail. Rumors are flying that the FTC and Facebook will agree on a billion-dollar-plus fine[2] on the company for failure to adhere to its consent decree. My guess?</p><p> This is not so much about law as about the climate of hostility around the company since it took the blame for Trump's election. And, in yet another attack on Big Tech, the EU is targeting Google and Amazon for unfair practices as sales platforms[3]. Uncharacteristically, I refuse to criticize the EU over this policy. Artificial intelligence is so overworked a tech theme that it has even attracted the attention of the White House and DOD. We ask a new contributor, Jessica \"Zhanna\" Malekos Smith[4], to walk us through the President's Executive Order on AI[5]. I complain that it's a cookie-cutter order that could as easily apply to alien abductions. DOD's AI strategy[6], in contrast, is somewhat more substantive. If you can't beat 'em, ban 'em. Instead of regulating Big Tech, Russia is looking to take its own Internet offline[7] in an emergency. The real question is whether Russia is planning to cause the emergency it's protecting itself against. If so, the West is profoundly unready. CFIUS is contagious! Brian Egan[8] tells us that under US pressure Israel is considering restrictions on Chinese investment[9] as the world keeps choosing sides in the new cold war. China's Ministry of Public Security is now authorized to conduct no-notice penetration testing[10] of Internet businesses operating in China. I must say, it was nice of them to offer the service in beta to OPM, Anthem, and Equifax. Speaking of which, this mayspell (more) trouble for Western firms doing business in China. Brian touches on Treasury's new sanctions[11] against Iranian organizations for supporting intelligence and cyber operations targeting US persons. It turns out that the hackers had help[12] - and that there is no ideology so loathsome it can't win converts among Americans. Nate Jones[13] describes the EU's plan to use \"cyber sanctions\"[14] to fend off hackers during upcoming elections. This Week in Old Guys You Shouldn't Mess With: Nate reveals how 94-year-old William H. Webster helped take down a Jamaican scam artist[15]. Of course, if he was any younger, he probably wouldn't have picked up when the landline rang. Our colleagues Nate Jones and David Kris have launched the Culper Partners Rule of Law Series.

But it's become too broad and too subjective to be a useful term. President Trump applies it to any media coverage he dislikes. So do many other politicians. Astrology and homeopathy are pernicious idiocy but I know people who believe in both and, puzzlingly, they are neither bad nor mad. A free society must make room for lots of opinions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are right to worry about \"fake news\", in the sense of disinformation campaigns carried out by hostile states like Russia. But the most visible aspects of these operations, such as the hysterical, conspiracy-mongering, Kremlin-financed broadcaster RT, may be among the least dangerous. Russia's arsenal of \"active measures\" (to use a Cold War term) comprises more than 20 tactics. They include not just disinformation but the covert and overt use of money, cyberespionage, and violence such as assassinations or the kind of naval blockades used against Ukraine.</p><p>All of these can be used to influence a country, for example by attacking its political system. But not only at elections. If hostile states such as Russia or China gain influence in the main political parties over time, exploit ethnic, social and other tensions, cow public opinion, penetrate state institutions, woo business and acquire media assets, then the result on polling day is almost irrelevant.</p><p>The Soviet Union was vigorously, and often violently, involved in other countries' politics. Western countries responded in kind. What's new is that the internet allows unprecedented levels of anonymity, immediacy and ubiquity. In the old days, you spread disinformation laboriously, by planting stories in obscure third-world news outlets, such as the Soviet lie that the CIA invented HIV/Aids. Now you can do it with anonymous or fake accounts on social media.</p><p>Facebook and other companies have a lot to answer for. They have been making money by facilitating attacks on democracy, through the abuse of personal data, enabling clandestine advertising campaigns and allowing the promotion of bogus news sites. Facebook in particular has been caught out practising the darkest arts of PR in its own defence and then lying about it. Its contemptuous attitude to public accountability was exemplified by the refusal of its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, to appear at yesterday's hearing in Westminster.

The limits of free speech (for example on grounds such as child abuse, libel, privacy or racial hatred) must be enforced online as well as in the real world, but by bureaucrats, judges and police officers, operating in a legal framework set ultimately by elected politicians. That is already, broadly, the way we regulate broadcasting; we will probably end up doing the same for the big social media platforms such as Facebook.</p><p>Even democracies will have different approaches to this. Britain enforces reporting restrictions on court cases that other countries find quaintly constraining. Germany bans Holocaust denial. Singapore is thin-skinned when it comes to criticism of its political and judicial system. Authoritarian regimes would love global curbs on what they call \"information weapons\" - which is what we call news.</p><p>But we do need some international rules, chiefly regarding online identity. We need better ways of knowing if someone we are dealing with is real, and whether we are navigating safely on the internet. The system at the moment is full of holes: it is still easy to set up an email address, open a social media account, and start pretending to be someone else. The best gatekeeper here is the state: a government-issued digital identity would give us the ability to prove who we are, making it easier for other people to trust us. Tech companies could also make it easier to check the integrity of websites we visit. Simple tests would include: is there a street address, phone number and bank account? Who are the people involved? Does it ever publish apologies? Anonymity is a vital right. But it should be the exception, not the rule.</p><p>In short, it will be easier to curb state-sponsored online mischief if we focus more on messengers than messages. Once you know that the information you are reading is ultimately paid for by China or Russia, you will treat it differently from something you hear from an independent and trustworthy source.</p><p>Technological change makes better identity assurance urgent. Automated messaging software can chat online like a human: useful for providing customer service, terrifying in politics, where an inexhaustible army of robot canvassers would drown out mortal rivals. And \"deep fakes\" - convincing but invented video and audio - mean that any public figure can be made to seem to say, or do, anything. That risks destroying trust in anything we see on our screens.</p><p>The combination of digital mischief, disinformation and dirty money is formidable, made worse by our inability to grasp the scope and nature of the threat.

But it's become too broad and too subjective to be a useful term. President Trump applies it to any media coverage he dislikes. So do many other politicians. Astrology and homeopathy are pernicious idiocy but I know people who believe in both and, puzzlingly, they are neither bad nor mad. A free society must make room for lots of opinions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are right to worry about \"fake news\", in the sense of disinformation campaigns carried out by hostile states like Russia. But the most visible aspects of these operations, such as the hysterical, conspiracymongering, Kremlin-financed broadcaster RT, may be among the least dangerous. Russia's arsenal of \"active measures\" (to use a Cold War term) comprises more than 20 tactics. They include not just disinformation but the covert and overt use of money, cyberespionage, and violence such as assassinations or the kind of naval blockades used against Ukraine.</p><p>All of these can be used to influence a country, for example by attacking its political system.

The suggestions made by Mr. Warner\u2019s office aim to address how privacy, competition and public discourse are being affected by the misuse of those companies\u2019 services.</p><p>The existence of the paper was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/mark-warner-google-facebook-regulation-policy-paper-023d4a52-2b25-4e44-a87c-945e73c637fa.html\">first reported by Axios</url> and confirmed by The New York Times.</p><p>In Britain, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee also has <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/363/363.pdf\">published a report</url> that provided the government with recommendations about how to achieve similar results.</p><p>Both documents stemmed from investigations into misinformation on social media platforms and offer some common solutions. For instance, the reports propose large tech companies should:</p><p>\u25a0 Undergo audits of their data and algorithms.</p><p>\u25a0 Be liable if they fail to take down illegal or damaging content.</p><p>\u25a0 Have a duty to identify and remove fake accounts.</p><p>\u25a0 Be subject to legislation demanding their transparency.</p><p>Many of the 20 policy proposals put forward by Mr. Warner\u2019s office are specific to the United States. For example, the paper proposed the United States adopt sweeping new privacy legislation similar to the European Union\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html\">General Data Protection Regulation</url> and provide the Federal Trade Commission with greater rule-making authority to protect the digital lives of consumers.</p><p>Talk of regulating big tech companies began to gain momentum after it came to light that Russia had used platforms including Facebook and Twitter in its attempt to interfere with the 2016 presidential election race.

Facebook and Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/business/dealbook/facebook-twitter-wall-street.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness-dealbook&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=dealbook&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">spent heavily in the second quarter</url> to shore up their networks against abuse.</p><p>Neither document pushed for a breakup of big technology companies. Mr. Warner\u2019s office focused on increasing competition in the technology sector. The report proposes making it easier for users to move their data between digital platforms and limiting what companies can do with products, such as Google Maps, that are deemed to be so dominant that they have become \u201cessential facilities\u201d for users. The House of Commons report said the portrayal of tech companies as monopolies \u201cdoes not appreciate the benefits of a shared service, where people can communicate freely.\u201d</p><p>Still, the initiatives outlined in these documents are a long way from becoming law. Some of them \u2014 such as thorough audits of data and algorithms \u2014 may be technically difficult to achieve. Many will require legislation that, at best, will be slow to enact, and, more likely, may never achieve the momentum and support among lawmakers to pass.</p><p>Mr. Warner\u2019s office acknowledged as much. \u201cIn many cases, there may be flaws in each proposal that may undercut the goal the proposal is trying achieve,\u201d its paper reads, \u201cor pose a political problem that simply can\u2019t be overcome at this time.\u201d</p><p>The point of the proposal, though, the paper claims, was merely to prompt conversations: \u201cThe hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion \u2014 among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups \u2014 on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: The office of Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, center, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has written a paper outlining potential approaches to regulating technology platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

The suggestions made by Mr. Warner's office aim to address how privacy, competition and public discourse are being affected by the misuse of those companies' services.</p><p>  The existence of the paper was first reported by Axios and confirmed by The New York Times.</p><p>  In Britain, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee also has published a report that provided the government with recommendations about how to achieve similar results.</p><p>  Both documents stemmed from investigations into misinformation on social media platforms and offer some common solutions. For instance, the reports propose large tech companies should:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Undergo audits of their data and algorithms.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Be liable if they fail to take down illegal or damaging content.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Have a duty to identify and remove fake accounts.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Be subject to legislation demanding their transparency.</p><p>  Many of the 20 policy proposals put forward by Mr. Warner's office are specific to the United States. For example, the paper proposed the United States adopt sweeping new privacy legislation similar to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and provide the Federal Trade Commission with greater rule-making authority to protect the digital lives of consumers.</p><p>  Talk of regulating big tech companies began to gain momentum after it came to light that Russia had used platforms including Facebook and Twitter in its attempt to interfere with the 2016 presidential election race. The efforts gained greater urgency in March after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data scandal.</p><p>  These new proposals are among the first to be made by lawmakers since <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the chief executive of Facebook, testified before Congress in April about misinformation and data privacy issues on his company's platform.</p><p>  For their part, big technology companies are well aware that they must act to solve their problems or risk regulation. Facebook and Twitter spent heavily in the second quarter to shore up their networks against abuse.</p><p>  Neither document pushed for a breakup of big technology companies. Mr. Warner's office focused on increasing competition in the technology sector. The report proposes making it easier for users to move their data between digital platforms and limiting what companies can do with products, such as Google Maps, that are deemed to be so dominant that they have become ''essential facilities'' for users. The House of Commons report said the portrayal of tech companies as monopolies ''does not appreciate the benefits of a shared service, where people can communicate freely.''</p><p>  Still, the initiatives outlined in these documents are a long way from becoming law. Some of them -- such as thorough audits of data and algorithms -- may be technically difficult to achieve. Many will require legislation that, at best, will be slow to enact, and, more likely, may never achieve the momentum and support among lawmakers to pass.</p><p>  Mr. Warner's office acknowledged as much. ''In many cases, there may be flaws in each proposal that may undercut the goal the proposal is trying achieve,'' its paper reads, ''or pose a political problem that simply can't be overcome at this time.''</p><p>  The point of the proposal, though, the paper claims, was merely to prompt conversations: ''The hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion -- among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups -- on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-312550180731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXK-B4D1-JBG3-61P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/business/dealbook/big-tech-regulation-ideas.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/business/dealbook/big-tech-regulation-ideas.html</url><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 31, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ludwig Siegele explains why it matters, and what can be done about it</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HAS THE INTERNET failed? Sitting in his office at Christ Church College, Oxford, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, has his answer ready: \"I wouldn't say the internet has failed with a capital F, but it has failed to deliver the positive, constructive society many of us had hoped for.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two decades ago he would have scoffed at the idea that the internet and the web would do anything but make this planet a better place. In his autobiography written in the late 1990s, \"Weaving the Web\", he concluded: \"The experience of seeing the web take off by the grassroots effort of thousands gives me tremendous hope that?we can collectively make our world what we want.\" </p><p>Until a few years ago most users, asked what they thought of the internet, would have rattled off a list of the things they love about it\u2014that it lets them stay in touch with friends, provides instant access to a huge range of information, sparks innovation, even helps undermine authoritarian regimes. And in some ways it has been a tremendous success. Just under a quarter of a century after the first web browser was released, around half the world's population is online. But like Sir Tim, many people have recently become more critical of it, concerned that it creates online addicts, hoovers up everybody's data and empowers malicious trolls and hackers. </p><p> At the heart of their disenchantment, this special report will argue, is that the internet has become much more \"centralised\" (in the tech crowd's terminology) than it was even ten years ago. Both in the West and in China, the activities this global network of networks makes possible are dominated by a few giants, from Facebook to Tencent. In his latest book, \"The Square and the Tower\", Niall Ferguson, a historian, explains that this pattern\u2014a disruptive new network being infiltrated by a new hierarchy\u2014has many historical precedents. Examples range from the invention of the printing press to the Industrial Revolution. </p><p>At the same time the internet has become much more strictly controlled. When access to it was still mainly via desktop or laptop computers, users could stumble across amazing new services and try many things for themselves. These days the main way of getting online is via smartphones and tablets that confine users to carefully circumscribed spaces, or \"walled gardens\", which are hardly more exciting than television channels. Makers of mobile operating systems can decide through their app stores which services smartphone owners have access to. Another control point is cloud computing, which by its nature puts outsiders in charge of applications and their associated data. Meanwhile governments, which long played no part in the internet, have established power over large parts of the network, often using big internet firms as willing enforcers, for instance by getting them to block unwelcome content.</p><p>This is more or less the opposite of what the early cyber-gurus had intended. When the first message was sent over the internet nearly half a century ago, on October 29th 1969, the system was \"biased in favour of decentralisation of power and freedom to act\", according to Yochai Benkler of Harvard University. Its technological roots played a large part in that. A child of the cold war, the internet was meant to connect disparate networks and computers so they could still communicate even if central links became unavailable, say in the event of a nuclear attack. \"We wanted anything connected to the net to connect to anything else connected to the net,\" explains Vint Cerf, one of the engineers who developed the communication protocols (he now works for Google). </p><p>To make this possible, Mr Cerf and his colleagues had to make the internet \"permissionless\", in today's lingo. Any network and any computer can join in as long as it follows the protocols. Packets of data are handed from one network to another, regardless of content. This loosely coupled architecture later inspired Sir Tim, who devised the protocols for the world wide web that work on top of the internet proper. </p><p> Those protocols were complemented by a set of organisations that allowed the rules to evolve, along with the software that puts them into effect, and keep both from being captured by outside interests. Chief among them has been the Internet Engineering Task Force, whose philosophy was perfectly summed up by David Clark, one of its founders: \"We reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.\"</p><p>The combination of open technical rules and flexible governance set off a frenzy of creativity and innovation. Starting in the mid-1990s, millions of websites were set up and tens of thousands of startups launched. Even after the dotcom bubble collapsed in the early 2000s, this decentralised activity continued unabated, for instance in the form of blogs. Users actually did what Sir Tim had hoped they would: publish online and link to each other, creating a great virtual conversation.</p><p>Today the internet is a very different beast. The connections to transfer information still exist, as do the protocols, but the extensions the internet has spawned now greatly outweigh the original network: billions of smartphones and other devices, and cloud-computing factories the size of football fields, containing unimaginable quantities of data. The best way to picture all this is as a vast collection of data silos with big pipes between them, connected to all kinds of devices which both deliver services and collect more data.</p><p>The centralisation of the internet and the growing importance of data has given rise to what Frank Pasquale of the University of Maryland, in a recent paper published in American Affairs, calls a \"Jeffersonian/Hamiltonian divide\" among critics of big tech. One group stands in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson, one of America's founding fathers, who favoured smaller government and less concentration in business. Its members want to rein in the tech titans through tougher antitrust policies, including break-ups. The other group follows the thinking of Alexander Hamilton, another founding father, who supported strong central institutions, both in politics and in the economy. Its adherents argue that to reap the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and distribute them fairly, online giants should be treated as utilities.</p><p>This framing also helps to understand the reactions to centralisation more generally. The Jeffersonian side worries that a centralised internet offers less scope for innovation. Although the online giants themselves are a source of much invention, they dampen it elsewhere, so that fewer new ideas are being tried. Venture capitalists now talk about \"kill zones\", areas they will not invest in because one of the big players may squeeze the life out of startups or buy them up at a low price.</p><p>The political consequences of the internet's growing centralisation are even more troublesome, if less obvious. Walled gardens often limit free speech, as Facebook's sometimes ham-fisted attempts to police its social network have shown. Having to hack the algorithms of only a few platforms makes it easier for Russian trolls and their Western counterparts to meddle in elections by spreading misinformation. The concentration of reams of personal data in one place makes serious leaks more likely. One example is the recent scandal at Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that acquired data on 87m Facebook users in underhand ways (and as a result went out of business). Dominant platforms are also handy for spooks, as shown by the revelations in 2013 by Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee who leaked vast amounts of classified information. Intelligence services had to tap into only a couple of computing clouds to find what they wanted. And online giants have plenty of cash to influence offline politics.</p><p>Yet among Jeffersonians a sense of a new beginning is also in the air. The buzz at technology conferences today is reminiscent of 1995, shortly after the birth of the world wide web, when a new piece of software called a browser took the web mainstream, and the internet with it. At today's events startups are pushing ambitious plans, often based on blockchain technology (immutable distributed ledgers of the sort that underlie Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies), promising to \"re-decentralise\" the online world.</p><p>Hamiltonians, on the other hand, argue that without the free services and easy-to-use interfaces offered by companies such as Google and Facebook, far fewer people would be using the internet. Without cloud computing, which lets firms crunch vast quantities of data, AI would be nowhere. Having a few powerful firms in control also helps curb the demons of decentralisation, such as cybercrime and hate speech. This kind of thinking, long used by online giants to make the case against regulation, has gained some traction on the left in the West. But it is mostly thriving in China, where the government wants tech titans to help it in its quest to turn the country into a cyber-superpower.</p><p>Tacking between the two sides is a growing group of academics who are trying to devise new ways to rein in big tech through regulation. Some of their proposals are more Jeffersonian, such as forcing firms to unwind recent mergers. Others are more Hamiltonian, including making companies share some of their data.</p><p>This special report will start by chronicling how the internet became centralised, then discuss all three strands in turn. While not hiding its sympathies with the Jeffersionan side, it will conclude that to re-decentralise the internet, ideas from all three camps are needed. There is no central solution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-267855A</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNM-H4R1-JBKN-B1YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

A handful of forward-thinking business leaders are on board with the idea \u2014 just a few days ago, tech reporters discovered Microsoft's plans to build a new 'Data Dignity' team[4], whose areas of research include enabling consumers to buy and sell their data. Lawmakers are catching on as well. For example, at the federal level, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators has drafted the DASHBOARD Act[5], which would require social media companies to disclose the value of consumer data. </p><p>These proposals are headed in the right direction. For years, consumers have been happy to hand over mountains of personal data in exchange for access to so-called 'free' web services like email and social networking. Our personal data has helped companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon become some of the richest in the world. However, while the biggest corporations of years past spent the vast majority of their income providing living wages to human workers, the tech-driven giants of today spend only a small fraction of that amount on labor[6] (and wages are falling[7]). These businesses aren't just hoarding consumer data \u2014 they're hoarding the economic value that data represents, and they're keeping their margins high by cutting wages and headcount wherever possible. This inefficient allocation of resources must be addressed, either by government regulation, or by the tech companies themselves. But where government intervention would likely be punitive (read: breaking up tech companies), a proactive response from the tech industry could prove to be a remarkable opportunity in the long run, and considerably less painful in the short run. As it stands, the gluttonous behavior[8] of today's tech giants (Microsoft notwithstanding) has the potential to shut countless future workers out of an increasingly vital AI economy[9]. In the worst case scenario, these companies will exacerbate income inequality around the world, precipitating the birth of a permanent global underclass. Fortunately, all is not lost. As more and more jobs are automated out of existence, these companies could leverage the value of consumer data to create a new job market. In fact, paying consumers for their data might be the first step towards building a healthy AI economy where automation can co-exist with new forms of income and a thriving middle class. What's more, this emerging AI economy could facilitate the creation of new income streams for workers that reward them for their expertise and unique knowledge, in addition to their data (far from a new idea[10]).Building a sustainable digital economyWe live in a world where the rapid progression of artificial intelligence and automation technologies is threatening to radically reshape our global economic systems, potentially eradicating millions of jobs in the process. These technologies offer incredible efficiencies that could very well eliminate most manual labor within our lifetimes, alongside many white collar jobs. Some new opportunities[11] will spring up as a result, but that may not be enough to provide jobs for the 40% of workers who could be affected[12] in just the next 15 years. This could result in millions of workers robbed of job opportunities and forced to rely on a universal basic income or some other form of government assistance. This is all being accelerated by leading tech companies, who tend to be among the biggest innovators in AI and automation. For these giants, the elimination of human workers isn't a 'bug' in their increasingly automated business processes. It's a feature. A March 2018 piece[13] from the New York Times points out that businesses like Google and Facebook spend only about 5 to 15% of their income on labor. For more traditional players like Walmart, the share is closer to 80%. The AI economy is accelerating income inequality, and with only a handful of alternatives to our usual system of runaway capitalism, a revolution is all but inevitable. The data market is still in its infancy, so it may not seem like a pressing issue now that today's social networks only generate a few dollars per user at most[14], and that today's businesses are far from achieving full workforce automation. However, over the long term, consumer data compensation could mean the difference between a sustainable future economy and a technological dystopia in which millions are permanently excluded from real job opportunities. Leaders in AI and automation have a moral imperative to find ways to integrate more people into the digital economy. Our industry must transition away from playing the role of modern day robber barons and work to build socially responsible platforms that reward people for their data, expertise, and skills. Data is a resource, and data production is labor. With today's tech companies deriving so much of their value from what is essentially unpaid labor, these companies have effectively enriched themselves by creating a form of digital serfdom. Data compensation is about more than fighting income inequality, or even just doing what's right. It's about mitigating the economic harm[15] caused by our industry's ruthless 'winner take all' approach to consumer data. Royalty driven systems that pay people for the data that drives automation are not charities. They are integral to making the system work.The efficient allocation of resourcesIn thinking about this subject, it's helpful to return to British Nobel Prize-winning economist Ronald H. Coase's seminal 1960 article, 'The Problem of Social Cost[16].' In it, Coase asserts that 'the economic problem in all cases of harmful effects is how to maximize the value of production.' That is to say, when confronting economic scenarios in which one party causes harm to another, the only way to truly ameliorate those effects is to create 'an efficient allocation of resources' that maximizes the value of production \u2014 ensuring a healthy economic system for all. By creating a system in which consumers' data-generating labor is entirely uncompensated, our industry is not only failing to maximize the value of that production, we are deliberately diminishing it. If companies like Google and Facebook were really focused on ensuring their long-term success, they would be falling over themselves to pay consumers for their data to stave off the rise of a global underclass. After all, Google and Facebook want to live in a world where there are billions of people who have the time and resources to use their products, browse their advertisers' offerings, and make the occasional purchase. Likewise, Apple wants to live in a world where millions of people can afford to continue purchasing the next slightly different version of the same iPhone every two years. However, these industry leaders are actively working to build a future in which vast swaths of today's global consumer class will be permanently underemployed or unemployed \u2014 replaced by AI systems and automation \u2014 and also trapped in the indentured servitude of uncompensated data production. For modern companies dealing in technology and consumer data, true corporate social responsibility means consciously working to build and sustain an economic system that rewards all who participate in it, not just a lucky few who sit at the top. Paying consumers for their data today could play a crucial role in helping shape a sustainable, equitable new AI economy \u2014 one that's rich enough to support a robust consumer class for generations to come. Because if we don't upgrade capitalism for the AI economy, we might as well kiss capitalism goodbye.

That disdain was on full display July 29, when Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg testified via videoconference to the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.     \u201cAs gatekeepers of the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, to shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, in his  opening statement .  \u201cTheir ability to dictate terms, call the shots, upend entire sectors, and inspire fear, represent the powers of a private government. Our founders would not bow before king, nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d    Republicans were no kinder. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, had this to say to Google\u2019s Pichai: \u201cA significant portion of the American public has lost trust in your company. A lack of public confidence in a product usually means there is economic harm to the company, but that just isn\u2019t the case with Google. So I think it\u2019s a legitimate question as to whether Google\u2019s market power insulates it from loss of revenue, normally associated with offending half the people who use your product.\u201d     What\u2019s going on here? Partly, I think, it\u2019s a fundamental confusion of two easily conflated but quite distinct sentiments: respect and trust. And unless our political leaders understand the difference, they\u2019re not going to be able to act in the best interests of Americans. Partly, it was political posturing. In line with their traditional wariness of big business, Democrats wanted to seem tough on Big Tech\u2019s alleged abuses of power. Republicans wanted to push a narrative about online censorship of conservative views. (That\u2019s who Armstrong was referring to as the \u201chalf\u201d of people offended by Google.) But beyond the political posturing, legislators will eventually have to decide what action to take, if any, in the best interests of the American people.  When they do, they should carefully consider two easily conflated but quite distinct sentiments: respect and trust.     Respect these innovators. But don\u2019t trust them.    It is folly to disrespect the Big Four tech executives. They are extremely accomplished. They have established companies that have changed society and how we live. They have pioneered both technical and social innovations that have been widely embraced by virtually all cultures around the world. They implemented and marketed their innovations globally more effectively than their competitors. For those accomplishments, Bezos, Cook, Pichai and Zuckerberg deserve enormous respect.     Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado did say, \u201cOur witnesses have taken ideas born out of a dorm room, a garage, a warehouse, and built these dreams into four of the biggest power players in the digital global economy.\u201d But such respect at the hearing was rare. That\u2019s too bad, because we should certainly respect them for all they have accomplished. And we ultimately want their awesome capabilities to help America to retain our leadership and now regain our prosperity.    But we should not trust them. They do not act completely in overall best interest of Americans. They cannot. As Jeff Bezos said in the hearing, \u201cWe promote our own products.\u201d Translation: \u201cWe act in our own best interest.\u201d     The real reason we should not trust the Big Four is because they stymy innovation. The ironic thing is that they have not stymied innovation in the way they are be accused. Zuckerberg did not stymy innovation when he handed over one billion dollars to the founders of Instagram and them poured billions more into building out the platform. That was good for everyone involved. And he did not stymy innovation when he mentioned that competition would heat up if they didn\u2019t team. Anyone in Zuckerberg\u2019s position would have done the same; it\u2019s just the truth of how competition works.     The problem of trust actually comes in mitigating the unintended consequences of their innovations. We need innovation to mitigate the election meddling, trolling, hate speech, and pornography that arose from Big Tech businesses.  This is the innovation they are stymying. Unintended consequences of new technologies aren\u2019t a new phenomenon. Walmart\u2019s supply chain innovations decimated the commercial centers of many U.S. small towns late last century and Ford\u2019s triggered major new sources of pollution. We\u2019re still grappling with these problems because Big Tech, as well as Walmart and Ford do not want to mitigate their innovations\u2014and they certainly do not want to encourage others to do so.     Requiring the Big Four to fix their own problems through regulation and consent decrees hasn\u2019t  worked too well in the past . It can\u2019t. Fixing problems peripheral to the objectives of a company is too distracting and costly and it creates potential rivals. Microsoft stymied computer tool developers, AT&amp;T stifled innovation in communications, IBM tried to do so with early computers, Boeing did so with its United Airlines, RCA with radio. Once an enterprise dominates a market it wants to stymy the innovation of entrepreneurs so they can slow down their own investments in innovation. It\u2019s not that innovation goes to zero, it\u2019s just that innovation gets focused in only a few areas where profits can grow. Efforts to mitigate past problems are at best miserly and half-hearted. Google and Facebook recently received big fines for their lack of compliance of their consent decrees requiring them to beef up privacy.     The other historical solution has been to break up the company because the founders cannot be trusted. It will be an expensive time-consuming long-shot trying to use existing antiquated antitrust legislation to go after the Big Four. Right now, the public loves their smartphones, wants to stay connected with Facebook, relies upon Google to find information (even misleading information), and could not live without Amazon delivering to their doors. As Bezos testified, \u201cOur approach is working. Eighty percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall. Who do Americans trust more than Amazon to do the right thing? Only their doctors and the military.\u201d Anti-trust legislation is targeted at preventing customers from being abused, and that\u2019s not the case now. The Big Four deserve to be respected for delivering value to their customers.    If we want to actually figure out how to eliminate election meddling, or online bullying and trolling, or privacy from advertising in search, or any number of unintended consequences, we will need to give entrepreneurs\u2014not just Big Four employees\u2014opportunity and incentives to develop solutions to these problems. We cannot trust the Big Four to effectively lead the efforts to mitigate the problems they cause.    The solutions lie in requiring the Big Four to give access to third party developers to their code. Open-source software is now an established, stable, effective way to improve the efficacy of software platforms. Not any piece of software makes it \u201cinto production\u201d (i.e., becomes part of the software consumers actually use), consumers only use software that has been peer-reviewed and peer tested for being effective, efficient, and bug-free. For example, third parties should be able to experiment on Google and Facebook off-line code to find better ways to detect and filter hate speech and on-line bullying. Entrepreneurs that develop more effective mitigations than in-house employees should receive a bonus and lucrative fees for non-exclusive licenses.    In the case of Amazon and Apple\u2019s potential to abuse third party vendors, they should be required to set up these businesses as separate auditable entities to make them more transparent. Third party vendors are customers too and creating entities with public records will make them accountable for their actions and less able to hide unfair practices and huge profit margins within a larger abstruse enterprise.    New legislation is required to make the Big Four let other entrepreneurs have access to their monopoly platforms. But Congress is confusing trust with respect and is therefore not able to identify the real issue by treating the Big Four executives as if they were incompetent and did not deserve respect. Disrespecting these executives leads members of congress to think they must rely on past legislative structures to solve problems they do not understand. The solution lies in enabling third-party entrepreneurs to have access to the Big Four platforms so they can work on fixing all the unintended consequences of the new technologies we so dearly love.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Many are less than 20 years old, and like teenagers they are full of energy and ideas to change the world. They also don't understand their own strength, are suspicious of authority, behave awkwardly in an adult world of government and regulators, and don't think the rules apply to them.</p><p>They are wrong. There's a reason why laws have emerged to protect children from sexual exploitation, to prevent radicalisation by extremists, to preserve the integrity of democratic elections, to safeguard people's property including their personal data, to ensure that workforces have rights, and to prohibit the emergence of monopolies. Tech finds itself at the centre now of a fierce argument about how all these legitimate social aims should apply to them. They clearly should.</p><p>Social network platforms are now the source of news for millions of people and make choices about what they see through algorithms, and so should be subject to the same kind of constraints as other media editors and publishers. Anti-trust regimes exist to prevent the consumer detriment that comes from a lack of competition today but also tomorrow. Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, but should be subject to the human one.</p><p>Whether they like it or not, the coming story of the next five years is how politicians across the West will seek to apply regulation to these technology firms and potentially break them up. It is right that Britain should want to lead intellectually on this debate - which is why the strategy set out by the new Culture Secretary and the Prime Minister today in Davos is welcome. But it should be done in a spirit of collaboration and not just confrontation.</p><p>Artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, robotics and the like are the technologies of the future, with the potential to improve our lives and further human innovation. We want the development of this future to happen in Britain. We've attracted the lion's share of European tech investment, and have some incredible firms such as Google's Deep Mind. But we should be aware that other countries are snapping at our heels. Emmanuel Macron has made an explicit pitch this week for tech to find its home in France, and Facebook has just chosen Paris as the place to invest millions in AI. Donald Trump is turning up today in Switzerland to make a simple, uncomplicated pitch for these businesses, including the big tech firms, to come home to America - and he has a big tax cut to encourage them.</p><p>You do not always hear a similarly positive message from the most senior members of the Government. As they might have learnt from last year, if you come to Davos only to lecture business leaders, don't be surprised if those leaders look elsewhere to do their business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTAND-133935590</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTAND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGS-8D21-JBVM-Y42F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138528</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Evening Standard (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31730\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But some stock mutual funds have found ways to both post gains and surpass major indexes, often with investment strategies that include such\u00a0stock market leaders as\u00a0Amazon (AMZN), Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX) and Salesforce.com (CRM).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[ibd-display-video id=3200627 width=50 float=left autostart=true] For the year through March 8, Fidelity Investments' Will Danoff and John Roth have deftly ridden such stocks to a nice 6.48%\u00a0gain in the fund they manage: $28.5 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX). That compares with the S&amp;P 500's 2.84%. The legendary Danoff is best known for managing the $129.6 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) since 1990, and with which he's  with $100 billion or more in assets in the past 15 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of their top holdings are riding a megatrend\u00a0\u2014 people spending more time on the internet \u2014 that they see driving earnings growth and price appreciation for years to come.</p><p>A key to the winning investment strategies they've used since New Insights' inception in 2003 is change.\u00a0\"We always look for change,\" Danoff told IBD, \"and change is an opportunity: when there's a .\"</p><p>While New Insights is solidly in the large-cap growth camp, Roth brings in expertise in midcap stocks and a slight value tilt, which adds a level of flexibility to the managers' investment process as they navigate 2018 stock market trends.</p><p/><p>In a wide-ranging Q&amp;A, Danoff and Roth share how their flexible investment strategies allow them to uncover opportunities even as the bull market ages and many growth stocks get pricey. They also discuss their major holdings, including why they're bullish on Amazon, Netflix and Adobe.</p><h>Investment Strategies 2018</h><p>IBD: What is the strategy of your fund?</p><p>Will Danoff: Fidelity Advisor New Insights is a capital appreciation fund with a growth bias. Both John and I believe that stocks over time follow the underlying earnings per share of the companies. I've joked in the past: You get two fund managers for the price of one. We\u00a0created a sleeve structure two years ago: Will is running 60% of the fund, John is running 40% of the fund. John has a more value orientation, I have a more growth orientation.</p><p>IBD: What is the main trend in the market today and how are you integrating it in the fund?</p><p>Danoff: I'm looking for the best stocks in the market and companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage but are growing in this environment, gaining market share, are able to leverage technology and find certain trends like Cloud or SaaS (Software as a Service) or just more and more people and more and more companies spending more time on the internet. That's probably the megatrend that we're all living in.</p><h>Growth Stocks Vs. Value Stocks</h><p>John Roth: I've spent half my time at Fidelity as a value-ish analyst and half as a growth analyst. I prefer to buy growth stocks \u2014 I think they're more fun, more interesting. But I think you can also make money in turnarounds and other things that the market has left by the wayside.</p><p>Nine years into a bull market, I think there's some valuation concerns on the growth side, so that's taken some of my growth money out, but I still have a growth bias. I think the key is to be versatile and really take advantage of the opportunities the market gives you.</p><p>Danoff: We're flexible and we'll go anywhere, so I really think that helps the fund. There aren't many constraints on what we can do. And John has been really good at anticipating which out-of-favor groups might come back into favor. And by looking for out-of-favor groups, that forces you to look at your existing names and say \"Wow, maybe all the good news has been discounted here.\"</p><p>IBD'S TAKE:\u00a0As an individual investor, you want to stay in sync with the market.\u00a0Read IBD's  column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.</p><p>IBD: Speaking of which, could you give a few examples of trades in the past 12 months?</p><p>Danoff: We were up 28% last year and tech helped a lot. Amazon was a nice overweight, Activision Blizzard (ATVI), PayPal (PYPL), Facebook (FB), Adobe \u2014 these were larger technology companies that grew very nicely.</p><p>We always look for change and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition. When something's happening, Fidelity can hopefully move quickly.</p><p>Last year was about avoiding some of the defensive names, General Electric (GE) obviously struggled with their earnings. ... We were underweight in a big way.</p><h>Where To Find Good Stocks Like Facebook</h><p>IBD: Your fund profile talks about companies that are undervalued by the public. But obviously the public is focusing on the big tech names, so how are they undervalued or what is the additional value that you're seeing in them?</p><p>Danoff: John and I are looking for misperceptions by the public. If we think  for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger (and) video. ... We're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer. I think I am more bullish on Facebook than the consensus and I own a lot of it.</p><p>Roth: A lot of times these big names are right in front of you and it doesn't mean they're not going to be great stocks. Apple (AAPL) has been the poster child. Back in 2007, people got excited about the potential for the company to have $6 billion in revenue, and no one thought they'd go to $250 billion. And it unfolded slowly over the years right in front of you.</p><p>IBD: What are your thoughts on the fact that we're late in the economic cycle and valuations are high?</p><p>Danoff: Yes, we've had a long run since the bottom of the spring of 2009, earnings have more than doubled, stocks have more than tripled. The crisis of 2008-2009 I think was felt more deeply than people realize. \u2026 (The economic impact) was quite drastic.</p><p>There was this massive footrace\u00a0to put on the brakes \u2014 cutting costs, cutting capital spending. Sort of the whole world froze. I think and Google\u00a0were two of the only companies I'm aware of that grew earnings in the first two quarters of 2009.</p><p>My point is, the starting point was quite drastic. And so even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing the costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending.</p><h>2018 Stock Market Trends: International Stocks</h><p>The other observation I have is the world is much more global and U.S. companies are now able to sell their products\u00a0all over the world. The big companies in the S&amp;P 500 are now much less capital intensive; they're high margin, they're high growth and they're highly cash generative. Yes, I think the market is expensive, but the market is not what it used to be. The quality of the companies is higher and estimates are going up.</p><p>IBD: Would you look more outside of the U.S. to find good stocks?</p><p>Roth: Our philosophy is turn over as many rocks as you can. The more you turn over, the higher the probability to find something good. If we find that the U.S. has less opportunities, then maybe we'll look harder in Europe. Europe has been slow to recover and there are some interesting names there. And the same would be true in Asia. You might see more names in the fund because we're trying to find new ideas.</p><p>Danoff: The global research effort helps us so much. The global economy is much more integrated. We can talk to Asian tech companies who are part of the supply chain, or Samsung, which is a supplier and a competitor to so many of the big tech companies, and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). It's hugely helpful to understand where we are in the cycle in that particular industry.</p><p>The trends we're seeing overseas are often similar, sometimes ahead of the trends that we see in the U.S., sometimes behind. But in terms of the big global companies, often the Nestles  (NSRGY) and Unilevers (UN) are more defensive, and right now defensive is out of favor. So we're trying to pay attention to out-of-favor, but right now these stocks are not leading the market. This is the tension and the balance we have to find.</p><p>IBD:\u00a0The market had a short correction recently. How do you react in this kind of environment?</p><h>Stock Market Volatility And Investment Strategies</h><p>Roth: We went through a very long period of no volatility and to the extent we see more volatility in the future as the economy heats up and the Fed gets more aggressive, it just means that we have to tighten our game up and look for dislocations every day. We've had some really big swings in the market where you could open up and then all of a sudden be down a fair amount, and so on an individual stock basis we're looking for bargains on the names that we really like. We do have some cash in the fund and we can be opportunistic. So a little bit of volatility is not a bad thing at all.</p><p>IBD: Do you sell anything in those times?</p><p>Danoff: You have to stay flexible and when fundamentals change, we all have stories when a top 10 position discloses some bad news and the stock is down and you start saying, \"Oh my God, one of my big positions is under pressure.\" If there's competition from Amazon, or there's regulatory changes, or there's unexpected margin pressure, you can't stand still in this business.</p><p>When the whole market sells off, John and I are looking for higher-quality companies that we can upgrade to.</p><h>2018 Stock Market Trends: Inflation</h><p>IBD: Considering the current increasing inflationary pressures, do you see any sector rotation or areas that may pop up that would be more advantageous for investors in 2018?</p><p>Roth: We are seeing wage inflation. Everyone from Walmart (WMT) to most big companies have started to pay their employees more. These bonuses that are coming as a result of the tax cut will have the same effect.</p><p>Who benefits? It's probably the financials to some extent, probably the energy companies, materials, gold. We have exposure to all of that, and we can easily shift if it looks like it's going to become more prevalent.</p><h>Stock Outlook For Netflix, Adobe And Amazon</h><p>IBD: What is your outlook for some of the big names in your fund?</p><p>Danoff: Good news is good news. In an expansionary environment, Netflix is crushing it overseas. They're adding 5 million subs overseas a quarter and a couple million subs in the U.S. They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding, it's a subscription model offering great value for roughly $10-$11 a month. The average subscriber is spending 10 hours a week watching their content. Margins are going up and I am quite positive.</p><p>Adobe has made a shift from licensed to Software-as-a-Service to the recurring revenue model. More and more people are spending more and more time on the web, so companies and individuals purchase Adobe software more frequently. Revenues are growing more than 20%, margins are going up and the company is generating a huge amount of free cash flow, so the outlook is very bright for Adobe. Could it sell off because it's expensive? Yes, both Adobe and Netflix could see multiples compression near-term, but I think over time both companies are very well positioned to grow, looking out three to five years.</p><p>Amazon\u00a0\u2014 wouldn't you want to partner with the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos? A week does not go by where somebody doesn't tell me, \"I love Amazon.\" AWS, which is their cloud-computing business \u2014 they started before anybody else realized that could be a business \u2014 it's now I think an $18 billion business, growing roughly 40% a year; it's nicely profitable. In e-commerce, he's pushing hard into India, into food, in apparel \u2014 he's gaining market share. He's got a long way to go. Maybe I'd like him to show a little more profit because I think stocks follow earnings over time, but I'm confident that everything Amazon is investing in is ultimately going to generate a very strong return, and if that's the case, then profits will come over time.</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-3175681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RV3-H6W1-DYTD-92Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

If the source code is not available to the public, it is not an open source. If you are giving out the software for free and if the source code is not available to the public, then it is a freeware and not an open source software.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are certain guidelines for a software to be qualified as Free Software Foundation (FSF)/ Open Source Initiative (OSI)-approved open source.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The basic rule is that open source code should be given to the user to run it, study it and modify it. The user should also be allowed to share the modified /unmodified part. If these four permissions are given by the author to any user, then it is an FSF/OSI-approved open source software.</p><p>There are three aspects of open source software: What, How and Why</p><p>WHAT - A source code which is shared within a community is open source software. An open source software follows a decentralized development approach. This means development does not happen at one centre, it will be developing on a global scale and everyone would be developing it.</p><p>HOW - Any individual or company trying to integrate open source should have proper open source guidelines. They should have a team dedicated to comply with the license obligations, a team who is well-proficient in reading the open source licenses that are usually very tricky. Last but not the least, they should have security vulnerability check for each and every component they are integrating in their own software.</p><p>WHY: Why a company or a startup or an individual should integrate open source software into their own product? Why there is such need that you have to incorporate a software that is not built by your own team?</p><p>Now, let me give you answers to these questions.</p><p>First, it will help reduce the development cycle. As the technology is moving on and as we are progressing, the development cycle is getting lesser and lesser day by day. Earlier we use to receive a new version in a year, now it has gone down to one month. The companies are releasing improved versions every month. So, the only way we can cope up with this fast pace is to use the already built-up module available in the open source domain.</p><p>Second is cost reduction. Usage of open source is not about profit because well-established company will not care about any cost, they are more concerned about their product. What they want is that the product should fulfil all the advertised functionalities and live upto the expectations, but usage of open source will still help them reduce the cost of the products.</p><p>Third is getting the bleeding edge technology. It is something which is really new in the market. The company developing the product may not be good or at par in market with the technology. Then they can use already build-up module and integrate it with their own software.</p><p>According to the golden circle, the vision should be why we are doing it and then we should build a strategy around it and then develop a product around it.</p><p>So, if we are developing a product by keeping 'the why of open source' then we should first have a strategy, all the guidelines and basic teams and then develop the product. Thus, you will able to create a full proof open source included product.</p><p>WHILE LICENSING YOUR SOFTWARE, YOU SHOULD INCLUDE A 'NO WARRANTY CLAUSE' SO THAT NO ONE CAN COME BACK TO YOU AND SAY \"BECAUSE OF YOUR SOFTWARE I HAVE SUFFERED THIS LOSS\"</p><p>Licensing of the open source software</p><p>Open source software can be licensed in three ways:</p><p>You can put it down in public domain where you do not need to put it down under any license. You can say that it is for public, for the welfare of the developers. But there are few downsides to this, as there will be no warranty clause.</p><p>Apart from WTF Public License and CCO (Creative Commerce License), these licenses do not have warranty clause. So, the company, developer or individual using your software can come back to you and say they are suffering loss that because of your open source component. This is a very important aspect that you should understand. Whenever you are trying to license your software, you should include a 'no warranty clause' so that no one can come back to you and say \"because of your software I have suffered this loss\".</p><p>That's where permissive licenses come in the picture. These are licenses that do not put much restrictions on user/companies and are very friendly for developers and authors. So, if an author is putting his own contribution through MIT license, then MIT license has an expressive clause where it says, 'you cannot just go against author and ask him that we have suffered this loss'. You cannot blame author for any loss you are suffering as this software comes with no warranty.</p><p>If your software has a registered patent, then I would suggest you go out for the Apache license because it has an expressive patent clause which grants any patent rights to be given to the user who will be using that software.</p><p>Why is this important? Let me explain it this way - If you have an open source software and a well working algorithm, a patented algorithm, and you are using MIT license, then you are not giving the patented rights to the user. So, the user will be worried that though he is using a patented algorithm, he has no right to use that algorithm. This will inhibit him to use your open source software and go with some other open source software. This is where an Apache license will help you to license all the technology you have and all the algorithm that you have created to open source domain.</p><p>And the last one is restrictive license. If you want to monetise, the permissive licenses and the public domain licenses won't help. If you want to earn money from your open source software, then you must go for restrictive licenses. In a restrictive license, an author can put multiple restrictions and if a company/individual wants to use that software without that restrictions, they need to come back to the author and ask for another copy, licensed in a permissive way or in a commercial license.</p><p>This is where the catch is. You will be shipping out your open source software into the public domain, where there will be multiple users. Day by day it will grow up, and soon when the corporates will look at it, they will be needing the software with less or no restrictions.</p><p>This is how a developer/author can earn money by giving out a commercial license to the user. A few of the restrictive licenses are General Public license (GPL), Lesser General Public license (LGPL) and Affero General Public License (AGPL). They come with different restrictions.</p><p>Explanation about GPL, LGPL and AGPL licenses</p><p>LGPL is created for the benefit of users so that they can incorporate libraries into their own proprietary product without sharing the source code. However, they are required to dynamically link the LGPL license component.</p><p>In case of GPL, they can only link if it's in a cloud or through a CLI (Command Line Interface) mode. If the user is not invoking it in cloud or CLI, they must share their own source code into the public domain.</p><p>When the founders of FSF/OSI realised that people are taking advantage of GPL they included a clause which says, \"if the software is communicated over the network then the virality clause will also be applicable.\" So, if you are planning to monetise your software, I would suggest you go for AGPL from the beginning. AGPL is the most restrictive license and chances of someone taking benefit of your open source component will be less.</p><p>One mistake the developers usually make is that during the initial time when they are developing their code, they put it under MIT license and for the later version they use AGPL. Any organisation who wants to use the software will see two versions available in the public domain: one version in MIT and another in AGPL. Now, you cannot relicense the copy which is already with the user, and they will only go for MIT and not AGPL. This way they can avoid paying the development fees. So, if you are planning to monetise your software, then you should put all the code under AGPL from day one.</p><p>\"A license is basically a contract between you and the user. You can file an infringement suit and say into the court of law that these were the terms in which we agreed on and that the user was supposed to release his own proprietary code. Say for example, if it's a big tech giant which is earning billions of dollars, they will never release its own proprietary source code. So, if they have infringed and if they have not complied with the regulation and license obligations, you can file an infringement suit and get a lot of money in return. But if it's an individual developer, all he needs to do to comply to the license obligations is to give his own proprietary source code into the public domain. The contract begins the moment user starts using the components. From there on, the author can enforce the contract under which he has opensourced his contribution.\"</p><p>Putting the code under restrictive licenses has a lot of disadvantages, but at the same time if you are planning to earn from it in the long run, then you should go for AGPL.</p><p>The difference between AGPL and GPL is that AGPL will have over the network clause.</p><p>One thing which the founders of OSI initially missed is that they said that a software is conveyed through some medium, but the internet was not covered in that. So, the companies started putting all the open source components into cloud. While the software is in cloud, it is not conveying the software as such, but they are using the open source component, a GPL version, without sharing their own proprietary code. That's why they came up with APGL to give all the restrictions over the network.</p><p>'Never call it a product'</p><p>Now you have a product and you want to open source it and you want to monetise it. How you would proceed for it. One of the basic pillars of it is 'you should never call it a product'. The moment you call it as a product, people will think that it's a finished product and there is nothing to contribute to it. But if you are calling it as a project, something that Apache and Linux are also doing, they will become contributors. They will contribute to get benefits out of it and to get recognition. It should be looked up as a community engineering collaboration and not an individual or one man show. You should put your open source software into a repository such as Github. Everybody should be allowed to collaborate, integrate and submit their contribution. That's how the project can improve drastically because multiple people are contributing to it.</p><p>You also should never take complete control of the project, because then it becomes just another proprietary software doing all work.</p><p>SO, IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO MONETISE YOUR SOFTWARE, THEN YOU SHOULD PUT ALL THE CODE UNDER AGPL FROM DAY ONE. </p><p>Ways to earn money from open source</p><p>There are four ways under which you can earn money from open source.</p><p>1.Donations - Wikipedia has been doing this. But it all depends on your company size or product. If your company or your product can reach to a large number of people, then you can get donations.</p><p>Example - A person shared that he has a mobiles OS but is not getting enough donation. In a span of three-four years, he was only able to get around 30 dollars.</p><p>2.Web apps - If you have a website and you are getting enough clicks, because people are coming there to download your open source software, then you can earn through that also.</p><p>The following two are the real ways by which you can to earn money.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>3. Support and maintenance- Red Hat has been doing this already. Here you will create a great product and put it out in the open source market. People will be contributing to it and it will get better every day. And when the big companies/corporates want to use it, they will need some assistance support or extra capabilities which are not available in open source market. Here, you can charge the company for those services, maintenance and for giving them better quality.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>4.Dual licensing- When you have a software, there are two ways you can license it, either under a copyleft license and proprietary license. Many websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube won't show you ads or ask for premium subscription at the beginning. They will just try to get users in the beginning.</p><p>When you put your software into the opensource market, people will come for it as free is always accepted by everyone. With time your product will grow, users will increase, people will contribute, and it will get better and better every day. That is the time when you can start giving out proprietary or commercial license copies of your own software, with no restrictions.</p><p>You can set a value for commercial version depending upon who is buying it. If it's an individual or a company, in order to get to that stage, you must use a copyleft license, which is just opposite of copyright license.</p><p>When you are putting your product under a copyleft license, you are actually saying that no one can hold a copyright on it because only I have the copyright.</p><p>LGPL, AGPL, GPL - they all fall under the copyleft type licenses. When you're putting your product under AGPL from day one, people will be contributing for free, there will be bug fixes and patch development. They will be improving your product free of cost. When the product is at this developed stage, you can charge your clients for the finished product.</p><p>Author of the article</p><p>The article is curated from the speech presented by Sachin Bhakar, Regional Counsel, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, at Open Source India (OSI) 2018. He worked as IP &amp; Open Source Compliance Analyst with Honeywell from 2016 to 2018.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Q. Initially I had put my source code in the repository through MIT. In the next version, I made some changes and use AGPL. How does it matter If I start with MIT license and then convert to AGPL? Because when you open the Github, by default you see the Apache License and people without much thinking usually go for Apache License.A. Let's suppose that your code is of 100 lines, and you have already put those lines in the open source domain. Version Two will be of 120 lines and there will only minor changes. If a company wants to use that particular functionality, they will have now two options - either pay you for AGPL or just to develop 20 lines for MIT version. In such case, they will usually avoid paying to the author at any cost. Therefore, from day one, you should put your code into AGPL because then every copy will be under AGPL and they will not be putting their proprietary code into the public domain. And just to avoid that part they will have to pay you. That's how you will be able to monetise your software.Q. A free software is developed by an individual and over time many contributors join. At a point when the product is complete and becomes a proprietary, can the contributors claim that they also have a role?A. That's where contributor license comes in picture. When you have an open source software and you want contributors to contribute to your project, you can put a contributor license agreement and you can modify according to your need. You can say that the moment you contribute to this library, the contribution is not yours, it's mine and I can license it. That's how you can take away the rights from the contributors. They can be given the credit, but you can get the right to relicense it. The ownership will lie with the original author.Q. If I add a different functionality and initially put 100 lines of code, and on top of it add more 500 lines of code. Then I put the entire thing under AGPL3, and an alternative license as a commercial license. Will I benefit with that? A. Of course you will benefit from that as you have improved your software and so the earlier portion does not matter. Instead of taking that software from the repository and developing it, the best option would be to take your developed product and get it commercially license from you. So, it entirely depends how much functionality the software is providing.Q. How are the contributors getting benefitted? What is the motivation for them?A. For a developer who are contributing to an open source, it's their hobby. They are playing with codes, it's an exercise for them. They are actually improving themselves by contributing to the code. That's the only take away or advantage they get from contributing.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LINFOR-0047285200</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LINFOR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W13-5261-JB5M-W114-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 EFY Enterprises Pvt Ltd., distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Open Source FOR You</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 29, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Conveyances</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkE5Mjg0OUZCNkRCNDI0NEI0NDI5RDlFMkYyQ0Y0OUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjlGMzNFNDc5QzI1NDlFQ0JFQjQxMDE5REVBQ0NEQTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009ER8</classCode><className>ACADEMIC STANDARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>STX001253</classCode><className>OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DF8W</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY VULNERABILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

I'm Gerri Willis, and this is OPEN HOUSE, the show that saves you money. Coming up on this Earth Day weekend, how to go green without breaking the bank, and we'll show you some easy ways to save water and money in your home.</p><p>But first, one of the biggest nor'easters in recent memory left its mark from South Carolina all the way up to Maine. New York City got eight inches of rain. That's the second highest amount since they started keeping records 113 years ago. Hundreds of thousands along the Eastern Seaboard lost power, and countless homeowners had to deal with devastation.</p><p>But one of the toughest parts of this storm was the impact on countless homes up and down the East Coast, homes that one hour were dry and the next flooded. While the damage is sure to be costly, no damage totals are in yet. FEMA is in the middle of conducting preliminary damage assessments. Right now, though, we want to look ahead and show you what to do if you and your home get hit with a flood. Mike Rimoldi is with flash.org in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>Mike, good to see you.</p><p>MIKE RIMOLDI, FLASH.ORG: Good to be here, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: Awesome. You know, let's start with safety first. That's one of the biggest issues when there's a flood. People can forget, it can be dangerous going back into your home.</p><p>RIMOLDI: Exactly. One of the things that people often forget is though the water may rise in your home, the electricity is still on. So before you enter into your home and stand in that water, you want to make sure that your electricity to your home is turned off to prevent any possible hazards from that.</p><p>WILLIS: Great idea. And of course, you've got to get the water out. That's one of the big things, right?</p><p>RIMOLDI: Exactly. One of the big things you see often is people are going into their homes and there's standing water, and the first means of recovery is to get that water out of the home. Get the doors open, get the windows open, obviously, when the weather has cleared up. Get some fans going. Air out and remove any items that are saturated with water, such as carpeting and such.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, Mike, this can be harder than you think. I was part of this flood over the weekend, I've got to tell you. You could not buy a sump pump. You couldn't find a fan where I live. You've really got to plan ahead for this stuff.</p><p>RIMOLDI: Exactly. It's kind of like hurricane protection, earthquake protection -- or preparation, I should say. Anything that involves a disaster, folks need to have a plan ahead of time, instead of just trying to react at the last minute.</p><p>WILLIS: Absolutely. Another thing you say is to check below the water line. What do you mean by that and what are you looking for?</p><p>RIMOLDI: If you can ascertain how high the water has come up in your home, obviously you may have seen it when the water was there, or if you're arriving after the water has already receded, you'll be able to see the line that -- the high water mark, so to speak.</p><p>And you want to determine what areas below that have been damaged. Is the drywall in that area -- need to be removed and replaced? Any flooring in that area, any molding? And that's something that the homeowner is going to have to check...</p><p>WILLIS: How do you know though -- I've got to interrupt you here, Mike. How do you know if it's damaged enough that it has to be replaced? Because a lot of people are making that very decision today. RIMOLDI: Exactly. And a lot of times, Gerri, carpeting is pretty much going to have to be replaced. Because folks forget, this isn't clean water that has come into their home. I mean, it's brown water, it's gray water, it's not totally clean water, so...</p><p>WILLIS: What does that mean? Yes, it could have anything in it, right?</p><p>RIMOLDI: Exactly. It's mixed with chemicals, runoff from the road, sewage, other items like that. So 99 percent of the time, you're going to want to pull that carpet out and replace it. If it's a precious heirloom rug or something, obviously you're going to take that to a professional cleaner to have restored, but if it's your standard carpeting, pull the carpeting out of the house, pull the padding out of the house, and then start looking at things like the drywall. Is it saturated enough that it's fragile to the touch? Because if so, you're going to want to cut that out.</p><p>Obviously, too, inside your walls, the insulation. And once that gets wet, it's really never really going to dry out to the point where it's not going to lead to possible mold, mildew and other items, which, you know, for the cost of insulation, it's more practical to remove and replace than to try to dry out.</p><p>WILLIS: Mike Rimoldi, thank you for being with us today. I just want to remind our viewers, he has got a great Web site. If you're worried about the stuff this weekend, flash.org, a great place to go.</p><p>And of course, one of the most important and dangerous threats from a flood is mold. Coming up. we'll have some vital tips on how to deal with mold, if you find it in your home.</p><p>More jawboning this week on the topic of the subprime mortgage meltdown on Capitol Hill. Subprime loans, of course, are loans with higher interest rates given to folks with low credit scores. As we've been telling you on this program now for six months, these loans are a big part of the sharp rise in foreclosures across the country.</p><p>And this week, Senator Chris Dodd, you're seeing him right here, held a homeownership preservation summit in which he asked participants to agree on a couple of ideas. One, that foreclosures are at unacceptably high levels. And two, that foreclosures are not in the interest of homeowners.</p><p>I guess the wheels turn pretty slowly inside the Beltway. Politicians have actually yet to write some legislation to take on this problem, and that's hurting tens of thousands of people across this country. We'll continue to follow that story.</p><p>Coming up on OPEN HOUSE, going green on this Earth Day weekend. How to do your part without emptying your wallet. But first, your \"Tip of the Day.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS (voice-over): The average household receives 20 bills every month.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With electronic payments, you can save $150 a year. And that is late fees, anywhere from $25 to $75 per bill, and with stamps, envelopes, and checks.</p><p>WILLIS: And since the payments are deducted from your bank account automatically, you always pay on time. Check with your utility providers, health club, and credit card companies to see if they offer financial incentives for direct payment. And you'll be helping the environment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up to 18 million trees a year can be saved, and over 390,000 cars can be taken off the road if all of us paid our bills electronically.</p><p>WILLIS: That's your \"Tip of the Day.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: One of the country's largest banks has found a way to go green -- well, sort of. Bank of America announced their first green initiative this year. For the remainder of 2007 each customer who opens a new home equity line of credit will have $100 donated to Conservation International. That's an international environmental organization.</p><p>Now, going green at home and on the road sounds, well, all well and good, but it can get pricey if you don't know what you're doing. That's why Cybele Weisser from Money Magazine is here.</p><p>Cybele, welcome. Good to have you here.</p><p>CYBELE WEISSER, EDITOR, MONEY MAGAZINE: Nice to be here.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Let's start with some of the easy stuff that doesn't take a lot of money. You know, everybody hears about those compact fluorescent bulbs. That's certainly one, right?</p><p>WEISSER: Yes. And you know, just take the five bulbs that you most commonly use in your household, buy, you know, replacements and you'll save about $60 a year on your energy costs.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, that's a lot of money.</p><p>WEISSER: It's a good deal.</p><p>WILLIS: Absolutely. So we've programmable thermostats, that's also a great idea too.</p><p>WEISSER: Yes, I love these. I mean, you just can buy them at your local hardware store and they cost about $50. And what it is, is it will just turn down automatically at night or if you're away, and then turn it up before you get home. Savings of about $100 in the first year. WILLIS: What is a hot water heater wrap?</p><p>WEISSER: Doesn't that sound like something really crazy and technical? It's $20 and it's just basically an insulator that will keep you from -- make your hot water heat up faster and keep you from losing that insulation. You can knock 5 to 10 percent off of your energy costs that way.</p><p>WILLIS: Wow. That is great. OK. And it's a cheap way to get some savings. Let's move onto heating and cooling. Because half of your bill is heating and cooling and if you can just bring that down a little bit, it makes a lot of sense. What's your first recommendation?</p><p>WEISSER: Well, we recommend that you repair some leaky ducts in your home. People don't realize they are losing 15 to 20 percent of their heating and cooling, it's just flowing out the door. If you repair that, you'll get that money right back.</p><p>WILLIS: How about ceiling drafts? I'd love to talk about that, because the windows for example, doors, you really lose a lot of energy that way.</p><p>WEISSER: You lose a ton of energy that way. Seal it up and you can get about another 10 percent savings on your energy bills.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WEISSER: ... but it's a lot of money.</p><p>WILLIS: Now you say donate old appliances to charity, right?</p><p>WEISSER: Mm-hmm, yes. Besides the fact that it's a nice thing to do, you can also get a tax break for it. I really recommend the site energystar.gov, it's the federal government's site.</p><p>WILLIS: It's a great website.</p><p>WEISSER: It's a wonderful Web site. They give you a lot of tax- saving tips. I mean a lot of these can come right off your taxes in the form of credit.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. I have to take you to allergy suffers. I read somewhere that there are 14 million people this year who will go to the doctor with allergy problems. I am one of them. I don't think I know anybody these days who is not. You can make quick fixes in your house, though, to help, right?</p><p>WEISSER: Yes, yes, 'tis the season. If you're doing any repairs, if you're thinking of painting, we recommend low-VOC paints, and what that means is that it is paints that won't give off fumes. Our regular paints give off fumes for years, actually, not just after you air out your house.</p><p>These paints cost a little more, about $50 a gallon, but they're non-toxic and there are plenty of other glues and laminates you can also get that are low on fumes.</p><p>WILLIS: Any other fixes? I understand that there is a little more expensive fix that will really clean up your air.</p><p>WEISSER: Yes, it's a mechanical filtration system. That will run you somewhere around $500 to $1,500, but that will really clean your air, and you know, you'll cut down on your headaches, your allergies, and your doctor's bills. Hey, think what you could save.</p><p>WILLIS: So it will take you a little while to pay for it, but at the end of the day, it makes sense.</p><p>WEISSER: Feeling good is a reward.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. There are other products -- yes. Feeling good is a great reward. You say there are other products to buy as well for your home. What are those?</p><p>WEISSER: Yes. If you're doing some home renovations, say, you might want to consider renewable products like bamboo flooring. It's about $2 to $4 a yard, but...</p><p>WILLIS: It's cheap compared to wood, right?</p><p>WEISSER: Yes. It's cheap compared to wood and it's all -- it's recyclable, it's natural, I mean, that's a wonderful thing to do. Also consider low-flow toilets and shower heads. The toilets actually can be a little pricey. They can go from about $150 to $500. Shower heads are pretty cheap. But you know, it will knock about half of the cost off of your water bill.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. So at the end of the day, how much savings do you think that people can really get by making these little changes along the way?</p><p>WEISSER: I mean, I think you can get thousands of dollars in savings just within the first year. It's actually pretty significant.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, thank you for taking us on the guided tour. We appreciate it. Cybele, thank you.</p><p>WEISSER: You're very welcome.</p><p>WILLIS: Still ahead, important tips on dealing with mold. Plus, saving water means helping the environment and saving money. How to do it all when we come right back. But first, your mortgage numbers.</p><p>WILLIS: Wasting water isn't good for anyone. It's bad for the environment and it's bad for your wallet. But there is such a thing as water efficiency without sacrificing water pressure. Ed Del Grande of hgtvpro.com, he stopped by to show us how to save water and save money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILLIS: OK. Here's my problem though, Ed.</p><p>ED DEL GRANDE, HOST, GHTVPRO.COM: OK.</p><p>WILLIS: You know all of these new rules? You can't take a shower anymore. It's like standing out in the rain. I mean, you want that really strong shower flow.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Gerri, you're not alone. It's not people's imagination. Everything runs slower now, hoses, because the regulations have come into effect. For instance, toilets can only use 1.6 gallons or less, faucets can only use about 1.5 gallon a minute, and showers, our beautiful showers are down to 2.5 gallons a minute.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Well, let's talk about the showers first because that's what I'm really concerned about. How do I get a really good shower head?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Well, remember, it has to adhere to those rules on the 2.5 gallons, which is a little slower, but there are shower heads like this on the market. This is called a performance head, and this gives you the impression that you're getting a stronger shower with less water. Can I tell you the tricks?</p><p>WILLIS: Sure.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: OK. First of all, see how wide it is, like a firehose? Well, with the wider stream, it feels like there's more water coming at you.</p><p>WILLIS: Even though there's not.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Even though there's not. So it's kind of a mind game. But inside, it's real. This is great. Look at this. Do you see that, looks like a jet engine?</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Yes, it injects air through the water, so even with the small amount of water, it feels stronger coming at you.</p><p>WILLIS: So it's pushing it through at you.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Yes. At you. But the best thing is, Gerri, feel these little nubs over here. Feel that over here, do you? See how they're rubber?</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Those little spokes...</p><p>WILLIS: What does that do?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Well, OK. Here is the trick. If you can keep these spokes clean, you will get a good, strong shower. Water deposits get in the shower heads, they block up. But look, if you wipe your thumb across it, go ahead, don't be shy, this squeezes the water out. And if there is no water in those little nubs, it can't leave deposits, so you always get a strong shower.</p><p>WILLIS: Pretty good, pretty good.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Not bad, huh?</p><p>WILLIS: OK. Let's talk about the faucets. What can I do there?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: OK. Faucets. Here's the spout, right here at this faucet. It could be a kitchen, it could be a bathroom faucet like this one. What you want to do is take off the standard aerator. Now that is what...</p><p>WILLIS: The standard aerator.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Yes. See it, see how it opened up the spout now. Now do you see how small that one is. Look, you can increase it to a jet aerator, just like the shower head. Inside is jet propulsion...</p><p>WILLIS: OK. Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed, what does this do? It's an aerator, what does that mean?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: It mixes air with the water, so it gives you the softer flow so it's not a big strong stream. So if you mix more air, and see these slots? Do you see the one you have? There's no slots, so this one mixes twice the air so it looks like a much stronger flow, even though it's the same amount of water.</p><p>WILLIS: Very tricky, very tricky.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: They look -- well, here's what's not tricky, Gerri. Look how fast I just changed that out. Anyone could do this in a matter of seconds.</p><p>WILLIS: Are they expensive?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: No, you can go down -- they sell them in six-packs, believe it or not. You get six aerators in a pack. And you just go and change all your faucets and hopefully you don't have more than six in your house. And it's a great project.</p><p>WILLIS: What about outdoor faucets?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: OK. Outdoor faucets, very good. Let me show you something right here. You can hold the new one.</p><p>WILLIS: This looks familiar.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Yes. Now this is the real familiar one, this is the old standard one.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Yes. Now see how it's big and fat? Look at that one, see how it's skinny? (CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Is that going to fit, though?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Well, that will fit, but what they've done is they've put ball valve technology in here so it makes it flow faster and you can actually have a thinner spoke. And let me mix these two right together here. See how that one's smaller? So with a third less water, you'll still get the same flow. How about that?</p><p>WILLIS: OK. We've got to say the T-word, we've got to talk about toilets. So...</p><p>DEL GRANDE: We have saved the best for last. All right. The new technology is with these toilets that are called dual-flushing toilets. Now they look...</p><p>WILLIS: What does that mean?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Well, they look the same from the outside, but on the top of the toilet or the side, you'll have two buttons. Now I'm going to be polite about this. The number one button is for number one, the number two button is for number two.</p><p>WILLIS: OK.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: So here is how you go. Inside it will activate these two buttons on the top. You'll have the chrome ones on the outside. So when you press the chrome ones, do you see this? The number one button will lift up this plunger and that only gives you one gallon to flush.</p><p>WILLIS: So this is just controlling the water flow?</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Right. What you're doing is now you're controlling the water so you get your water saving with one gallon, but if you need that big flush under 1.6, you put the number two button and that will give you a strong flush. And, Gerri, this tower will save up to 5,000 gallons of water a year just with that feature. So this is no joke.</p><p>WILLIS: Wow. That is great. OK. I was laughing, but in fact it is a very serious technology.</p><p>DEL GRANDE: Yes it is.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: As always, if you have an idea for a \"Weekend Project,\" send us an e-mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:openhouse@cnn.com\">openhouse@cnn.com</email>.

But first, out West to check in with a city that plans to cut energy consumption by 30 percent over the next five years. That's this week's \"Local Lowdown.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PATRICK CONLON, DIR., OFFICE OF ENERGY MGMT.: The Palm Desert Energy Partnership is an energy conservation program with a five-year goal to save 30 percent of our energy city-wide, 215 million kilowatt hour savings in electrical energy.</p><p>WILLIS (voice-over): New residential and commercial buildings must consume 10 percent less energy than currently allowed by state law.</p><p>CONLON: The program entails incentives for people to invest in energy efficiency in their homes and businesses.</p><p>WILLIS: Some ideas: install solar panels, Energy Star appliances, high-performance windows, and high-efficiency air conditioning. Palm Desert is also banning drive-through restaurants and declaring electric golf carts street legal in order to lower carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>That's your \"Local Lowdown.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: From paper bags to solar panels, living green can mean many things, but one company in San Francisco is taking it to a whole new level, by greening the real estate market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING \"SAN FRANCISCO (BE SURE TO WEAR SOME FLOWERS IN YOUR HAIR)\")</p><p>WILLIS (voice-over): Beauty, climate, and culture. There are plenty of reasons to call the City by the Bay home, unless you are committed to buying green.</p><p>CHRIS BARTLE, GREEN KEY REAL ESTATE: There's really not a lot of green real estate here in the city. So instead of waiting for that to be built or created, I decided that I could create a company that could facilitate or expedite the creation of that real estate.</p><p>WILLIS: In business since 2005, Green Key Real Estate connects green buyers with environmentally friendly homes. It also provides resources to clients who wish to green their homes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm very excited about this greenhouse up here, too.</p><p>WILLIS: The Shepherds bought and sold their last home through Chris. And now with his company's help, they are doing a green remodel in their new one.</p><p>BART SHEPHERD, GREEN KEY CLIENT: We have similar concerns about lessening our impact on the world and leaving sort of less of a mark behind, preserving things for future generations like the two little girls that we have running around here.</p><p>What are we going to put in the backyard, Cha-Cha (ph)? Are we going to put a slide?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Chris practices what he preaches.</p><p>BARTLE: This is Brazilian cherry, it is FSC-certified. FSC- certified simply means that it is grown in sustainably-harvested forests, so they are clear-cutting. They're not cutting old growth. They're farming it in a sustainable way.</p><p>Also in here, we have zero VOC paints, compact fluorescent light bulbs, double-pane windows.</p><p>WILLIS: Later this year the company hopes to use a new database allowing people to search specifically for homes with green features.</p><p>SHEPHERD: The stairway may get more efficient space.</p><p>WILLIS: The shepherds believe greening their home will pay off both health-wise and financially.</p><p>SHEPHERD: It's taking the house to a whole 'nother level. It's a competitive real estate market, and so I think it gives us the added benefit of standing out.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING \"SAN FRANCISCO (BE SURE TO WEAR SOME FLOWERS IN YOUR HAIR)\")</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: Now, if you're thinking about greening your own home, log onto builditgreen.org for a list of products and resources.</p><p>Now, as promised, what to do if you think there is mold in your home. Remember that mold isn't always visible. It can grow behind your walls. So check them for any discoloration. Mold is also very common in central air conditioning systems. If this is the case, you just need to replace your filtration system.</p><p>Now, if you have a portable air conditioner, take the filter out and make sure the coil is shiny. And if you can see mold in your house and the affected area is less than 10 square feet, you can handle the cleanup yourself. Forget mold testing kits. They're expensive and unnecessary. Besides, even a little mold is bad news. Don't test it, just get rid of it.</p><p>You can remove mold growth from hard surfaces with a bleach solution of one cup bleach and a gallon of water. Now, use a stiff brush on the rough surface materials like concrete. And of course, you'll want to wear gloves so your skin doesn't come in direct contact with mold, and use a surgical mask too so you don't breathe it in.</p><p>Now if the affected area is larger than 10 square feet, you should consider calling professionals.</p><p>OPEN HOUSE will be back next week right here on CNN.

That judgment is premature</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IN 2018 A new word entered Silicon Valley's lexicon: the \"techlash\", or the risk of a consumer and regulatory revolt against big tech. Today that threat seems empty. Even as regulators discuss new rules and activists fret about the right to privacy, the shares of the five biggest American tech firms have been on a jaw-dropping bull run over the past 12 months, rising by 52%. The increase in the firms' combined value, of almost $2trn, is hard to get your head round: it is roughly equivalent to Germany's entire stockmarket. Four of the five\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft\u2014are each now worth over $1trn. (Facebook is worth a mere $620bn.) For all the talk of a techlash, fund managers in Boston, London and Singapore have shrugged and moved on. Their calculus is that nothing can stop these firms, which are destined to earn untold riches.</p><p>This surge in tech giants' share prices raises two worries. One is whether investors have stoked a speculative bubble. The five firms, worth $5.6trn, make up almost a fifth of the value of the S&amp;P 500 index of American shares. The last time the market was so concentrated was 20 years ago, before a crash that triggered a widespread downturn. The other, opposite concern is that investors may be right. The big tech firms' supersized valuations suggest their profits will double or so in the next decade, causing far greater economic tremors in rich countries and an alarming concentration of economic and political power.</p><p>The question of a bubble is a reasonable one. Tech cycles are an integral part of the modern economy. The 1980s saw a semiconductor boom. Then, in the 1990s, came PCs and the internet. Each cycle fades or ends in a bust.</p><p>Today's upswing got going in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone. By 2018 it, too, seemed to be showing its age. Sales of smartphones were stagnating. Data scandals at Facebook crystallised anger about the tech giants' flippant approach to privacy. Global antitrust regulators were on the alert. And the loss-making antics of flaky tech \"unicorns\", such as Uber and WeWork, evoked the kind of speculative froth often seen at the tail end of a long boom.</p><p>In fact, at least for the biggest tech giants, today's valuations are built on more solid foundations. Together, the five biggest firms have cranked out $178bn of cashflow after investment in the past 12 months (see Buttonwood). Their size has yet to slow their expansion: their median sales growth, of 17% in the latest quarter, is still as impressive as it was five years ago.</p><p>Consumers say they care about privacy but act as if they care much more about getting stuff, and preferably without having to pay for it in cash. Since the end of 2018 the number of people using Facebook's services (including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp) has risen by 11%, to 2.3bn. Regulators have punished tech firms for tax, privacy and competition misconduct, but so far their efforts have been like bringing a pea-shooter to a gun fight: the fines and penalties they have imposed amount to less than 1% of the big five's market value, a tolerable cost of doing business. And the agonies of some of the unicorns, and their biggest backer, SoftBank, have only demonstrated how hard it is to replicate the scale and network effects of the big five.</p><p>Meanwhile, the size of the opportunity is vast. As our special report in this issue explains, many parts of the economy have yet to digitise. In the West only a tenth of retail sales are online, and perhaps a fifth of computing workloads sit in the cloud with the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Big tech operates globally, giving it more space to expand, especially in emerging economies where spending on digital technology is still relatively low.</p><p>The trouble is that if you think that tech firms will get much bigger and diversify into more industries, from health care to agriculture, it is logical to assume that the backlash against them will not fade away but, eventually, get bigger.</p><p>As big tech's scope expands, more non-tech firms will find their profits dented and more workers will see their livelihoods disrupted, creating angry constituencies. One crude measure of scale is to look at global profits relative to American GDP. By this yardstick, Apple, which is expanding into services, is already roughly as big as Standard Oil and US Steel were in 1910, at the height of their powers. Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are set to reach the threshold within the next ten years.</p><p>When recession strikes it will fuel new resentments. Big tech could face a storm that few have yet paid much attention to (see Business section). The big five firms employ 1.2m people and are now by far the biggest investors in corporate America, spending almost $200bn a year. Their decisions about whether to squeeze suppliers, slash investment or attack weaker rivals will prove as controversial as those of carmakers when Detroit still ruled in the 1970s, or even of Wall Street in 2007-08. Big tech's role in politics is already toxic; social media and videos influence elections from Minnesota to Myanmar.</p><p>All this means that, far from having peaked, anger may be in the foothills. Executives hope that slick lobbying will protect them. But even today, the picture outside America is not of inaction but a tumult of regulatory experiments. China keeps its internet giants under tacit state control and wants to rely less on Silicon Valley, including Apple, which is already dealing with the covid-19 virus and other headwinds there. At least 27 countries have or are considering digital taxes. India has cracked down on e-commerce and online speech. The European Union (EU) wants individuals to own and control their own data, an approach this newspaper favours, although it may take years of innovation to create a system that is easy for consumers to use and profit from. This week the EU proposed curbs on artificial intelligence. Even in America, trustbusters may limit big tech's ability to gobble up startups, a strategy which has been instrumental to the success of Alphabet and Facebook in particular. </p><p>The $5.6trn market value of tech's formidable five is a testament to some of the most commercially successful companies ever created. But it also assumes that they will get a lot bigger even as the world stands by and watches placidly. Until today, big tech has been largely unscathed. The bigger it becomes, the more reason there is to doubt this can continue. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-TS8E77M</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y81-4F71-DY2R-219F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

But in a surprising move this week, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division decided to block the deal, saying that the new company would harm consumers and weaken competition. The agency's lawsuit was a stark departure from decades of leniency toward similar tie-ups, including Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2011. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Here is what you need to know to make sense of the government's case:</p><p>  Why was the government's decision such a surprise?</p><p>AT&amp;T and Time Warner do not directly compete against each other. So their combination, known in the business world as a vertical merger, would not reduce the number of companies in the telecommunications or media markets. That is a key test of competition for antitrust officials.</p><p>  For about four decades mergers like this one passed regulatory muster, notably Comcast's union with NBC in 2011 and Time Warner's merger with AOL in 2000. The Justice Department has been more critical of mergers between companies that directly compete, what antitrust officials call horizontal mergers. In 2015, the agency blocked another Comcast deal, that time to buy Time Warner Cable, a cable company that is a separate company from Time Warner. The agency said that combining the two cable and broadband providers would reduce options for consumers and have too much power.</p><p>  Then why are antitrust officials doing this? </p><p>  Makan Delrahim, less than two months into his job as the head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, has arrived with a very different approach to merger reviews.</p><p>  He has said that he is not opposed to vertical mergers in general. But he said he disagreed with how anticompetitive concerns for these deals have been handled in the past.</p><p>  Traditionally, antitrust officials have addressed concerns by making companies agree to abstain from anti-competitive business practices. In the case of the Comcast-NBC Universal deal, Comcast promised to share NBC programming with streaming companies like Netflix, for example. These sort of arrangements are called behavioral remedies.</p><p>  But Mr. Delrahim believes that those agreements are difficult to police and often do not work. If there are anticompetitive harms, he says, the companies should be willing to sell off assets to allay those concerns.</p><p>  Mr. Delrahim proposed AT&amp;T sell off Turner or DirecTV, according to three people from the companies involved in the deliberations who spoke on the condition that they not be named because of the delicacy of the negotiations. AT&amp;T has refused to sell either one and said it instead would fight in court to keep all assets.</p><p>  Why does Mr. Delrahim criticize behavioral remedies?</p><p>  Mr. Delrahim, a Republican who served at the Justice Department during the George W. Bush administration, believes the government should not expend a lot of resources on merger enforcement. He thinks consent decrees with behavioral conditions turn the Justice Department into a regulatory agency that has to police those settlements for years.</p><p>  In a speech at the American Bar Association this month, Mr. Delrahim said, ''Like any regulatory scheme, behavioral remedies require centralized decisions instead of a free market process.'' He added that if a deal is anticompetitive, ''we should only accept a clean and complete solution.''</p><p>  Are regulators rethinking antitrust more broadly?</p><p>  Corporate consolidation, particularly in the tech and media sectors, has become a bipartisan concern. Lawmakers say they are worried about the power of Facebook over public opinion and Amazon's great reach across retail, media, and business services like cloud storage.</p><p>  There is a call for regulators to think more creatively about antitrust. A common test for antitrust officials is whether customers will be harmed. Many tech companies easily pass that test because they offer handy free or inexpensive products. But critics of existing laws say that the big tech companies may be hurting competition in other ways, by preventing start-ups from succeeding or innovating, that are more difficult to measure.</p><p>  But do not expect a dramatic new standard for tech companies. Mr. Delrahim has said the ultimate test for competition is whether consumers are happy.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-665525171123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R18-SXY1-JBG3-651C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/the-att-antitrust-case-questions-and-answers.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/the-att-antitrust-case-questions-and-answers.html</url><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 23, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002SBL</classCode><className>TIME WARNER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002H12</classCode><className>TIME WARNER CABLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

They explore ways that applications of open data can benefit society and consider efforts to preserve data security and privacy, promote data discovery, and ensure the quality of open data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Podcast transcript</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> Data-it's the lifeblood of the AI techniques used most often today. Most organizations have plenty of data within their veritable walls to fuel AI applications that improve areas from operations to product offerings. But it's the sharing of data across organizations that could unlock huge benefits for society. There's the potential to find cures to disease, to respond more effectively to crises, to combat climate change.</p><p>Today, however, very little of the data sharing needed for such endeavors is happening. And this is due to a variety of reasons, from technical challenges to very legitimate privacy concerns and also because many organizations are simply hesitant to share their data because they see it as providing them with competitive advantage.</p><p>So how can we break down some of these barriers to unlock the potential for data and AI to do societal good? I'm David DeLallo with McKinsey Publishing, and I explored this question in a fascinating conversation I had with the CEO of the Open Data Institute, Jeni Tennison. The London-based institute works with businesses, governments, and other organizations to build an open and trustworthy data ecosystem.</p><p>The first order of business I wanted to tackle with Jeni was to understand exactly what she and the institute mean when they say \"open data.\" Here's how she explained it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Tennison:</emphasis> We think about data as being on a spectrum of access. So there's data that's closed within a particular organization-only that organization and people within that organization can access it. And at the other end of the spectrum, there's open data, which is data that anyone can access, use for whatever purpose, and share with others.</p><p>Fully open data tends to be data that comes from organizations that care about getting maximum value for the economy and society as a whole from that data. And it tends to be data that is not personal data.</p><p>A good example is lidar data, which shows you hills and valleys and so on. It can be used to predict flooding. That data is made available as open data in the United Kingdom, so that organizations can use it to create accurate insurance premiums, for example.</p><p>But you can see that that's very nonpersonal data. So open data really spans a wide range of different types of data, tends to be nonpersonal but doesn't have to be nonpersonal, and is made available because we think that others can benefit from it and that we actually get value from others benefiting from it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> Of course, it's that personal data that can be leveraged best for ways that would benefit society as a whole-for example, by allowing doctors to understand the nature of disease and possibly see a path to new treatments. Anonymization and aggregation techniques are one way such data can be shared and leveraged. I asked Jeni if there were other ways to go about safely using personal data. And she talked about an idea that's being explored more recently, and that's the concept of a data trust.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Tennison:</emphasis> One thing that we [ODI] have been looking at is this concept of data trusts as third-party institutions that would wrap within them the kind of governance that you need to make sure that the data is being shared well and for good purposes, for the purpose that it's going to benefit the people who are affected by that data.</p><p>So the idea of a data trust is that it would be an institution set up with a particular purpose in mind. The people running that institution, the trustees, would have a responsibility and a legal responsibility to share data only in accordance with that purpose of the trust.</p><p>And then you would obviously need to have the kind of technology that makes that data easy to share. You would have to have very strong engagement with the people who were affected by the sharing of that data in order to make sure that there is trust in the way it's being shared for that purpose.</p><p>But setting up those kinds of institutions is a direction I think we will travel in as we try to get more use out of data, both for public-good purposes and for understanding how it can unlock innovation and economic growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> But while data trusts might solve issues around privacy and security, they don't address the concern from organizations that they'd be giving up some competitive advantage by sharing their valuable data. Jeni pointed out, however, that there are plenty of reasons to share data that would unlock more value than keeping it close to the vest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Tennison:</emphasis> When we look at the reasons that private-sector organizations start to share data, they fall into a number of categories. Sometimes private-sector organizations do things for social-peer purposes. And you can be cynical and just view that as them trying to build up their reputation or those kinds of things. But some organizations actually have at the heart of them that they want to do good. So there's that kind of category.</p><p>There's another category of sharing and opening data that is really about driving open innovation. So many organizations recognize-particularly larger ones-that being a bit more porous in the way in which they interact with other organizations out there in their environment can bring benefits back to them.</p><p>We have a project called Data Pitch, which is funded by the European Commission, where we're kind of matchmaking organizations that have lots of data with small start-up AI businesses. And the organizations that have a lot of data have a lot of challenges, too, that they think that the data they have can help with but don't have the know-how themselves about how to do that. They are sharing data with those smaller organizations in order to get that innovation back into their organization themselves.</p><p>In other places, we have organizations that recognize that they are part of a much wider ecosystem of organizations that is under a significant challenge. For example, we do quite a lot of work in the agriculture sector. The agriculture sector recognizes that with growing populations and with climate change, it is under an increased threat and demand around being able to satisfy the need that we will have in the future. And the only way in which that can be addressed is by organizations like Syngenta and Monsanto actually working together, and sharing more data is a way of doing that to ensure that we can feed the world in the future. So there are those kinds of larger challenges that get addressed through more sharing of data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> And many organizations that collect the largest volumes of personal data-think big tech here-still have elements of their data they could share.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Tennison:</emphasis> First is open data that's generated from that personal data. So an example of that would be Uber, which aggregates data about journeys made through cities by its drivers and then uses that data to help inform the way in which cities might put in other traffic restrictions or can then predict what the impact of a particular event might be on the way in which traffic moves around the city.</p><p>Now, Uber's data isn't quite open data. The company doesn't make it available for anyone to access, use, and share. It's not available for commercial purposes. But it's the kind of aggregate data that is nonpersonal but could be open for anybody to use.</p><p>The second way in which organizations like that are looking at sharing data more is providing restricted access to bulk data about the people who are using their services but for public-good research purposes. So an example of that would be, say, Facebook making available data about the social graph in Facebook and the way that people use Facebook, so that social researchers can understand more about the way in which Facebook works but also how we interact with each other as people, which is valuable research for the future.</p><p>And then the third way in which those kinds of organizations are making data more available, more open, is by enabling us as individuals to get access to data that is about us and enabling us as individuals to choose to pass that data on to other organizations and other services. In the United Kingdom, we have that as a right. We have the right of data portability through GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation]. We have the right to get hold of data that is collected about us, pass that on to third-party organizations, to other applications, that can then use it to provide insight about us.</p><p>A good example of that is the open-banking work that has been happening in the United Kingdom over the past couple of years, which gives people the ability to access information about their bank transactions and their bank accounts and then to pass that on to third parties, which might be another bank if they wanted to move banks.</p><p>But more often, it is actually insight-type applications that are giving them a better understanding about the way in which their bank balance flows up and down and therefore helping them to manage debt, helping them to manage when they might need to get loans, for example, for a small business. So you can see what more openness and more sharing of those three sweet spots [can enable].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> Even for those organizations willing to share data, there's another obstacle: the physical or technical aspects of sharing. Jeni talked about some ways to tackle those.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Tennison:</emphasis> There's really interesting interplay between the technology that you use when sharing data and the governance that you need to have when sharing data. The bit that I'm most interested in is the use of new privacy-enhancing technologies that enable us to have more sharing without invading people's privacy-things like really good, high-quality synthetic-data generation, where synthetic data (so it's just made up) can be shared with organizations, so they can try out their algorithms and their data processing before getting hold of the real thing. That, I think, helps to reduce some of the costs and barriers that you would otherwise have when developing algorithms or getting access to data.</p><p>The other thing that I'm very interested in and excited about is the new advances around kind of distributed machine learning, where individual organizations can still keep hold of data themselves-it's still behind their own kind of firewalls-but the machine learning can happen on that data. And then the results of it come back into the central place and are combined for multiple different organizations, so that the person who is creating the AI never gets behind those firewalls, never gets access to that personal data, but we're still able to learn from it.</p><p>Those are the kinds of technologies that we need to explore more, because the more we can get away with not sharing huge amounts of bulk data that's very, very personal, the better the situation will be.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> Interestingly, Jeni pointed out that one of the biggest barriers to data sharing, even within organizations, is data discovery. And while this is often viewed as a technological challenge, it's actually one that's best solved by humans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Tennison:</emphasis> So how do you find out that some other person in your organization-or some other organization, if you're looking more widely-actually has some data that you think is going to be worthwhile for the challenge that you're currently facing?</p><p>One of the things we find with discovery of data is that the curatorial role of the librarian is closer to what we need than a technology solution. It's the individual who can actively do the research to find out what data is available and pull that into something that makes sense, that tells the story of what data is available, that helps to articulate to people the subtleties about the quality of data, its provenance, what kinds of conclusions it can support, and what kinds it can't support. These are subtle kinds of notions that need to be articulated by people rather than technologies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> While we were on the topic of data discovery, I asked Jeni if she had some tips for organizations around how to assess the quality of data that's available to be shared. After all, in research we conducted last year, more than a third of senior executives admitted that the data their organizations use to make the most critical decisions is of a somewhat low quality.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Tennison:</emphasis> Data quality is a really tricky issue. I think one thing to be very mindful of is that quality is associated with use. It's quality for use rather than quality per se. So the same data might be of completely adequate quality for one set of conclusions and completely dreadful for another set of conclusions.</p><p>So that's when we come down to this need to really, really understand the problem that you want to apply that data to in order to understand whether the quality of the data that you're getting can match that use.</p><p>Now, there are some bits about quality that are very obvious, very standard. Things like completeness, missing values, standardization, or lack of standardization are the kinds of things that can be assessed by tools, that you can get scores on. And that, of course, can help inform a decision about whether that data is fit for purpose or how much work you're going to have to do in order to get it fit for purpose for the work that you want to do.</p><p>But much more important when it comes to quality is where it comes from, how it was collected, what kinds of biases there may have been in that collection, what kind of error rates there are. That's much more qualitative information.</p><p>That information can be extremely hard for a third party who's assessing data to actually get hold of. And this, I think, is where we come to the bit that is really one of our biggest challenges around sharing of data: getting the originator of data to describe all of that background information about how the data came into being, which can enable really informed choices about the degree to which it can be trusted, the degree to which you can draw particular conclusions of the backfit.</p><p>Getting organizations to articulate that is very, very hard. We've been trained to think of the kind of metadata that we need to supply around data sets as being very factual kinds of things. When was it created? Who is responsible for it?</p><p>We need to really be learning from statisticians and the way in which they provide the full methodology-real details from statisticians, from scientists, about how they think of describing the real detail of where data has arisen from-so that we can get into a state where it's actually possible for third parties to assess whether data can be used for the particular purpose they want to use it for.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David DeLallo:</emphasis> And with that final insight from my interesting conversation with Jeni, we bring this episode to a close. We hope you enjoyed listening and that you'll check out the other podcasts we have available for you on this and other McKinsey podcast channels.

Please see hard copy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">cc: PA </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Subject: A hard-headed guide to </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">corporate diversity </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dear David,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YOU FACE pressure to \"do something\" about diversity in your company\u2014not only from your wife and woke children. Corporate clients increasingly demand it in your supply chain. Regulators, who use a \"stable\" or \"inclusive\" culture as a proxy for low risk, are breathing down your neck. Governments like Britain's, which now mandates pay-gap reporting, insist on making more of your sensitive data public. And employees, including former ones, can air their complaints on social media. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Small wonder that 87% of your fellow bosses told consultants at PwC that diversity is a business priority. I'm sure you did, too. After all, you recently posted a job opening for a diversity manager. You were not alone; the number of such offers in Britain has doubled in the past year, say analysts at Glassdoor, a recruitment website. Since June 2017 more than 800 American CEOs have signed a pledge to \"advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace\". </p><p>That is where we are: lots of talk, plenty of initiatives, little change on the ground. Between 2015 and 2018 the share of female executives at large (mostly) American and British firms went from 12% to 14%; for ethnic minorities it moved from 12% to 13%. The FTSE 100 has fewer female CEOs (six) than it does bosses who share your name (seven). In American companies with over 100 employees, the share of black men in management was 3.4% in 2017, half their share in the population as a whole\u2014and virtually unchanged from 3% in 1985. White women make up 25% of executives and senior managers, compared with 60% for white men. Something is clearly amiss.</p><p>In the past this letter would have gone straight to your legal department. Since the term \"diversity\" entered the corporate lexicon in the 1960s it has been code for avoiding lawsuits\u2014especially in America, where companies have coughed up billions in fines for discrimination over the years. The financial sector still treats it mostly as a compliance issue. </p><p>Now you are no doubt tempted to forward it to someone in HR, almost certainly a woman with an arts degree, a sound moral compass and too little power. Don't. This is your problem. Without your leadership it is unlikely to be solved soon.</p><p>Deep inside, you may be wondering if anything really needs solving. The short answer is: it does. With that in mind, you should ask yourself three things. </p><p>First, why does diversity matter to your firm? Is your reputation in trouble, as it was for Uber, Nike, Lloyd's of London and others scarred by #MeToo? Do you, like consumer giants such as P&amp;G, hope that more diversity makes for better products? Are you concerned about attracting and retaining bright sparks? You would be in good company: 97% of executives fret about increased competition for talent (according to Mercer's HR consultants). </p><p>Or are you hoping that diversity will boost the bottom line? To be perfectly honest, I have no idea if it does. It is hard to tell if diversity helps firms do well, or if successful firms are also more enlightened on other matters. But variety has been linked to innovation, productivity and, for example in diverse teams of surgeons, fewer mistakes. Lack of it breeds groupthink\u2014which in turn can lead to disasters. The Bay of Pigs invasion and the Lehman Brothers collapse stemmed from narrow-mindedness. And employees who believe their firm cares about gender diversity are 40% more likely to be satisfied at work\u2014and possibly more productive as a result.</p><p>Once you have sorted out the why, consider where you want to get to. Some firms, like Facebook, Nike or P&amp;G, say they wish to mirror their customer base. Others are keen not to recruit from an artificially thin talent pool. Goldman Sachs claims its new entry-level recruitment targets\u201450% female and, in America, 14% Hispanic and 11% black\u2014are based on things like graduation rates. Clear goals make it easier to assess if you are on track. But make them attainable. Qantas's goal of 40% of its pilot intake to be female by 2028 is as admirable as it looks unrealistic: today just one in 20 pilots worldwide is a woman.</p><p>The third question concerns barriers that stop diverse talent from flourishing at your firm. Mapping how it flows through your organisation and where the blockages and leaks happen is a start. A McKinsey study of more than 300 companies identified the second step of the career ladder, from entry level to manager, as the \"broken rung\": for every 100 men only 72 women (and just 68 Hispanic and 58 black ones) earned that critical early promotion. When Google was losing women in disproportionate numbers it homed in on maternity as the principal cause; the technology giant increased maternity leave and support for mothers returning to work. </p><p>Staff surveys can help, provided they are large and comprehensive enough. After its #MeToo moment, Lloyd's, an insurance market, found that 45% of staff felt unable to raise concerns about improper conduct. Employees are now encouraged to speak up, including through a bullying-and-harassment helpline. A \"culture dashboard\" tracking progress on survey metrics will be published with the Lloyd's annual report.</p><p>Now you've got your diversity-and-inclusion priorities straight and diagnosed what needs fixing. Good. Before you order a rainbow float for a Pride parade and send staff on a micro-aggression avoidance course, here is what not to do.</p><p>American firms spend billions a year on training. Half of large ones have unconscious-bias seminars. Most of these \"D&amp;I\" programmes are a waste. Or worse: recent research from America shows that diversity statements can put off minorities, possibly because they perceive them as tokenism. Often, firms do D but forget I, which is about ensuring that the workforce is not just diverse, but thriving. Too many try to fix people instead of procedures. Training women to be more assertive in asking for a promotion or pay rise is pointless; they are just as likely to ask for these but also likelier to be seen as pushy when they do. Ushering your managers onto the \"Check Your Blind Spots bus\", currently touring America as part of the CEOs' drive, is unlikely to do much. \"Days of understanding\", popular in American offices, risk causing \"diversity fatigue\". It is hard to beat bias out of individuals\u2014easier to root it out of systems. </p><p>Take Silicon Valley. Big Tech has splurged on D&amp;I to little effect. Representation of blacks and Hispanics has been flat (see chart). Girls Who Code, an industry-sponsored NGO, found that a quarter of young women who applied for internships at tech firms said they were asked inappropriate or biased questions. Others reported being flirted with or demeaned. It's no use hiring diverse coders if the message then is: wear a hoodie and pretend to be a guy, or this is no place for you. They will underperform\u2014or flee, leaving you as undiverse as before. Firms that do not change their ways beyond recruitment see high attrition rates of diverse talent. A lack of diversity is a symptom of deeper problems that a few diversity hires won't mend.</p><p>At this point the how should be relatively clear. In a nutshell, it is all about creating a level playing field. When recruiting, software can mute biases by concealing giveaways to a candidate's gender or ethnic identity. These include names but also less obvious hints like the sports they play. If only the usual suspects apply, look harder. Specialised recruitment drives, such as visiting \"black\" colleges or advertising in women's forums, appear to work. The Bank of England no longer visits the Russell group of top universities, whose graduates apply in spades anyway, and focuses instead on less elite schools. BHP, an Anglo-Australian mining giant, broadened its search for female miners by recruiting from professions, such as nursing, with some similar skills. </p><p>In an effort to find trainees from different backgrounds, British law firms are trying \"contextual recruitment\". An applicant with Bs from a school where everyone got Cs may be more impressive than one with As from a place full of A* pupils. Rare, a recruitment firm, has developed software which screens candidates for disadvantage and gauges their outperformance against the average for their school.</p><p> Once in the workplace, the clearer your criteria for professional advancement, the better. Informality is the enemy of women and minorities. It perpetuates bias. Surveys of American engineers and lawyers found that female workers were nearly twice as likely as their male peers to be saddled with \"office housework\", like setting up meetings and conference calls. White men were likelier to be given careerenhancing tasks such as client meetings. </p><p>Sponsorship schemes are an effective way to ensure traditionally sidelined groups get a fair shot. PayScale, a pay-comparison site, found that employees with a sponsor made 11.6% more than those without. The Bank of England has offered most of its sponsorship places to ethnic-minority women. Staff surveys, if bite-sized but regular, can bring clarity to fuzzy inclusion metrics. \"Psychological safety\", lingo for an environment where people feel free to speak their mind, can be tracked with questions like \"are your ideas regularly attributed to someone else?\" or \"are you regularly interrupted in meetings?\" Rotating who chairs a meeting, or a firm word with loudmouths who dominates it, can help. </p><p>Many employers\u2014yourself included\u2014would be horrified to learn that they implicitly require employees who want to be considered leadership material to adjust their behaviour. Women shouldn't need to \"act like a man\", gay employees to \"act straight\" or people with frizzy hair to treat it to \"look professional\" (ie, white). Let grievances fester and your workers will lose motivation or simply leave.</p><p>That is a lot to take in. But unless you do, your most valuable resource\u2014workers\u2014will not be as good as it could be. Best to get ahead of the problem. It isn't that hard. And it can pay off mightily.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Shareholder</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-OS88S8U</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFM-62P1-JBKN-B027-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The quantity you get depends upon the taxes you paid and also your variety of years of registration. On top of that, partners are qualified to Social Safety and security settlements, which amount to half the perk made by a working spouse.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> Many people are qualified to an advantage based upon their very own profits, along with a spousal advantage based upon their companion's profits. Just one benefit at a time could be claimed.&lt;nl/&gt; For example, if Tom is entitled to a monthly benefit of $2,000, his other half Mary would certainly be entitled to one-half of Tom's advantage, or $1,000. Collectively, the couple might obtain $3,000 whenever they are both at full old age. Even if Mary has actually worked and also earned her very own benefits, she could choose to take whichever perk is higher - her very own, or fifty percent of Tom's. This versatility and the one-time choice to switch over from a spousal advantage to a personal advantage - or vice versa - supplies extraordinary possibility to maximize Social Safety and security payouts.&lt;nl/&gt; The right to obtain spousal benefits is just better in retired life preparation when you consider the following options offered to Social Safety and security beneficiaries. Making the right choices can significantly enhance regular monthly advantages, along with the complete funds received over a lifetime.&lt;nl/&gt;Early or Deferred Regular monthly Benefits Normal Retirement Age&lt;nl/&gt;Under Social Safety and security rules, your 'typical old age' is the legal age developed by Congress at which you or your spouse can get normal retirement perks. If you were born in 1960 or later on, it is age 67. &lt;nl/&gt;Early Retirement&lt;nl/&gt;Social Security enables key beneficiaries and also their spouses to start obtaining reduced Social Security benefits at age 62. The regular monthly perk quantity is decreased for each month prior to regular retirement age.&lt;nl/&gt; The adhering to examples illustrate the reduction in benefits due to taking an early retired life circulation: &lt;nl/&gt; Taking Perk at Age 62 With a Typical Retired life Age of 67. At her typical retired life age of 67, Mary would be qualified to a $1,000 month-to-month advantage. Electing to take her benefit at age 62 would certainly minimize it to $700. For the first 36 months, her benefit would be lowered by $200. For the added 24 months, her benefit would certainly be reduced an added $ONE HUNDRED. By taking advantages five years early, her complete regular monthly revenue of $1,000 would certainly be decreased by $300, leaving her a net of $700. Taking Advantage at Age 64 With a Normal Retired life Age of 67. At her normal retirement age of 67, Mary would certainly be qualified to a $1,000 regular monthly benefit. Electing to take her benefit at age 64, three years early, would certainly minimize her benefit by $200, bringing it down to $800. Taking Advantage at Age 66 With a Regular Retired life Age of 67. At her typical old age of 67, Mary would certainly be qualified to a $1,000 regular monthly advantage. Electing to take her advantage at age 66, one year early, would certainly decrease her benefit by $76.60, to $933.30. &lt;nl/&gt; The benefit quantity, when established, would certainly continue to be unchanged other than for cost-of-living increases for all future settlements. As a result of the serious decrease in benefit amounts, choosing very early circulation can be a pricey decision.&lt;nl/&gt;Deferred Retirement Age&lt;nl/&gt;Social Safety and security regulations enable you or your partner to delay advantages previous your normal old age, an important option if you are able to afford it. For each and every year up to age 70, your benefit enhances 8 % per annum. So if Mary is due to receive $1,000 at age 67, that number enhances to $1,240, or 24 %, if she waits until age 70. &lt;nl/&gt; Keep in mind that if you were born in 1960 or later on, there is no financial advantage in delaying invoice of your advantages past age 69. The monthly advantage increase is topped at 24 %. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; 'File and Suspend' Option&lt;nl/&gt;If individuals want their spouses to obtain Social Security yet wish to defer their own benefits, they might submit for as well as consequently suspend repayments. Tom can apply for his perk at age 66, therefore activating Mary's right to a spousal perk. Instead of taking his very own advantage, Tom could possibly suspend settlements until age 70 in order to becoming the greater deferred quantity. Mary might begin obtaining her month-to-month spousal perk instantly while delaying her very own perks until a later date. In this instance, the ability to 'switch over' from spousal benefits to one's very own perk is essential in making the most of the total received.&lt;nl/&gt;File as well as Suspend Considerations&lt;nl/&gt;The election to 'submit and suspend' is especially crucial in the following situations: &lt;nl/&gt; Tom continuouslies function, so if he were taking his Social Safety and security settlements currently, they would be strained at a higher price. As soon as Tom is at his regular retired life age, he does not need to bother with the probability that several of his perk might be recovered because of outdoors income. Mary is entitled to her own Social Safety and security advantage that is anticipated to be higher than her spousal profit from Tom. Making use of the spousal perk currently permits her very own perk to grow at 8 % each year till she changes to her very own account. If the couple had a financial emergency throughout the suspension duration, Tom could prefer to start perk settlements any time after his routine old age. Or, he can ask for a retroactive lump sum of regular monthly repayments that would have been paid to him if he had taken payments at complete retired life age, as opposed to delaying. If the latter option is taken, he would require to know revenue tax liability, along with boosted Medicare premiums.&lt;nl/&gt; Having excellent wellness and a desire of durability is necessary if you decide to use the 'file and suspend' method. When you postpone repayment, you're taking a gamble that you're visiting live enough time to 'destroy just' from a money circulation standpoint.&lt;nl/&gt;'Restricted Application' Option&lt;nl/&gt;Social Safety beneficiaries that are married to other Social Security recipients can apply for perks, but limit their application to the spousal perk, rather than attracting on their very own accounts. As an example, Expense as well as Jane retire at age 67 and also anticipate to live out their complete life expectations of 16.1 and 18.6 additional years, specifically, baseding on the Social Safety and security Management. Each anticipate a $2,000 month-to-month benefit based upon their lifetime earnings.&lt;nl/&gt; Bill as well as Jane have three alternatives: &lt;nl/&gt; Both Take Their Advantages at Age 67. The couple obtains $2,000 for Expense and also $2,000 for Jane, or a complete $4,000 month-to-month. If the couple lives 16 extra years, they stand to make $772,800. Both Defer Benefits Up until Age 70. Costs as well as Jane postpone perks till age 70, entitling each to obtain $2,480 or a total amount of $4,960. If Bill lives to be 84 years of age, the couple's cumulative revenues total up to $839,232. Nevertheless, Expense has to live to at the very least age 83 in order to make up for the very first 4 years of deferred payments. Mix and Match. In this instance, one spouse takes a regular advantage at age 67 while the various other takes a spousal perk. Jane apply for her regular advantage of $2,000 while Costs utilizes the restricted application to apply for spousal perks of $1,000 each month, deferring his own advantages until age 70. Once he gets to 70 and changes to his very own advantage, he obtains $2,480 monthly (because of the deferred advantage). Bill and also Jane's joint earnings at this factor would certainly be $4,480 each month. Presuming Bill lives to age 83, the couple can expect to collect $806,880 in total benefits.&lt;nl/&gt; These decisions are often complex as well as depend after the one-of-a-kind situations of each couple. If you're at all unsure which circulation alternative corrects for you, speak with a monetary advisor.&lt;nl/&gt;Widow or Widower Benefit&lt;nl/&gt;A enduring partner is qualified to a quantity as much as ONE HUNDRED % of the departed spouse's perk, assuming the surviving spouse is at retirement age. The copying illustrate the estimation of perks: &lt;nl/&gt; If Tom has a $2,000 perk, and Mary has elected to receive half of Tom's Social Security for a $1,000 spousal perk, both have a complete regular monthly earnings of $3,000. At Tom's death, Mary would certainly continue accumulating a $2,000 perk, but would certainly no longer be qualified for her $1,000 spousal benefit. John as well as Betty each draw $2,000 regular monthly based after their specific earnings for an overall earnings of $4,000 monthly. At John's fatality, Betty would certainly not get a widow's perk considering that her Social Safety incomes are equal to John's. She would continuously obtain $2,000. Carol obtains $2,000 while Joe receives $1,200, for a consolidated family members earnings of $3,200. At Carol's fatality, Joe would certainly obtain $2,000, the precise amount of his deceased spouse's benefit.&lt;nl/&gt; If the dead spouse obtained decreased advantages due to early elections, the widow and also widower advantages would certainly be minimized accordingly. If the dead spouse had actually deferred taking repayments till past the normal retirement age, the widow and widower perk would be increased.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Factors to Think about When Electing Spousal Benefits&lt;nl/&gt;Calculations of Social Safety and security advantages should be complexed depending upon the earning records of each partner, and the age at which they begin drawing benefits. Prior to making a resolution for your retired life, take into consideration the following.&lt;nl/&gt;The Health of Each Spouse&lt;nl/&gt;Social Safety benefits continue till the month after the fatality of the recipient. Poor health and wellness of one or both spouses must influence your choice concerning when to start advantages. For example, a high-earning partner sick could elect to delay taking settlements past normal retired life age in order to maximize the widow or widower advantage. Conversely, the finest choice might be to take advantages early in order to take pleasure in time together.&lt;nl/&gt;Other Retirement Assets and Income&lt;nl/&gt;Deferring your Social Protection benefits supplies a substantial market return of 8 % yearly. From 1928 to 2013, the typical return for the S...00 has actually been 11.50 %, baseding on the Federal Reserve data source in St. Louis. In the last 10 years, market volatility has varied from a loss of 36.55 % to a revenue of 32.15 %. For some people, an 8 % return is a secure and also welcome option.&lt;nl/&gt;Projected Social Safety and security Perks of Each Earner&lt;nl/&gt;In cases where one partner has made significantly greater than the other, the advantages might be dramatically various. If Tony spent his profession in bookkeeping, he might be entitled to a regular monthly advantage of $1,800. His wife Pam could have functioned as a pediatrician and also is qualified to benefit of $2,400. This difference permits most couples to handle their advantages to ideal suit their requirements, whether for optimal revenue currently or in the future.&lt;nl/&gt; Tony as well as Pam have a variety of choices when they start their benefits at retired life age, consisting of these 2: &lt;nl/&gt; Tony could file for his benefits, receiving $1,800 per month. Pam can submit and also suspend her very own repayment, electing rather to get spousal gain from Tony's account, amounting to $900. This would enable her to postpone her perks for 3 years until age 70, at which time she might switch over to her own account and also begin receiving $2,976 each month. For the rest of their lives, their complete earnings would certainly be $4,776. In case of one partner's fatality, the advantage would go back to $2,976 for the individual. Pam can apply for her advantages in her own business, getting $2,400 each month. Tony can choose to take a spousal perk of $1,200 and delay his perks for 3 years up until age 70. At age 70, Tony could change to his very own account as well as begin receiving $2,232 monthly. For the rest of their lives, their complete earnings would be $4,632. In case of one companion's fatality, the advantage would certainly go back to $2,400 for the individual.&lt;nl/&gt; Deciding which partner takes the spousal advantage could originally be based upon life span and forecasted benefit amounts. At age 67, a female is expected to live nearly 2 and also a half years much longer compared to a male. Your calculations must take into consideration the result upon widow or widower benefits.&lt;nl/&gt;General Concepts for Choosing Social Protection Benefits&lt;nl/&gt;Deciding when to start Social Safety advantages must just be done after cautious analysis. The overall perk for 2 people should easily total up to numerous countless bucks, and an incorrect decision could be costly. Seeking guidance from a licensed economic organizer is recommended.&lt;nl/&gt; When determining the best ways to make an application for benefits, a couple ought to consider the following: &lt;nl/&gt; Avoid the Early Retired life Alternative if Possible. The reduction in benefit as a result of layoff is punishing, so unless the demand for earnings is extreme, hesitate till you reach your typical retired life age prior to beginning circulations. Naturally, if an individual is in disease as well as is not likely to endure to their normal old age, taking early distributions is economically sound. Simply do not fail to remember that taking very early perks likewise decreases the month-to-month widow or widower perks received by the making it through spouse. Delay the Begin of Benefits Until Age 70. An 8 % delayed assured return is hard to attain in today's volatile markets, just if you agree to take considerable assets dangers. While delayed advantages could be a strong economic decision, ensure you're able to replace that missing revenue from job or other investments. Beneficiaries With Nonworking Partners Must Constantly File and also Suspend. Delaying spousal perks for a nonworking partner seldom makes economic sense. For instance, the key advantage owner that was qualified to $1,000 monthly would at some point get $1,240 by postponing settlement. At the exact same time, the spousal benefit would certainly enhance from $500 to $620. The 3 years of deferred repayments would total $18,000, needing 12 as well as a fifty percent years just to 'recover cost.' The partner needs to instead start gathering promptly, using data as well as suspend. Higher Wage Earners Ought to Defer as well as Utilize the Spousal Benefit. Greater earning partners electing the spousal benefit can let their accounts enhance and afterwards switch to them at age 70. Although this might result in a disproportionately minimized revenue during the deferral years, it sets the couple for a much better perk in the years thereafter. Use the Greater of the Spousal Advantage or Your Companion's Entitled Benefit. The higher settlement consistently continues with the widow or widower benefit.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt; Possibilities ...d results for a Regular Resigning Couple&lt;nl/&gt;Matt and Sylvia are age 67, their typical retired life ages.

At that factor, the combined perk would be $4,712 - Matt's delayed perk of $2,852, plus Sylvia's postponed benefit of $1,860.

This was done without the consent that is a legal requirement in the UK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's advertising arm DoubleClick was by far the most common destination for data, showing up on 78 per cent of the sites tested, followed by Amazon, which was present in 48 per cent of cases, Facebook, Microsoft and adtech firm AppNexus.</p><p>'These findings are quite remarkable, and very concerning,' said Wolfie Christl, a technologist and researcher who has been investigating the adtech industry. 'From my perspective, this kind of data is clearly sensitive, has special protections under the [General Data Protection Regulation] and transmitting this data most likely violates the law.'</p><p>Health for sale</p><p>For centuries, physicians have sworn the Hippocratic oath, to keep secret 'whatever I see or hear in the lives of my patients'.</p><p>But hundreds of millions of people now turn to the web each day to allay their medical worries, which range from the mundane to the grave. Despite the illusion of privacy that exists between users and their computers, the reality is starkly different.</p><p>A network diagram showing the flow of user data from the health website BabCenter.com on 7th November 2019. There are a plethora of connections including to Big Tech advertising (Facebook, Google), Programmatic advertising and contextual advertising</p><p>Digging deeper into 10 of the sites, chosen to reflect the different types of health information they offer to users, the FT looked at the types of data they were sharing.</p><p>The investigation excluded data sent to analytics companies to improve the performance of a website, and consent was given for cookies on all the websites that requested it. The privacy policies the FT reporters consented to did not adequately outline that this sensitive data would be shared with third parties, however, or for what purposes.</p><p>The data shared included:</p><p>drug names entered into Drugs.com were sent to Google's ad unit DoubleClick.</p><p>symptoms inputted into WebMD's symptom checker, and diagnoses received, including 'drug overdose', were shared with Facebook.</p><p>menstrual and ovulation cycle information from BabyCentre ended up with Amazon Marketing, among others.</p><p>keywords such as 'heart disease' and 'considering abortion' were shared from sites like the British Heart Foundation, Bupa and Healthline to companies including Scorecard Research and Blue Kai (owned by software giant Oracle).</p><p>In eight cases (with the exception of Healthline and Mind), a specific identifier linked to the web browser was also transmitted - potentially allowing the information to be tied to an individual - and tracker cookies were dropped before consent was given. Healthline confirmed that it also shared unique identifiers with third parties.</p><p>'Data silos of undesirables'</p><p>Since the adoption of the Europe-wide General Data Protection Regulation in May 2018, the EU online advertising industry, which makes $55bn of annual sales, has been subject to tighter rules around the collection and processing of data.</p><p>It is now illegal for advertisers to share the most sensitive data, including on health and sexual orientation, without explicit consent, where the user agrees to the specific sharing of their 'special category' data, and is told how it will be used and by whom.</p><p>None of the websites tested asked for this type of explicit and detailed consent.</p><p>The ultimate destinations of the personal and sensitive data collected and shared by the websites was opaque, as it was not visible via an internet browser.</p><p>Research into the 'data broker' industry shows that dozens of companies profit from buying and selling data to multiple clients who want to better understand users.</p><p>Experts believe that the predictive models built by the plethora of advertising and data-targeting companies may use ill health to profile and prey on users.</p><p>Knowledge of an individual's medical ailments allows companies to try to sell specific treatments, services or financial products that desperate users might turn to.</p><p>'There is a whole system that will seek to take advantage of you because you're in a compromised state. I find that morally repugnant,' said Tim Libert, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon university, who built the open source WebXray tool used by the FT, and specialises in the social and legal implications of online ad tracking.</p><p>Previous research in which Mr Libert analysed 80,000 unique pages relating to common diseases found that more than 91 per cent contacted third parties in the US. The paper explains that holding such sensitive data on a person can result in discriminatory marketing, even without marketers knowing their identity.</p><p>'As medical expenses leave many with less to spend on luxuries, these users may be segregated into 'data silos' of undesirables who are then excluded from favourable offers and prices,' Mr Libert wrote. 'This forms a subtle, but real, form of discrimination against those perceived to be ill.'</p><p>In the UK, the online advertising industry was put on watch in June by the regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office. It gave the industry until December to clean up its data practices, or face further probes.</p><p>'This investigation by the Financial Times further highlights the ICO's concerns about the processing of special category data in online advertising, as well as the role that site owners and publishers play in this ecosystem,' said Simon McDougall, the ICO's executive director for technology policy and innovation.</p><p>'Special category data - such as health information - requires greater protection because of its sensitivity and the increased risk of harm to or discrimination against individuals. We will be assessing the information provided by the FT before considering our next steps,' he added.</p><p>The advertisers' defence</p><p>Google, which powers the online advertising industry, said that it 'does not build advertising profiles from sensitive data?.?.?.?and has strict policies preventing advertisers from using such data to target ads'.</p><p>It told the FT that the named sites investigated had been marked as 'sensitive' internally, meaning the information that we found being sent to them was specifically excluded from the database used for personalised advertising. It said that its technology might be used to serve 'contextual' ads, based on the contents of the page, but not user information.</p><p>The company explained that if a publisher chose to include information like the date of its visitor's last period in the URL, it could be sent to Google as part of an ad request from that page. But Google's ads systems would not understand what that URL data represents, nor use it to create profiles of users.</p><p>The sensitive data could be used for a variety of other reasons, including protecting against fraud and abuse and measuring the engagement with an advert, Google said.</p><p>Facebook, another frequent tracker across the sites we surveyed, which also received data on highly sensitive symptoms and diagnoses, was not able to confirm what it does with this information. 'We don't want websites sharing people's personal health information with us - it's a violation of our rules, and we enforce against sites we find doing this,' a company spokesperson said. 'We're conducting an investigation and will take action against those sites in violation of our terms.'</p><p>Amazon said: 'We do not use the information from publisher websites to inform advertising audience segments,' but it did not confirm what it did with the sensitive data is received, such as user-input fertility information.</p><p>It was unclear if either Facebook or Amazon also received personal identifiers, such as an IP address or a unique ID, alongside health data.</p><p>The companies also emphasised that the publishers of the websites were required to manage user consent and the type of data sent to third parties.</p><p>'It's like a bar saying we don't like to serve people that are underage, they shouldn't come here to drink,' Mr Libert said. 'They are being negligent and it's deeply disingenuous.'</p><p>Meanwhile the website publishers themselves did not provide details of why the data was being shared or what would be done with it once it left their hands. A WebMD spokesperson said: '[W]e only use, collect or share user information to the extent disclosed in our privacy policy.' The policy reviewed by the FT did not appear to provide clear answers about the fate of the data.</p><p>Bar chart of Number of the UK's top 100 health websites that contacted advertisers showing Google was the biggest recipient of data from top health websites</p><p>Condensed comments from other companies that responded are published at the end of this article. Others contacted, including Lotame, Co ore, AppNexus, Drugs.com, Health.com and Bounty, did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>As the ICO's deadline for online ad auction firms to audit themselves approaches, it will be a time of reckoning for many in the industry that was until recently self-regulated.</p><p>'The internet has turned into a privacy wasteland. But there's a suspension of disbelief in the [ad] industry. Companies say they are GDPR-compliant, there's a codependency where everybody pretends everything is OK, but the deep technical architecture is fundamentally incompatible with the right to privacy,' Mr Libert said.</p><p>'Ultimately it's going to be the ICO that decides, and based on early guidance, I suspect they may not be a willing participant in this fictional world built by online advertisers.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY14112019000519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH9-BDF1-JCH9-G3TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0007GVW</classCode><className>BRITISH UNITED PROVIDENT ASSOCIATION LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0003PRY</classCode><className>BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This was done without the consent that is a legal requirement in the UK.</p><p>Google\u2019s advertising arm DoubleClick was by far the most common destination for data, showing up on 78 per cent of the sites tested, followed by Amazon, which was present in 48 per cent of cases, Facebook, Microsoft and adtech firm AppNexus.</p><p>\u201cThese findings are quite remarkable, and very concerning,\u201d said Wolfie Christl, a technologist and researcher who has been investigating the adtech industry. \u201cFrom my perspective, this kind of data is clearly sensitive, has special protections under the [ General Data Protection Regulation] and transmitting this data most likely violates the law.\u201d</p><p>Health for sale</p><p>For centuries, physicians have sworn the Hippocratic oath, to keep secret \u201cwhatever I see or hear in the lives of my patients\u201d.</p><p>But hundreds of millions of people now turn to the web each day to allay their medical worries, which range from the mundane to the grave. Despite the illusion of privacy that exists between users and their computers, the reality is starkly different.</p><p>Digging deeper into 10 of the sites, chosen to reflect the different types of health information they offer to users, the FT looked at the types of data they were sharing.\u00a0</p><p>The investigation excluded data sent to analytics companies to improve the performance of a website, and consent was given for cookies on all the websites that requested it. The privacy policies the FT reporters consented to did not adequately outline that this sensitive data would be shared with third parties, however, or for what purposes.</p><p>The data shared included:\u00a0</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>drug names entered into Drugs.com were sent to Google\u2019s ad unit DoubleClick.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>symptoms inputted into WebMD\u2019s symptom checker, and diagnoses received, including \u201cdrug overdose\u201d, were shared with Facebook.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>menstrual and ovulation cycle information from BabyCentre ended up with Amazon Marketing, among others.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>keywords such as \u201cheart disease\u201d and \u201cconsidering abortion\u201d were shared from sites like the British Heart Foundation, Bupa and Healthline to companies including Scorecard Research and Blue Kai (owned by software giant Oracle).</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>In eight cases (with the exception of Healthline and Mind), a specific identifier linked to the web browser was also transmitted \u2014 potentially allowing the information to be tied to an individual \u2014 and tracker cookies were dropped before consent was given. Healthline confirmed that it also shared unique identifiers with third parties.</p><p>\u2018Data silos of undesirables\u2019</p><p>Since the adoption of the Europe-wide General Data Protection Regulation in May 2018, the EU online advertising industry, which makes $55bn of annual sales, has been subject to tighter rules around the collection and processing of data.</p><p>It is now illegal for advertisers to share the most sensitive data, including on health and sexual orientation,\u00a0without explicit consent, where the user agrees to the specific sharing of their \u201cspecial category\u201d data, and is told how it will be used and by whom.</p><p>None of the websites tested asked for this type of explicit and detailed consent.</p><p>The ultimate destinations of the personal and sensitive data collected and shared by the websites was opaque, as it was not visible via an internet browser.\u00a0</p><p>Research into the \u201cdata broker\u201d industry shows that dozens of companies profit from buying and selling data to multiple clients who want to better understand users.\u00a0</p><p>Experts believe that the predictive models built by the plethora of advertising and data-targeting companies may use ill health to profile and prey on users.</p><p>Knowledge of an individual\u2019s medical ailments allows companies to try to sell specific treatments, services or financial products that desperate users might turn to.</p><p>\u201cThere is a whole system that will seek to take advantage of you because you\u2019re in a compromised state. I find that morally repugnant,\u201d said Tim Libert, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon university, who built the open source WebXray tool used by the FT, and specialises in the social and legal implications of online ad tracking.</p><p>Previous research in which Mr Libert <url normalizedValue=\"https://timlibert.me/pdf/Libert-2015-Health_Privacy_on_Web.pdf\"> analysed</url> 80,000 unique pages relating to common diseases found that more than 91 per cent contacted third parties in the US. The paper explains that holding such sensitive data on a person can result in discriminatory marketing, even without marketers knowing their identity.</p><p>\u201cAs medical expenses leave many with less to spend on luxuries, these users may be segregated into \u2018data silos\u2019 of undesirables who are then excluded from favourable offers and prices,\u201d Mr Libert wrote. \u201cThis forms a subtle, but real, form of discrimination against those perceived to be ill.\u201d</p><p>In the UK, the online advertising industry was\u00a0 put on watch\u00a0 in June by the regulator, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. It gave the industry until December to clean up its data practices, or face further probes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis investigation by the Financial Times further highlights the ICO\u2019s concerns about the processing of special category data in online advertising, as well as the role that site owners and publishers play in this ecosystem,\u201d said Simon McDougall, the ICO\u2019s executive director for technology policy and innovation.</p><p>\u201cSpecial category data \u2014 such as health information \u2014 requires greater protection because of its sensitivity and the increased risk of harm to or discrimination against individuals. We will be assessing the information provided by the FT before considering our next steps,\u201d he added.</p><p>The advertisers\u2019 defence</p><p>Google, which powers the online advertising industry, said that it \u201cdoes not build advertising profiles from sensitive data\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and has strict policies preventing advertisers from using such data to target ads\u201d.</p><p>It told the FT that the named sites investigated had been marked as \u201csensitive\u201d internally, meaning the information that we found being sent to them was specifically excluded from the database used for personalised advertising. It said that its technology might be used to serve \u201ccontextual\u201d ads, based on the contents of the page, but not user information.</p><p>The company explained that if a publisher chose to include information like the date of its visitor\u2019s last period in the URL, it could be sent to Google as part of an ad request from that page. But Google\u2019s ads systems would not understand what that URL data represents, nor use it to create profiles of users.</p><p>The sensitive data could be used for a variety of other reasons, including protecting against fraud and abuse and measuring the engagement with an advert, Google said.</p><p>Facebook, another frequent tracker across the sites we surveyed, which also received data on highly sensitive symptoms and diagnoses, was not able to confirm what it does with this information. \u201cWe don\u2019t want websites sharing people\u2019s personal health information with us \u2014 it\u2019s a violation of our rules, and we enforce against sites we find doing this,\u201d a company spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019re conducting an investigation and will take action against those sites in violation of our terms.\u201d</p><p>Methodology</p><p>We carried out our analysis on August 29 2019, based on a list of the top 100 health sites produced by SimilarWeb based on average UK monthly traffic as of July 2019. We ran this list through WebXray, an open-source tool that opens each site and records all the subsequent \u201crequests\u201d made to third parties, and also used HTTP Toolkit to look more closely at what data were specifically being received by third parties.</p><p>It should be noted that our investigation represents only a limited view, since we could not see what happened to data beyond the user\u2019s browser, and that it is a snapshot in time: if the experiment were repeated, even on the same computer in the same location, it is likely the results would vary.</p><p>Amazon said: \u201cWe do not use the information from publisher websites to inform advertising audience segments,\u201d but it did not confirm what it did with the sensitive data it received, such as user-input fertility information.</p><p>It was unclear if either Facebook or Amazon also received personal identifiers, such as an IP address or a unique ID, alongside health data.</p><p>The companies also emphasised that the publishers of the websites were required to manage user consent and the type of data sent to third parties.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a bar saying we don\u2019t like to serve people that are underage, they shouldn\u2019t come here to drink,\u201d Mr Libert said. \u201cThey are being negligent and it\u2019s deeply disingenuous.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile the website publishers themselves did not provide details of why the data was being shared or what would be done with it once it left their hands. A WebMD spokesperson said: \u201c[W]e only use, collect or share user information to the extent disclosed in our privacy policy.\u201d The policy reviewed by the FT did not appear to provide clear answers about the fate of the data.</p><p>Condensed comments from other companies that responded are published at the end of this article. Others contacted, including Lotame, ComScore, AppNexus, Drugs.com, Health.com and Bounty, did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>As the ICO\u2019s deadline for online ad auction firms to audit themselves approaches, it will be a time of reckoning for many in the industry that was until recently self-regulated.</p><p>\u201cThe internet has turned into a privacy wasteland. But there\u2019s a suspension of disbelief in the [ad] industry. Companies say they are GDPR-compliant, there\u2019s a codependency where everybody pretends everything is OK, but the deep technical architecture is fundamentally incompatible with the right to privacy,\u201d Mr Libert said.</p><p>\u201cUltimately it\u2019s going to be the ICO that decides, and based on early guidance, I suspect they may not be a willing participant in this fictional world built by online advertisers.\u201d</p><p>Further company responses</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bupa</emphasis>: \u201cAdvertising cookies are used on our site but we have set them so that no personal data about visitors to our website, including our health information pages, is passed on to third parties.</p><p>\u201cUnique IDs are shared with some third parties in order to measure website performance and engagement. This is anonymised data and is not personally identifiable. No health information of visitors to our website is shared with third parties.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BabyCenter</emphasis>: \u201cOur privacy and consent statements clearly indicate that we may use data including due date to personalise content and ads. BabyCenter would only pass personal data to third parties after consent is given. As of August 19, 2019, BabyCenter is under new ownership and will be rolled under Everyday Health Group\u2019s GDPR and data privacy consent policies and practices in line with the digital properties in its portfolio.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">British Heart Foundation</emphasis>: \u201cThe data captured by the cookies on our website is protected (pseudonymised) so it doesn\u2019t directly identify individuals. We don\u2019t sell data and we don\u2019t share sensitive personal data on areas such as ethnic origin and health that could directly identify people.</p><p>\u201cTo reflect recent changes in guidelines we are reviewing how we use cookies and how we seek consent for their use when people visit our website. In the coming months, we will be implementing a new version of our cookies model.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t share or sell sensitive personal information that could directly identify an individual. We only share information about pages that devices have visited, for example the URL.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Healthline</emphasis>: \u201cOf the eight platforms you referenced, five are service providers and are not used by Healthline.com for advertising. Facebook, Pinterest and Trade Desk are platforms we may use for re-marketing. However, the data we pass to these platforms is for our use only and is subject to data protection agreements.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mind</emphasis>: \u201cSince the Information Commissioner published updated guidance about cookies in July, we have been reviewing our practice, including an audit of tracking across our website. As a result of a report published by Privacy International in September, we have removed marketing trackers from our site and won\u2019t reinstate them until our review has finished and we are satisfied we\u2019re using them appropriately.</p><p>\u201cNo data is being explicitly shared with Google DoubleClick through the Mind.org.uk site, however Google sets its own DoubleClick cookies via other Google products to support development and optimisation.</p><p>\u201cWe have never sold or shared, and will never sell or share, any of our website users\u2019 personal information with organisations so that they can be contacted for any marketing activities. Nor do we sell any information about our website users\u2019 web browsing activity.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle</emphasis>: \u201cRegarding BlueKai, any site setting a BlueKai cookie is required to collect data in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In addition, Oracle Data Cloud has implemented processes designed to prevent the ingest of third-party data from EU-based users for the sites you reference. Finally, Oracle Data Cloud does not create or offer any sensitive third-party audience segments on consumers in the EU.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">These responses have been condensed</emphasis></p><p>Big tech and personal data</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">See below more coverage of the evolving relationship between tech companies and consumers\u2019 personal information</emphasis></p><p>Google to limit advertiser\u2019s access to user data<br/>Publishers warn that move could further entrench search group\u2019s dominance</p><p>Apple launches research app in bid to gather users\u2019 health data<br/>Company hopes millions of users will opt in for array of medical studies</p><p>Google in talks to move into banking<br/>Group\u2019s interest comes after steps by Apple and Facebook into financial services</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional research by Edwin Esosa.

The rest of the world can no doubt also learn from the New Zealand inquiry's findings, but all democracies should be putting measures in place to counter far-right extremism before it reaches the radar of intelligence services or police.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Christchurch attack shocked the world, but not those of us that have studied the far-right and its flourishing transnational online ecosystem. Representing nearly half of all referrals to the UK government's counter-extremism program in 2017-2018 and the vast majority of extremist-related killings in the U.S. in recent years, the far-right has inspired violence within its ranks while also pushing its ideas out to mainstream audiences largely unabated.</p><p>Analysis by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in 2017 of public Facebook pages in the U.K. unearthed some 40,000 accounts engaging with hateful far-right views, compared to only 2,000 engaging with Islamist extremist views.</p><p>But despite the clear threat, efforts by governments and the private sector to stem Islamist violent extremism online simply have not been matched by efforts against far-right extremism.</p><p>The U.K., for example, has public and private sector frameworks, technology and personnel in place to deal with a range of harmful content, including child pornography and Islamist violent extremism. But they failed to cope with the thousands of attempts to repost and modify the Christchurch terrorist's video in order to bypass filters. While tech giants have come under increased pressure from European governments to remove illegal content, these platforms have struggled to meet the scale of the problem.</p><p>One urgent need is for the companies to work with experts in order to train their human and machine-learning systems to better identify far-right content and accounts against the backdrop of this fast evolving threat. However, this will not address the problem posed by the wider online ecosystem.</p><p>Extremists have increasingly migrated to alternative online spaces where moderation is either limited or non-existent. Forums such as 4chan and 8chan, messaging apps such as Telegram and Gab, and gaming platforms like Discord, act as virtual safe havens for hateful propaganda and even the mobilization and planning of illegal activities. Efforts need to be made by governments to ensure offline laws are applied effectively to all these online spaces.</p><p>When it comes to existing laws addressing hate speech, harassment and even terrorism, enforcement focuses heavily on explicit incitement to violence or affiliation with proscribed groups - both a relatively small part of the problematic behavior that drives extremist sub-cultures and ecosystems. So what do we do about content that sits in a legal gray zone - such as the would-be manifesto of the New Zealand attacker - objectionable and hateful but not necessarily illegal?</p><p>Firstly, our educational programs need to be fit for the digital age. Improving digital literacy and enabling people - young and old -- to identify propaganda and understand how the platforms serve them content and use their data is essential.</p><p>There are some promising programs that do this, but they are not delivered at the scale we need. Governments should move to integrate digital citizenship education into national curriculums.</p><p>Our second line of effort must focus on equipping civil society with the tools and skills to compete more effectively with extreme voices in our new digital ecosystem. Civil society organizations like ours have worked in partnership with tech companies and experts to trial innovative community-based solutions. These include tools for local authorities to analyze online hate speech in their communities and its impact on hate crimes, one-to-one engagements with those expressing violent extremist views and promoting alternative content for those searching for extremist material. These types of projects, however, struggle to get past the pilot phase and need to be scaled up significantly to have an impact on the problem.</p><p>The virtual elephant in the room though are the products and algorithms deployed by tech companies that tip the scales towards hateful, extreme voices over the majority of us who oppose them. Engagement-powered newsfeeds still disproportionately influence public discourse. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that users engage with the most controversial content on his platform, and its architecture still encourages this.</p><p>European governments are moving closer to regulation of social media companies, with Germany having already enacted legislation (NetzDG, which fines platforms if they fail to remove flagged illegal content within 24 hours) and the U.K. is due to publish its plans in the coming weeks. Their focus so far has only been on big tech and on content moderation. They must also look at ways to encourage changes to the distortive impact of the platforms' technological architecture, as well as the wider tech/media ecosystem.</p><p>Extremism is, and always has been, a pan-ideological phenomenon. We need to apply existing laws more effectively to the online world and dedicate the resources and solutions built up focusing on Islamist-inspired extremism to the far-right threat. Without a more robust effort by democratic countries to come to a consensus on internet governance, virtual hate will continue to have devastating real world consequences.</p><p>Sasha Havlicek is the founder and CEO of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.</p><p>Zahed Amanullah is a resident senior fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

These types of projects, however, struggle to get past the pilot phase and need to be scaled up significantly to have an impact on the problem.</p><p>[readmore]913265[/readmore]</p><p>The virtual elephant in the room, though, is the products and algorithms deployed by tech companies that tip the scales towards hateful, extreme voices over the majority of us who oppose them. Engagement-powered newsfeeds still disproportionately influence public discourse. Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has admitted that users engage with the most controversial content on his platform, and its architecture still encourages this.</p><p>European governments are moving closer to regulation of social media companies, with Germany having already enacted legislation (NetzDG, which fines platforms if they fail to remove flagged illegal content within 24 hours) and with Britain due to publish its plans in the coming weeks. Their focus, so far, has only been on big tech and on content-moderation. They must also look at ways to encourage changes to the distortive impact of the platforms' technological architecture, as well as the wider tech/media ecosystem.</p><p>Extremism is a pan-ideological phenomenon. We need to apply existing laws more effectively to the online world and dedicate the resources and solutions built up focusing on Islamist-inspired extremism to the far-right threat. Without a more robust effort by democratic countries to come to a consensus on internet governance, virtual hate will continue to have devastating, real-world consequences.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-913488</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-W911-JCW9-22W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

It sounds bonkers, but can actually be highly lucrative. Just ask investors in Amazon, Twitter or Ocado.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taxi hailing app Uber was the latest loss-making firm to motor on to the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, completing one of the most highly anticipated US floats in recent years.</p><p>While its shares stalled from the $45 offer price, falling 1.2pc or $0.75 to $44.25 a few hours into trading, this still gave it a market value of about \u00a362bn, putting it squarely among America's listed giants.</p><p>But despite the enormous price tag, Uber has never made a profit.</p><p>Why would anyone plough money into a company that has never been out of the red?</p><p>When you look back to how some of Uber's peers began, it wasn't immediately obvious how they would deliver profitability,' says John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin.</p><p>Yet the likes of Amazon and Twitter have found a way to do it, the latter getting there in the end after a particularly tough start.'</p><p>Rewards have been stellar for investors who took a punt on those loss-making companies.</p><p>An investment in Amazon as it floated in 1997 - when it made a loss of \u00a323.8m - would have seen a return of more than 10,000pc today. In the first quarter of this year alone, it made \u00a32.8bn - as much profit as in its first 14 years on the stock market combined.</p><p>Perhaps it is these successes which have fuelled investors' appetite for loss-making companies. In recent months alone, Uber-rival Lyft, mood-board app Pinterest and vegan specialist Beyond Meat have all drawn in money despite having never ended a year in the black.</p><p>It might seem crazy, but making a loss isn't always a bad thing.</p><p>Neil Goddin, manager of the Kames Global Equity fund, explains that profit may not necessarily be the right way to measure a company's potential, especially if it is losing money because it is rapidly scaling up or developing.</p><p>Arguably this type of company is using the stock market in the exact way it was meant to be used - as a source of cash to help build businesses,' he says. The real question is whether we believe loss-making firms will be successful in building a lead that will keep competitors at bay longer than other investors believe possible, like Netflix has.'</p><p>Disruptive firms such as Uber, which are shaking up an industry, may have to put in a lot of money to reach a size where they can make an impact.</p><p>Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, says: The types of companies which are listing at the moment need investors who can see their future potential and the profits that come from that, rather than focusing on the costs they are incurring as they build up the business.'</p><p>Although savers might be keen to get their money into the next big tech firm as soon as possible, it may be worth waiting a short time after the initial listing.</p><p>Lowcock says: Share prices can be volatile following the launch as investors get excited by the chance to invest in a company for the first time, but this usually settles down after a while.'</p><p>He also advises savers to look at factors such as how fast the company is burning through cash, when it expects to become profitable and what threats it may face from rivals or regulation.</p><p>Most of these high-growth, high-promise companies are listed on US stock exchanges, although there are some in Britain, such as Ocado. Investors wanting to muscle in on the action can buy US shares directly through a platform such as Hargreaves Lansdown, though this often comes with extra fees. Alternatively they can buy into a fund which tracks the US stock market, or one which focuses on the tech sector like the Allianz Technology Trust.</p><p>But the growing willingness to put huge sums of money behind a business idea that hasn't yet been fully proven has left some experts uneasy, while some parallels are being drawn with the dotcom bubble of the late 90s.</p><p>Goddin, however, says that to say we are in a 1999-style blowout is maybe a stretch'.</p><p>And attaching high value to loss-making companies needn't sound alarms. Back in 1929, business machinery company IBM - now the computer giant - was one of the most expensive stocks on the US market while making a loss.</p><p>Like then, investors are increasingly interested in future profitability,' says Moore.</p><p>The million-dollar question - perhaps literally - is whether loss-making disruptors will be raking in the cash in five years or more.</p><p>Investors who can spot a good idea will be laughing, but with more trying to get a piece of the pie, pushing valuations higher, there is an ever-growing threat that unlucky savers could be burned.</p><p>\u00a9 Daily Mail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W33-X8H1-DYTG-4008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138794</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

It sounds bonkers, but can actually be highly lucrative. Just ask investors in Amazon, Twitter or Ocado. Taxi hailing app Uber was the latest loss-making firm to motor on to the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, completing one of the most highly anticipated US floats in recent years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While its shares stalled from the $45 offer price, falling 1.2pc or $0.75 to $44.25 a few hours into trading, this still gave it a market value of about \u00a362bn, putting it squarely among America's listed giants.</p><p>But despite the enormous price tag, Uber has never made a profit.</p><p>Why would anyone plough money into a company that has never been out of the red? 'When you look back to how some of Uber's peers began, it wasn't immediately obvious how they would deliver profitability,' says John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin.</p><p>'Yet the likes of Amazon and Twitter have found a way to do it, the latter getting there in the end after a particularly tough start.' Rewards have been stellar for investors who took a punt on those loss-making companies.</p><p>An investment in Amazon as it floated in 1997 - when it made a loss of \u00a323.8m - would have seen a return of more than 10,000pc today. In the first quarter of this year alone, it made \u00a32.8bn - as much profit as in its first 14 years on the stock market combined.</p><p>Perhaps it is these successes which have fuelled investors' appetite for loss-making companies. In recent months alone, Uber-rival Lyft, mood-board app Pinterest and vegan specialist Beyond Meat have all drawn in money despite having never ended a year in the black.</p><p>It might seem crazy, but making a loss isn't always a bad thing.</p><p>Neil Goddin, manager of the Kames Global Equity fund, explains that profit may not necessarily be the right way to measure a company's potential, especially if it is losing money because it is rapidly scaling up or developing.</p><p>'Arguably this type of company is using the stock market in the exact way it was meant to be used - as a source of cash to help build businesses,' he says. 'The real question is whether we believe loss-making firms will be successful in building a lead that will keep competitors at bay longer than other investors believe possible, like Netflix has.' Disruptive firms such as Uber, which are shaking up an industry, may have to put in a lot of money to reach a size where they can make an impact.</p><p>Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, says: 'The types of companies which are listing at the moment need investors who can see their future potential and the profits that come from that, rather than focusing on the costs they are incurring as they build up the business.' Although savers might be keen to get their money into the next big tech firm as soon as possible, it may be worth waiting a short time after the initial listing.</p><p>LOWCOCK says: 'Share prices can be volatile following the launch as investors get excited by the chance to invest in a company for the first time, but this usually settles down after a while.' He also advises savers to look at factors such as how fast the company is burning through cash, when it expects to become profitable and what threats it may face from rivals or regulation.</p><p>Most of these high-growth, highpromise companies are listed on US stock exchanges, although there are some in Britain, such as Ocado. Investors wanting to muscle in on the action can buy US shares directly through a platform such as Hargreaves Lansdown, though this often comes with extra fees. Alternatively they can buy into a fund which tracks the US stock market, or one which focuses on the tech sector like the Allianz Technology Trust.</p><p>But the growing willingness to put huge sums of money behind a business idea that hasn't yet been fully proven has left some experts uneasy, while some parallels are being drawn with the dotcom bubble of the late 90s.</p><p>Goddin, however, says that 'to say we are in a 1999-style blowout is maybe a stretch'.</p><p>And attaching high value to lossmaking companies needn't sound alarms. Back in 1929, business machinery company IBM - now the computer giant - was one of the most expensive stocks on the US market while making a loss.</p><p>'Like then, investors are increasingly interested in future profitability,' says Moore.</p><p>The million-dollar question - perhaps literally - is whether lossmaking disruptors will be raking in the cash in five years or more.</p><p>Investors who can spot a good idea will be laughing, but with more trying to get a piece of the pie, pushing valuations higher, there is an ever-growing threat that unlucky savers could be burned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-149134374</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W34-XP21-JCBW-N0JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

as a source of cash to help build businesses,' he says. </p><p>'The real question is whether we believe loss-making firms will be successful in building a lead that will keep competitors at bay longer than other investors believe possible, like Netflix has.'</p><p>Disruptive firms such as Uber, which are shaking up an industry, may have to put in a lot of money to reach a size where they can make an impact.</p><p>Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, says: 'The types of companies which are listing at the moment need investors who can see their future potential and the profits that come from that, rather than focusing on the costs they are incurring as they build up the business.'</p><p>Although savers might be keen to get their money into the next big tech firm as soon as possible, it may be worth waiting a short time after the initial listing.</p><p>Lowcock says: 'Share prices can be volatile following the launch as investors get excited by the chance to invest in a company for the first time, but this usually settles down after a while.'</p><p>He also advises savers to look at factors such as how fast the company is burning through cash, when it expects to become profitable and what threats it may face from rivals or regulation.</p><p>Most of these high-growth, high-promise companies are listed on US stock exchanges, although there are some in Britain, such as Ocado. </p><p>Investors wanting to muscle in on the action can buy US shares directly through a platform such as Hargreaves Lansdown, though this often comes with extra fees. </p><p>                     Popular Shares - British Land                    </p><p> [item name=module id=65386779 style=151 /]</p><p>British Land is one of the UK's biggest commercial property landlords, with a portfolio of about \u00a313billion worth of shopping centres and office blocks.</p><p>The sector has been through the mill lately, with Brexit undermining confidence and the High Street being ravaged by the rise of digital shopping. </p><p>British Land does have exposure to some struggling retail tenants, such as Debenhams and M&amp;S, but it's also got more stable renters - Tesco, Facebook and the Government.</p><p>What's more, British Land has targeted investment at higher-end, destination shopping centres, which are better insulated from the vagaries of High Street retail.</p><p>British Land shares trade at around a 30 per cent discount to the value of the underlying property portfolio. </p><p>That's allowed it to generate shareholder value by selling properties and using the proceeds to buy back shares on the cheap.</p><p>While developments in Westminster may yet throw a curve ball at the share price, with a yield of over 5 per cent British Land looks worthy of consideration for those willing to peer beyond the Brexit fog.</p><p>Alternatively they can buy into a fund which tracks the US stock market, or one which focuses on the tech sector like the Allianz Technology Trust.</p><p>But the growing willingness to put huge sums of money behind a business idea that hasn't yet been fully proven has left some experts uneasy, while some parallels are being drawn with the dotcom bubble of the late 90s.</p><p>Goddin, however, says that 'to say we are in a 1999-style blowout is maybe a stretch'.</p><p>And attaching high value to loss-making companies needn't sound alarms. Back in 1929, business machinery company IBM - now the computer giant - was one of the most expensive stocks on the US market while making a loss.</p><p>'Like then, investors are increasingly interested in future profitability,' says Moore.</p><p>The million-dollar question - perhaps literally - is whether loss-making disruptors will be raking in the cash in five years or more.</p><p>Investors who can spot a good idea will be laughing, but with more trying to get a piece of the pie, pushing valuations higher, there is an ever-growing threat that unlucky savers could be burned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-53102356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W31-MKW1-JCJY-G1N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"993\"/><timeReceived>6:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Platforms like Google and Facebook are audacious. They want to carry content created by media companies without paying for it. Australia is suitably enraged. Many publishers there have folded as advertising revenue that used to keep their businesses running is now going the way of Google and Facebook. Australia called on Google to share their ad revenue with publishers but it refused. Where ethics fail, the law must take over. Thanks to robust regulators, Australia has law on its mind. We must be similarly enraged. Many publishers here, too, have perished taking down with them hundreds of employees. Those who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t are shedding staff. Mainstream publications didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go under as a result of low quality journalism but because the ad revenue earned by their content was hived off by big tech platforms. The might of the pen must not be allowed to be diminished this way.</p><p>There are things Malaysia can do. But first the kind of money media companies are losing to big techs. As numbers here are hard to come by (what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new),\u00c2\u00a0 let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s settle for a proxy: Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings in Australia last year. ABC News of Australia, which had access to Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest financial statement, says the big tech paid close to A$100 million in tax but gave a miss on the A$4.8 billion gross revenue, almost all from ad revenue. Imagine the number of publications and journalists that will be still around if Google had shared it with media companies. It is not an unreasonable ask by the publishers. After all, the content is the publishers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 anyway. The Australian apple may be a Malaysian orange but fruits nevertheless. Sure, Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bean counters and lawyers have their arguments but the point is the humongous ad revenue from news content that it is refusing to share with the media companies. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument? The A$4.8 billion was booked in Singapore. Shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the revenue be taxed where it is earned and not where it is booked? Or put differently, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Google share the revenue earned from media companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 content?</p><p>Malaysia can do one of two things, or both. Firstly, it should help Australia lead a global force against big tech platforms such as Google and Facebook. There is one already in place led by OECD and G20. Called the GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon) tax, it aims to levy a certain percentage on sales. The advantage of a global rally against GAFA is obvious. The big techs are too strong for any single country. Secondly, Malaysia can pass a tax law like France has done. If this is not in tandem with the rest of the world, GAFA will marshal the muscle of the United States to impose tariffs on countries that pass such laws. To the US, power comes before principles. Like it does to big tech platforms. Either of this path doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the media companies. No government in the world has shared its tax revenue with companies. The path of least resistance to GAFA, and most beneficial to media companies, is to compel the big techs to negotiate an ad revenue formula with the publishers. Google refused Australia. And that is because it fought alone. Malaysia must be with Australia on this.

Microsoft, a tech company worth more than them all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Valued at more than $1 trillion by investors, Microsoft is no stranger to government scrutiny and public criticism. It endured years of antitrust investigations, and faced a long public trial that almost split up the company. In the end, Microsoft paid billions in fines and settlements, and absorbed humbling lessons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But its \"Evil Empire\" moniker, once a label favored by the company's critics, has fallen by the wayside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Today, Microsoft has positioned itself as the tech sector's leading advocate on public policy matters like protecting consumer privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence. Though it has sued to limit government access to users' data, Microsoft is seen in capitals around the world as the most government-friendly of the tech companies.</p><p> \"It's in a league of its own,\" said Casper Klynge, a foreign-service officer who is Denmark's ambassador to the technology industry, based in Silicon Valley. \"There is self-interest, of course. But Microsoft actively engages with governments on important issues far more than we see from the other big tech companies.\"</p><p> Market shifts and the evolution of Microsoft's business over the years help explain the transformation. It is less a consumer company than its peers. For example, Microsoft's Bing search engine and LinkedIn professional network sell ads, but the company as a whole is not dependent on online advertising and the harvesting of personal data, unlike Facebook and Google.</p><p> And though big, Microsoft no longer looms as the bully it was in the personal computer era. The company is a healthy No. 2 in markets like cloud computing (behind Amazon) and video games (behind Sony) rather than a dominant No. 1.</p><p> \"Microsoft can afford to be more self-righteous on some of those social issues because of its business model,\" said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.</p><p> But Microsoft has also undergone a corporate personality change over the years, becoming more outward looking and seeking the views of policymakers, critics and competitors. That shift has been guided by Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, diplomat-in-residence and emissary to the outside world. His work has been endorsed and his role enlarged under Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in 2014 and led a resurgence in the company's fortunes.</p><p> In a new book, Smith makes the case for a new relationship between the tech sector and government \u2014 closer cooperation and challenges for each side.</p><p> \"When your technology changes the world,\" he writes, \"you bear a responsibility to help address the world that you have helped create.\" And governments, he writes, \"need to move faster and start to catch up with the pace of technology.\"</p><p> In a lengthy interview, Smith talked about the lessons he had learned from Microsoft's past battles and what he saw as the future of tech policymaking \u2014 arguing for closer cooperation between the tech sector and the government. It's a theme echoed in the book, \"Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age,\" which he wrote with Carol Ann Browne, a member of Microsoft's communications staff.</p><p> Smith, 60, was at Microsoft during the company's antitrust conflict in the 1990s, but he did not direct the legal strategy.</p><p>Microsoft lost the suit filed by the Justice Department and 20 states, narrowly avoided being broken up and then settled the case with the Bush administration in 2001. Smith, who became general counsel in 2002, then served as Microsoft's global peacemaker, settling the follow-on cases with companies and governments.</p><p> From that experience, Smith had some advice for the young platform companies today \u2014 Google, Facebook and Amazon. Major antitrust confrontations, he noted, last a long time. The landmark cases in technology \u2014 AT&amp;T, IBM and Microsoft \u2014 all went on for decades.</p><p> \"And once you're in the crosshairs, it is hard to get out,\" Smith said.</p><p> The natural tendency for the young tech powers is to fight.</p><p> \"They didn't get to where they are by compromising,\" Smith said. \"They got to where they are because they stuck to their guns. And so they tend to think they're right and the government is wrong.\"</p><p> That mentality is especially true for immensely successful and wealthy founders. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to Smith, \"learned that life actually does require compromise and governments actually are stronger than companies,\" if only after a bruising confrontation.</p><p> Gates, who wrote the foreword in Smith's book, recalled that for years he was proud of how little time he spent talking to people in government.</p><p> \"As I learned the hard way in the antitrust suit,\" he wrote, \"that was not a wise position to take.\"</p><p> At Microsoft, Smith pushed for the new path. Horacio Gutierrez, a former senior Microsoft lawyer who is now the general counsel of Spotify, said, \"We went from dealing with governments in a reactive, defensive way to reaching out and being proactive.\"</p><p> As Smith was cleaning up Microsoft's legacy of legal troubles, the tech industry was moving on. The personal computer was no longer the center of gravity, displaced by smartphones, internet search, social networks and cloud computing.</p><p> \"What you saw at Microsoft was acknowledging reality and a response to changed circumstances,\" said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School. Microsoft is not in a spotlight of criticism today, he said, \"largely because the company is not dominant in visible ways as it used to be.\"</p><p> Under Nadella, Microsoft has fully embraced the cloud, including offering its lucrative Office productivity software as a cloud service. While Nadella was transforming the business, Smith increasingly became Microsoft's envoy to the world on policy matters. In 2015, he was named the company's president as well as chief legal officer.</p><p> Smith, whose first stint at Microsoft was a posting in Paris, is a globalist on tech policy. He has called for a Digital Geneva Convention, new rules to protect the public from the dangers of digital warfare, just as governments pledged in 1949 to protect civilians in times of war waged with bombs and bullets.</p><p> In 2018, Smith played a leading role in marshaling support for the Paris Call for international norms of behavior on the internet, which was endorsed by dozens of nations, and hundreds of companies and public interest groups. And this year, he did the same for the Christchurch Call to curb terrorist and extremist content online. While these initiatives lack the force of law, Smith said they could start global conversations that shaped policy.</p><p> After the terrorist attack at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which an Australian gunman killed 51 people and video of the carnage spread rapidly on social media, Australia enacted legislation that holds social networks responsible if they do not remove violent video quickly enough.</p><p> Smith pointed to the Australian move and similar proposals in Britain, France and Germany as evidence that a wave of technology regulation can move quickly.</p><p> Even states can set policy. Microsoft, for example, is supporting a proposed law in Washington state on facial recognition technology.</p><p> The legislation would require organizations deploying facial recognition to clearly tell people how they are using it. Law enforcement could not use the technology for ongoing surveillance of someone without a warrant. And companies that sell facial recognition software would have to make their code available for testing to check for racial and gender bias \u2014 a crucial weakness if the software is trained on data sets with too few images of women or people of color.</p><p> The American Civil Liberties Union opposes the Microsoft-supported proposal, calling for tighter restrictions and a ban on facial recognition until it can be shown to be bias-proof.</p><p> But the biggest impact on Microsoft's policy posture is Europe. The continent may not be leading the way in high-tech innovation, but it is the pacesetter in tech policy.</p><p> Smith is a fan. He calls Europe's General Data Protection Regulation \"a Magna Carta for data.\" The law, which took effect last year, lets people request their online data and restricts how businesses obtain and handle information. At another point, Smith said Europe is \"the world's best hope for privacy's future.\"</p><p> In America, there have been activist states on privacy, like California, but the political gridlock in Washington has held back a national policy.</p><p> \"That means the decisions that impact Americans,\" Smith said, \"are going to be made in Brussels and interpreted in Berlin, because those are the two places that have the most impact.\"</p><p> Steve Lohr is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-ae16cd61dbf04623e1dde94480796b861a593af8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X17-G1C1-JBCN-420J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Microsoft, a tech company worth more than them all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The software giant, valued at more than $1 trillion by investors, is no stranger to government scrutiny and public criticism. It endured years of antitrust investigations, and faced a long public trial that almost split up the company. In the end, Microsoft paid billions in fines and settlements, and absorbed humbling lessons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But its \u201cEvil Empire\u201d moniker, once a label favored by the company\u2019s critics, has fallen by the wayside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Microsoft has positioned itself as the tech sector\u2019s leading advocate on public policy matters like protecting consumer privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence. Though it has sued to limit government access to users\u2019 data, Microsoft is seen in capitals around the world as the most government-friendly of the tech companies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in a league of its own,\u201d said Casper Klynge, a foreign-service officer who is Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the technology industry, based in Silicon Valley. \u201cThere is self-interest, of course. But Microsoft actively engages with governments on important issues far more than we see from the other big tech companies.\u201d</p><p>Market shifts and the evolution of Microsoft\u2019s business over the years help explain the transformation. It is less a consumer company than its peers. For example, Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine and LinkedIn professional network sell ads, but the company as a whole is not dependent on online advertising and the harvesting of personal data, unlike Facebook and Google.</p><p>And while big, Microsoft no longer looms as the threatening bully it was in the personal computer era. The company is a healthy No. 2 in markets like cloud computing (behind Amazon) and video games (behind Sony) rather than a dominant No. 1.</p><p>\u201cMicrosoft can afford to be more self-righteous on some of those social issues because of its business model,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.</p><p>But Microsoft has also undergone a corporate personality change over the years, becoming more outward looking and seeking the views of policymakers, critics and competitors. That shift has been guided by Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, diplomat-in-residence and emissary to the outside world. His work has been endorsed and his role enlarged under Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in 2014 and led a resurgence in the company\u2019s fortunes.</p><p>In a new book, Mr. Smith makes the case for a new relationship between the tech sector and government \u2014 closer cooperation and challenges for each side.</p><p>\u201cWhen your technology changes the world,\u201d he writes, \u201cyou bear a responsibility to help address the world that you have helped create.\u201d And governments, he writes, \u201cneed to move faster and start to catch up with the pace of technology.\u201d</p><p>In a lengthy interview, Mr. Smith talked about the lessons he had learned from Microsoft\u2019s past battles and what he saw as the future of tech policymaking \u2014 arguing for closer cooperation between the tech sector and the government. It\u2019s a theme echoed in the book, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/604709/tools-and-weapons-by-brad-smith-and-carol-ann-browne/9781984877710/\">\u201cTools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age,\u201d</url> which he wrote with Carol Ann Browne, a member of Microsoft\u2019s communications staff.</p><p>Mr. Smith, 60, was at Microsoft during the company\u2019s antitrust conflict in the 1990s, but he did not direct the legal strategy.</p><p>Microsoft lost the suit filed by the Justice Department and 20 states, narrowly avoided being broken up and then settled the case with the Bush administration in 2001. Mr. Smith, who became general counsel in 2002, then served as Microsoft\u2019s global peacemaker, settling the follow-on cases with companies and governments.</p><p>From that experience, Mr. Smith had some advice for the young platform companies today \u2014 Google, Facebook and Amazon. Major antitrust confrontations, he noted, last a long time. The landmark cases in technology \u2014 AT&amp;amp;T, IBM and Microsoft \u2014 all went on for decades.</p><p>\u201cAnd once you\u2019re in the cross hairs, it is hard to get out,\u201d Mr. Smith said.</p><p>The natural tendency for the young tech powers is to fight. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get to where they are by compromising,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey got to where they are because they stuck to their guns. And so they tend to think they\u2019re right and the government is wrong.\u201d</p><p>That mentality is especially true for immensely successful and wealthy founders. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to Mr. Smith, \u201clearned that life actually does require compromise and governments actually are stronger than companies,\u201d if only after a bruising confrontation.</p><p>Mr. Gates, who wrote the foreword in Mr. Smith\u2019s book, recalled that for years he was proud of how little time he spent talking to people in government. \u201cAs I learned the hard way in the antitrust suit,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat was not a wise position to take.\u201d</p><p>At Microsoft, Mr. Smith pushed for the new path. Horacio Gutierrez, a former senior Microsoft lawyer, who is now the general counsel of Spotify, said, \u201cWe went from dealing with governments in a reactive, defensive way to reaching out and being proactive.\u201d</p><p>As Mr. Smith was cleaning up Microsoft\u2019s legacy of legal troubles, the tech industry was moving on. The personal computer was no longer the center of gravity, displaced by smartphones, internet search, social networks and cloud computing.</p><p>\u201cWhat you saw at Microsoft was acknowledging reality and a response to changed circumstances,\u201d said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School. Microsoft is not in a spotlight of criticism today, he said, \u201clargely because the company is not dominant in visible ways as it used to be.\u201d</p><p>Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has fully embraced the cloud, including offering its lucrative Office productivity software as a cloud service. While Mr. Nadella was transforming the business, Mr. Smith increasingly became Microsoft\u2019s envoy to the world on policy matters. In 2015, he was named the company\u2019s president as well as chief legal officer.</p><p>Mr. Smith, whose first stint at Microsoft was a posting in Paris, is a globalist on tech policy. He has called for a Digital Geneva Convention, new rules to protect the public from the dangers of digital warfare, just as governments pledged in 1949 to protect civilians in times of war waged with bombs and bullets.</p><p>In 2018, Mr. Smith played a leading role in marshaling support for the Paris Call for international norms of behavior on the internet, which was endorsed by dozens of nations, and hundreds of companies and public interest groups. And this year, he did the same for the Christchurch Call to curb terrorist and extremist content online. While these initiatives lack the force of law, Mr. Smith said they could start global conversations that shaped policy.</p><p>After the terrorist attack at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which an Australian gunman killed 51 people and video of the carnage spread rapidly on social media, Australia enacted legislation that holds social networks responsible if they do not remove violent video quickly enough.</p><p>Mr. Smith pointed to the Australian move and similar proposals in Britain, France and Germany as evidence that a wave of technology regulation can move quickly.</p><p>Even states can set policy. Microsoft, for example, is supporting a proposed law in Washington State on facial recognition technology.</p><p>The legislation would require organizations deploying facial recognition to clearly tell people how they are using it. Law enforcement could not use the technology for ongoing surveillance of someone without a warrant. And companies that sell facial recognition software would have to make their code available for testing to check for racial and gender bias \u2014 a crucial weakness if the software is trained on data sets with too few images of women or people of color.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union opposes the Microsoft-supported proposal, calling for tighter restrictions and a ban on facial recognition until it can be shown to be biasproof.</p><p>But the biggest impact on Microsoft\u2019s policy posture is Europe. The Continent may not be leading the way in high-tech innovation, but it is the pacesetter in tech policy.</p><p>Mr. Smith is a fan. He calls Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation \u201ca Magna Carta for data.\u201d The law, which took effect last year, lets people request their online data and restricts how businesses obtain and handle information. At another point, Mr. Smith said Europe is \u201cthe world\u2019s best hope for privacy\u2019s future.\u201d</p><p>In America, there have been activist states on privacy, like California, but the political gridlock in Washington has held back a national policy.</p><p>\u201cThat means the decisions that impact Americans,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201care going to be made in Brussels and interpreted in Berlin, because those are the two places that have the most impact.\u201d</p><p>Steve Lohr covers technology and economics.

It was just 243 short years ago that the Second Continental Congress, in its infancy and infinite wisdom, signed the Declaration of Independence. The War of Independence would, of course, drag on for seven more long years, until we finally won our freedom in 1783. But the document that we credit most with preserving the personal freedoms we won in independence, the Constitution of the United States of America, wasn't even written until four years after that\u2014a full decade after independence was declared. It wasn't ratified until 1788 and didn't take effect until 1789. For those that believe what we need today is another era of revolutionary change rather than incremental progress, it is a good reminder that incremental progress can lead to revolutionary change. </p><p>It is a reminder that we had to fight and think and negotiate hard in order to secure our protection from tyranny\u2014and that the means of securing it has been the Constitution we designed, not the war we fought. It was as imperfect as the men who wrote it. But it was what set the structure of our government, and established us as a commercial republic\u2014both of which, in addition to the rights enumerated in the Constitution, have helped ensure and even extend our individual rights. Before we go any further, you may be asking how does being a commercial republic help extend rights? Well, besides Alexander Hamilton's argument that 'lessening its need of external commerce' with Great Britain would 'render it still securer against the encroachments of tyranny' Congress has used its power to regulate commerce between states to fight institutional racism and discrimination. It was on the powers given to Congress under the Commerce Clause, the Supreme Court decided in 1964, that the Civil Rights Act rested. As Kim Wehle writes in her new book: The government is already prohibited from engaging in such discrimination under the Constitution itself. But the Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause and other parts of the Bill of Rights didn't bind private parties, so companies were free to discriminate prior to 1964. The court upheld the Civil Rights Act on the rationale that 'voluminous testimony [before Congress] presents overwhelming evidence that discrimination by hotels and motels impedes insterstate travel.' Wehle, a Professor of Law, former Associate Independent Counsel in the Whitewater Investigation under Kenneth Starr, and Assistant U.S. Attorney under former Attorney General Eric Holder, has written a great exploration of our government's founding document and its importance in How to Read the Constitution\u2014and Why[2]. In it, she writes: The question for generations is whether the framers of the Constitution got it right. In order to begin to answer that question, every generation needs a basic working knowledge of what the Constitution does (it sets up a structure of government and lists individual rights) and what it doesn't do (it does not crown a king). This book helps build that knowledge and also answers questions such as: What are the powers of government? What are the limits on those powers? And what does it mean to have 'rights' under the Constitution? They are important questions to consider, as 'the structure of the Constitution is being tested like never before'\u2014not only, or perhaps most importantly by the current occupant of the White House, but by hyperpartisanship, a money-driven, winner-take-all system of politics, and an abdication of the responsibility to check the power of the executive branch. The first two questions\u2014on the powers of government and their limits\u2014are largely answered in Part I of the book, discussing the structure of government. It is here that we're walked through the separation of powers, checks and balances, and the ways in which powers overlap the three branches of government and have blurred over time. You'll likely learn some things that will surprise you, like the fact that the alphabet soup of federal agencies, which both make laws (regulations) and adjudicate disputes on their own\u2014ostensibly exercising powers under the umbrella of the executive branch that appoints agency heads that are constitutionally in the purview of other branches\u2014are not, according to 'the plain language of the Constitution,' actually constitutional. And yet, created under FDR at the height of the Great Depression to help manage the economy and stave off future financial catastrophe, they have helped govern life and manage the economy\u2014and much else besides\u2014for almost a century. You will also learn that 'the plain language of the Constitution' is not so plain, after all, and that the idea that there is, or could be, 'a strict reading of the Constitution' is a myth. It is for this reason that Wehle tells her first-year law students that the first thing they need to do is learn to read, because the kind of reading required by the Constitution is fundamentally different. It is a different skill that she likens to the reading of poetry, one that requires isolating phrases, and even individual words, that are open to interpretation and are either deliberately vague or made so by history. What does the word executive mean, or the word shall? What are the arms we have a right to bear under the Second Amendment? (Certainly not plutonium, she insists.) What does the protection guaranteed in the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search mean when 90 percent of all the world's data has been created in just the last two years, and so much of our personal information is available electronically?  The 'rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution,' writes Kim Wehle, 'are like winning the lottery.' Perhaps the most surprising thing to me, then, is that the first ten amendments of the Constitution that are the bedrock of those rights, that were added only to appease anti-federalists that opposed the entire project, were not a part of the original Constitution. When the Constitution was written, in Philadelphia in 1787, it did not contain a bill of rights. The Bill of Rights wasn't written until 1789, and not ratified until 1791. But perhaps the biggest takeaway (in my reading, at least) is that even as progress has continued to be slow, that it has been unevenly experienced and continues to be so, that we sometimes take a step back, that the arch of the moral universe is long, we have tended to move in a direction that secures the equality of civil rights envisioned in the Declaration of Independence. Revolutionary progress has never been a sharp turn, but rather the progressive motion of a self-governing body around the two different constitutional axes of government structure and individual rights. And much of that motion, much of what we consider American values, aren't actually enshrined in the Constitution, but in social norms. And while the revolutionary progress of ensuring and extending civil liberties and rights has been slow, reactionary progress that breaks with norms has often been swift, and long-lasting when not addressed quickly. That is: When government actors push existing boundaries, they expand their power. Usually for keeps. 'The Constitution is the boss of all laws in the United States,' writes Wehle, 'but much of its strength is based on social norms and values ' That a president serves only two terms was a norm for 150 years, until FDR broke it by being elected to four\u2014prompting Congress to pass a law decreeing a two-term limit in 1947 to re-establish it. What happens when democratic norms and values are ignored, or when the entire social contract is not only fraying but has been shredded, as it has been today. Love him or hate him, whether you find it refreshing or endlessly frustrating, Donald Trump's defining trait may be shattering such norms. One of the earliest and most dramatic examples of this was calling for his political opponent, Hillary Clinton, to be jailed. There is a rather thin line, in a realpolitikal sense, from calling for the jailing a political opponent and actually having the power to do so. It is a difference in how strong the democratic norms and the rule of law are. We can see an instance in which such norms and rules were not sufficiently strong enough in Ukraine, whereupon defeating Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential election\u2014Viktor Yanukovych trumped up charges against her that ultimately led to her imprisonment. The similarities are a little eerie, in that both Clinton and Tymoshenko we both establishment figures aligned with Western Europe and the rules-based order that has governed the west since WWII, while Trump and Yanukovych both had some shadowy ties to the primary adversary to that order, Russia. (One other similarity, that both Trump and Yanukovych both employed Paul Manafort as a key figure in their respective campaigns to gain power, is a little more direct.) Wehle argues that an 'extreme unitary executive view' of the law, one that Trump seems to ascribe to above and beyond any previous president\u2014in which there is no limiting principle on the executive power to execute the law, or to ignore and not execute the law if they so choose\u2014cannot be correct because it 'would elevate that power above other provisions in the constitution.' She writes further: But from a structural standpoint, it also means that the president could run the Oval Office like a dictatorship or Mafia ring\u2014those people who line his pockets with enough cash can commit crimes, while those who turn him down get prosecuted and potentially jailed. Assuming he has physical access as president, he could empty the federal treasury into a bank account in his own name and get away with it. Whether that is correct, of course, is whether it is allowed, or whether the social norms and democratic values are strong enough to reign in such executive power. And as we learned in Moneyland[3], this is a pretty accurate description of what happened in Ukraine under the leadership of Yanukovych when the judiciary and legislative branch, along with the media, would not or could not hold him to account. He was eventually removed from office when the people themselves took to the streets, but very little of the approximately $70 billion in treasury funds he is estimated to have transferred to foreign accounts through the rampant corruption and cronyism he bred will ever be recovered by the people of Ukraine.  Wehle also stresses that 'what people consider core American values\u2014such as the opportunity for financial success and upward social mobility, rewards for hard work, cultural diversity, and unrestricted individualism\u2014may not be expressed anywhere in the Constitution.' If they are taken for granted or not socially enforced, these values will cease to reign in America. The same is true, she writes, of expectations we have of our elected leaders\u2014that they will be relatively transparent, will appoint competent people, that they will accept the outcome of popular elections, and will act with decency and decorum, in a way that is generally considered appropriate for the office they hold. Wehle explains how, while the framers did not foresee the way in which money, big tech, or gerrymandering could undermine the system of government they envisioned, they 'did anticipate that deep ideological factions could rip the country apart and leave space for the kind of autocracy that they denounced in the form of the British monarchy.' We can bemoan negative campaigns as 'dirty politics,' but they are nothing new. The battle for the presidency between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams was ugly even by today's standards. Jefferson hired newspaperman James Callendar to smear Adams, a tactic that backfired on Jefferson when Callendar went to jail for slander. He turned on Jefferson upon his release, writing stories of how Jefferson had fathered children with his slave, Sally Hemings. It was scandalous, of course, and\u2014as DNA tests of Hemings' descendants proved in 1998\u2014true. These were not flawless men, nor was the document they helped produce. But it set up a governmental structure and bill of rights that helps perfect the union established. Most importantly, she reminds us that the government derives its power from 'We the People' and 'not some piece of paper.' That it is written in such a large script to open the preamble of our constitution is but a reminder that our leaders are accountable to us. Under the Constitution, the people are the sole source of governing power\u2014elected and appointed officials are not entitled to it. Every exercise of their power flows through\u2014not from\u2014the Constitution. And every person exercising that power remains ultimately and exclusively accountable to the people. That government authority exists only with 'the consent of the governed' is, of course, always true, but the ability to hold it accountable and the degrees we must go to in order to do so are meaningful and dramatic. There is a difference between free and fair popular elections, and the power to redress the grievances of citizens to an impartial judiciary\u2014a power also not necessarily set in the Constitution, but by precedent\u2014and having to take to the streets to force out a would-be dictator abusing their power and ignoring the rights of the governed. There is a difference in the ability to operate a business freely without bribing government officials and to be free from competing against companies given contracts based on bribes rather than ability. There is a difference between calling for imprisoning political opponents and actually being able to do so. It is a difference that is eroding in a winner-take-all system of governing that has crept into our current era of hyper-partisanship, fueled by dark money in elections, and gerrymandering in which the power of the minority party in government has been reduced to such an extent that is almost nonexistent. When elected officials are allowed to pick their voters, rather than the other way around, the ability to hold elected officials accountable through electoral means is withering. Dirty politics is nothing new, but dark money politics is. The painful truth is that the individual voter has been substantially cut out of the democratic process, and we don't even realize it. The genius of the constitution is that it structured the government in a way that provides checks on the most powerful while guaranteeing the rights of the least powerful. It has been a long and slow journey these past 243 years, and we are still far from being the land promised in the Declaration of Independence, in which we held these truths to be self-evident: 'that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.' But to secure these rights, we did in fact institute a government, deriving its just powers from the consent of the governed. That consent is given through the Constitution and, as Wehle concludes, it 'has served us well.' It is worth preserving, and worth strengthening by holding our elected representatives accountable, and by enshrining more of our democratic norms into the law itself.

BoskinSTANFORD \u2014 Two years ago, it seemed clear to me that a combination of factors would lead to increased calls to regulate technology companies, especially Big Tech giants Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. When that happens, I argued at the time, regulatory policy would have to strike a sensible balance between mitigating the most harmful effects of technology and allowing tech companies to continue improving people's lives.\u00a0Now that day has arrived, and achieving such a balance will be difficult. Having benignly neglected these companies for years, democratic governments are now producing a dizzying array of policies to regulate them. The risk is that the flurry of policymaking will overcorrect and do more harm than good, not least by unintentionally stifling innovation and competition.There are at least four separate regulatory policy issues that need to be addressed: privacy, market power, free speech and censorship, including inappropriate content, and national security and law enforcement. </p><p>Tech-sector policies must therefore be narrowly targeted and carefully crafted to minimise the risk of counterproductive outcomes.All four issues feature prominently in recent embarrassing revelations about tech firms' practices, some of which have been detailed in books by industry insiders. Regarding privacy, for example, thousands of Amazon employees listen to what customers say to their Echo speakers, without the company seeking users' prior permission to do so. Although Amazon says the recordings help to improve its Alexa digital assistant, most ordinary people think this is Orwellian Big Brother behaviour.As for market power, the European Union recently levied its third large fine on Google in as many years for three separate abuses of its market dominance. Google is appealing. Concerning content, the mass killings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March were streamed live on Facebook, while there are daily controversies over removing hate speech and the possible anti-conservative bias in defining it. And on national security, the report by US Special Counsel Robert Mueller contains damning information dating back to 2014 about Russian operatives' use of social media to sow discord in America's elections.In these circumstances, a clamor among the public and politicians to 'do something' is not surprising. There is certainly a need for regulation, as some tech bosses admit. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently called on governments to play a 'more active role' in regulating the Internet, in order to set clear rules regarding harmful content, election integrity, personal privacy and data portability. To many, it sounded like the plea of an alcoholic or a drug addict to 'protect me from myself'.Regulators had started to act long before Zuckerberg's appeal. Regarding data privacy, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in May 2018, requires all firms, whether EU-based or not, doing business in the EU to be GDPR-compliant in their global operations, not just those in the EU. But, because the large fixed cost of compliance will hit smaller companies hardest, the GDPR may end up protecting larger firms from competition from small ones.Furthermore, the network effects that Big Tech firms enjoy, whereby additional users make all users more valuable, create entry barriers and limit competition. In addition to the EU's fines, the US Federal Trade Commission is reexamining its antitrust policies in this new era of economic concentration. And some of the Democratic candidates for the 2020 US presidential election have their own suggestions for curtailing Big Tech's market power.Yet, attempts to address market concentration may have counterproductive effects too. The most radical proposal, by Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren, would prohibit Big Tech firms from both operating platforms and offering their own products on them. But consumers currently benefit from ease of use and perhaps lower prices, including 'free services' made possible by these platforms' advertising profits.Turning tech platforms into regulated utilities is also problematic. A recent draft report in the UK proposed establishing a regulator to enforce codes of conduct \u2014 including a level playing field for competitors' products on digital platforms, open standards for user data and greater consideration in merger decisions of the potential future harm to competition. Although that is more promising than Warren's proposal, it risks giving too much power to agencies that could be vulnerable to regulatory capture.Finally, tech firms need to address the potential national-security risks arising from the use of their products. The current debate over Chinese mobile-telecom giant Huawei's 5G ambitions underscores this imperative. So did the 2016 confrontation between Apple and the FBI over the company's refusal to unlock a terrorist's iPhone, and Google employees' insistence that the company refuse US defence and intelligence contracts.Such cases call for cooperation and mutual understanding between tech companies and national-security and law-enforcement professionals. For example, in the FBI episode, Apple CEO Tim Cook worried that a backdoor built into iPhones could be stolen or hacked, potentially causing far more harm. Yet, tech firms must understand that actions that hurt profits may be necessary to protect lives in exceptional circumstances, provided the measures are narrowly prescribed and court-supervised.As technologies continue to develop, the four challenges discussed here will only intensify. That is all the more reason for tech firms and governments to get ahead of the curve before an especially ugly incident causes an even larger public uproar, prompting broader and blunter regulation that unnecessarily limits technology's undeniable benefits.\u00a0 Michael J.

It was reassuring to hear companies are placing ethical use of AI at the forefront of decision-making and restricting the use of the technology in certain applications. Obvious examples are AI facial and voice recognition not being used for nefarious purposes as well as ensuring AI doesn't create or reinforce bias in society.</p><p>This month both federal Technology Minister Karen Andrews and NSW Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello are hosting industry government roundtables on AI, to which the AIIA has been invited, to look at the role of government in supporting and regulating this innovative technology.</p><p>The key point is trust. The AI technology and its undoubted benefits can only be realised if trust is maintained. This applies equally to both the government and private sectors.</p><p>Governments and businesses when using AI must demonstrate transparency around the processes and systems inside an organisation as to how they came to a decision on the use case. This includes establishing ethics committees inside organisations that have representatives from the business, outside experts and from civil society.</p><p>The second point around trust involves the transparency of the AI technology itself, so it is clear what the technology can and cannot do. The tech companies building the AI must show how the AI tech was built and how it works in practice.</p><p>A final point is Australia does not operate in isolation so we must ensure Australian governments do not duplicate international standards around AI use before deciding on any regulatory gaps that need redressing.Simon Bush is GM policy and advocacy for the AIIA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-48b0e85e117711ea9762bbc75a5bf541c078133a1143af1fe228e736fb046f4d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMX-R6W1-JD3N-508S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 3, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SOFTWARE &amp;

The question is no longer if, but how.Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives and the highest-ranking Democratic federal official, recently pushed back against her big-tech San Francisco constituency, declaring that \"the era of self-regulation is over.\" President Donald J. Trump is holding a summit on social media at the White House this week, and Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has introduced legislation threatening the platforms' protection from immunity if they demonstrate \"politically biased\" moderation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Politicians are channeling widespread public animosity toward digital platforms: according to a Pew Research Center poll, Americans regard disinformation as a bigger threat than violent crime. Yet, in sharp contrast to their European counterparts, U.S. policymakers have so far shied away from regulation - out of concerns that the technology is too complex, or that effective measures would entail government censorship.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice between them have begun antitrust investigations of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, while the House Antitrust Subcommittee has also started investigations. But any antitrust suit would move slowly and be tough to win under current law. Moreover, without regulatory oversight, antitrust measures alone cannot address the vulnerabilities that threaten the flow of information necessary for democracy to function.</p><p>The digital platforms are media gatekeepers that shape news consumption, political expression, and civil-society allegiances. But, as U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller documented, they allow bots, fake accounts, and click farms to influence users, and they outsource editorial functions to optimized algorithms that amplify outrage and conspiracy theories in order to keep users watching online ads. Fake content, like a recent doctored video of Pelosi, further corrupts the supply chain of news. And platforms mostly enforce their terms of service only after disinformation has gone viral.</p><p>To be sure, digital platforms' technology and business practices are increasingly complex, and congressional hearings reveal widespread tech illiteracy among policymakers. But complexity didn't stop the U.S. from creating expert agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to protect citizens' safety. And in the realm of information and speech, the Federal Communications Commission has a history of safeguarding free expression from gatekeepers.</p><p>Now that America's political class is willing to act, it should start by establishing an expert government regulatory body to safeguard the integrity of the information supply chain. We envisage a new Digital Democracy Agency that would do what the digital giants have no incentive to do on their own: enhance transparency, improve user control, and help sustain local journalism.</p><p>The DDA would limit the vulnerabilities of the digital system without interfering in content decisions - in the same way that radio, television, cable and telecommunications providers became more publicly accountable as they developed. Self-regulation played an important role, including through journalism's own transparency norms.</p><p>But government regulation - such as common-carrier rules for telecommunications companies, political ad disclosures, restrictions on cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same market, and support for non-commercial broadcasting - was essential to prevent abuse. At least in broadcasting, media regulation created a public-interest culture and language.</p><p>For digital media gatekeepers, the DDA would mandate transparency about who is paying for online political ads, when a bot is a bot, and the identities of group hosts and websites posing as news outlets. It would help users understand how and why they and their fellow citizens have been targeted, and limit abusive surveillance. It would give users control over how their data is used and how algorithms serve up content. It would help users to protect themselves against fake videos and behavioral experiments. And it would focus on internet infrastructure and other supports for accountability journalism.</p><p>To avoid the pitfalls of industrial-era U.S. regulatory agencies, which tended to stifle innovation with overly prescriptive rules and to side with incumbents or other vested interests, the DDA would be structured for the 21st century. It would be a nimble regulator using agile software design, offering sufficient salaries to develop the necessary in-house technical capacity.</p><p>And it would have strong post-employment lobbying prohibitions in order to prevent the emergence of a revolving door between government and the digital platforms.</p><p>The new body could work closely with U.S. competition and privacy authorities at the FTC and DOJ, or be bundled together with them. Building on the example of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the DDA would be transparent and collaborative, opening its data and processes to the public. And by setting standards and consistently measuring their effectiveness, the agency would be able to adapt as technology continues to evolve.</p><p>The DDA would not decide whether online content is true or false, or otherwise objectionable, but would instead focus on systemic vulnerabilities to disinformation. It would enforce democratic accountability by requiring large platforms to have clear content-takedown rules, disclosures for online ads, an appeals process for users, and access for public-interest researchers.</p><p>It would require that platforms' real-name policies entail some verification, and that trending topics confer the credibility that users assume. The DDA could also direct platforms to allow users to customize the algorithms that populate their newsfeeds. Given how platforms have siphoned off the revenue sources that once sustained local journalism, the agency might also create a fund to support such outlets.</p><p>Although digital platforms raise a host of complicated issues, the government has a duty to protect its citizens - as it already does in other, equally complex areas. As the U.S. gears up for the 2020 presidential election, artificial intelligence presents ever-greater challenges to the information ecosystem. With the health of its democracy at stake, regulation has become necessary in the defense of freedom.</p><p>Karen Kornbluh is senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations and former U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Self-regulation clearly has not worked, and this slow-dawning reality has led to a number of proposals to rein them in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some critics have proposed regulating the platform companies as utilities, or even as monopolies. The European Union (EU) recently implemented its ambitious General Data Protection Regulation to protect user data and privacy. Germany passed its \"Facebook law\", permitting fines of large social media companies that fail to promptly delete hate speech.</p><p>But those interventions don't address a crucial dilemma. Governments can't really check misbehaving companies if regulators can't bar them from their domestic marketplace. Automakers could simply ignore safety and environmental regulations if there was no way to stop them from selling their cars. A fracking company could inflict major damage if the Environmental Protection Agency lacked the authority to shut down its operation.</p><p>Yet, when it comes to internet-based platform companies, they seemingly exist everywhere and nowhere, making up their own rules. So enforcement is more challenging. As you tap the Google map or launch a tweet, it makes no difference if the server running the algorithm resides in the United States or halfway around the world. If Facebook is threatened by regulators, it could just place its servers on an island in international waters or, in the future, use internet-beaming balloons.</p><p>US President Donald Trump's trade war with China is partly motivated by disagreement over digital technology use and transfers, but it is difficult to prevent Chinese software companies from accessing US digital markets.</p><p>That's very different from how traditional brick-and-mortar companies operate. They must obtain licences and permits, and follow mandated rules. If a DowDuPont chemical plant violates the rules, whether in Delaware or India, it can be fined or even shut down.</p><p>What if we make the online world work more like the brick-and-mortar world? What if regulators create \"digital licences\" for internet-based companies, which make clear the rules and conditions required for market access? Companies above a certain size would have to agree to follow regulations that support free markets and democratic values.</p><p>The EU's General Data Protection Plan is an example of a digital licence, focused narrowly on personal data and privacy. Other areas for potential targeting include labour rights and working conditions, competition and monopolistic practices, taxation, artificial intelligence development, data collection and retention.</p><p>But what if the company refuses to follow the conditions of the digital licence? After all, Facebook has a history of ignoring previous agreements and consent decrees.</p><p>Just as countries need to enforce physical borders to ensure leverage over trade and commerce, so too do they need to have the technological tools and legal basis to enforce their digital borders. That means the power to digitally evict the worst violators.</p><p>Is that even technically possible, to \"evict\" a Facebook or Google? Essentially, yes. Already, many countries use technology to decide which companies can access their online users and markets.</p><p>The \"Great internet Wall\" of China, for example, has guarded its digital border using a number of methods, such as IP address blocking, packet filtering and domain name system redirection to block websites such as Google, Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Yes, such interventions have been deployed to censor speech and advance economic nationalism. But accountable governments can use these methods for loftier goals. Britain already has blocked some rogue websites.</p><p>Representative democracies can restrict access to enforce legitimate laws and regulations that uphold democracy, free enterprise and the rule of law. The US government already structures communication markets in ways that are recognised as legitimate.</p><p>Some may object that digitally ousting a popular internet platform would mean losing that company's service. But actual eviction probably wouldn't be necessary; even a credible threat would prod companies to adhere to the digital licence. If not, ejection would allow for the emergence of new competitors. In China, the expulsion of Facebook and Google led to alternatives Tencent and Baidu which, despite omnipresent government restrictions, have matured into commercial giants.</p><p>One basic principle of US capitalism is that the nation-state has an inalienable right to mandate the terms of operation for businesses and commercial activity. The free market has never been a free-for-all. Why should internet-based businesses be allowed to operate differently from historical businesses?</p><p>In the end, no government can properly regulate giant internet-based companies if it cannot enforce digital licences by threatening to withhold entry to its markets. The best way to harness our digital future is to use technology itself to apply long-established principles for regulating businesses. We don't need to overcomplicate this; just roll up our sleeves and get to work.</p><p>\u2014 Washington Post</p><p>Steven Hill is a journalist and the author of Raw Deal: How the 'Uber Economy' and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/12/154704605637.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/12/154704605637.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-134787272</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V56-FPW1-JDJN-61G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

The European Union recently implemented its ambitious General Data Protection Regulation to protect user data and privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Germany passed its \"Facebook law,\" permitting fines of large social-media companies that fail to promptly delete hate speech.</p><p> But those interventions don't address a crucial dilemma. Governments can't really check misbehaving companies if regulators can't bar them from their domestic marketplace. Automakers could simply ignore safety and environmental regulations if there was no way to stop them from selling their cars. A frocking company could inflict major damage if the Environmental Protection Agency lacked the authority to shut down its operation.</p><p> Yet when it comes to Internet-based platform companies, they seemingly exist everywhere and nowhere, making up their own rules. So enforcement is more challenging. As you tap the Google map or launch a tweet, it makes no difference if the server running the algorithm resides in the United States or halfway around the world.</p><p> If Facebook is threatened by regulators, it could just place its servers on an island in international waters or, in the future, use Internet-beaming balloons.</p><p> The Trump administration's trade war with China is partly motivated by disagreement over digital technology use and transfers, but it is difficult to prevent Chinese software companies from accessing U.S. digital markets.</p><p> That's very different from how traditional brick-and mortar companies operate.</p><p> They must obtain licenses and permits, and follow mandated rules. If a DowDuPont chemical plant violates the rules, whether in Delaware or India, it can be fined or even shut down.</p><p> What if we make the online world work more like the brick-and-mortar world? What if regulators create \"digital licenses\" for Internet based companies, which make clear the rules and conditions required for market access? Companies above a certain size would have to agree to follow regulations that support free markets and democratic values.</p><p> The EU's General Data Protection Plan is an example of a digital license, focused narrowly on personal data and privacy. Other areas for potential targeting include labor rights and working conditions, competition and monopolistic practices, taxation, artificial intelligence development, and data collection and retention.</p><p> But what if the company refuses to follow the conditions of the digital license? After all, Facebook has a history of ignoring previous agreements and consent decrees.</p><p> Just as countries need to enforce physical borders to ensure leverage over trade and commerce, so too do they need to have the technological tools and legal basis to enforce their digital borders. That means the power to digitally evict the worst violators.</p><p> Is that even technically possible, to \"evict\" a Facebook or Googleft Essentially, yes.</p><p> Already, many countries use technology to decide which companies can access their online users and markets.</p><p> The \"Great Internet Wall\" of China, for example, has guarded its digital border using a number of methods, such as IP address blocking, packet filtering, and domain name system redirection to block websites such as Google, Facebook and Twitter.</p><p> Yes, such interventions have been deployed by repressive governments to censor speech and advance economic nationalism. But democratically elected and accountable governments can use these methods for loftier goals.</p><p>Britain already has blocked some rogue websites.</p><p> Representative democracies can restrict access to enforce legitimate laws and regulations that uphold democracy, free enterprise and the rule of law. The U.S. government already structures communication markets in ways that are recognized as legitimate.</p><p> Some may object that digitally ousting a popular Internet platform would mean losing that company's service.</p><p> But actual eviction probably wouldn't be necessary; even a credible threat would prod companies to adhere to the digital license. If not, ejection would allow for the emergence of new competitors.</p><p> In China, the expulsion of Facebook and Google led to alternatives Tencent and Baidu which, despite omnipresent government restrictions, have matured into commercial giants.</p><p> One basic principle of U.S. capitalism is that the nation-state has an inalienable right to mandate the terms of operation for businesses and commercial activity. The free market has never been a free for-all. Why should Internet based businesses be allowed to operate differently from historical businesses?</p><p> In the end, no government can properly regulate giant Internet-based companies if it cannot enforce digital licenses by threatening to withhold entry to its markets.

Self-regulation clearly has not worked, and this slow-dawning reality has led to a number of proposals to rein them in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some critics have proposed regulating the platform companies as utilities, or even as monopolies. The European Union recently implemented its ambitious General Data Protection Regulation to protect user data and privacy. Germany passed its \"Facebook law,\" permitting fines of large social-media companies that fail to promptly delete hate speech. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But those interventions don't address a crucial dilemma. Governments can't really check misbehaving companies if regulators can't bar them from their domestic marketplace. Automakers could simply ignore safety and environmental regulations if there was no way to stop them from selling their cars. A fracking company could inflict major damage if the Environmental Protection Agency lacked the authority to shut down its operation.</p><p>Yet when it comes to Internet-based platform companies, they seemingly exist everywhere and nowhere, making up their own rules. So enforcement is more challenging. As you tap the Google map or launch a tweet, it makes no difference if the server running the algorithm resides in the United States or halfway around the world. If Facebook is threatened by regulators, it could just place its servers on an island in international waters or, in the future, use  Internet-beaming balloons.</p><p>The Trump administration's trade war with China is partly motivated by disagreement over digital technology use and transfers, but it is difficult to prevent Chinese software companies from accessing U.S. digital markets.</p><p>That's very different from how traditional brick-and-mortar companies operate. They must obtain licenses and permits, and follow mandated rules. If a DowDuPont chemical plant violates the rules, whether in Delaware or India, it can be fined or even shut down.</p><p>What if we make the online world work more like the brick-and-mortar world? What if regulators create \"digital licenses\" for Internet-based companies, which make clear the rules and conditions required for market access? Companies above a certain size would have to agree to follow regulations that support free markets and democratic values.</p><p>The E.U.'s General Data Protection Plan is an example of a digital license, focused narrowly on personal data and privacy. Other areas for potential targeting include labor rights and working conditions, competition and monopolistic practices, taxation, artificial intelligence development, and data collection and retention.</p><p>But what if the company refuses to follow the conditions of the digital license? After all, Facebook has a history of ignoring previous agreements and consent decrees.</p><p>Just as countries need to enforce physical borders to ensure leverage over trade and commerce, so too do they need to have the technological tools and legal basis to enforce their digital borders. That means the power to digitally evict the worst violators.</p><p>Is that even technically possible, to \"evict\" a Facebook or Google? Essentially, yes. Already, many countries use technology to decide which companies can access their online users and markets. </p><p>The \"Great Internet Wall\" of China, for example, has guarded its digital border using a number of methods, such as IP address blocking, packet filtering, and domain name system redirection to block websites such as Google, Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Yes, such interventions have been deployed by repressive governments to censor speech and advance economic nationalism. But democratically elected and accountable governments can use these methods for loftier goals. Britain already has blocked some rogue websites.</p><p>Representative democracies can restrict access to enforce legitimate laws and regulations that uphold democracy, free enterprise and the rule of law. The U.S. government already structures communication markets in ways that are recognized as legitimate.</p><p>Some may object that digitally ousting a popular Internet platform would mean losing that company's service. But actual eviction probably wouldn't be necessary; even a credible threat would prod companies to adhere to the digital license. If not, ejection would allow for the emergence of new competitors. In China, the expulsion of Facebook and Google led to alternatives Tencent and Baidu which, despite omnipresent government restrictions, have matured into commercial giants.</p><p>One basic principle of U.S. capitalism is that the nation-state has an inalienable right to mandate the terms of operation for businesses and commercial activity. The free market has never been a free-for-all. Why should Internet-based businesses be allowed to operate differently from historical businesses?</p><p>In the end, no government can properly regulate giant Internet-based companies if it cannot enforce digital licenses by threatening to withhold entry to its markets.

Congress and state attorneys general have their sights on the companies, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is no shortage of people arguing that America's large technology companies -- namely Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google -- have gotten too big and too powerful. That has helped spur the scrutiny by the government officials. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But what to do about the issue? On that, the industry's critics are split.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Some would like to see the businesses broken up. Others want more robust regulation. And there are shades of gray on both sides. Here are four of the most prominent prescriptions being debated.</p><p>  Bright-Line Breakups</p><p>  This is the most drastic surgery, splitting off large portions of the big tech companies.</p><p>  The guiding principle is simple. If you own a dominant online marketplace or platform, you cannot also offer the goods, services and software applications sold on that marketplace.</p><p>  So Amazon could not own the leading e-commerce marketplace and sell Amazon-label goods there. Or Google could not have both the dominant search engine and its Google Shopping service, which shows up in search results. Apple could own an app store that offers music services, but not also its own music service sold there. And so on.</p><p>  Bundling businesses on top of a dominant platform invites conflicts of interest and discrimination against rivals, thwarting competition, proponents of this countermeasure say.</p><p>  ''The world is going to be better off after we break up these companies,'' said Barry Lynn, executive director of Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group.</p><p>  Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has embraced the idea of bright-line breakups in her presidential campaign.</p><p>  But such a sweeping overhaul of the tech industry could bring unknown risks for the companies and shareholders. Many economists are leery of broadly prohibiting companies from entering new businesses, fearing potential losses of efficiency and consumer welfare.</p><p>  The last big government-mandated breakup targeted AT&amp;T in the early 1980s, and that was the dissolution of a government-granted monopoly.</p><p>  Still, the idea is not unthinkable. The remedy initially proposed in the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, endorsed by three leading economists, was to split the Windows operating system business from Microsoft's Office productivity software business. After George W. Bush was elected president, his administration settled the case without a breakup.</p><p>  Selective Split-Ups</p><p>  This is a case-by-case approach to breakups rather than a broad rule applied to all the tech giants. A current example is a plan that would require Facebook to shed Instagram and WhatsApp. A detailed proposal on this, laying out the alleged anticompetitive conduct, was developed by two leading antitrust scholars, Tim Wu of Columbia Law School and Scott Hemphill of New York University Law School, along with Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. (Mr. Wu is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.)</p><p>  The three have made their presentation to federal and state antitrust regulators and to congressional investigators. They explain that starting about 2010, when mobile computing and photo-sharing services were taking off and Facebook was lagging in those areas, the social network embarked on a yearslong campaign to buy nascent competitors.</p><p>  The biggest purchases were of the photo-sharing service Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p>  Typically, regulators challenge mergers when they give a company a big share of an established market. That was not the case when Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, a start-up with 13 employees in an emerging field.</p><p>  Instead, the three argue, the strategy was to buy out budding threats. ''We think that's the better perspective of what was going on -- maintenance of monopoly in the social network market,'' Mr. Hemphill said.</p><p>  In Facebook's case, Mr. Wu said, ''the remedy is straightforward: Unwind the acquisitions.''</p><p>  But an issue in spinning off a unit like Instagram is whether doing so enhances competition. Would a stand-alone Instagram be a real rival to Facebook, or would consumers simply stay with the dominant social network, Facebook, and Instagram suffer?</p><p>  A New Tech Watchdog</p><p>  Getting breakups approved by the nation's courts, which are generally conservative on economic matters, would be a stretch. Besides, some experts argue, a more comprehensive way to police the big tech companies would be with a beefed-up force of regulators.</p><p>  One idea is the creation of a new regulator, a Digital Authority. It would be an expert group to supplement traditional antitrust regulators in the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. It would be able to move faster and have the expertise to constantly track the tech markets and trends.</p><p>  ''Its mandate would be to protect competition,'' said Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale University School of Management.</p><p>  The new regulator was the central recommendation of a recent report about the digital platforms that was sponsored by the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago. Ms. Scott Morton led a group of eight antitrust experts and technologists who worked on the study. Since the report was released in May, members of the group have made a series of presentations to policymakers.</p><p>  In online markets, the flywheel of network effects -- the more people who use a service, the more users, developers and advertisers it attracts -- is especially powerful, creating dominant companies. Yet even in digital markets, the door to new entrants must remain open, said Ms. Scott Morton, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.</p><p>  In traditional antitrust, regulators and courts move at a measured pace, slowly and often after the fact. The goal of a new digital regulator, she said, ''would be to save the rival before it is killed.''</p><p>  The authority, Ms. Scott Morton said, could receive a complaint from a competitor and schedule a hearing two weeks later, when both sides would present testimony.</p><p>  A new regulator? It would be a tough sell in today's political environment. But we do have specialist federal regulators in many other industries, including banking, aviation, transportation, drugs and agriculture.</p><p>  Reining in the big tech companies, Ms. Scott Morton said, is increasingly becoming a bipartisan concern. ''At some point, society will say this is too much power without real oversight,'' she said.</p><p>  Unlock the Data</p><p>  There are also narrower, targeted regulatory proposals. Some of these involve rules that would loosen a dominant company's control of user data, by either forcing that company to share the data with a smaller competitor or giving users more ability to take their data from one service and move it to a competitor. The Stigler Center study cited those data moves in a list of potential regulations and enforcement actions.</p><p>  The idea, broadly, is that data can be a barrier to competition, and that freeing up the personal information collected by the tech giants could lower that barrier.</p><p>  The big online platforms are data monetization machines, collecting, analyzing and exploiting information from consumers, merchants, advertisers and others. And the network effect of data is formidable. The more data the companies have, the more fuel to feed the machine-learning algorithms that power their businesses.</p><p>  ''Data is the real trump card these platforms have,'' said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School and a member of the Stigler Center study team.</p><p>  Mr. Melamed, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, favors a rule that would require dominant digital platforms to give other companies access to their user data for a fee. That would help level the playing field for new entrants and other rivals, he said, but wouldn't be free for them, either.</p><p>  ''You let the competitors have access to their back rooms for a reasonable fee,'' Mr. Melamed said. Such a solution would require regulatory oversight to set guidelines for fair licensing terms. Data sharing would also entail some privacy risk, since no privacy-protection technique is foolproof.</p><p>  A related idea is to mandate that tech companies make user data portable. That means consumers could move their information from one service to another, forcing digital businesses to compete with superior offerings rather than data lock-in.</p><p>  The regulator would need the technical skills to ensure that the consumer data was handed over in a way that would let a competitor use it easily.</p><p>  ''The details are crucial, if you're really going to give consumers more choice and control,'' said Jamie Morgenstern, a computer scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who worked on the study.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: A billboard in San Francisco for Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign advocating major surgery for big tech.

To address this question, the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business spearheaded a yearlong multidisciplinary research effort and now is presenting the final results.</p><p>The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms Final Report and Policy Brief, released Sept. 17, identifies the trouble with America's largest technology companies in four areasmarket structure, consumer privacy and data protection, media, and political systems. It then delivers policy recommendations to rein in Big Tech, including creating a new Digital Authority.</p><p>\"We want to reduce the harmful effects of digital platforms without reducing the enormous benefits they bring,\" said Luigi Zingales, faculty director of the Stigler Center and a finance professor at Chicago Booth. \"Taken together, the recommendations are aimed at maintaining the benefits of digital platforms while promoting competition, protecting consumers and defending democracies.\"</p><p>The policy brief and the accompanying 330-page report are the result of 12 months of research and debate among more than 30 scholars and policymakers convened by the Stigler Center at its annual antitrust and competition conference in Chicago.</p><p>The recommendations come at a time when the U.S. government is increasing its own scrutiny of digital platforms. State attorneys general from across the country announced last week a sweeping investigation into the market power of big technology companies including Google and Facebook. The Justice Department said in July that it would start an antitrust review into Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion as part of a settlement related to violating consumers' privacy rights.</p><p>The Stigler report cites \"the lack of meaningful competition in many key digital markets\" and adds that \"the concentration of economic, media, data and persuasion, and political power is incredibly dangerous for our democracies.\"</p><p>A significant problem with scholarship around policymaking in many areas, but particularly around digital platforms, is the influence or even the perceived influence of corporate money and donations on think tanks, NGOs, and even universities, said Zingales, one of the world's leading economists and an expert on the issues at intersection of economics and politics. To preserve not only the independence but also the appearance of independence of the analysis, the center recruited scholars and experts who had not worked for, consulted with or acted as expert witness for or against Google or Facebook within the previous two years.</p><p>The policy recommendations from the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms build on the solutions formed by four subcommittees, each writing a separate report on its findings. The four subcommittee reports are Market Structure and Antitrust, Privacy and Data Protection, Media and Politics.</p><p>The key policy recommendations are as follows:</p><p>Force interoperability among social media, similar to how phone companies operate. Mandate an open and common application program interface that allows different messaging systems to connect to one another.</p><p>Change the threshold for merger review, basing it on transaction value or other criteria that allow regulators to scrutinize transactions between digital platforms and startups.</p><p>Create inside the FTC a Digital Authority, capable of overseeing all aspects of digital platforms. This DA would oversee how these companies collect data, set up rules allowing data portability among competing service providers and data sharing with third parties, promote open standards, and review mergers in parallel with the Justice Department.</p><p>Extend campaign disclosure obligations to specifically target digital platforms, including relationships with politicians, academic funding, and the intentional promotion or demotion of content related to political figures.</p><p>Adopt sticky pro-consumer default rules, forcing companies to actually explain data protection practices to consumers instead of just encouraging them to click \"I agree.\" Also discourage so-called dark patterns, or user interfaces that can confuse consumers or manipulate them.</p><p>Remove the safe-harbor protections associated with Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act for content actively promoted and monetized by digital platforms.</p><p>Promote investigative and democratic journalism by: setting up pilot projects that instruct the development of alternative funding sources for local news media; and requiring antitrust authorities to consider media plurality when reviewing mergers between media companies.</p><p>Impose an additional fiduciary duty on the boards of monopolies, specifically a fiduciary duty toward society.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123202652</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3C-26B1-JCBF-S13Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 17, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A wasteland. A place of confusion and half-truth. Ask Americans these days for their impressions of the news media and they are likely to produce such grim descriptions.<br/>These sentiments boil and fester as political and regulatory communities, whether motivated to tackle information monopolies or address data-privacy concerns, seem poised to get serious about new laws that could fundamentally alter the media ecosystem. But much of this energy is focused on the big tech companies, when the crisis, as the public perceives it, is deeper.</p><p><br/>Policy makers could do more, much more, to help the collapsing news industry, which is pulling down America's civic culture with it.<br/>At the moment, the overwhelming problem is not a deluge of fake news (with a need to suppress it), but an undersupply of quality news, particularly at the local, state, and regional levels. The lack of such news has become an issue even for social-media platforms, which serve up other available stories instead-including whatever crazy, amusing, or outrageous pieces of content start trending online. But no business solution is in sight; most local news outlets cannot seem to make a profit.<br/>The federal government could help address this market failure through the tax code. As the legal scholar Cass Sunstein has <url normalizedValue=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10935.html\">pointed out</url>, the government has long held the power to subsidize speech, a tradition begun when America's 18th-century leaders gave postal subsidies to newspapers and magazines to ensure the diffusion of knowledge throughout the sprawling young republic.<br/>What if the government offered tax-free status to media start-ups and smaller existing news outlets that could demonstrate a commitment to public service?<br/>For sure, the issue of defining the public interest       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/revisiting-the-broadcast-public-interest-standard-in-communications-law-and-regulation/#critiques\">has bedeviled</url> the Federal Communications Commission and the TV broadcasting world for decades. But the vast majority of regulatory decisions would be straightforward, and in a crisis like ours, worries about edge cases should not stop progress. Policy makers could keep the rules simple and let independent regulators make the decisions, subject to legal review. They could also impose a market-capitalization limit, so no current conglomerates would qualify.<br/>About a decade ago, a number of leading media thinkers were toying with ideas such as creating       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://archives.cjr.org/reconstruction/the_reconstruction_of_american.php\">low-profit companies</url>for these purposes, or more modest       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/Rejuvenating_American_Journalism_Bob_McChesney_FTC_Workshop_Presentation.pdf\">tax-credit proposals</url>. More resources are now flowing toward       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://shorensteincenter.org/funding-the-news-foundations-and-nonprofit-media/\">nonprofit news models</url>. That's good. But coming up with the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/newspapers/\">tens of billions</url> in annual revenue needed to serve and inform a vast country of 330 million people is tough. So why not open the floodgates for commercial innovation and see what happens?<br/>Another way to change the market for news would be to protect news consumers from the costs imposed by internet-service providers through a 21st-century version of the postal subsidy. Specifically, regulators could devise a rule exempting the news from data caps, which might become stricter as telecommunications companies consolidate power. Under \"news neutrality,\" everyone would have a right to access news sources without charge, and at the fastest possible speed. (At the moment, this change would have more of an effect on video news than on text.)<br/>Of course, the first hurdle would be to define what \"news\" is. Regulators could take a fairly expansive view of the word, including any and all information gathered on socially significant issues. News has always been a mix of hard and soft stories, so the granting of this benefit might be based on a holistic evaluation of what an outlet does-whether it serves a public interest in some general sense.<br/>Finally, the government could help on the advertising front by allowing news companies to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/business/media/google-facebook-news-media-alliance.html\">band together</url> to negotiate revenue sharing with the big tech companies. (The Federal Trade Commission would likely have to approve such collective action.) Ultimately, perhaps, the likes of Google and Facebook could pay news companies a \"carriage fee,\" as cable companies do broadcasters, for the privilege of disseminating their content.<br/>None of the many possible policy schemes to rectify the collapse of the news business will bring back the days of old. We are not going back to a time of three TV networks and a moneymaking newspaper in every city. Yet finding new ways to help anchor our digital public sphere through higher-quality, sustainable news institutions is vital.<br/>Problems in the news business grow deeper each year as policy makers do nothing. The ideas outlined above could of course lead to negative unintended consequences. But the social consequences of the status quo-in which news sources crater as the government offers no additional support-are likely worse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-policymakersshoulddomorehelpnewsindustry586069</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSW-14N1-JCG7-V1XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Many developed countries are also far behind in the digital race.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The global digital economy seems to be concentrated in just two countries  one developed and the other, still developing. It may seem outrageous but the US and China account for about 90 per cent of the market value of the world's 70 largest digital platforms and they own around 75 per cent of all patents related to blockchain technologies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> They are also responsible for approximately 50 per cent of global spending on Internet of Things (IoT) and dominate 75 per cent of the cloud computing market. Amber lights are blinking on the dashboard of the global economy once again.</p><p> The fight for dominance by a few digital behemoths has far-reaching consequences, in ways that were not thought of before. Players with access to consumer data thwart the rise of local, smaller players.</p><p> At present, big tech companies are the subject of several investigations to see if they use their large data trove to take unfair advantage of competitors.  Smaller rivals and traditional incumbents are not privy to this customer data.</p><p> For example, a search engine company has been accused of favouring its own services over those of rivals. There are concerns over whether a few companies unfairly wield power over their application stores hurting rival apps from competitors.</p><p> Some e-commerce players use their data algorithms to favour their own goods over products from third-party sellers. Acquire smaller rivals, if they thrive, in an early stage.</p><p> Big tech companies often pursue acquisitions to eliminate the threat from smaller rivals. For example, Facebook acquired rival Instagram in 2012, followed by WhatsApp in 2014. But how can market efficiencies be realised when many of these local start-ups are acquired at an early stage by their bigger rivals? Regulators must walk the fine line of regulating tech companies without hurting innovation.</p><p> Yet, the fight for dominance in the digital world has far-reaching consequences due to data-access, in ways that was not thought of before. For example, traditional market regulation mechanisms such as marked maximum retail prices and checks and balances to prevent price fixing and collusion, seem to be losing meaning in a digital world where prices are set in a non-transparent approach, at times by using algorithms.</p><p> Is there a single strategy to win a football game? Highly paid club manager often evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of his team to come up with a strategy. Likewise, each nation needs to address the problem of regulating digital platforms in a different manner.</p><p> To resolve the issues surrounding inefficiencies in access to data, we advocate a mix of three key approaches: a) data privacy approach, b) data localisation approach, and/or c) universal data approach. Data privacy is important but scattershot crackdowns are hurting small fries while digital behemoths thrive.</p><p> In May 2018, the EU introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to harmonise data privacy laws across its member states. To date, about 120 countries have enacted data protection laws and around 40 countries and jurisdictions have pending data-protection bills.</p><p> While helping to preserve data privacy, these regulations at times exacerbate market efficiency. At times, smaller players feel pressured to put a stop to data collection practices, even when such data is integral to their businesses for fear of noncompliance.</p><p> Since GDPR was put into effect, the advertising share of a leading search engine has grown while most other ad-tech vendors in North America and Europe have lost ground. Some countries such as Vietnam are attempting to fight inefficiencies through data localisation requirements and mandating digital platform companies to open local offices in the country.</p><p> This led to multiple data centres being set up locally, creating many jobs and benefiting the economy. The government can also collect taxes easily with local operations in the place.</p><p> Many developing countries, however, do not have the required digital infrastructure, implying higher cost of data storage and higher security risks. There are also talks in India about mandating digital companies to sell public or non-personal data to anyone within the country seeking access to the database to level the playing field for the smaller players.</p><p> This approach is similar to governments acquiring land for making highways or roads, where the owners are expected to act in national interests. However, in encouraging sharing and access, one must also not lose sight of privacy and security risks.</p><p>  Each country is trying to pick a mix of approaches that suit its reality. Indonesia's digital economy is the largest and fastest growing in the Southeast Asia region, but the archipelago does not have regulations on personal data protection yet.</p><p> With the EU's GDPR as a guiding light, Indonesia has drafted a law on personal data protection, which is being reviewed by the House of Representatives. Once adopted, Indonesia will join the ranks of over 120 countries that have enacted data protection laws To exercise greater sovereign control over the country's data, Indonesia adopted strict data localisation mandate in 2012. However, data localisation requirements were relaxed in October last year in a bid to promote foreign investments.</p><p> Since then, data localisation regulations only apply to public entities and those operating digital platforms on behalf of the public entities. However, regardless of the location, all players must ensure that their digital platforms and data are accessible by the regulator.</p><p> There is no talk of universal data access in Indonesia yet. If home-grown companies can get an access to the public data for a fee, it may encourage them to tackle country-specific challenges which are less relevant for the global players.</p><p>  However, bear in mind that the digital behemoths have the financial muscle to lobby for favourable regulations. Hence, in order to push for the right moves, many developing nations including Indonesia will need the backing of Europe, Japan, regional bodies and multilateral organisations.</p><p> Otherwise, the lobbying power of large digital platforms may simply prove too much.

If home-grown companies can get an access to the public data for a fee, it may encourage them to tackle country-specific challenges which are less relevant for the global players.</p><p>  However, bear in mind that the digital behemoths have the financial muscle to lobby for favourable regulations. Hence, in order to push for the right moves, many developing nations including Indonesia will need the backing of Europe, Japan, regional bodies and multilateral organisations.</p><p> Otherwise, the lobbying power of large digital platforms may simply prove too much.

Many developed countries are also far behind in the digital race.    The global digital economy seems to be concentrated in just two countries \u2013 one developed and the other, still developing. It may seem outrageous but the US and China account for about 90 percent of the market value of the world\u2019s 70 largest digital platforms and they own around 75 percent of all patents related to blockchain technologies. They are also responsible for approximately 50 percent of global spending on Internet of Things (IoT) and dominate 75 percent of the cloud computing market.    Amber lights are blinking on the dashboard of the global economy once again. The fight for dominance by a few digital behemoths has far reaching consequences, in ways that were not thought of before.    Players with access to consumer data thwart the rise of local, smaller players. At present, big tech companies are the subject of several investigations to see if they use their large data trove to take unfair advantage of competitors. Smaller rivals and traditional incumbents are not privy to this customer data. For example, a search engine company has been accused of favoring its own services over those of rivals. There are concerns over whether a few companies unfairly wield power over their application stores hurting rival apps from competitors. Some e-commerce players use their data algorithms to favor their own goods over products from third-party sellers.    Acquire smaller rivals, if they thrive, in an early stage. Big tech companies often pursue acquisitions to eliminate the threat from smaller rivals. For example, Facebook acquired rival Instagram in 2012, followed by WhatsApp in 2014. But how can market efficiencies be realized when many of these local start-ups are acquired at an early stage by their bigger rivals?    Regulators must walk the fine line of regulating tech companies without hurting innovation. Yet, the fight for dominance in the digital world has far-reaching consequences due to data-access, in ways that was not thought of before. For example, traditional market regulation mechanisms such as marked maximum retail prices and checks and balances to prevent price fixing and collusion, seem to be losing meaning in a digital world where prices are set in a non-transparent approach, at times by using algorithms.    Is there a single strategy to win a football game? Highly paid club manager often evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of his team to come up with a strategy. Likewise, each nation needs to address the problem of regulating digital platforms in a different manner. To resolve the issues surrounding inefficiencies in access to data, we advocate a mix of three key approaches: a) data privacy approach, b) data localization approach, and/or c) universal data approach.

Indonesia\u2019s digital economy is the largest and fastest growing in the Southeast Asia region, but the archipelago does not have regulations on personal data protection yet. With European Union\u2019s GDPR as a guiding light, Indonesia has drafted a law on personal data protection, which is being reviewed by the House of Representatives. Once adopted, Indonesia will join the ranks of over 120 countries that have enacted data protection laws    To exercise greater sovereign control over the country\u2019s data, Indonesia adopted strict data localization mandate in 2012. However, data localization requirements were relaxed in October 2019 in a bid to promote foreign investments. Since then, data localization regulations only apply to public entities and those operating digital platforms on behalf of the public entities. However, regardless of the location, all players must ensure that their digital platforms and data are accessible by the regulator.    There is no talk of universal data access in Indonesia yet. If home-grown companies can get an access to the public data for a fee, it may encourage them to tackle country-specific challenges which are less relevant for the global players.      However, bear in mind that the digital behemoths have the financial muscle to lobby for favorable regulations. Hence, in order to push for the right moves, many developing nations including Indonesia will need the backing of Europe, Japan, regional bodies and multilateral organizations. Otherwise, the lobbying power of large digital platforms may simply prove too much.     ***    The writer is regional head of Telecom, Media and Technology Research at DBS Bank.

Under the agreement struck by EU leaders, the commission is charged with assessing the plans set forth by EU capitals and making sure they contain genuine reform efforts that will lift growth and contribute to the bloc\u2019s key goals \u2014 most obviously the green and digital transitions.\u00a0</p><p>Ms von der Leyen\u2019s State of the Union speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday morning will be riddled with references to those goals, as she proposes a route for the EU out of its current fragile state. The Covid-19 crisis only underscores the need to accelerate the green and digital transition, she will argue, not slow things down. </p><p>Some member states and MEPs are watching with disquiet. Their concern is that instead of using the hundreds of billions of euros to support economy-enhancing reforms, member states will find ways of frittering the money away on spending programmes that would have happened anyway \u2014 or which do nothing to boost their economic potential.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe recovery fund must not end up as a cash machine for the member states,\u201d Manfred Weber, head of the centre-right European People\u2019s party group in the parliament, told the FT on Tuesday. \u201cI am very worried. When I see what member states already have proposed for their recovery plans there is too little value added or new projects.\u201d </p><p>The commission is acutely aware of the risk of budgetary waste and boondoggles, and on Thursday, it will present\u00a0guidelines for member states on what will be expected in their recovery plans. </p><p>Key benchmarks include how governments will prepare for the green transition, with capitals\u2019 recovery and resilience plans expected to devote 37 per cent of spending to climate efforts. The other element is how to aid the digital transformation of their societies \u2014 a goal that officials are finding a lot harder to quantify. Ms von der Leyen is expected to announce a 20 per cent target for spending on the digital transformation. </p><p>The commission will also set out so-called flagship projects it hopes will sit at the heart of its proposals \u2014 such as the rollout of rapid broadband internet, clean power technologies such as hydrogen, electric car charging points, investment in better building insulation and the expansion of industrial data cloud capacities. Part of Ms von der Leyen\u2019s goal is to find opportunities for national proposals to be married into wider, cross-border projects. </p><p>Once capitals\u2019 plans are submitted, the commission will have two months to analyse them and provide its assessment to member states. The \u201cFrugal Four\u201d, who are among the most distrustful of the commission's track record on economic policing, will be keenly watching \u2014 knowing they have the power to pull an emergency brake on the cash disbursements if they think a country's homework is not up to scratch. </p><p>\u201cIt's not about how to spend it, but how to reform it,\u201d says one Frugal diplomat. \u201cWe don't want any government to be put on trial, so the commission has to do its work well.\u201d</p><p>It was during the five days of fracas at the July summit that Ms von der Leyen made an impassioned plea to Europe's leaders, asking them to have faith in Brussels\u2019 ability to independently police government finances. That trust exercise begins here. </p><p>SOTEU: what to look out for</p><p>Ms von der Leyen is expected to give a lengthy speech setting out her agenda on the green and digital transitions and economic recovery, but MEPs will be watching her messages in a number of other key policy areas as well.

Yet, over the past several decades, technology has drastically changed consumer behavior as well as how governments respond with new rules and regulations. Recent seismic payment shifts away from cash have been driven by the rapid rise of  (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/15/how-to-invest-in-e-commerce.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/15/how-to-invest-in-e-commerce.aspx</url>) e-commerce  and  (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/25/seothe-best-ways-to-invest-in-mobile-payment-stock.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/25/seothe-best-ways-to-invest-in-mobile-payment-stock.aspx</url>) mobile payments.</p><p>Meanwhile, businesses have faced new opportunities and problems. How quickly is the world moving toward a cashless economy? Are certain geographic areas more likely to experience this transformation? Is this a positive change for society? We'll explore these questions, with an aim to capture nuanced positions, while discussing different ways investors can profit from this massive global economic shift.</p><p>Let's start with perhaps the most complex and important piece of the puzzle: how governments around the globe are addressing the digitization of money and how these regulations might spur or dampen future growth of companies betting on a strong digital economic future.</p><p>Can a government ban cash?</p><p>Can governments ban cash? The short answer: They can certainly try. And whether you think attempts to regulate or ban cash are examples of big government run amok or bold attempts to curb tax evasion and black market activities, it's important to recognize that some governments have already tried an outright ban on currency notes. While these attempts have been rare, less drastic regulations surrounding the use of currency notes and bills are more common. Paying attention to these developments in different areas of the world can help investors identify places where there may be opportunity. </p><p>Countries in northern Europe are moving most rapidly toward cashless societies, and while most of the movement is driven by consumers and industry, governments are also playing a role in the end of paper money.</p><p>In Sweden, merchants are allowed to legally reject cash, with \"No cash accepted\" signs sprouting up around the country. More than half of all banks in the country do not accept cash deposits or even keep currency on hand. Denmark's Chamber of Commerce recommended a similar law, permitting Danish retailers to reject cash, but the law was rejected by the country's parliament. The Norwegian Conservative political party championed the notion for Norway to become a cashless society by 2030.  </p><p>Closer to home, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers argued that banning high denominations of cash, such as the $100 bill, would go a long way toward stamping out black market activities, including drug dealing and terrorism.  While not government-related,(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/26/visa-inc-wages-war-on-cash.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/26/visa-inc-wages-war-on-cash.aspx</url>)  Visa incentizes  domestic merchants with $10,000 in rewards for ceasing cash acceptance. </p><p>However, these moves pale next to India's sudden -- and what many described as reckless -- move to ban the 500 and 1,000 rupee bills in November 2016. These currency notes had been the country's two most widely used. The unexpected announcement caused mad rushes to exchange and deposit the notes and temporarily disrupted much of the emerging country's economy. While it is doubtful that the original goals of hindering illegal activities and rampant tax evasion were met, the move did jump-start India's electronic and digital payment ecosystem.</p><p>In Visa's 2018 third-quarter (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/07/25/visa-inc-v-q3-2018-earnings-conference-call-transc.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/07/25/visa-inc-v-q3-2018-earnings-conference-call-transc.aspx</url>) conference call , CEO Al Kelly (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/03/visa-again-capitalizes-on-international-opportunit.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/03/visa-again-capitalizes-on-international-opportunit.aspx</url>) touted  the company's 20% payment volume growth and control of 50% of the market place. In 2017, Paytm's payment volume quadrupled as the digital wallet user base exploded.  </p><p>The positives of a cashless society</p><p>Society can benefit from the rise of digital and electronic payments at the expense of physical currency in many ways.</p><p>Consumers benefit from the security and convenience that credit cards and other forms of digital payments provide. After all, unlike most other methods of payment, once cash is taken and the bad guy gets away, there is no institutional recourse for the victim. The money is gone, unlikely to ever come back. With (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/03/02/the-no-1-way-to-avoid-losing-money-to-fraud.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/03/02/the-no-1-way-to-avoid-losing-money-to-fraud.aspx</url>) credit cards , American consumers are given much greater legal protection and can only be held liable for $50 if they have been victims of fraud or theft. </p><p>Non-cash payments are also much more convenient. Frank McNamara discovered this lesson when he took clients out to dinner in New York City in the late 1940s and discovered, to his horror, that he did not have cash to pay for the meal. His wife bailed him out of an embarrassing situation by arriving to foot the bill. The circumstance made McNamara think of a way for customers to pay for what they could actually afford, but not with the money they had on hand. His solution was the Diners Club card, a charge card that could be used at participating restaurants and hotels. A plastic payment revolution was born. Consumers loved not having to carry large amounts of cash to make their purchases.</p><p>There are also benefits for merchants in removing cash from transactions. Studies show consumers are willing to spend more and are less sensitive to price when they use a credit card than with cash, which means retailers can charge more for products and services when they accept cards as a means for payment.  </p><p>Security is also an issue for businesses. There are costs to keeping money safe, such as on-site safes and secure transportation from the business location to the bank. Cash exposes businesses to the possibility of embezzlement, theft, and robberies. Accounting for this security can be both expensive and taxing. In fact, some studies suggest the use of cash costs a society as much as 1.5% of its GDP.</p><p>Governments have incentives to push for a cashless society. Law bodies are the ones introducing these laws and regulations to ban cash. Ending the use of cash in society curbs fraud because there's no room for fudging numbers when all payments are electronic, whether it be citizens or employers trying to dodge taxes or businesses trying to inflate revenue.</p><p>Cash is anonymous and largely traceless, making it ideal for negotiating illegal transactions, which, of course, the government has an interest in stopping.</p><p>Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is one of many who have argued cash is a boon to criminal activity. As he wrote in The Washington Post, \"[I]llicit activities are facilitated when a million dollars weighs 2.2 pounds as with the 500 euro note rather than more than 50 pounds as would be the case if the $20 bill was the high denomination note.\" He concluded that \"a moratorium on printing new high denomination notes would make the world a better place.\" </p><p>The negatives of banning cash </p><p>Some of the very characteristics that can make cash problematic are also reasons why it's so useful and integral to our society.</p><p>Cash is private, so using it makes keeps your transactions safe from surveillance. It's extremely difficult for others to see how you're spending your money, from nosy family members, as well as third parties, like your bank, credit card company, or credit rating agency. If you only use cash, you won't be at risk of having your account drained by a criminal or hacker who gets ahold of your information.</p><p>Then there's a sticky issue of how to determine the limits of what government should be trusted to track. Many believe this is the real reason behind government attempts to restrict the use of cash, including (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2016/03/01/the-great-cash-grab/#192b87624aed\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2016/03/01/the-great-cash-grab/#192b87624aed</url>) Steve Forbes who wrote  in response to Summers, \"The real reason for this war on cash ... is an ugly power grab by Big Government.\"</p><p>In an age where (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/03/why-data-breaches-should-scare-you-and-how-to-prot.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/03/why-data-breaches-should-scare-you-and-how-to-prot.aspx</url>) data breaches  are virtually an everyday occurrence and big tech companies know us better than we know ourselves, it is easy to see why concerns about privacy and personal security are paramount.</p><p>London-based security company G4S issued a Global Cash Report, in which its CEO Jesus Rosano summed up cash's attractive qualities: \"People trust cash; it's free to use and readily available for consumers, it's confidential, it can't be hacked and it doesn't run out of battery power -- these unique qualities continue to hold significant value to people living on all continents.\"</p><p>Finally, some people say that refusing to accept cash is a form of discrimination against people who are the least well-off economically.</p><p>In 2014, the Office of the Inspector General stated that about one-quarter of the country's adult population lived outside the \"financial mainstream,\" which the report defined as either not having a bank account or having to use expensive services such as payday lenders. Many low-income earners don't have the same kind of access to financial institutions as the average person, for an array of different reasons.</p><p>After some New York City restaurants, such as Sweetgreen and Dig Inn, decided to stop accepting cash for payment, legislation was introduced to penalize such behavior with a fine, on the premise that it discriminated against the city's financially underserved. According to New York City Councilman Richie Torres, \"We should not be stigmatizing how poor people purchase goods and services.\" </p><p>How to profit from the war on cash</p><p>These complicated trade-offs are what free societies must wrestle with. Ultimately, people will come down on opposite sides of the issue and make different decisions concerning how to handle their own personal transactions. Either way, it's undeniable that the use of electronic and digital payments is growing rapidly around the world.</p><p>In 2011, Mastercard released a study claiming that cash was still used as a payment method in 85% of the transactions facilitated around the world and good for about 60% of total retail transaction value. Six years later, at Mastercard's 2017 investor day, CEO Ajay Banga said that cash was now being used in about 80% of the world's transactions.

Alibaba Group Holding</p><p>(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/03/1-top-stock-you-can-buy-and-hold-for-the-next-deca.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/03/1-top-stock-you-can-buy-and-hold-for-the-next-deca.aspx</url>) Alibaba  makes this list due to its 33% stake in Ant Financial, the fintech juggernaut responsible for (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/02/alibaba-group-just-wont-stop-growing.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/02/alibaba-group-just-wont-stop-growing.aspx</url>) Alipay  and consortium of other financial services including Ant Fortune, MYbank, and Zhima Credit. In Alibaba's 2018 Q3, Ant Financial boasted 700 million active users in China, a number made all the more staggering since 70% of its user base used at least three of its services.  </p><p>Ant Fortune is a mobile app that allows users to invest in a variety of Chinese investment vehicles, usually commission-free. MYbank is a cloud-based online banking platform for small businesses in China, where only approximately 14% have access to banking services such as loans and credit. Zhima Credit is a private credit platform that essentially generates credit scores for Chinese consumers who opt to use its services.</p><p>CEO Daniel Zhang shared the company's long-term goals in his 2018 letter to shareholders: </p><p>Looking ahead, our vision is to deliver digital transformation for all our clients using cloud-computing technology in the areas of retail, marketing, finance, logistics and other supporting services within the Alibaba Operating System. Globalization has always been Alibaba's longterm strategy. We are making progress toward our goal to realize 'global buy,' 'global sell,' 'global delivery,' 'global travel' and 'global pay.' This will ultimately create one truly globalized digital economy where goods can move freely around the world, and not just from China to the world.</p><p>Alibaba's intentions to reshape finance and enable a cloud-based, global payments platform make the company a particularly compelling fintech investment for an economy moving away from the use of cash. With a massive base of 700 million members, there's a decent-sized chance Alibaba is a huge catalyst toward a universal payments and (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/01/alibaba-is-expanding-its-e-commerce-platform-into.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/01/alibaba-is-expanding-its-e-commerce-platform-into.aspx</url>) e-commerce platform.</p><p>2. Mastercard</p><p>Mastercard essentially acts as a toll road for consumers' money, taking a small cut every time it moves funds from consumers' bank accounts to merchants' accounts when a purchase is made. For all intents and purposes, in the Western world, Mastercard operates as one part of a (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/06/3-reasons-mastercard-and-visa-are-still-buys.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/06/3-reasons-mastercard-and-visa-are-still-buys.aspx</url>) duopoly  with Visa as a payments network. It currently has about 2.5 billion cards issued across the globe and its products facilitate nearly 20 billion transactions every quarter.  </p><p>Its (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/07/how-do-visa-and-mastercard-make-money.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/08/07/how-do-visa-and-mastercard-make-money.aspx</url>) business model  necessitates partnerships with banks and other financial institutions. Mastercard does not directly lend money to consumers. That responsibility falls on the shoulders of its banking partners, so Mastercard is not liable for the massive amounts of credit card loans held by its cardholders. While this also means Mastercard does not collect interest on these loans, the underlying results is that it runs an extremely asset-light business model, one with an envy-inducing non-GAAP operating margin of 59.4%, according to its most recent earnings presentation.  </p><p>This high operating margin allows Mastercard to return money to shareholders by repurchasing (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-a-share-repurchase.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-a-share-repurchase.aspx</url>) shares  and issuing (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/06/mastercard-incs-dividend-could-double-in-just-5-ye.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/06/mastercard-incs-dividend-could-double-in-just-5-ye.aspx</url>) dividends,  while investing in complementary services that it can upsell to existing clients. These (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/09/mastercards-services-fuel-another-strong-quarter.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/09/mastercards-services-fuel-another-strong-quarter.aspx</url>) bundled services  include features and products ranging from data analytics and reward program management to fraud prevention tools and digital services. Accounted for in its \"(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/26/mastercards-recipe-for-extra-juice.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/26/mastercards-recipe-for-extra-juice.aspx</url>) other revenues \" segment, these services have maintained a double-digit growth rate for several consecutive quarters and are becoming an increasingly larger revenue stream for the company.  </p><p>Beyond adding to the company's top and bottom lines, these services make Mastercard's relationship with its clients much stickier, meaning it's harder for its partnering banks and credit unions to leave Mastercard for a competitor if the client relies on Mastercard for other services.</p><p>3. PayPal Holdings</p><p>The best way to think of PayPal might be as an operating system for money. From its digital wallet platform, account holders can send money to friends, make quick and secure online purchases, or transfer money to different accounts.</p><p>The company is benefiting from society's move away from cash, not the least of which is manifested by the growth in (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/04/paypal-is-the-obvious-winner-of-the-mobile-commerc.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/04/paypal-is-the-obvious-winner-of-the-mobile-commerc.aspx</url>) mobile payments , transactions facilitated with a mobile device. Judging by its growing 250 million-plus active account user base, PayPal is beginning to develop a real (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-the-network-effect.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-the-network-effect.aspx</url>) network effect moat, meaning PayPal's service becomes more valuable the larger its platform grows. As more consumers sign on to PayPal's service, the more compelling it is for merchants to accept PayPal as a payment method. Furthermore, the more merchants that accept PayPal, the more consumers can use the platform.</p><p>CEO Dan Schulman acknowledged the company was enjoying significant tailwinds from the move to a cashless society and mobile commerce. In the company's 2017 fourth-quarter conference call, he said, \"We are riding powerful and accelerating tailwinds created by 2 global trends, the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile devices. We are actively positioning ourselves to take full advantage of these trends and strategically moving our business into areas where we believe these transformations are creating the strongest opportunities.\"</p><p>Mobile payment volume represents 40% of PayPal's total payment volume, and the segment is quickly growing.  </p><p>A huge driver of PayPal's mobile success is its (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/19/has-paypal-met-its-match.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/19/has-paypal-met-its-match.aspx</url>) One Touch platform , where users can make transactions with one click on a registered device. This removes the hassle of entering cumbersome and tedious information into a small smartphone screen with each purchase. It's also more secure, as users are not leaving their personal identification and payments information on different websites, but instead giving it out as (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/08/what-is-tokenization.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/08/what-is-tokenization.aspx</url>) tokenized data  through PayPal. </p><p>Merchants love the platform because shoppers who use PayPal are much more likely to finalize a purchase compared to those who use other payment methods. One Touch has more than 100 million consumers and 10 million merchants participating on the platform.  </p><p>4. Square</p><p>Square was (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/21/square-stock-history-a-complete-timeline.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/21/square-stock-history-a-complete-timeline.aspx</url>) founded  by Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey who developed the concept after a friend had a hard time selling a piece of art because he didn't have the ability to accept credit cards as payment. Square released its first product, a small square-shaped device that plugs into a mobile device, enabling any person with a cell phone to accept payments from credit and debit cards. Merchants began using these at the point-of-sale and the company soon expanded its suite of offerings.</p><p>The product effectively democratized payments, enabling small businesses -- think food trucks, farmer market vendors, etc. -- to cheaply accept card payments for the first time. Square's quarterly gross payment volume (GPV), the total amount of money facilitated through Square's point-of-sale system, is now $22.5 billion, and has grown between 29% to 31% year over year for five consecutive quarters.  </p><p>Square's products for sellers have grown to include (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/10/the-biggest-advantage-of-squares-ecosystem.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/10/the-biggest-advantage-of-squares-ecosystem.aspx</url>) a robust suite of products for small businesses that were traditionally only available to larger retailers. This (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/09/what-is-squares-competitive-advantage.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/09/what-is-squares-competitive-advantage.aspx</url>) ecosystem  differentiates Square form its payment processing peers because it gives it a deeper relationship with its merchants rather than just a vendor offering a commoditized service like cash registers. This subscription and services-based revenue segment has show explosive growth, with sales even eclipsing a triple-digit growth rate year over year in recent quarters.  </p><p>Square's products are also beginning to appeal to (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/17/how-square-successfully-serves-substantial-sellers.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/17/how-square-successfully-serves-substantial-sellers.aspx</url>) larger businesses . In the company's 2018 third quarter, businesses with annualized payment volume over $500,000 represented 24% of Square's customer base, up from just 16% two years before. There is also evidence that many of Square's sellers are growing within its ecosystem, a good indicator of future success for Square. More than 40% of Square's large sellers (defined as having GPV between $125,000 to $500,000) started off as micro sellers (less than $125,000 in GPV) on the company's payments platform.</p><p>5. Visa</p><p>Sporting a near identical (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/25/how-visa-inc-makes-money.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/25/how-visa-inc-makes-money.aspx</url>) business model  to Mastercard, Visa's network provides fast and safe transport for funds from a consumer to a merchant bank account after transactions. It does not lend money to its card holders, meaning that it also features an asset-light business model with an operating margin that even tops Mastercard's. In 2018, the fiscal year's adjusted operating margin came in at 66%.  </p><p>Visa's management team sees the greenest pastures for future growth in developing economies, where local currency notes are still used more than other forms of digital and electronic payment methods. In the company's 2018 third-quarter (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/07/25/visa-inc-v-q3-2018-earnings-conference-call-transc.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/07/25/visa-inc-v-q3-2018-earnings-conference-call-transc.aspx</url>) conference call , CEO Al Kelly said:</p><p>As I look at our business ... over the next number of years, the bulk of our growth is going to come from overseas. It's something we're putting a lot of time and attention too. I've personally spent a lot of my personal time overseas. So, I think you're going to continue to see us invest in these markets. The cash displacement opportunity is great.</p><p>One of the company's greatest opportunities is in India, where the company enjoys a more than 50% market share. Visa recently renewed deals with five of the country's largest banks. Kelly said he was \"confident that these deals contribute to further strengthening of our market leadership position across debit and credit products\" in the country.</p><p>Investments making a cashless society possible</p><p>Alibaba, Mastercard, PayPal, Square, and Visa represent the purest ways to invest in the digitization of money. What makes these investments particularly compelling is that they are not passively benefiting from society's move toward digital and electronic payments but are actively driving that change.</p><p>Alibaba's Alipay and PayPal's core platform and (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/26/venmo-is-powering-paypal-higher.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/26/venmo-is-powering-paypal-higher.aspx</url>) Venmo , make it easier than ever for consumers to use their mobile devices to manage their money and facilitate transactions tp merchants but also between friends, families, roommates, coworkers, and classmates. Merchants love the platforms because it helps them complete more online sales.</p><p>Mastercard and Visa make it quick and safe to transfer money across digital and electronic channels. E-commerce would not resemble anything like its current state without these networks and the security and protection they provide to consumers and merchants.</p><p>Finally, Square makes it possible for small businesses to participate in the digital economy. Before Square, small merchants relied on the use of cash to sell their wares. Now it is easy for these sellers to</p><p>make sales by accepting credit and debit card payments without expensive hardware or even a landline necessary.</p><p>With these positions in your portfolio, you'll be set to cash in on a cashless world.</p><p>This article (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/28/how-to-start-investing-in-a-cashless-society.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/28/how-to-start-investing-in-a-cashless-society.aspx</url>) originally appeared in the Motley Fool.</p><p>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFCochrane/info.aspx\">http://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFCochrane/info.aspx</url>) Matthew Cochrane  owns shares of Mastercard, PayPal Holdings, and Square.

For centuries, humans have used cash[1] to buy and sell goods and services because local fiat currency[2] hasbeen the most efficient way to to conduct commerce.Yet, over the past several decades, technology has drastically changed consumer behavior as well as how governments respond with new rules and regulations. Recent seismic payment shifts away from cash have been driven by the rapid rise of e-commerce[3] and mobile payments[4]. Meanwhile, businesses have faced new opportunities and problems. How quickly isthe world moving toward a cashless economy?</p><p> Are certain geographic areas more likely to experience this transformation? Is this a positive change for society? We'll explore these questions, with an aim to capture nuanced positions, while discussing different ways investors can profit from this massive global economic shift. Let's start with perhaps the most complex and important piece of the puzzle: how governments around the globe are addressing the digitization of money and how these regulations might spur or dampen future growth of companies betting on a strong digital economic future. Can a government ban cash? Can governments ban cash? The short answer: They can certainly try. And whether you think attempts to regulate or ban cash are examples of big government run amok or bold attempts to curb tax evasion and black market activities, it's important to recognize that some governments have already tried an outright ban on currency notes. While these attempts have been rare, less drastic regulations surrounding the use of currency notes and bills are more common. Paying attention to these developments in different areas of the world can help investors identify places where there may be opportunity. Countries in northern Europe are moving most rapidly toward cashless societies, and while most of the movement is driven by consumers and industry, governments are also playing a role in the end of paper money. In Sweden, merchants are allowed to legally reject cash, with \"No cash accepted\" signs sprouting up around the country. More than half of all banks in the country do not accept cash deposits or even keep currency on hand.Denmark's Chamber of Commerce recommended a similar law, permitting Danish retailers to reject cash, but the law was rejected by the country's parliament.The Norwegian Conservative political party championed the notion for Norway to become a cashless society by 2030.  Closer to home, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers argued that banning high denominations of cash, such as the $100 bill, would go a long way toward stamping out black market activities, including drug dealing and terrorism. While not government-related,Visa incentizes[5]domestic merchants with $10,000 in rewards for ceasing cash acceptance. However, these moves pale next to India's sudden -- and what many described as reckless-- move to ban the 500 and 1,000 rupee bills in November 2016. These currency notes had been the country's two most widely used. The unexpected announcement caused mad rushes to exchange and deposit the notes and temporarily disrupted much of the emerging country's economy. While it is doubtful that the original goals of hindering illegal activities and rampant tax evasion were met, the move did jump-start India's electronic and digital payment ecosystem. InVisa's2018 third-quarterconference call[6], CEO Al Kellytouted[7]the company's 20% payment volume growth and control of 50% of the market place. In 2017, Paytm's payment volume quadrupled as the digital wallet user base exploded.  The positives of a cashless society Society can benefit from the rise of digital and electronic payments at the expense of physical currency in many ways. Consumers benefit from the security and convenience that credit cards and other forms of digital payments provide. After all, unlike most other methods of payment, once cash is taken and the bad guy gets away, there is no institutional recourse for the victim. The money is gone, unlikely to ever come back. Withcredit cards[8], American consumers are given much greater legal protection and can only be held liable for $50 if they have been victims of fraud or theft. Non-cash payments are also much more convenient. Frank McNamara discovered this lesson when he took clients out to dinner in New York City in the late 1940s and discovered, to his horror, that he did not have cash to pay for the meal. His wife bailed him out of an embarrassing situation by arriving to foot the bill. The circumstance made McNamara think of a way for customers to pay for what they could actually afford, but not with the money they had on hand. His solution was the Diners Club card, a charge card that could be used at participating restaurants and hotels. A plastic payment revolution was born.Consumers loved not having to carry large amounts of cash to make their purchases.

Photo: Francois Nel/Getty Images There are also benefits for merchants in removing cash from transactions. Studies show consumers are willing to spend more and are less sensitive to price when they use a credit card than with cash, which means retailers can charge more for products and services when they accept cards as a means for payment.  Security is also an issue for businesses. There are costs to keeping money safe, such as on-site safes and secure transportation from the business location to the bank. Cash exposes businesses to the possibility of embezzlement, theft, and robberies. Accounting for this security can be both expensive and taxing. In fact, some studies suggest the use of cash costs a society as much as 1.5% of its GDP. Governments have incentives to push for a cashless society. Law bodies are the ones introducing these laws and regulations to ban cash. Ending the use of cash in society curbs fraud because there's no room for fudging numbers when all payments are electronic, whether it be citizens or employers trying to dodge taxes or businesses trying to inflate revenue. Cash is anonymous and largely traceless, making it ideal for negotiating illegal transactions, which, of course, the government has an interest in stopping. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is one of many who have argued cash is a boon to criminal activity. As he wrote inThe Washington Post, \"[I]llicit activities are facilitated when a million dollars weighs 2.2 pounds as with the 500 euro note rather than more than 50 pounds as would be the case if the $20 bill was the high denomination note.\" He concluded that \"a moratorium on printing new high denomination notes would make the world a better place.\" The negatives of banning cash Some of the very characteristics that can make cash problematic are also reasons why it's so useful and integral to our society. Cash is private, so using it makes keeps your transactions safe from surveillance. It's extremely difficult for others to see how you're spending your money, from nosy family members, as well as third parties, like your bank, credit card company, or credit rating agency. If you only use cash, you won't be at risk of having your account drained by a criminal or hacker who gets ahold of your information. Then there's a sticky issue of how to determine the limits of what government should be trusted to track. Many believe this is the real reason behind government attempts to restrict the use of cash, includingSteve Forbes who wrote[9]in response to Summers, \"The real reason for this war on cash ... is an ugly power grab by Big Government.\" In an age wheredata breaches[10]are virtually an everyday occurrence and big tech companies know us better than we know ourselves, it is easy to see why concerns about privacy and personal security are paramount. London-based security company G4Sissued aGlobal Cash Report, in which its CEO Jesus Rosano summed up cash's attractive qualities: \"People trust cash; it's free to use and readily available for consumers, it's confidential, it can't be hacked and it doesn't run out of battery power -- these unique qualities continue to hold significant value to people living on all continents.\" Finally, some people say that refusing to accept cash is a form of discrimination against people who are the least well-off economically. In 2014, the Office of the Inspector General stated that about one-quarter of the country's adult population lived outside the \"financial mainstream,\" which the report defined as either not having a bank account or having to use expensive services such as payday lenders. Many low-income earners don't have the same kind of access to financial institutions as the average person, for an array of different reasons. After some New York City restaurants, such as Sweetgreen and Dig Inn, decided to stop accepting cash for payment, legislation was introduced to penalize such behavior with a fine, on the premise that it discriminated against the city's financially underserved. According to New York City Councilman Richie Torres, \"We should not be stigmatizing how poor people purchase goods and services.\" How to profit from the war on cash These complicated trade-offs are what free societies must wrestle with. Ultimately, people will come down on opposite sides of the issue and make different decisions concerning how to handle their own personal transactions. Either way, it's undeniable that the use of electronic and digital payments is growing rapidly around the world. In 2011,Mastercardreleased a study claiming that cash was still used as a payment method in 85% of the transactions facilitated around the world and good for about 60% of total retail transaction value. Six years later, at Mastercard's 2017 investor day, CEO Ajay Banga said that cash was now being used in about 80% of the world's transactions. In other words, while the use of digital and electronic payment methods is rising, there's still a long runway of growth. There are several options for investors to consider as they explore how they can best position their portfolios to take advantage of these changing consumer habits while avoiding risk from potential regulations. American Expressis finally taking itsdigital presence[11]seriously, partnering withPayPal Holdingsand acquiring two fintech start-ups, an AI-powered concierge app called Mezi, and Cake, a mobile payments solutions app. Amex is also increasing its merchant coverage, meaning its cardholders can use it in a growing number of places, boosting animportant revenue stream[12]. Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS[13]) is being led by anew CEO[14]who appears committed to maintaining the company's legacy of world-classcustomer service[15]. Discover also has a major presence in thestudent[16]andpersonal loan[17]space, making it one of the few domestic companies with a presence in lending and payments. With a P/E ratio well under the market's average, it might also feature the most attractive valuation of all the stocks we will consider. Brazilian payments companyPagSeguro Digitalis showingtorrid revenue growth[18], but margin pressure, or the company's ability to profitably offer its services without lowering its price,has kept thestock price[19]down. Tencent'spayment platforms[20]now boast an incredible 800 million monthly active users but is being held back due toregulatory concerns[21]surrounding its video game business. But while these companies all might offer investors market-beating returns, I don't believe they are all necessarily best-in-class. Market capitalization table of nine companies. Photo: Google Finance What are the top investments for a cashless society? Here are the five best ways for investors to profit from this cashless movement: 1. Alibaba Group Holding Alibaba[22]makes this list due to its 33% stakein Ant Financial, the fintech juggernaut responsible forAlipay[23]and consortium of other financial services includingAnt Fortune, MYbank, and Zhima Credit. In Alibaba's 2018 Q3, Ant Financial boasted 700 million active users in China, a number made all the more staggering since 70% of its user base used at least three of its services.  Ant Fortune is a mobile app that allows users to invest in a variety of Chinese investment vehicles, usually commission-free.MYbank is a cloud-based online banking platform for small businesses in China, where only approximately 14% have access to banking services such as loans and credit. Zhima Credit is a private credit platform that essentially generates credit scores for Chinese consumers who opt to use its services. CEO Daniel Zhang shared the company's long-term goals in his 2018 letter to shareholders:Looking ahead, our vision is to deliver digital transformation for all our clients using cloud-computing technology in the areas of retail, marketing, finance, logistics and other supporting services within the Alibaba Operating System. Globalization has always been Alibaba's longterm strategy. We are making progress toward our goal to realize 'global buy,' 'global sell,' 'global delivery,' 'global travel' and 'global pay.' This will ultimately create one truly globalized digital economy where goods can move freely around the world, and not just from China to the world.Alibaba's intentions to reshape finance and enable a cloud-based, global payments platform make the company a particularly compelling fintech investment for an economy moving away from the use of cash. With a massive base of 700 million members, there's a decent-sized chance Alibaba is a huge catalyst toward a universal payments ande-commerce platform[24]. 2. MastercardMastercard essentially acts as a toll road for consumers' money, taking a small cut every time it moves funds from consumers' bank accounts to merchants' accounts when a purchase is made. For all intents and purposes, in the Western world, Mastercard operates as one part of aduopoly[25]with Visa as a payments network. It currently has about 2.5 billion cards issued across the globe and its products facilitate nearly 20 billion transactions every quarter.  Itsbusiness model[26]necessitates partnerships with banks and other financial institutions. Mastercard does not directly lend money to consumers. That responsibility falls on the shoulders of its banking partners, so Mastercard is not liable for the massive amounts of credit card loans held by its cardholders. While this also means Mastercard does not collect interest on these loans, the underlying results is that it runs an extremely asset-lightbusiness model, one with an envy-inducing non-GAAP operating margin of 59.4%, according to its most recent earnings presentation.  This high operating margin allows Mastercard to return money to shareholders by repurchasingshares[27]and issuingdividends,[28]while investing in complementary services that it can upsell to existing clients. Thesebundled services[29]include features and products ranging from data analytics and reward program management to fraud prevention tools and digital services. Accounted for in its \"other revenues[30]\" segment, these services have maintained a double-digit growth rate for several consecutive quarters and are becoming an increasingly larger revenue stream for the company.  Beyond adding to the company's top and bottom lines, these services make Mastercard's relationship with its clients much stickier, meaning it's harder for its partnering banks and credit unions to leave Mastercard for a competitor if the client relies on Mastercard for other services. 3. PayPal Holdings The best way to think of PayPal might be as an operating system for money. From its digital wallet platform, account holders can send money to friends, make quick and secure online purchases, or transfer money to different accounts. The company is benefiting from society's move away from cash, not the least of which is manifested by the growth inmobile payments[31],transactions facilitated with a mobile device. Judging by its growing 250 million-plus active account user base,PayPal is beginning to develop a realnetwork effect[32]moat, meaning PayPal's service becomes more valuable the larger its platform grows. As more consumers sign on to PayPal's service, the more compelling it is for merchants to accept PayPal as a payment method. Furthermore, the more merchants that accept PayPal, the more consumers can use the platform. CEO Dan Schulman acknowledged the company was enjoying significant tailwinds from the move to a cashless society and mobile commerce. In the company's 2017 fourth-quarter conference call, he said, \"We are riding powerful and accelerating tailwinds created by 2 global trends, the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile devices. We are actively positioning ourselves to take full advantage of these trends and strategically moving our business into areas where we believe these transformations are creating the strongest opportunities.\" Mobile payment volume represents 40% of PayPal's total payment volume, and the segment is quickly growing.  A huge driver of PayPal's mobile success is itsOne Touch platform[33], where users can make transactions with one click on a registered device. This removes the hassle of entering cumbersome and tedious information into a small smartphone screen with each purchase. It's also more secure, as users are not leaving their personal identification and payments information on different websites, but instead giving it out astokenized data[34]through PayPal. Merchants love the platform because shoppers who use PayPal are much more likely to finalize a purchase compared to those who use other payment methods.One Touch has more than 100 million consumers and 10 million merchants participating on the platform.  Merchants love PayPal's One Touch because it has been shown that consumers are more likely to complete the purchase when it is available as a method of payment. Photo: PayPal Holdings 4. Square Square wasfounded[35]by Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey who developed the concept after a friend had a hard time selling a piece of art because he didn't have the ability to accept credit cards as payment.Square released its first product, a small square-shaped device that plugs into a mobile device, enabling any person with a cell phone to accept payments from credit and debit cards. Merchants began using these at the point-of-sale and the company soon expanded its suite of offerings. The product effectively democratized payments, enabling small businesses -- think food trucks, farmer market vendors, etc. -- to cheaply accept card payments for the first time. Square's quarterly gross payment volume (GPV), the total amount of money facilitated through Square's point-of-sale system, is now $22.5 billion, and has grown between 29% to 31% year over year for five consecutive quarters.  Square's products for sellers have grown to includea robust suite of products[36]for small businesses that were traditionally only available to larger retailers. Thisecosystem[37]differentiates Square form its payment processing peers because it gives it a deeper relationship with its merchants rather than just a vendor offering a commoditized service like cash registers. This subscription and services-based revenue segment has show explosive growth, with sales even eclipsing a triple-digit growth rate year over year in recent quarters.  Square's products are also beginning to appeal tolarger businesses[38]. In the company's 2018 third quarter, businesses with annualized payment volume over $500,000 represented 24% of Square's customer base, up from just 16% two years before. There is also evidence that many of Square's sellers are growing within its ecosystem, a good indicator of future success for Square. More than 40% of Square's large sellers (defined as having GPV between $125,000 to $500,000) started off as micro sellers (less than $125,000 in GPV) on the company's payments platform. 5. Visa Sporting a near identicalbusiness model[39]to Mastercard, Visa's network provides fast and safe transport for funds from a consumer to a merchant bank account after transactions. It does not lend money to its card holders, meaning that it also features an asset-light business model with an operating margin that even tops Mastercard's. In 2018, the fiscal year's adjusted operating margin came in at 66%.  Visa's management team sees the greenest pastures for future growth in developing economies, where local currency notes are still used more than other forms of digital and electronic payment methods. In the company's 2018 third-quarterconference call[40], CEO Al Kelly said:As I look at our business ... over the next number of years, the bulk of our growth is going to come from overseas. It's something we're putting a lot of time and attention too. I've personally spent a lot of my personal time overseas. So, I think you're going to continue to see us invest in these markets. The cash displacement opportunity is great.One of the company's greatest opportunities is in India, where the company enjoys a more than 50% market share.Visa recently renewed deals with five of the country's largest banks.Kelly said he was \"confident that these deals contribute to further strengthening of our market leadership position across debit and credit products\" in the country. Investments making a cashless society possible Alibaba, Mastercard, PayPal, Square, and Visa represent the purest ways to invest in the digitization of money. What makes these investments particularly compelling is that they are not passively benefiting from society's move toward digital and electronic payments but are actively driving that change. Alibaba's Alipay and PayPal's core platform andVenmo[41], make it easier than ever for consumers to use their mobile devices to manage their money and facilitate transactions tp merchants but also between friends, families, roommates, coworkers, and classmates. Merchants love the platforms because it helps them complete more online sales. Mastercard and Visa make it quick and safe to transfer money across digital and electronic channels. E-commerce would not resemble anything like its current state without these networks and the security and protection they provide to consumers and merchants. Finally, Square makes it possible for small businesses to participate in the digital economy. Before Square, small merchants relied on the use of cash to sell their wares. Now it is easy for these sellers to make sales by accepting credit and debit card payments without expensive hardware or even a landline necessary. With these positions in your portfolio, you'll be set to cash in on a cashless world. This article originally appeared[42] in the Motley Fool.

Most engineers assume so with a casual fatalism: the rate of advance in artificial intelligence (AI) is so rapid that it is only a matter of time before robots indistinguishable from human beings are built. Will the robots of the future surpass and then subordinate their creators? Some of the initiated believe so. This impending apocalypse has a name \\x96 \\x93the singularity\\x94 \\x96 and is confidently expected in some quarters as soon as 2045.</p><p>  Most existing AI systems have a narrow remit. They are task-focused, designed to perform some specific function \\x96 recognising speech, say, or diagnosing melanoma. Driven by the aggregation of huge data sets and explosive increases in computer processing power, \\x93machine learning\\x94 \\x96 a newly effective technique for designing algorithms \\x96 is facilitating impressive advances in the capabilities of these systems. Machine learning-trained algorithms now outperform human specialists across a range of applications. But artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems that can imitate human thought, like the\u00a0robot Hal in Stanley Kubrick\\x92s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2001: A Space\u00a0Odyssey</emphasis> \\x96 which experts have been claiming are \\x93just around the corner\\x94 since about 1956 \\x96 remain the stuff of science fiction.</p><p>  Jamie Susskind does not think the distinction between the two forms of artificial intelligence \\x96 the specific AI and the human-like AGI \\x96 matters much. Specific AIs will be hard enough to handle, creating \\x93vast new opportunities and risks worthy of careful attention in their own right\\x94. If you integrate enough specific AIs into a single interface you might well end up with something so good at giving \\x93the impression of general intelligence\\x94 that it is functionally indistinguishable from the AGIs of the engineering imagination. Whether or not AGI fictions like Hal become reality does not matter, Susskind insists. We need to stop debating such distinctions and\u00a0 knuckle down to the hard work of adapting our politics to a world reshaped by AI.</p><p>  Susskind believes that a whole new domain of existence \\x96 he calls it the \\x93digital lifeworld\\x94 \\x96 is materialising around us through the proliferation of specific AI systems ordering and streamlining our lives. Organising the digital lifeworld is going to be challenging. Engineers are busy translating existing rules and norms into the rigid terminologies of code. But in the process something important is often lost \\x96 some of the slack or give that lends these rules tensile strength.</p><p>  In the real world it is possible to drive too fast. One risks punishment, injury and social condemnation \\x96 but those are risks one is free to run. Once engineers code speed limits into self-driving cars, speeding will simply be impossible. In this example, a recognised rule is formalised through AI in such a way as to preclude its violation. For Susskind \\x96 an author, barrister and past fellow of Harvard University\\x92s Berkman Center for Internet and Society \\x96 this is a diminution of liberty. It represents a \\x93colonising\\x94 by the authorities of a \\x93precious hinterland of naughtiness\\x94.</p><p>  Moreover, in the process of translating the rules and norms that govern the real world into code, engineers sometimes come upon gaps. The process of filling these gaps further curtails liberty. Consider the scenario in which a child strays into the path of an automated car. Should the driver swerve into oncoming traffic to save the child, risking multiple fatalities in doing so, or hold her course? Reasonable minds will respond to this grim scenario differently \\x96 some may prefer to preserve multiple lives; others will protect the child\\x92s. As things stand we have the autonomy to make a terrible choice. In the digital lifeworld that discretion will be forfeit: the relevant code will have a decision programmed into it in advance.</p><p>  As well as truncating freedom in these ways, construction of the digital lifeworld will give rise to new forms of power that will be difficult to fathom and hold in check using our current conceptual resources. The ability to force us to comply with the law\u00a0will be complemented by new powers of scrutiny and surveillance, persuading\u00a0people that even minor transgressions cannot escape official notice. Artificial\u00a0intelligence will also give governments and businesses new resources to control how we perceive the world around us. News feeds and search results can be manipulated to define what a user sees: state censorship in\u00a0China illustrates the growing reach of these technologies.</p><p>  A related power to control how we are seen by our peers, neighbours and trading partners is also emerging. The Chinese authorities plan to create a comprehensive social credit system, adding private financial data on creditworthiness to information on crime and civic infringements, building on systems already in place in some provinces. Their intention is to put a new premium on trust by making histories of malfeasance harder to mask. There are already systems at work across the world using credit scoring and online user reviews \\x96 this takes them to new extremes, suggesting the kind of future we might all have in store for us.</p><p>  ****</p><p>  These dangers to liberty (\\x93unprecedented\\x94, in Susskind\\x92s estimation) expose shortcomings in our intellectual resources. Political theory as it stood at the end of the 20th-century is inadequate to the task of grappling with the distinctive conditions of politics in the digital lifeworld: this is Susskind\\x92s central contention. If we want to measure and mitigate the risks to liberty posed by AI\\x92s new forms of force, scrutiny and perception control we will look in vain to John Stuart Mill\\x92s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">On Liberty</emphasis>, Isaiah Berlin\\x92s \\x93Two Concepts\\x94 or Robert Nozick\\x92s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Anarchy, State, Utopia</emphasis>: they simply did not see the new forms of power coming.</p><p>  Susskind believes that our concepts of property and democracy are similarly outmoded. Electoral systems will be compromised where new powers of perception control run unchecked. Meanwhile, AI will prompt revision of the parameters of democracy as we currently understand it. We already have apps that ask voters about their preferences and then indicate how to vote. These might be scaled up and decision-making authority handed over to AI systems purporting to understand where a person\\x92s interests lie better than they can. More frequent and exhaustive polling becomes conceivable \\x96 governments could make inquiries, Susskind writes, \\x93thousands of times each day\\x94.</p><p>  Our structures of property will also be rendered unstable. Concentrations of capital in the hands of the wealthy few will be exacerbated by the growing scarcity of\u00a0labour as advances in technology cause unemployment. Whereas it has long been possible for those without capital to work at accumulating a nest egg, automation\\x92s\u00a0unemployed will only be able to invest what little they can save of the subsidies proffered to them by the state. Applying Thomas\u00a0Piketty\\x92s law that the return on capital will continue to exceed the rate of growth, in Susskind\\x92s digital lifeworld inequality between the rich and the rest will rise dramatically.</p><p>  For the convenience of travelling with hands off the wheel we trade some of the freedoms that make being out on the open road a pleasure. But is this kind of threat to liberty really, as Susskind argues, \\x93unprecedented\\x94? Is it not an extension of the processes of rationalisation and bureaucratisation that Nietzsche and Max Weber lamented a century and more ago? Anti-chivalrous cars that prohibit drivers from veering into oncoming traffic to save infant lives, on the utilitarian basis that the death of one innocent is preferable to multiple adult fatalities, sound like the kind of congealments of the human spirit that Weber abhorred. Do we need wholly new conceptual resources to think about them?</p><p>  Corporate behemoths such as Google and Facebook wield influence over how we think, see and are seen in the digital lifeworld, but their power goes unchecked because we fail to view them as political: Susskind argues we have succumbed to the \\x93dangerous\\x94 notion \\x93that a body has to be as powerful as a state before we start taking it seriously as an authentic political entity\\x94.</p><p>  Were our predecessors really so obtuse? It is true the great tradition of political philosophy from Hobbes onwards ascribes surpassing importance to the state. But any number of complementary theories enrich our understanding of how states and civil society groups such as trade\u00a0unions and firms co-operate to organise\u00a0market societies.</p><p>  The complex interaction between individuals, governments and powerful firms has also been a topic of rigorous analysis in political economy. Discussion of the big tech companies consistently distinguishes their business models from those of the 20th-century monopolists that John Hobson, Lenin and Joseph Schumpeter attacked and that anti-trust regimes dismantled. It is insisted that the kind of monopolies these new corporations represent is different, although their business practices \\x96 such as buying out entrepreneurs who threaten the status quo \\x96 suggest otherwise.</p><p>  And if the resolve to curb these firms\\x92 power could be summoned, old-fashioned competition policy might be appropriate after all. Susskind\\x92s own treatment of the \\x93data deal\\x94 that the likes of Google and Facebook offer their users suggests as much. If the information garnered through use of their products is valuable, Google and Facebook emerge as the only buyers in markets with many sellers, suppressing the price of data to maximise their own profits. This is monopsony, a practice regulators are experienced (if not always successful) at policing.\u00a0</p><p>  ****</p><p>  Received wisdom might also prove\u00a0illuminating on the broader fate of labour in the automation era. Susskind recognises that the value of work is not simply material. Some kind of universal basic income could mitigate the loss of a wage or salary, but what about the rest? Susskind proposes that \\x93political theorists, economists, social psychologists and the like\\x94 get to work precipitating a paradigm shift, elevating some kind of activity other than work to the apex of social esteem. But presumably this would involve revisiting earlier efforts in the same vein.</p><p>  The future of work has been foremost in the minds of critics of automation since the 1950s. Some of them did not think the relationship between automation and unemployment one of simple causation. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Human Condition</emphasis> (1958), for instance, Hannah Arendt argued that work was growing scarce in part because it had become unfulfilling. The model of achievement in the modern age had been <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo faber</emphasis>, the craftsman, engineer or inventor who worked to fabricate a human habitat \\x96 making wine jars out of clay, building\u00a0cities of stone and towers of glass and steel. But the environment <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo faber</emphasis> built had ceased to feel hospitable. What Arendt called \\x93world-alienation\\x94 had made the human artifice seem more like a trap than a home. The space race enacted a desire for escape: finally, an end to \\x93man\\x92s imprisonment on Earth\\x94 was within reach. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo faber</emphasis>\\x92s new task was to get us out of here. Automation then was not so much the driver of a dwindling supply of work as a consequence of a broader disillusionment. The \\x93work paradigm\\x94 was in crisis less because work had grown scarce than because work had ceased to be rewarding.</p><p>  However, if low morale as much as technological progress lies behind the replacement of humans by robotic systems, then automation \\x96 and particularly the AI\u00a0advances initiated by new machine-learning techniques \\x96 could reverse the trend\u00a0 and make work interesting again. Part of the promise of these systems is that by taking over data-crunching drudgery they offer interesting problems for humans to solve.</p><p>  In medicine, for example, diagnostic algorithms for certain cancers free up research and development time for improving other treatments. In fashion, systems that expedite online shopping by profiling and then advising customers are built not by supplanting human sales assistants but by equipping human staff to supervise the machine-learning process \\x96 improving the operation of auto-select algorithms by reviewing and correcting their output. In law, the graduate weeks spent in litigation war-rooms hand-coding emails for their relevance to issues in dispute are being foreshortened by machine learning-powered algorithms. So far, this seems to mean not fewer jobs for lawyers, but more rewarding work for them to do. In research science, machine learning is dramatically\u00a0expediting data processing, liberating scientists to formulate and explore more far-reaching hypotheses: the isolation of the Higgs boson particle at CERN exemplifies the kind of discovery that will happen more quickly now.</p><p>  The growing use of robots in these fields is redirecting human workers to tasks more likely to engage their distinctively human faculties. Decades of rationalisation and depersonalisation that broke work down into empty increments may be shifting into reverse. The most exciting AI technologies (so-called \\x93learning apprentice\\x94 or \\x93human-in-the-loop\\x94 systems) give humans a pivotal role in carrying out astonishing feats of engineering. The steady improvement of interfaces means that coding expertise is no longer a prerequisite for these roles. New software is superseding some jobs but creating others \\x96 and not the menial repetition of the production line, which robots now handle, but innovative, constructive, meaningful activity, shaping and refining the\u00a0human artifice.</p><p>  Not everyone is going to end up at the centre of a creative storm of machine learning \\x96 making adjustments, solving tightly framed problems, moving enterprises forward in satisfying leaps and bounds. But other kinds of work that look certain to survive the great automation \\x96 teaching, nursing, care work, hairdressing \\x96 might also be raised higher in the general esteem by virtue of their very survival. The jobs most likely to live on are those the robots cannot manage, requiring feats of tact, dexterity and emotional intelligence that only humans command. These are things we have devalued through the long ascendancy of utilitarianism. Automation might help us to\u00a0re-evaluate these careers, restoring their dignity and earning power.</p><p>  ****</p><p>  It was not the appropriation of humanity by robots but the dehumanisation of people that caused greater concern to 20th-century critics, and that concern should be with us still, not least because recalling it at this juncture might actually lead us towards a more positive appraisal of AI and its implications. Susskind thinks the distinction\u00a0between specific and general AI is immaterial. But it\\x92s arguable that it is everything. For as long as AI remains specific and applied, confining AGI to works of fiction, we have good reason to believe that AI systems will augment rather than diminish our humanity. In reaching the limits of their own capabilities, specific AI systems will help to remind us how impressive seemingly prosaic processes of human cognition (such as appreciating context and sensing latent sentiments) really are \\x96 even as they furnish means to engage those processes to still more inspiring ends.</p><p>  If we are looking for ways to revitalise politics for the new century, these renewed appreciations of human capability seem more promising starting points than the summary abandonment of our efforts to make sense of politics to date. l</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tim Rogan is author of \\x93The Moral Economists: RH Tawney, Karl Polanyi,\u00a0EP Thompson, and the Critique of Capitalism\\x94 (Princeton University Press)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Future Politics: Living Together in a\u00a0World Transformed by Tech</emphasis>  Jamie Susskind  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Oxford University Press, 544pp, \\xA320</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-HV41-DYX2-C002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Statesman Ltd.
