They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P9-KYC1-F0NT-H20V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Australia's political and media elite seemed nonplussed: can they really do that?   It seemed almost unAustralian. At least when old media companies like News Corp use their platforms to promote their interests, they have the decency to dress it up as \"news\".   Or when fossil-fuel companies want to resist climate action they wash their campaign through respectable front groups. (Hello, IPA!)   But when, like Google, you have your own channel used by most Australians most days, what else would you do? In its letter Google said the government proposals would dramatically worsen internet services in Australia and could lead to users' personal data being handed over to media companies: </p><p/><excerpt><bodyText><p>The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses -- news media businesses -- over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google search results and YouTube will be worse for you.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> They encouraged YouTube creators to protest the draft legislation up for consultation until August 28 through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and foreshadowed further action in coming days. The ACCC responded that the letter was based on \"misinformation\".  It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.   Both platforms are heavily represented in Canberra. According to Australia's lobbyist register, Facebook is represented by DPG Advisory Solutions, whose principal, David Gazard, was described in the AFR in 2018 as \"number one in terms of who Morrison speaks to\". Google has multiple representatives, including Newgate Communications and TG Endeavour, that claim close connections with the Nationals.  Still they'd be finding it hard to compete with the Murdochs' News Corp or the Peter Costello-chaired Nine.  Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P4-0321-JD6R-T1BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.

Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N1-SXT1-JD6R-T1XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Australia's political and media elite seemed nonplussed: can they really do that?   It seemed almost unAustralian. At least when old media companies like News Corp use their platforms to promote their interests, they have the decency to dress it up as \"news\".   Or when fossil-fuel companies want to resist climate action they wash their campaign through respectable front groups. (Hello, IPA!)   But when, like Google, you have your own channel used by most Australians most days, what else would you do? In its letter Google said the government proposals would dramatically worsen internet services in Australia and could lead to users' personal data being handed over to media companies: </p><p/><excerpt><bodyText><p>The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses -- news media businesses -- over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google search results and YouTube will be worse for you.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> They encouraged YouTube creators to protest the draft legislation up for consultation until August 28 through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and foreshadowed further action in coming days. The ACCC responded that the letter was based on \"misinformation\".  It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.   Both platforms are heavily represented in Canberra. According to Australia's lobbyist register, Facebook is represented by DPG Advisory Solutions, whose principal, David Gazard, was described in the AFR in 2018 as \"number one in terms of who Morrison speaks to\". Google has multiple representatives, including Newgate Communications and TG Endeavour, that claim close connections with the Nationals.  Still they'd be finding it hard to compete with the Murdochs' News Corp or the Peter Costello-chaired Nine.  Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P9-Y591-F0NT-H2MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out.

Australia's political and media elite seemed nonplussed: can they really do that?   It seemed almost unAustralian. At least when old media companies like News Corp use their platforms to promote their interests, they have the decency to dress it up as \"news\".   Or when fossil-fuel companies want to resist climate action they wash their campaign through respectable front groups. (Hello, IPA!)   But when, like Google, you have your own channel used by most Australians most days, what else would you do? In its letter Google said the government proposals would dramatically worsen internet services in Australia and could lead to users' personal data being handed over to media companies: </p><p/><excerpt><bodyText><p>The law would force us to give an unfair advantage to one group of businesses -- news media businesses -- over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business. The proposed changes are not fair and they mean that Google search results and YouTube will be worse for you.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p> They encouraged YouTube creators to protest the draft legislation up for consultation until August 28 through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and foreshadowed further action in coming days. The ACCC responded that the letter was based on \"misinformation\".  It's a first for Australia, but it's part of a global pattern by the big tech companies to resist regulation -- particularly regulation that costs money or challenges their monopoly.   It's a playbook that includes spending big on lobbying, removing services from countries or states to avoid regulation (and punish regulators), leveraging their user networks to campaign politically and, if necessary, unleashing the lawyers.   Most famously, in 2014, Google shut down Google News in Spain when faced with a law requiring it to pay publishers for using snippets in the News search results.   Both platforms are heavily represented in Canberra. According to Australia's lobbyist register, Facebook is represented by DPG Advisory Solutions, whose principal, David Gazard, was described in the AFR in 2018 as \"number one in terms of who Morrison speaks to\". Google has multiple representatives, including Newgate Communications and TG Endeavour, that claim close connections with the Nationals.  Still they'd be finding it hard to compete with the Murdochs' News Corp or the Peter Costello-chaired Nine.  Just how far big tech will go to protect revenues has shown up this week in the industry's home state of California. The two big app-based transport companies, Uber and Lyft, are threatening to suspend operations in the state rather than comply with a law requiring them to treat their drivers as employees (with consequent minimum wages and benefits) rather than independent contractors.  They spent US$100 million boosting a referendum to be voted on in November to overturn the law. Their yes case is being supported through emails to customers and in-app promotions as well as a multimillion-dollar public advertising campaign.   Now, facing a court order to comply with the law this month, Uber and Lyft have threatened to suspend their services in California until their ballot proposal is approved.  The Australian government believes its draft legislation will prevent the tech platforms from suspending or limiting services. However, Facebook has foreshadowed that it doesn't believe it needs news, saying: \"News content is highly substitutable with other content for our users and ... does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business.\"   Google says it doesn't sell ads against news searches and has consistently said it believes its search delivers more value to publishers through subscriptions and advertising than it takes through using news snippets in its results.   Both companies have been attempting to make friends in the news world through grants and training both to start-up media and traditional voices.  The tech platforms have not threatened legal action against the code, but it can't be ruled out. Last year an internal leak showed Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg threatening legal action against any threatened break-up of the company by US regulators.   \"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he pugnaciously told staff. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MM-5P71-JD6R-T185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>09:31:38 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

They ensure that fair competition exists in an open-market economy.  \u201cThese laws have evolved along with the market, vigilantly guarding against would-be monopolies and disruptions to the productive ebb and flow of competition.  \u201cAntitrust laws are applied to a wide range of questionable business activities, including but not limited to market allocation, bid rigging, price fixing, and monopolies.  The problem for these self-described free marketeers is \u2013 if they oppose antitrust laws\u2026they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually free marketeers. </p><p> Because one or a few companies overwhelmingly dominating a market \u2013 inherently means the market isn&amp;rsquo;t free.  With that dominant market power, these companies can artificially warp the market to their will.  In part \u2013 by anti-competitively crushing any competitors that might attempt to arise.  In part \u2013 by crony-ing up with government to ensure things continue to always go their way.  We&amp;rsquo;re certainly encountering this with the Leftist Big Tech companies \u2013 Facebook, Twitter and Google (owner of YouTube).  They have been massively abusing their nigh-monopoly market dominance.  Conservatives aplenty have been kicked off the Big Tech websites.  And they can go\u2026where, exactly, to replicate the audiences they&amp;rsquo;ve built?  Without a Web search, name for me a please a competitor to either Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.  I&amp;rsquo;ll wait\u2026. You can&amp;rsquo;t \u2013 because there actually aren&amp;rsquo;t any.  When Big Tech silences you \u2013 you&amp;rsquo;re silenced.  And Big Tech has long been bribing the living daylight out of governments everywhere \u2013 to ensure nothing will be done to alter their de facto universal rule.  Forget Wall Street \u2013 Silicon Valley Is the New Political Power in Washington  A lesser known example of this anti-free market monopolistic dominance \u2013 is the music royalty business.  Behold ASCAP and BMI \u2013 who together control the performing rights to approximately 90% of all songs.  What this means is: Just about ANY place that wants to play music \u2013 either prerecorded or live \u2013 must go through ASCAP and/or BMI.  And this certainly means the VAST majority of the most popular tunes and artists \u2013 given ASCAP and BMIs overwhelming dominance.  This absolutely means even the tiniest of places \u2013 coffee shops, mom and pop stores, bars, restaurants, hotels, retail stores,.\u2026  ASCAP and BMI do perform a helpful service. They give these venues one place to pay all royalty rates \u2013 rather than impossibly having to chase down and negotiate with each artist and performer individually.  Except:  ASCAP and BMI have 90% market share not because they&amp;rsquo;re excellent at what they do.  They have it because they are a cartel \u2013 created by the music publishers.  Music publishers \u2013 should be free market rivals.  And they are \u2013 except in music licensing.  In music licensing, publishers combined their market share into these two institutions \u2013 ASCAP and BMI.  What this was \u2013 was the creation of a cartel.  What this is \u2013 is actual, in-practice, Russian-free collusion:  \u201cThe indicators used by the Antitrust Division in detecting antitrust violations are patterns of behavior or transactional records that suggest some sort of agreement among competing companies.\u201d  Which artificially delivered the publishers massive leverage \u2013 and the ability to massively price-gouge.  For decades, these cartels choked to death music performers and music-playing venues alike.  Until 1941 \u2013 when the Department of Justice (DoJ) stepped in. And introduced the consent decrees:  \u201cASCAP and BMI are governed by \u2018consent decrees&amp;rsquo; originally issued by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) as a means to curb the anticompetitive tendencies of the publishing sector\u2026.  \u201cBack in 1941, there was only one legally recognized copyright in music&amp;mdash;the musical composition&amp;mdash;and the balance of power in the industry was heavily tilted to the music publishers and ASCAP.  \u201cAt the time, ASCAP acted as a kind of gatekeeper to the world&amp;rsquo;s most valuable musical repertoires, to the extent that the DOJ took action that same year to balance the scales. The result of this intervention are consent decrees that, to this day, govern how radio, whether AM/FM or digital, licenses compositions\u2026.  \u201cIntended to promote competition in the marketplace for musical works, the consent decrees encourage ASCAP and BMI to compete with one another to attract licensees and recruit new songwriter/publisher members.\u201d  The consent decrees \u2013 truly do assist all the Music Little Guys.  Anyone trying to break into the business ASCAP and BMI dominate:  \u201cUnder the blanket licenses made possible by consent decrees, a performance of a song published by a small independent publisher is worth just as much as a performance of a song published by a huge multinational\u2026.  \u201cThe arrangement is also useful to emerging services that may not have the capital or clout to cut direct deals at the rates demanded by the big publishers\u2026.\u201d  Except\u2026periodically, ASCAP and BMI try to get the Justice Department to modify their consent decrees.  I.e.: ASCAP and BMI kick up the cronyism.  And try to get the DoJ to allow them to again slam down the lid on the marketplace they used to singularly control \u2013 and wish to singularly control again.  That time of attempted DoJ cronyism \u2013 is again upon us.  Attorney General William Barr \u2013 gird your loins:  ASCAP and BMI Call On DOJ to Replace Consent Decrees: Open Letter:  \u201c(T)he two performance rights organizations have issued an open letter endorsing that the DOJ replace the consent decrees with ones that would offer music users many of the same protections they now enjoy, albeit with a sunset clause.\u201d  ASCAP and BMI are yet again asking for the DoJ to end the anti-duopoly protections \u2013 that have kept music royalties palatable for nearly eighty years.  And ASCAP and BMI manage to ask \u2013 with a straight face \u2013 for this duopoly reinstatement\u2026in the name of the free market:  \u201cWe believe that a free market with less government regulation is hands down the best way for music creators to be rewarded for their hard work and intellectual property.  \u201cA free market would create a more productive, efficient and level playing field for everyone involved. Competition is a good thing.\u201d  Except the only thing preserving a free market in the music royalty business \u2013 is the consent decrees.  Without them, we go back to the bad old days when royalty rates killed every Little Guy trying to do anything anywhere with music.  As someone who once tried to sell fifteen million records, I know first hand that the littlest of the Little Guys in the music business \u2013 is the unsigned songwriter/performer.  Ending the consent decrees \u2013 will make those tiny people even smaller\u2026cowering in the giant shadow cast by ASCAP and BMI.  Songwriter/musician Matt Fitzgibbons knows it:  William Barr Must Choose Between Protecting Local Musicians or Enriching Big Music:  \u201cAs a songwriter and musician, I am disappointed that the Department of Justice is considering removing the monopoly protections that have for decades protected local musicians like me from Big Music&amp;rsquo;s overreach and abuse\u2026.  \u201cWhy the Justice Department is revisiting this issue when it just finalized a two-year review of their agreements three years ago, in which it decided that they should remain unchanged, is anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess.  \u201cWhile there are certainly far bigger fish to fry at the DOJ, it seems that whenever Big Music cries loudly enough it finds a shoulder to cry on in Washington.  \u201cOne thing&amp;rsquo;s for certain, though: what is good for Big Music almost always represents a disaster for everyone else in the industry and removing these DOJ agreements would be of no exception.\u201d   In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN1019355320190511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3R-WR01-DXCW-D2NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 11, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They ensure that fair competition exists in an open-market economy.  \u201cThese laws have evolved along with the market, vigilantly guarding against would-be monopolies and disruptions to the productive ebb and flow of competition.  \u201cAntitrust laws are applied to a wide range of questionable business activities, including but not limited to market allocation, bid rigging, price fixing, and monopolies.  The problem for these self-described free marketeers is \u2013 if they oppose antitrust laws\u2026they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually free marketeers. </p><p> Because one or a few companies overwhelmingly dominating a market \u2013 inherently means the market isn&amp;rsquo;t free.  With that dominant market power, these companies can artificially warp the market to their will.  In part \u2013 by anti-competitively crushing any competitors that might attempt to arise.  In part \u2013 by crony-ing up with government to ensure things continue to always go their way.  We&amp;rsquo;re certainly encountering this with the Leftist Big Tech companies \u2013 Facebook, Twitter and Google (owner of YouTube).  They have been massively abusing their nigh-monopoly market dominance.  Conservatives aplenty have been kicked off the Big Tech websites.  And they can go\u2026where, exactly, to replicate the audiences they&amp;rsquo;ve built?  Without a Web search, name for me a please a competitor to either Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.  I&amp;rsquo;ll wait\u2026. You can&amp;rsquo;t \u2013 because there actually aren&amp;rsquo;t any.  When Big Tech silences you \u2013 you&amp;rsquo;re silenced.  And Big Tech has long been bribing the living daylight out of governments everywhere \u2013 to ensure nothing will be done to alter their de facto universal rule.  Forget Wall Street \u2013 Silicon Valley Is the New Political Power in Washington  A lesser known example of this anti-free market monopolistic dominance \u2013 is the music royalty business.  Behold ASCAP and BMI \u2013 who together control the performing rights to approximately 90% of all songs.  What this means is: Just about ANY place that wants to play music \u2013 either prerecorded or live \u2013 must go through ASCAP and/or BMI.  And this certainly means the VAST majority of the most popular tunes and artists \u2013 given ASCAP and BMIs overwhelming dominance.  This absolutely means even the tiniest of places \u2013 coffee shops, mom and pop stores, bars, restaurants, hotels, retail stores,.\u2026  ASCAP and BMI do perform a helpful service. They give these venues one place to pay all royalty rates \u2013 rather than impossibly having to chase down and negotiate with each artist and performer individually.  Except:  ASCAP and BMI have 90% market share not because they&amp;rsquo;re excellent at what they do.  They have it because they are a cartel \u2013 created by the music publishers.  Music publishers \u2013 should be free market rivals.  And they are \u2013 except in music licensing.  In music licensing, publishers combined their market share into these two institutions \u2013 ASCAP and BMI.  What this was \u2013 was the creation of a cartel.  What this is \u2013 is actual, in-practice, Russian-free collusion:  \u201cThe indicators used by the Antitrust Division in detecting antitrust violations are patterns of behavior or transactional records that suggest some sort of agreement among competing companies.\u201d  Which artificially delivered the publishers massive leverage \u2013 and the ability to massively price-gouge.  For decades, these cartels choked to death music performers and music-playing venues alike.  Until 1941 \u2013 when the Department of Justice (DoJ) stepped in. And introduced the consent decrees:  \u201cASCAP and BMI are governed by \u2018consent decrees&amp;rsquo; originally issued by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) as a means to curb the anticompetitive tendencies of the publishing sector\u2026.  \u201cBack in 1941, there was only one legally recognized copyright in music&amp;mdash;the musical composition&amp;mdash;and the balance of power in the industry was heavily tilted to the music publishers and ASCAP.  \u201cAt the time, ASCAP acted as a kind of gatekeeper to the world&amp;rsquo;s most valuable musical repertoires, to the extent that the DOJ took action that same year to balance the scales. The result of this intervention are consent decrees that, to this day, govern how radio, whether AM/FM or digital, licenses compositions\u2026.  \u201cIntended to promote competition in the marketplace for musical works, the consent decrees encourage ASCAP and BMI to compete with one another to attract licensees and recruit new songwriter/publisher members.\u201d  The consent decrees \u2013 truly do assist all the Music Little Guys.  Anyone trying to break into the business ASCAP and BMI dominate:  \u201cUnder the blanket licenses made possible by consent decrees, a performance of a song published by a small independent publisher is worth just as much as a performance of a song published by a huge multinational\u2026.  \u201cThe arrangement is also useful to emerging services that may not have the capital or clout to cut direct deals at the rates demanded by the big publishers\u2026.\u201d  Except\u2026periodically, ASCAP and BMI try to get the Justice Department to modify their consent decrees.  I.e.: ASCAP and BMI kick up the cronyism.  And try to get the DoJ to allow them to again slam down the lid on the marketplace they used to singularly control \u2013 and wish to singularly control again.  That time of attempted DoJ cronyism \u2013 is again upon us.  Attorney General William Barr \u2013 gird your loins:  ASCAP and BMI Call On DOJ to Replace Consent Decrees: Open Letter:  \u201c(T)he two performance rights organizations have issued an open letter endorsing that the DOJ replace the consent decrees with ones that would offer music users many of the same protections they now enjoy, albeit with a sunset clause.\u201d  ASCAP and BMI are yet again asking for the DoJ to end the anti-duopoly protections \u2013 that have kept music royalties palatable for nearly eighty years.  And ASCAP and BMI manage to ask \u2013 with a straight face \u2013 for this duopoly reinstatement\u2026in the name of the free market:  \u201cWe believe that a free market with less government regulation is hands down the best way for music creators to be rewarded for their hard work and intellectual property.  \u201cA free market would create a more productive, efficient and level playing field for everyone involved. Competition is a good thing.\u201d  Except the only thing preserving a free market in the music royalty business \u2013 is the consent decrees.  Without them, we go back to the bad old days when royalty rates killed every Little Guy trying to do anything anywhere with music.  As someone who once tried to sell fifteen million records, I know first hand that the littlest of the Little Guys in the music business \u2013 is the unsigned songwriter/performer.  Ending the consent decrees \u2013 will make those tiny people even smaller\u2026cowering in the giant shadow cast by ASCAP and BMI.  Songwriter/musician Matt Fitzgibbons knows it:  William Barr Must Choose Between Protecting Local Musicians or Enriching Big Music:  \u201cAs a songwriter and musician, I am disappointed that the Department of Justice is considering removing the monopoly protections that have for decades protected local musicians like me from Big Music&amp;rsquo;s overreach and abuse\u2026.  \u201cWhy the Justice Department is revisiting this issue when it just finalized a two-year review of their agreements three years ago, in which it decided that they should remain unchanged, is anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess.  \u201cWhile there are certainly far bigger fish to fry at the DOJ, it seems that whenever Big Music cries loudly enough it finds a shoulder to cry on in Washington.  \u201cOne thing&amp;rsquo;s for certain, though: what is good for Big Music almost always represents a disaster for everyone else in the industry and removing these DOJ agreements would be of no exception.\u201d   In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN1019355320190511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W37-70Y1-J9XT-P39S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 11, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They ensure that fair competition exists in an open-market economy. 'These lawshave evolved along with the market, vigilantly guarding against would-be monopolies and disruptions to the productive ebb and flow of competition. 'Antitrust laws are applied to a wide range of questionable business activities, including but not limited to market allocation, bid rigging, price fixing, and monopolies. </p><p>The problem for these self-described free marketeers is - if they oppose antitrust lawsthey aren't actually free marketeers. Because one or a few companies overwhelmingly dominating a market - inherently means the market isn't free. With that dominant market power, these companies can artificially warp the market to their will. In part - by anti-competitively crushing any competitors that might attempt to arise. In part - by crony-ing up with government to ensure things continue to always go their way. We're certainly encountering this with the Leftist Big Tech companies - Facebook, Twitter and Google (owner of YouTube). They have been massively abusing their nigh-monopoly market dominance. Conservatives aplenty have been kicked off the Big Tech websites. And they can gowhere, exactly, to replicate the audiences they've built? Without a Web search, name for me a please a competitor to either Facebook, Twitter or YouTube. I'll wait. You can't - because there actually aren't any. When Big Tech silences you - you're silenced. And Big Tech has long been bribing the living daylight out of governments everywhere - to ensure nothing will be done to alter their de facto universal rule. Forget Wall Street - Silicon Valley Is the New Political Power in Washington[2] A lesser known example of this anti-free market monopolistic dominance - is the music royalty business. Behold ASCAP and BMI - who together control the performing rights to approximately 90% of all songs. What this means is: Just about ANY place that wants to play music - either prerecorded or live - must go through ASCAP and/or BMI. And this certainly means the VAST majority of the most popular tunes and artists - given ASCAP and BMIs overwhelming dominance. This absolutely means even the tiniest of places - coffee shops, mom and pop stores, bars, restaurants, hotels, retail stores,. ASCAP and BMI do perform a helpful service. They give these venues one place to pay all royalty rates - rather than impossibly having to chase down and negotiate with each artist and performer individually. Except: ASCAP and BMI have 90% market share not because they're excellent at what they do. They have it because they are a cartel - created by the music publishers. Music publishers - should be free market rivals. And they are - except in music licensing. In music licensing, publishers combined their market share into these two institutions - ASCAP and BMI. What this was - was the creation of a cartel. What this is - is actual, in-practice, Russian-freecollusion[3]: 'The indicators used by the Antitrust Division in detecting antitrust violations are patterns of behavior or transactional records that suggest some sort of agreement among competing companies.' Which artificially delivered the publishers massive leverage - and the ability to massively price-gouge. For decades, these cartels choked to death music performers and music-playing venues alike. Until 1941 - when the Department of Justice (DoJ) stepped in. And introduced theconsent decrees[4]: 'ASCAP and BMI are governed by 'consent decrees' originally issued by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) as a means to curb the anticompetitive tendencies of the publishingsector. 'Back in 1941, there was only one legally recognized copyright in music\u2014the musical composition\u2014and the balance of power in the industry was heavily tilted to the music publishers and ASCAP. 'At the time, ASCAP acted as a kind of gatekeeper to the world's most valuable musical repertoires, to the extent that the DOJ took action that same year to balance the scales. The result of this intervention are consent decrees that, to this day, govern how radio, whether AM/FM or digital, licenses compositions. 'Intended to promote competition in the marketplace for musical works, the consent decrees encourage ASCAP and BMI to compete with one another to attract licensees and recruit new songwriter/publishermembers.' The consent decrees - truly do assist all the Music Little Guys. Anyone trying to break into the businessASCAP and BMI dominate[5]: 'Under the blanket licenses made possible by consent decrees, a performance of a song published by a small independent publisher is worth just as much as a performance of a song published by a huge multinational. 'The arrangement is also useful to emerging services that may not have the capital or clout to cut direct deals at the rates demanded by the big publishers.' Exceptperiodically, ASCAP and BMI try to get the Justice Department to modify their consent decrees. I.e.: ASCAP and BMI kick up the cronyism. And try to get the DoJ to allow them to again slam down the lid on the marketplace they used to singularly control - and wish to singularly control again. That time of attempted DoJ cronyism - is again upon us. Attorney General William Barr - gird your loins: ASCAP and BMI Call On DOJ to Replace Consent Decrees: Open Letter[6]: '(T)he two performance rights organizations have issued an open letter endorsing that the DOJ replace the consent decrees with ones that would offer music users many of the same protections they now enjoy, albeit with a sunset clause.' ASCAP and BMI are yet again asking for the DoJ to end the anti-duopoly protections - that have kept music royalties palatable for nearly eighty years. And ASCAP and BMI manage to ask - with a straight face - for this duopoly reinstatementin the name of the free market[7]: 'We believe that a free market with less government regulation is hands down the best way for music creators to be rewarded for their hard work and intellectual property. 'A free market would create a more productive, efficient and level playing field for everyone involved. Competition is a good thing.' Except the only thing preserving a free market in the music royalty business - is the consent decrees. Without them, we go back to the bad old days when royalty rates killed every Little Guy trying to do anything anywhere with music. As someone who once tried to sell fifteen million records, I know first hand that the littlest of the Little Guys in the music business - is the unsigned songwriter/performer. Ending the consent decrees - will make those tiny people even smallercowering in the giant shadow cast by ASCAP and BMI. Songwriter/musician Matt Fitzgibbons knows it: William Barr Must Choose Between Protecting Local Musicians or Enriching Big Music[8]: 'As a songwriter and musician, I am disappointed that the Department of Justice is considering removing the monopoly protections that have for decades protected local musicians like me from Big Music's overreach and abuse. 'Why the Justice Department is revisiting this issue when it just finalized a two-year review of their agreements three years ago, in which it decided that they should remain unchanged, is anyone's guess. 'While there are certainly far bigger fish to fry at the DOJ, it seems that whenever Big Music cries loudly enough it finds a shoulder to cry on in Washington. 'One thing's for certain, though: what is good for Big Music almost always represents a disaster for everyone else in the industry and removing these DOJ agreements would be of no exception.' So this is one of those instances in DC where the best move - is no move at all. Attorney General William Barr and his DoJ - should keep the consent decrees exactly as they are. What's worked for eighty years - ain't broke. And if it ain't broke - don't 'fix' it. AG Barr: Don't just do something - stand there.

They give these venues one place to pay all royalty rates - rather than impossibly having to chase down and negotiate with each artist and performer individually.<br/>Except:<br/>ASCAP and BMI have 90% market share not because they're excellent at what they do.\u00a0 They have it because they are a cartel - created by the music publishers.<br/>Music publishers - should be free market rivals.\u00a0 And they are - except in music licensing.<br/>In music licensing, publishers combined their market share into these two institutions - ASCAP and BMI.\u00a0 What this was - was the creation of a cartel.\u00a0 What this is - is actual, in-practice, Russian-free\u00a0collusion:<br/>\"The indicators used by the Antitrust Division in detecting antitrust violations are patterns of behavior or transactional records that suggest some sort of agreement among competing companies.\"<br/>Which artificially delivered the publishers massive leverage - and the ability to massively price-gouge.<br/>For decades, these cartels choked to death music performers and music-playing venues alike.<br/>Until 1941 - when the Department of Justice (DoJ) stepped in. And introduced the\u00a0consent decrees:<br/>\"ASCAP and BMI are governed by 'consent decrees' originally issued by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) as a means to curb the anticompetitive tendencies of the publishing\u00a0sector....<br/>\"Back in 1941, there was only one legally recognized copyright in music-the musical composition-and the balance of power in the industry was heavily tilted to the music publishers and ASCAP.<br/>\"At the time, ASCAP acted as a kind of gatekeeper to the world's most valuable musical repertoires, to the extent that the DOJ took action that same year to balance the scales. The result of this intervention are consent decrees that, to this day, govern how radio, whether AM/FM or digital, licenses compositions....<br/>\"Intended to promote competition in the marketplace for musical works, the consent decrees encourage ASCAP and BMI to compete with one another to attract licensees and recruit new songwriter/publisher\u00a0members.\"<br/>The consent decrees - truly do assist all the Music Little Guys.\u00a0 Anyone trying to break into the business\u00a0ASCAP and BMI dominate:<br/>\"Under the blanket licenses made possible by consent decrees, a performance of a song published by a small independent publisher is worth just as much as a performance of a song published by a huge multinational....<br/>\"The arrangement is also useful to emerging services that may not have the capital or clout to cut direct deals at the rates demanded by the big publishers....\"<br/>Except...periodically, ASCAP and BMI try to get the Justice Department to modify their consent decrees.<br/>I.e.: ASCAP and BMI kick up the cronyism.\u00a0 And try to get the DoJ to allow them to again slam down the lid on the marketplace they used to singularly control - and wish to singularly control again.<br/>That time of attempted DoJ cronyism - is again upon us.\u00a0 Attorney General William Barr - gird your loins:<br/>ASCAP and BMI Call On DOJ to Replace Consent Decrees: Open Letter:<br/>\"(T)he two performance rights organizations have issued an open letter endorsing that the DOJ replace the consent decrees with ones that would offer music users many of the same protections they now enjoy, albeit with a sunset clause.\"<br/>ASCAP and BMI are yet again asking for the DoJ to end the anti-duopoly protections - that have kept music royalties palatable for nearly eighty years.<br/>And ASCAP and BMI manage to ask - with a straight face - for this duopoly reinstatement...in the name of the free market:<br/>\"We believe that a free market with less government regulation is hands down the best way for music creators to be rewarded for their hard work and intellectual property.<br/>\"A free market would create a more productive, efficient and level playing field for everyone involved. Competition is a good thing.\"<br/>Except the only thing preserving a free market in the music royalty business - is the consent decrees.<br/>Without them, we go back to the bad old days when royalty rates killed every Little Guy trying to do anything anywhere with music.<br/>As someone who once tried to sell fifteen million records, I know first hand that the littlest of the Little Guys in the music business - is the unsigned songwriter/performer.<br/>Ending the consent decrees - will make those tiny people even smaller...cowering in the giant shadow cast by ASCAP and BMI.<br/>Songwriter/musician Matt Fitzgibbons knows it:<br/>William Barr Must Choose Between Protecting Local Musicians or Enriching Big Music:<br/>\"As a songwriter and musician, I am disappointed that the Department of Justice is considering removing the monopoly protections that have for decades protected local musicians like me from Big Music's overreach and abuse....<br/>\"Why the Justice Department is revisiting this issue when it just finalized a two-year review of their agreements three years ago, in which it decided that they should remain unchanged, is anyone's guess.<br/>\"While there are certainly far bigger fish to fry at the DOJ, it seems that whenever Big Music cries loudly enough it finds a shoulder to cry on in Washington.<br/>\"One thing's for certain, though: what is good for Big Music almost always represents a disaster for everyone else in the industry and removing these DOJ agreements would be of no exception.\"<br/>So this is one of those instances in DC where the best move - is no move at all.<br/>Attorney General William Barr and his DoJ - should keep the consent decrees exactly as they are.<br/>What's worked for eighty years - ain't broke.<br/>And if it ain't broke - don't \"fix\" it.<br/>AG Barr: Don't just do something - stand there.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-62107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRP1-F03R-W3NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1346\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Heartland Institute, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Heartland Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And some industry watchers see this wedding as a precursor to the potential next phase: IPO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past 10 years, the industry has been awash with speculation that the two would eventually join forces. It makes sense, watchers say, as they both have similar capabilities, technology and point of view that they can help publishers make more money. So why now, as opposed to then?</p><p>Long courting process</p><p>In a conversation with Adweek, Taboola CEO Adam Singolda and Outbrain CEO Yaron Galai said the leadership of both companies had been meeting in private for close to a decade, as part of what Singolda called \u201ca human process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of times, with humans being humans, it just takes some time to build that trust with each other,\u201d Singolda said.</p><p>And now Singolda will take the reins of the new merged company; Galai will act in an advisory capacity for 12 months after the deal has closed.</p><p>Additionally, Singolda noted the timing of the merger was deliberate given the regulatory scrutiny bearing down on big tech names such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, given their dominance of the online ad market.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re strong and I think they\u2019re perhaps too strong,\u201d said Singolda. \u201cSo, the only way we can truly give them a fight is by joining forces.\u201d</p><p>Terry Kawaja, CEO of Luma Partners, an investment bank that operates primarily in the ad tech and mar tech space, described the merger as sensible given the history of the pair, namely their shared value proposition of native advertising.</p><p>\u201cIt should have happened years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the company is likely to be a significant revenue partner for publishers,\u201d he added.</p><p>Meaningful competitor</p><p>Singolda and Galai also mentioned how the combined entity would pose as a \u201cmeaningful competitor\u201d to Facebook and Google for advertisers. Albeit, Singolda discussed the scale of the disparity between his outfit and the behemoths of Silicon Valley, noting that the combined entity will generate \u201cabout $2 billion in revenue\u201d per year.</p><p>Compare this with the $39 billion in revenue (the vast majority from ad spend) that Google-parent Alphabet reported in the three months to June 30 this year, and the $17 billion reported by Facebook for the same period. \u00a0And the scale of the challenge becomes apparent.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re very small and we have a huge mission of getting advertisers a chance to have an alternative to the three monopolies [including Amazon],\u201d added Singolda.</p><p>Publisher concerns</p><p>Given Outbrain and Taboola\u2019s dominance of the content recommendation market, some publishing sources expressed concerns over exactly how the proposed entity will operate, with some even saying that it may lead to \u201cless guarantees on minimum spend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many respects, we look at the two solutions as Coke and Pepsi,\u201d said an exec for a top media publisher, who spoke with Adweek on the condition of anonymity because they work closely with Taboola, regarding how the difference between the two companies is minimal. Media execs no longer have to choose between the first-punch sweetness or the longer-lasting flavor.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on Taboola primarily for the ability to control the quality of ads that are showing up on the site, and they\u2019ve given us more control if we see something we don\u2019t like, which happens a lot, [so] we\u2019re able to shut down those ads much more readily,\u201d the source said. \u201cOutbrain didn\u2019t give us the same kind of control.\u201d</p><p>While the merger could be sold to publishers as a way to take on Facebook and Google in a bigger way, \u201cit may not be good\u201d and could actually cut down on the choice publishers have over what kind of ad content appears on their sites, said Raju Narisetti, director of the Knight-Bagehot Fellowship Program in Economics and Business Journalism at Columbia University and former CEO of Gizmodo Media Group.</p><p>\u201cMost publishers that have resorted to Taboola and Outbrain have really undermined their brands because the quality of the ads is so despicable. They\u2019ve sold their trust and the credibility of their brands by putting those modules all over their websites,\u201d Narisetti said. \u201cIt\u2019s a drug for media companies.

But are there opportunities enough to compensate for any losses?</p><p>Biotech and the diversification of expertise</p><p>The wave of digital technology that has risen to prominence this century breaks down into a diverse mix of companies, of differing sizes and specialisms.</p><p>Much of these firms are focused on working with or serving the life sciences industry, particularly those, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/life-sciences-industry-strives-towards-unified-clinical-model\">Veeva</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/communicating-the-value-of-new-products-to-payers-and-providers-in-today-s-crowded-market\">others</url>, that are working on the kinds of web-based tools traditionally associated with the digital sector.</p><p>Such firms are enabling rapid and far-reaching changes, such as the use of real-world data to guide regulatory submissions, pricing, reimbursement and market access discussions, and sales enablement functions.</p><p>On the more speculative side, technologies such as the blockchain concept underpinning the cryptocurrencies Bitccoin are being <url normalizedValue=\"https://medcitynews.com/2017/03/two-california-startups-preparing-pharma-companies-blockchain/?rf=1\">pioneered</url> in medical record keeping.</p><p>Many startups are also competing directly in the life sciences space, such as in the area of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7a60642-0361-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9\">medical devices</url>, where new forms of hardware and software are able to rapidly gain market share against established players.</p><p>The pharmaceutical sector, with its greater dependence on lab-based clinical research and compound development, may appear more resistant to entrants from another field, but as drug discovery and development becomes more <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/05/navigating-the-fragmented-outsourced-manufacturing-sector/\">fragmented and outsourced</url>, a novel concept can easily go from seed funding to the lab, with the help of CMOs, in record time.</p><p>This is particularly the case in the area of biotechnology, which the older pharmaceutical players are themselves still coming to terms with, and which involves a diffuse range of specialisms.</p><p>No single player can have a monopoly on ever-changing areas of expertise required to innovate in biopharmaceuticals, and even very large firms are forced to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/takeda-trusts-biotech-startup-ovid-to-develop-rare-epilepsy-drug\">collaborate</url> with startups to discover compounds or take them forward.</p><p>The dynamic world of biotech startups also represents a chance for established life sciences companies to buy into next-generation technologies, with investment arms such as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.novoholdings.dk/seeds/team\">Novo Seeds</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/merck-ventures-matches-9-million-series-a-investment-in-macrophage-pharma\">Merck Ventures</url> capitalizing on investment opportunities in immuno-oncology and other areas.</p><p>Artificial intelligence</p><p>Drug discovery itself is increasingly dependent on digital technologies and software models more commonly seen in a Californian tech company, making the gaps between Silicon Valley startup and established drugmaker smaller, and blurring the lines between these industries.</p><p>In recent years, a plethora of drug discovery platforms have emerged, utilizing highly sophisticated computational models driven by the sorts of algorithms you'd expect to find in development at Google - including artificial intelligence concepts.</p><p>For example, America's Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) is working with San Francisco-based Atomwise to identify neurological candidates, using deep learning technology.</p><p>Deep learning - crudely put, the idea of refining algorithms by processing massive amounts of data through hierarchical layers of neural networks - has shown exciting results in image and voice recognition, and is garnering attention in the life sciences for that reason.</p><p>One commonly cited application is in diagnostics, where it is believed that software may more reliably be able to detect abnormalities, such as tumors, than clinicians.</p><p>Researchers at <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.stanford.edu/2017/04/03/deep-learning-algorithm-aid-drug-development/\">Stanford University</url> have gone further, using this concept to predict the toxicity or potential side effects of drug candidates.</p><p>Slava Akmaev, chief analytics officer at BERG, an East Coast biotech firm funded largely by West Coast real estate titan Carl Berg, believes another kind of machine learning may be more effective at identifying novel candidates.</p><p>\"We can mechanistically track from molecular features to clinical features, to other molecular features.\"</p><p>\"We looked at alternative ways to analyse data, focusing eventually on Bayesian artificial intelligence. Our technology is based on some of the seminal work by Judea Pearl at Stanford in the 1980s, and others.\"</p><p>\"Neural networks work really well in image analysis, correlating for example radiographs with disease progression or other medical outcomes. But it doesn't work that well with molecular data. Others tried to use it, back in 2000, with very limited results.\"</p><p>\"The major difference with Bayesian networks is that it's a white box classifier. Instead of looking for patterns and identifying associations, this approach allows us to build a mechanistic understanding of how molecular pathways drive certain phenotypes, certain pathophysiologies in the patient.\"</p><p>\"We can mechanistically track from molecular features to clinical features, to other molecular features.\"</p><p>The company's artificial intelligence platform is designed to sift through internally generated and externally sourced biological datasets.</p><p>The aim, ultimately, is to develop novel candidates, and the company has had some validation of its approach, in the form of lead candidate BPM-31510, which has delivered <url normalizedValue=\"https://berghealth.com/berg-presents-key-clinical-data-at-esmo-2017-on-bpm-31510-for-advanced-pancreatic-cancer-patients-and-bpm-31543-for-preventing-hair-loss-in-patients-treated-with-chemotherapy/\">promising Phase II data</url> in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The candidate has a new mechanism of action. As chief scientific officer Ranga Sarangarajan explains: \"The drug has the ability to reverse the Warburg effect, starving the cancer of energy. We got this mechanism out of the platform, using biology-AI combination. It's a reverse validation of our approach.\"</p><p>BERG has also had interest from major players, in the form of a deal with AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN). (Fellow British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) is exploring its own <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gsk-links-with-ai-spinout-to-cut-costs-and-speed-drug-discovery\">AI collaboration</url> with Dundee's Exscientia.)</p><p>Dr Sarangarajan, who told The Pharma Letter that another major deal with a pharma giant will be announced \"probably within a month,\" argues that \"the current paradigm to drug discovery isn't working, and we need a different approach.\"</p><p>He says: \"When you convert large volumes of biology into data, you're looking at trillions of datapoints. It's easy to do a statistical differential, but then we would be no better than anybody else.\"</p><p>\"Our goal is - how can we use the cardinal scientific facts associated with a disease to model it, convert it into data, and find out what the model is telling us.\"</p><p>The big three</p><p>The potential for conflict between the pharma establishment and the new wave of digital companies is heightened by the sheer scale of the modern tech industry.</p><p>The big three - Apple, Google and Amazon - have a combined market capitalization of around $1.9 trillion, larger than the top ten pharmaceutical companies put together.</p><p>Google and Apple have made direct ventures into the life sciences sector.</p><p>Apple, Google and Amazon - have a combined market capitalization of around $1.9 trillion.</p><p>Apple has invested heavily in digital health, with software for consumers and healthcare professionals designed to leverage the company's range of hardware platforms. Observers have long-noted the potential of Apple's wearable technologies in applications such as blood glucose monitoring, fitness tracking, or improved safety monitoring.</p><p>The company introduced ResearchKit in 2015 and CareKit in 2016, open source platforms designed to allow developers to build apps for research and for consumer health.</p><p>These tools have used to create a range of apps, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2017/january/penn-medicine-launches-first-apple-researchkit-app-for-sarcoidosis-patients\">a project</url> at the University of Pennsylvania for the rare disease Sarcoidosis, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/wmd/research/postpartum-depression-research\">another</url> at the University of North Carolina which studies postpartum depression.</p><p>Meanwhile, Californian rivals Google has founded <url normalizedValue=\"https://verily.com/\">Verily Life Sciences</url> to translate data science and the manipulation of big data into health technologies.</p><p>Verily <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/gsk-and-google-parent-form-bioelectric-meds-company\">partnered last year</url> with GlaxoSmithKline to found a new company, Galvani Bioelectronics, injected with up to $700 million, to research, develop and commercialize new bioelectric medicines.</p><p>Verily is also conducting doing longitudinal research, investing $100 million-plus in the Baseline Project, a multi-year initiative mapping human health that it says will search for clues to predicting heart disease and cancer.</p><p>While tech companies may not be founded with an intention to enter the life sciences space, adaptation is in the DNA of Silicon Valley, and once a certain critical mass is reached, anything is possible.</p><p>Amazon, not normally associated with the pharma space, is now widely expected to be planning a move into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/middlemen-jittery-as-amazon-extends-creepers-toward-pharma\">pharmaceuticals retailing</url>.</p><p>The company appears adept at causing widescale disruption in whichever market it turns its attention to. When the firm recently <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40306099\">acquired</url>US supermarket chain Whole Foods, pharmacies shed about $10 billion in share price value, according to UBS, as nervous investors saw the potential for encroachment in that area. Disruption in this market would have unpredictable consequences on drug pricing.</p><p>Whatever the long-term impact of big tech on big pharma, it's clear that the two worlds will continue to collide long into the future.</p><p>As erstwhile Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg says, companies \"need to think about where to invest and how to invest, and what is the right time to jump into the

Karl included two quotes from two different Senators in the article, and I found both of them amusing, as they both basically took the story and responded with their own \"hobby horse\" solution to the problem, even though neither one of them seemed to accurately understand or describe it:\"This is terrifying,' said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who has called for the federal government take a tougher stance with tech companies. 'It is terrifying not just because of the major national security implications, what Beijing could get ahold of. But it also raises personal privacy concerns for individuals and families. </p><p>These companies are tracking our kids.\" 'Tech companies are profiting by spying on Americans \u2014 trampling on the right to privacy and risking our national security,' Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for president, told us. 'They are throwing around their power to undermine our democracy with zero consequences. This report is another alarming case for why we need to break up big tech, adopt serious privacy regulations and hold top executives of these companies personally responsible.'The Hawley quote is classic Hawley, because he immediately jumps to the claim that these companies are tracking our \"kids.\" Many of his attempts at regulating big tech has resulted in \"but think of the children\" arguments. Even when he was directly asked to respond to a Techdirt article, he ignored the question and went on a rant about how much damage tech is doing to the children[3]. Except, this story is entirely about location data on phones. So, um, maybe don't give your kid a phone and then they're not directly tracking your kid anymore? Yes, obviously it's more complicated than that, and with the kind of data at issue you could probably identify adults who were with certain kids and track them. So there are legit concerns as is clear from the initial report. But, it's kind of a weird thing to focus on \"the children\" when the companies themselves focusing on location data -- as bad as they are -- are not actually tracking kids unless you, the parent, give them a phone with location sharing turned on. Hawley sometimes likes to pretend he's against big government and especially against government taking over for parents. And, yet, here's a simple way that parents can take control in this situation: don't give your kid a phone with location info turned on. The Warren quote is a similar thing. She immediately latches onto her idea that the correct answer is to break up big tech[4]. But... while the NY Times does not say exactly where it got the data from to make this report, they do explicitly say that this data is not from the big internet companies Warren has suggested breaking up (i.e., Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple). Those companies aren't in the business of selling or sharing your location data with third parties. Indeed, with Google and Apple, they actually tell you what data your phone is sharing and allow you to block services from accessing that data. The data appears to be coming from a smaller data broker firm who got it from elsewhere (most likely a sketchy app provider selling your location data). Yet Warren uses it as evidence that internet companies need to be broken up. Even if the data did come from such a company, it's difficult to see how breaking them up would solve any of the issues laid out in the report. Indeed, by cutting off ancillary and complementary lines of business, it's only likely to make such data collection efforts more central to a business, and push companies to rely even more heavily on such activity. So, yes, obviously the NY Times' reporting here raises all sorts of alarm bells and concerns -- and it's nice to see some Senators concerned about all of this as well. Except it would have been a hell of a lot nicer if they were actually concerned about what the report said, and didn't use it as an opportunity to spew nonsense, make a non-existent connection to their own personal stump speech talking points, and ignore what's actually happening. But, hey, I guess that's asking too much of our elected officials these days. Of course, all of this is just a symptom of a larger issue. As I've been talking about for years, we still don't fully understand what \"privacy\" means[5]. Everyone seems to have a different conception of what privacy means, and that makes it quite difficult to talk about it -- but even more difficult to regulate it. This is why so many attempts at regulating privacy have insane unintended consequences. The quotes from Hawley and Warren just serve to illustrate all that. Neither are offering actual solutions to the issue of data brokers selling granular location data that can easily be de-anonymized. They're just pushing the same plan they've pushed in the past that vaguely speaks of \"tech bad.\"Permalink[6] | Comments[7] | Email This Story[8] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/08435243609/using-trump-as-prop-myth-anonymized-cell-data-is-finally-exposed.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/08435243609/using-trump-as-prop-myth-anonymized-cell-data-is-finally-exposed.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/20/opinion/location-data-national-security.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/20/opinion/location-data-national-security.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190918/00130743014/senator-hawley-responds-to-techdirt-with-bunch-nonsense-lies-about-his-own-bill-that-he-doesnt-seem-to-understand.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190918/00130743014/senator-hawley-responds-to-techdirt-with-bunch-nonsense-lies-about-his-own-bill-that-he-doesnt-seem-to-understand.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190308/10591041767/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-break-up-amazon-google-facebook-does-her-plan-make-any-sense.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190308/10591041767/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-break-up-amazon-google-facebook-does-her-plan-make-any-sense.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180803/12153440362/were-bad-regulating-privacy-because-we-dont-understand-privacy.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180803/12153440362/were-bad-regulating-privacy-because-we-dont-understand-privacy.shtml</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/16502043612/when-we-fail-to-understand-privacy-as-set-trade-offs-everyones-solutions-are-unhelpful.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/16502043612/when-we-fail-to-understand-privacy-as-set-trade-offs-everyones-solutions-are-unhelpful.shtml</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/16502043612/when-we-fail-to-understand-privacy-as-set-trade-offs-everyones-solutions-are-unhelpful.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/16502043612/when-we-fail-to-understand-privacy-as-set-trade-offs-everyones-solutions-are-unhelpful.shtml#comments</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/16502043612/when-we-fail-to-understand-privacy-as-set-trade-offs-everyones-solutions-are-unhelpful.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191220/16502043612/when-we-fail-to-understand-privacy-as-set-trade-offs-everyones-solutions-are-unhelpful.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT102305157723234952425876500115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTS-1JP1-F03R-N17B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

The U.S. president's suggestion that NAFTA needed a name is perhaps the first positive thing he's personally put on the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My suggestion: the North American Free-ish Trade Agreement. If that's too glib, let's just drop \"free\" like the president did when he raised the idea in the Oval Office. It would more accurately reflect what is shaping up to be a future of managed cross-border exchange rather than the more liberal kind of which we dreamed back in the early 1990s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NAFTA might have felt like a free-trade agreement because it eliminated duties on things that we see, smell, taste, and touch.

Dell is a diversified tech company, supplying businesses with computers and services, but also offering specialized machines such as Alienware computers for video games.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have paired the data with our vision for what a resilient workforce will look like on the other side of this pandemic,\" Pringle said in an email, a strategy that has emerged from Dell's work culture that \"is outcomes based, not anchored to a specific place or time.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That means an ever-evolving concept of \"ways of working - planning for high levels of engagement and productivity no matter where our team members are based - whether it be ensuring we have the right infrastructure in place, providing the right collaboration tools, or finding new ways to maintain our culture remotely,\" he said.</p><p>Austin-based National Instruments (Nasdaq: NATI) intends to \"continue to maintain our work from home status,\" said Cate Prescott, vice president of global human resources, in an email. \"In fact, we will not require any of our Austin-based employees to return to our campus for the remainder of 2020 if they feel safer working from home and their job function allows it.\"</p><p>Prescott said she and CEO Eric Starkloff \"have been in regular communication with members of the Austin business community to share information and tentative plans.\"</p><p>National Instruments, which makes testing equipment for engineers around the world, including those producing semiconductors and medical devices, has freely offered its system template \"to small businesses and nonprofits, so we can all learn together and keep our community safe,\" she said. It employs about 2,200 in the Austin area and more than 7,300 total, as of Dec. 31, 2019, according to a regulatory <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/935494/000093549420000007/nati-20191231x10k.htm\">filing</url>.</p><p>Gov. Greg Abbott allowed offices to reopen in Texas<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/05/18/bars-can-reopen-may-22-gov-greg-abbott-says.html\">on May 18</url>. But that doesn't mean companies are rushing back, especially tech companies that might find working from home just as easy. When, and how, these companies, which employ tens of thousands of Central Texans, do make it back to the workplace has big implications for everything from worker health and safety as well as the wider economy, as sectors such as commercial real estate are heavily invested in the tech office boom.</p><p>Austin Business Journal reached out to 27 tech companies based in or with offices in Central Texas to learn how they are planning to return to workplaces. Those companies range in size from thousands of area employees, such as Dell, National Instruments and Cirrus Logic Inc., to startups with dozens of workers, like Medici Technologies LLC and Self Financial Inc.</p><p>The response from those businesses reveal a diversity of designs.</p><p>Returning slowly and in shifts</p><p>Clinton Phillips, founder and CEO of Medici, which makes a secure platform for doctors to communicate with patients, said in an email that the company is \"taking a slow approach, despite a young health workforce. We are reopening the office and will ask employees to return to the office two days a week in June.\"</p><p>Medici, which employs more than 50, already has increased the space between desks, plans to disinfect work stations every night, intends to test employees \"once we select the highest-quality antibody test,\" Phillips said. \"We will take a flexible approach and reassess every two weeks.\"</p><p>But many executives and spokespeople interviewed for this story also conveyed that returning to the office remained a long way off.</p><p>Brett Hurt, co-founder and CEO of Austin-based Data.world Inc., for example, repeatedly has told ABJ during phone interviews that the company \"will be one of the last in Austin to return to the office.\" The company makes software which, among other things, catalogues and links data sets and employs about 60.</p><p>Austin-based Civitas Learning Inc. is \"encouraging remote work for the foreseeable future,\" Amanda Hearn, the education-tech company's director of communications, in an email. \"The earliest we will consider returning in larger groups will be September or October, and that will be dependent on the status of the pandemic and local guidelines.\" Civitas Learning employs more than 100 in Austin.</p><p>Q2 Holdings Inc. (NYSE: QTWO) Executive Vice President Kim Rutledge said in an email that the Austin-headquartered financial-technology company has \"no immediate plans to re-open our offices. We will continue working from home, at least through the summer. In addition to our peoples' health and safety being priority, many employees are still managing dual responsibilities between work and children and still need that flexibility.\" As of Dec. 31, Q2 employed 1,574 worldwide, according to an SEC <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1410384/000141038420000025/a191231qtwo10k.htm\">filing</url>, and about 800 in Austin.</p><p>In a statement provided to ABJ, professional-services company Accenture plc (Nasdaq: ACN); headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, reflected a similar sentiment. The company employs about 3,500 in Austin. It has not yet reopened its offices, except for essential business functions, and does not have a specified timeline for which to do so.</p><p>Austin's Vrbo, formerly HomeAway, which is owned by Seattle-based Expedia Group Inc. (Nasdaq: EXPE), is operating in a similar fashion, said spokeswoman Alison Kwong in an email. Vrbo and Expedia employ about 1,800 locally.</p><p>Other Texas-capital companies said they are using surveys and other methods of gathering feedback from employees to help executives as they continue to figure out the best path forward. This group includes WP Engine Inc., The Zebra, RigUp Inc. and Austin Business Journal itself.</p><p>The return of ABJ's roughly 20 employees to its office won't occur for several months at the earliest, and when it does, staggered shifts and closed common areas will likely promote social distancing.</p><p>Austin-based home-health test startup Everlywell Inc. and job-search giant Indeed Inc. haven't yet decided when or how they will return to the office.</p><p>\"People are not yet back,\" Everlywell spokeswoman Christina Song said in an email. \"We are evaluating our options to make that happen. Nothing decided yet. We're being extremely cautious. It helps that we have several medical experts in the house that are experts in all things Covid-19.\"</p><p>In a statement provided to ABJ, Indeed said, \"We will take a conservative approach to returning to our offices around the world. We have a dedicated Return to Work Task Force mapping out a strategy, and are considering options such as continued work from home, phased office openings and limited capacity. In order to protect our employees and the communities where we operate, we have no plans to return to any office before September at the earliest.\"</p><p>Indeed was one of the first tech companies to send workers home, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/03/04/tech-giant-indeed-tells-all-employees-to-work-from.html\">doing so in early March</url>.</p><p>Silicon Valley-based Google, part of Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), declined to comment but CEO Sundar Pichai outlined the company's plan in an <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-offices-reopening-june-at-10percent-to-15percent-full.html\">early May memo</url> to bring in about 10% to 15% of workers on a rotating basis starting in June. Pichaio expects to have between about 60% of employees in the office at least once a week by the end of the year, Pichai       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262934/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-interview-pandemic-coronavirus\">told The Verge</url>.</p><p>California-based Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) also declined to comment but has taken a progressive stance, with employees allowed to work from home through 2020 if they choose. Half of its employees could work from home full-time within five to 10 years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-facebook-remote-work-long-term.html\">according to Silicon Valley Business Journal</url>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) looks to be returning to the office faster than its Big Tech peers. The company, which already has its largest office hub outside California in Austin and is building a $1 billion campus here as well, is bringing employees back to office in shifts, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/05/21/apple-employees-return-to-office-timeline-aapl.html\">with some reportedly returning in May</url>.</p><p>Asking employees</p><p>Like Indeed, many companies have created internal groups and teams specifically focusing on how best to respond to the ever-changing coronavirus environment. Among them are Self Financial, The Zebra, National Instruments and SolarWinds Inc.</p><p>The \"business-continuity team\" at SolarWinds (NYSE: SWI) is putting together a return program that will include one-way staircases, extra cleaners to keep highly trafficked areas sanitized during the day and additional disinfecting each night, said spokeswoman Tiffany Nels in a phone interview.</p><p>The IT management software company's more than 3,200 employees throughout the world currently are working remotely, Nels said. SolarWinds employs more than 580 in Austin.</p><p>\"We'll have a solid plan in place to bring back employees in some way, shape or form safely in the future, but we don't know when that's going to be,\" Nels said.</p><p>Self Financial's coronavirus task force meets twice a week to address employee health and what the business can do to help customers more during the pandemic, said Brett Billick, chief marketing officer at Self Financial, in a phone interview. The company offers customers credit-builder loans and employs 76.</p><p>\"We've been wrestling with it quite a bit,\" Billick said.</p><p>The task force also set June 1 as the date employees may return to the office if they choose, Billick said. \"It's completely optional.\" A maximum of 15 people would be allowed at a time, he said.</p><p>Civitas Learning, RigUp and The Zebra, which operates legally as InsuranceZebra Inc., also are among the companies whose return to the office will be optional for employees.</p><p>\"The company's been operating remotely very well,\" Zebra CEO Keith Melnick said during a Zoom interview. He worked remotely even before the pandemic hit because he lives in Connecticut. \"We're not pushing people to come back. We're not going to require anyone to work at the office.\"</p><p>The insurance-comparison company employs 186 people in Austin and about 200 total, counting those in the New York office.</p><p>Instead, The Zebra will create social-distanced workspaces for employees who might need a place other than home - which could be cramped with children, spouses and pets - to do their jobs, Melnick said.</p><p>Several companies, such as RigUp, have adapted a multi-phase strategy to brining people back to the physical office space.</p><p>\"Phase one is based on feedback from our employees and is geared toward those who need a space to focus to get work done or who may need a mental health break from their current situation and/or work space,\" spokesman Mitch Goulding said in an email. The company has created a marketplace for on-demand services and workers in the oil and gas and alternative energy sectors</p><p>RigUp was among many tech companies in the Texas capital that laid off or furloughed workers due to the coronavirus. Though executives declined to say how many people lost their jobs, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/03/30/rigup-lays-off-100-plus-employees-founders-to-get.html\">employees in late March on LinkedIn put the total at 120</url>.

Not only are the creative industries innovative but they are economically valuable; the UK's creative industries contribute about \u00a377bn to the economy each year and provide 1.7 million jobs.</p><p>Big Tech, however, is having an effect. We all use Google's search engine. But some in the creative industries are questioning the search engine giant's role in directing people to sites where they can download, watch, read and listen to creative work without payment.\u00a0</p><p>Questions and complaints about such practices have been mounting and have become louder and more vociferous in the past five years. Now, for the first time in the past two years, these complaints are being considered properly.</p><p>Credit:      Chris Ratcliffe     </p><p>There comes a time in every business's life where it simply becomes too big to be ignored. It happened with Microsoft and Intel and its now happening with others, including Google. Interestingly, the European Commission's decision on Microsoft's internet browser led to a huge shift in browser usage, with Firefox and notably Google Chrome taking huge market share.</p><p>Ironically, Chrome now has greater share than Microsoft Explorer. The winds of change are blowing. National governments, tax authorities and the European Commission have woken up to the power of not just Google, but other large firms such as Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>On search, the commission could be nearing the end of its investigation, begun in 2010, as to whether Google has abused its position . More recently, the EU is investigating whether Google has abused its position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators.</p><p>Amazon's contracts with publishers are also being investigated to see whether they made it harder for competitors to offer similar pricing. There is also a broader policy discussion taking place as to how platforms should be regulated, which may lead to positive steps to curb piracy.</p><p>Finally, there are the tax investigations, some more aggressive than others, as seen recently in Paris. On privacy, Facebook is facing inquiries in a number of states across the EU. More significant perhaps is the discussion about how Big Tech transfers our data between the EU and the US.</p><p>After the European Court found that the agreement between the US and EU did not protect EU citizens sufficiently, a new proposed agreement was developed, but this again has been questioned by regulators. Alternative contracts used by the likes of Facebook are also being questioned by the Irish regulator.</p><p>So whether its privacy, search, tax payments, their role in combating piracy or how they might contribute to investment in news and content there are now a range of investigations facing Big Tech. Most of the talk has focused on how these investigations and new legislation might affect large technology companies.</p><p>Notable UK 'unicorns'</p><p>What hasn't been discussed, however, are the huge opportunities this scrutiny might provide for UK and European-based innovation. I don't believe this is why the EU is undertaking its investigations, after all, the beneficiary of the Microsoft action was Google.</p><p>But if greater home grown successes is a by-product, then that's fine by me. For a long time people have asked why we don't have a European Google or Facebook. Clearly, there are a range of reasons as to why this hasn't happened, including access to capital.</p><p>There is a question to be asked though, about why we don't have more mid-stage tech companies across Europe which have the potential to be as big as Google, Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp. The latest description for these mid-size companies is unicorns, a term used to describe technology firms worth more than $1bn (\u00a3680m) - the fact they are described in dollar terms is indicative of the problem.</p><p>Clearly the answer isn't for the EU to create these in some statist project. However, if Big Tech's power on the internet ecosystem is curbed, there are huge opportunities for new businesses. How many of us use pre-loaded apps on our android phones simply because they are there.</p><p>Inertia is a huge block to innovation and a favourite means for monopolies to retain their position. How many of us use Google Play because it's there, rather than Deezer? Maybe Finnish firm Jolla's Sailfish operating system will now stand a chance and new mapping services might get created in places like Scotland, which has a thriving technology sector.</p><p>There will be much gnashing of teeth as the ongoing investigations and legislative proposals progress. What we need to consider though is whether we have the home-grown ideas, capital and people to exploit what could be a turning point on the internet.</p><p>If we do, then we might finally have ourselves some European, British and, perhaps, even Scottish unicorns.</p><p>Pete Wishart is chair of the all-party group on intellectual property, the SNP leader in the Commons and the only MP to have ever performed on 'Top of the Pops' (in the band Runrig)</p><p>READ MORE ABOUT:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Microsoft</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Internet</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Google</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Show more</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-41891789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K2W-T791-JCJY-G4Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"908\"/><timeReceived>5:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 23, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

''Those who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking -- what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the ''nifty 50'' American companies like Disney and McDonald's, which had been the ''go-go'' stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came. </p><p>  Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands -- and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of a irrational euphoria are growing.</p><p>  One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoftto make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.</p><p>  Seven of the world's 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs -- the Dow hit 22,000 this week -- the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.</p><p>  No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.</p><p>  The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet -- including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel -- and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations -- from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning -- are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the ''electricity of the 21st century.''</p><p>  Market excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil's not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.</p><p>  It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies -- mainly the internet giants -- are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.</p><p>  However, the scale of today's tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years -- the highest flows since the peak in 2000 -- and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.</p><p>  These new private funding channels are creating ''unicorns,'' companies that haven't gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.</p><p>  We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.</p><p>  The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as ''electronic heroin.'' A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.</p><p>  The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the ''nifty 50'' stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.</p><p>  Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.</p><p>  Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 -- or earlier.</p><p>  The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.</p><p>  Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING (DRAWING BY MATT CHASE)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-171158170806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P62-P8J1-JBG3-647R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/05/opinion/sunday/when-will-the-tech-bubble-burst.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/05/opinion/sunday/when-will-the-tech-bubble-burst.html</url><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 6, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Ed</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

So everybody keeps asking - what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \"nifty 50\" American companies like Disney and McDonald's, which had been the \"go-go\" stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.</p><p>Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands - and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.</p><p>One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoftto make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.</p><p>Seven of the world's 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs - the Dow hit 22,000 this week - the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.</p><p>No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.</p><p>The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet - including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel - and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations - from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning - are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \"electricity of the 21st century.\"</p><p>Market excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil's not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.</p><p>It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies - mainly the internet giants - are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.</p><p>However, the scale of today's tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years - the highest flows since the peak in 2000 - and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.</p><p>These new private funding channels are creating \"unicorns,\" companies that haven't gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.</p><p>We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.</p><p>The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \"electronic heroin.\" A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.</p><p>The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \"nifty 50\" stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.</p><p>Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.</p><p>Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 - or earlier.</p><p>The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ruchir Sharma, author of \"The Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\" is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005317115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P6P-6F31-DYR7-C00R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 5, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201d</p><p>Every decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.</p><p>Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.</p><p>One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.</p><p>Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.</p><p>No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.</p><p>The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201d</p><p>Market excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.</p><p>It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.</p><p>However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.</p><p>These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.</p><p>We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.</p><p>The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.</p><p>The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.</p><p>Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.</p><p>Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.</p><p>The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.</p><p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion\">Twitter (@NYTopinion)</url>, and sign up for the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/\">Opinion Today newsletter</url>. <br/></p><p>Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.</p><p>DRAWING (DRAWING BY MATT CHASE)</p><h>Related Articles</h><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/business/economy/stock-market-trump-economy.html\">Wall Street, Climbing Sharply, Skips Washington\u2019s \u2018Soap Opera\u2019</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/business/stock-market-value-trump.html\">Tech, Fed, Trump: So Many Reasons to Worry About the Market</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/business/economy/us-economy-growth-trump.html\">U.S. Growth Accelerates, but Remains Short of Pace Promised by Trump</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005317115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P5W-R451-DXY4-X3M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1297\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 5, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Ed</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stocks and Bonds</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dow Jones Stock Average</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The building's $49 million penthouse would be the most expensive in San Francisco. </p><p>\"Just in time for the coming wave of I.P.O. millionaires in San Francisco,\" the Four Seasons said, promising \"an elevated sales experience\" to cater to \"this new class of buyers.\" </p><p>But then the wave of tech initial public offerings - the one that was supposed to mint San Francisco's new ultra rich - fizzled. The stock of Uber, the ride-hailing giant, has dropped nearly 30 percent since the company went public in May. Lyft shares are down nearly 40 percent. Pinterest and Slack have declined, too. </p><p>San Francisco has been left as a slightly more normal town of tech workers who got rich-ish, maybe making a few hundred thousand dollars. But that doesn't go far in a city where the median cost of a single family home is about $1.6 million. </p><p>\"Everyone that came back post-I.P.O. seemed to be the same person. I didn't see any Louis Vuitton MacBook case covers or champagne in their Yeti thermos,\" said J.T. Forbus, a tax manager at Bogdan &amp;amp; Frasco in San Francisco.</p><p>Private wealth managers are now meeting with a chastened clientele. Developers are having to cut home prices - unheard-of a year ago. Party planners are signing nondisclosure agreements to stage secret parties where hosts can privately enjoy their wealth. Union organizers are finding an opportunity. </p><p>Everyone had gotten too excited, and who could blame them? The money was once so close: A start-up that coordinated dog walkers raised $300 million. The valuations of the already giant ride-hailing behemoths had nearly doubled again.  WeWork, a commercial real estate management start-up that owned very little of its own real estate, was valued at $47 billion. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">City of Towers</emphasis></p><p>Towers rose across San Francisco to house the money. The marble was polished. The bathroom floors were warm. The private pools were being filled.</p><p>\"The world has changed in a year,\" said Herman Chan, a real estate broker with Sotheby's International. \"We expected an upward trajectory at least, and it really kind of deflated. These companies aren't dying but the cultural zeitgeist, that momentum of I.P.O.s, is gone. You don't even hear anyone talking about it anymore.\"</p><p>The developers who had fought the odds of regulation and zoning to build their glass residences in the sky had timed their units to the I.P.O.s. But on a recent visit with the Four Seasons sales team, they acknowledged that techie wealth was not what they were seeing. Interest was mostly coming from overseas buyers, young heirs to foreign fortunes and older executives looking for city pieds-\u00e0-terre, they said. </p><p>Also in time for the wave that was not a wave are more luxury towers: The Avery, The Harrison, 181 Fremont, The Mira. </p><p>\"The definition of luxury is scarcity, and there's so many now,\" Mr. Chan said. \"Nowadays, my buyers are getting a contingency period and inspectors. Things you would never ask for before. There's not 10 offers on a house anymore.\"</p><p>Case in point: A full-floor apartment in San Francisco's poshest neighborhood of Pacific Heights was listed at $21.6 million and advertised that \"a sommelier-worthy wine cellar awaits 1,500 of your most prized bottles.\" But more than a year later and after a $5 million price cut, it is still on the market. </p><p>Prices for the top 5 percent of San Francisco area real estate listings - the cream of the crop - rose 7 percent between 2017 and 2018. This year, they have fallen more than 1 percent, according to data prepared for The New York Times by the real estate listing service Zillow. </p><p>The malaise has spread south into Silicon Valley. A $10.8 million home listing in the town of Portola Valley, Calif., was slashed to $5.7 million. The median sale price for a nearby home in San Jose, Calif., has dropped 10 percent in a year to just under $1 million, according to data from Zillow. </p><p>Before the tech I.P.O.s, Deniz Kahramaner, then a real estate data analyst with the property brokerage Compass, had rallied packed rooms of real estate agents and investors about the bonanza that lay ahead. He had charts and estimates of thousands of new millionaires raising the average price of single family homes in San Francisco above $5 million.</p><p>Now, he is more muted. \"The I.P.O. cash-out hasn't played out as I mentioned in my original presentation,\" he said. </p><p>Mr. Kahramaner added, hopefully, that it was still early. \"People need more time,\" he said. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wealth and Unions</emphasis></p><p>Instead of yachts, tech workers are funding more mundane ventures like college savings plans. </p><p>\"This year brought a lot of people back to reality,\" said Ryan S. Cole, a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital, a wealth management firm in San Francisco. \"We've had a lot of people fund 529 plans for their kids. Pretty boring stuff.\"</p><p>Some private wealth managers said they were actually somewhat relieved. </p><p>\"At the end of the day, it's funny money until it's realized,&amp;#34; said Jonathan DeYoe, another private wealth adviser. \"I've got Uber and Lyft clients that are disappointed. It's a different house now. It's a different school situation for the kids. But they're still by and large in good places. No one's impoverished.\"</p><p>And so workers who thought they would upgrade from Allbirds to Berluti shoes are remaining, after all, in the Allbirds.</p><p>As some rank-and-file tech workers realize they might not get rich from company stock, the allure of working long hours without comparable real money pay is also wearing thin, said labor organizers. They have found traction this year in an industry long resistant to unions. </p><p>\"The incentives to take the licks that you do are in the hope of some sort of big payoff down the road,\" said Paul Thurston, who focuses on unionizing San Francisco tech workers and is the organizing director at the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. </p><p>Now, \"the engineers and the app designer and the developers are going to be treated a lot more like the employees that they are rather than like partners, which is what they're told pre-I. P. O.,\" he said.</p><p>Jonathan Wright, the organizing director of Engineers and Scientists of California, said he was in talks to unionize the workers of several big tech companies. </p><p>\"There's a promise: you work 100 hours a week, you sleep under your desk, and then you'll be rewarded with the wealth of Bezos,\" Mr. Wright said. \"That mythology has been fading for years. The day of the unicorn is over.\"</p><p>Where there is new wealth, it's coming from the older tech companies like Apple and Alphabet, whose stocks this year have soared. And some fortunes are still being made from the I.P.O.s. While Uber's shares have fallen, the company's co-founder, Travis Kalanick, has sold off more than $2 billion in stock, according to securities filings. </p><p>\"Especially with things like Uber, almost all the I.P.O. wealth was going to a couple of people,\" said Kalena Masching, a Redfin agent in San Jose. \"They are not looking to buy a standard house here.\"</p><p>Another bright spot: female-led companies, with more becoming unicorns in 2019 than any other year, according to Aileen Lee, the venture capitalist who coined the phrase \"unicorn\" to refer to a private company valued at $1 billion or more.</p><p>And post-I.P.O. parties are happening. They are just secret - and phone-free. </p><p>\"We're signing a lot more nondisclosures,\" said Jay Siegan, who curates party entertainment for corporate tech clients. \"A year ago, people would set up social media stations at the party, signs with the hashtag for Instagram. Now we have clients asking guests to check their phones at the door or using those Yondr bags.\"</p><p>These are pouches used to lock phones en masse at concerts and events where someone might be tempted to record. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Self Reflection</emphasis></p><p>However, in public, the tech world is all about reflection and self-critiquing after the year that was. </p><p>The I.P.O. disappointment has gotten so extreme that two Silicon Valley techies are setting out to do what few have done before: Make fun of themselves. </p><p>David Cowan, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners, and Michael Fertik, the founder of Reputation.com, are launching an online talk show called \"The Bubble Report.\" It will feature interviews with other tech executives. The point, they hope, is to poke fun at Silicon Valley from within Silicon Valley.</p><p>Mr. Cowan, either in character or just being very honest, decried the falling stock prices of newly public tech companies as victims of cruel Wall Street analysts.</p><p>\"It should be against the law for unscrupulous analysts to assess stocks based on cash flow and profit, to impugn a company based on eight lines of a financial report,\" he joked. \"Imagine how much more value we'd have in the stock market if we got rid of that arcane thinking.\" </p><p>Mr. Fertik said his inspiration to mock his industry came in part from realizing how far from reality it had all gotten. </p><p>\"I want people to understand that Silicon Valley is a deeply religious place that thinks of itself as agnostic,\" he said. \"It has some of the strengths and many of the frailties of organized religion.\"</p><p>For now, most people are waking up to find they are still on Earth. This is good news for those in San Francisco who mostly viewed the tech exuberance as bad news: housing rights activists, first-time home buyers, and renters. </p><p>\"We are excited by any resetting of Bay Area rents that bring them down from their artificially inflated high,\" said Fred Sherburn-Zimmer, the executive director of Housing Rights Committee, which fights against evictions. \"Eventually all bubbles burst.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006834475</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSS-VSC1-JC85-N013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009Y95</classCode><className>BESSEMER VENTURE PARTNERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0001PNE</classCode><className>LVMH MOET HENNESSY LOUIS VUITTON SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523910 MISCELLANEOUS INTERMEDIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6799 INVESTORS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS316992 WOMEN'S HANDBAG &amp;

But on a recent visit with the Four Seasons sales team, they acknowledged that techie wealth was not what they were seeing. Interest was mostly coming from overseas buyers, young heirs to foreign fortunes and older executives looking for city pieds-\u00e0-terre, they said. </p><p>Also in time for the wave that was not a wave are more luxury towers: The Avery, The Harrison, 181 Fremont, The Mira. </p><p>\u201cThe definition of luxury is scarcity, and there\u2019s so many now,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cNowadays, my buyers are getting a contingency period and inspectors. Things you would never ask for before. There\u2019s not 10 offers on a house anymore.\u201d</p><p>Case in point: A full-floor apartment in San Francisco\u2019s poshest neighborhood of Pacific Heights <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/most-expensive-penthouse-San-Francisco-Four-Season-14856417.php\">was listed at $21.6 million</url> and advertised that \u201ca sommelier-worthy wine cellar awaits 1,500 of your most prized bottles.\u201d But more than a year later and after a $5 million price cut, it is still on the market. </p><p>Prices for the top 5 percent of San Francisco area real estate listings \u2014 the cream of the crop \u2014 rose 7 percent between 2017 and 2018. This year, they have fallen more than 1 percent, according to data prepared for The New York Times by the real estate listing service Zillow. </p><p>The malaise has spread south into Silicon Valley. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/most-expensive-penthouse-San-Francisco-Four-Season-14856417.php\">$10.8 million home listing</url> in the town of Portola Valley, Calif., was slashed to $5.7 million. The median sale price for a nearby home in San Jose, Calif., has dropped 10 percent in a year to just under $1 million, according to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/most-expensive-penthouse-San-Francisco-Four-Season-14856417.php\">data</url> from Zillow. </p><p>Before the tech I.P.O.s, Deniz Kahramaner, then a real estate data analyst with the property brokerage Compass, had rallied packed rooms of real estate agents and investors about the bonanza that lay ahead. He had charts and estimates of thousands of new millionaires raising the average price of single family homes in San Francisco above $5 million.</p><p>Now, he is more muted. \u201cThe I.P.O. cash-out hasn\u2019t played out as I mentioned in my original presentation,\u201d he said. </p><p>Mr. Kahramaner added, hopefully, that it was still early. \u201cPeople need more time,\u201d he said. </p><p>Wealth and Unions</p><p>Instead of yachts, tech workers are funding more mundane ventures like college savings plans. </p><p>\u201cThis year brought a lot of people back to reality,\u201d said Ryan S. Cole, a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital, a wealth management firm in San Francisco. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people fund 529 plans for their kids. Pretty boring stuff.\u201d</p><p>Some private wealth managers said they were actually somewhat relieved. </p><p>\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s funny money until it\u2019s realized,\" said Jonathan DeYoe, another private wealth adviser. \u201cI\u2019ve got Uber and Lyft clients that are disappointed. It\u2019s a different house now. It\u2019s a different school situation for the kids. But they\u2019re still by and large in good places. No one\u2019s impoverished.\u201d</p><p>And so workers who thought they would upgrade from Allbirds to Berluti shoes are remaining, after all, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/most-expensive-penthouse-San-Francisco-Four-Season-14856417.php\">in the Allbirds</url>.</p><p>As some rank-and-file tech workers realize they might not get rich from company stock, the allure of working long hours without comparable real money pay is also wearing thin, said labor organizers. They have found traction this year in an industry long resistant to unions. </p><p>\u201cThe incentives to take the licks that you do are in the hope of some sort of big payoff down the road,\u201d said Paul Thurston, who focuses on unionizing San Francisco tech workers and is the organizing director at the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. </p><p>Now, \u201cthe engineers and the app designer and the developers are going to be treated a lot more like the employees that they are rather than like partners, which is what they\u2019re told pre-I. P. O.,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jonathan Wright, the organizing director of Engineers and Scientists of California, said he was in talks to unionize the workers of several big tech companies. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a promise: you work 100 hours a week, you sleep under your desk, and then you\u2019ll be rewarded with the wealth of Bezos,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cThat mythology has been fading for years. The day of the unicorn is over.\u201d</p><p>Where there is new wealth, it\u2019s coming from the older tech companies like Apple and Alphabet, whose stocks this year have soared. And some fortunes are still being made from the I.P.O.s. While Uber\u2019s shares have fallen, the company\u2019s co-founder, Travis Kalanick, has sold off more than $2 billion in stock, according to securities filings. </p><p>\u201cEspecially with things like Uber, almost all the I.P.O. wealth was going to a couple of people,\u201d said Kalena Masching, a Redfin agent in San Jose. \u201cThey are not looking to buy a standard house here.\u201d</p><p>Another bright spot: female-led companies, with more becoming unicorns in 2019 than any other year, according to Aileen Lee, the venture capitalist who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/most-expensive-penthouse-San-Francisco-Four-Season-14856417.php\">coined the phrase \u201cunicorn\u201d</url> to refer to a private company valued at $1 billion or more.</p><p>And post-I.P.O. parties are happening. They are just secret \u2014 and phone-free. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re signing a lot more nondisclosures,\u201d said Jay Siegan, who curates party entertainment for corporate tech clients. \u201cA year ago, people would set up social media stations at the party, signs with the hashtag for Instagram. Now we have clients asking guests to check their phones at the door or using those <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/most-expensive-penthouse-San-Francisco-Four-Season-14856417.php\">Yondr bags.</url>\u201d</p><p>These are pouches used to lock phones en masse at concerts and events where someone might be tempted to record. </p><p>Self Reflection</p><p>However, in public, the tech world is all about reflection and self-critiquing after the year that was. </p><p>The I.P.O. disappointment has gotten so extreme that two Silicon Valley techies are setting out to do what few have done before: Make fun of themselves. </p><p>David Cowan, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners, and Michael Fertik, the founder of Reputation.com, are launching an online talk show called \u201cThe Bubble Report.\u201d It will feature interviews with other tech executives. The point, they hope, is to poke fun at Silicon Valley from within Silicon Valley.</p><p>Mr. Cowan, either in character or just being very honest, decried the falling stock prices of newly public tech companies as victims of cruel Wall Street analysts.</p><p>\u201cIt should be against the law for unscrupulous analysts to assess stocks based on cash flow and profit, to impugn a company based on eight lines of a financial report,\u201d he joked. \u201cImagine how much more value we\u2019d have in the stock market if we got rid of that arcane thinking.\u201d </p><p>Mr. Fertik said his inspiration to mock his industry came in part from realizing how far from reality it had all gotten. </p><p>\u201cI want people to understand that Silicon Valley is a deeply religious place that thinks of itself as agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has some of the strengths and many of the frailties of organized religion.\u201d</p><p>For now, most people are waking up to find they are still on Earth. This is good news for those in San Francisco who mostly viewed the tech exuberance as bad news: housing rights activists, first-time home buyers, and renters. </p><p>\u201cWe are excited by any resetting of Bay Area rents that bring them down from their artificially inflated high,\u201d said Fred Sherburn-Zimmer, the executive director of Housing Rights Committee, which fights against evictions. \u201cEventually all bubbles burst.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: The I.P.O. millionaires the Four Seasons expected to occupy its new luxury residences failed to materialize.

The building's $49 million penthouse would be the most expensive in San Francisco.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Just in time for the coming wave of IPO millionaires in San Francisco,\" the Four Seasons said, promising \"an elevated sales experience\" to cater to \"this new class of buyers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But then the wave of tech initial public offerings \u2014 the one that was supposed to mint San Francisco's new ultrarich \u2014 fizzled. The stock of Uber, the ride-hailing giant, has dropped nearly 30% since the company went public in May. Lyft shares are down nearly 40%. Pinterest and Slack have declined, too.</p><p> San Francisco has been left as a slightly more normal town of tech workers who got rich-ish, maybe making a few hundred thousand dollars. But that doesn't go far in a city where the median cost of a single family home is about $1.6 million.</p><p> \"Everyone that came back post-IPO seemed to be the same person. I didn't see any Louis Vuitton MacBook case covers or Champagne in their Yeti thermos,\" said J.T. Forbus, a tax manager at Bogdan &amp; Frasco in San Francisco.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Private wealth managers are now meeting with a chastened clientele. Developers are having to cut home prices \u2014 unheard of a year ago. Party planners are signing nondisclosure agreements to stage secret parties where hosts can privately enjoy their wealth. Union organizers are finding an opportunity.</p><p> Everyone got too excited, and who could blame them? The money was once so close: A startup that coordinated dog walkers raised $300 million. The valuations of the already giant ride-hailing behemoths had nearly doubled again. WeWork, a commercial real estate management startup that owned very little of its own real estate, was valued at $47 billion.</p><p> Towers rose across San Francisco to house the money. The marble was polished. The bathroom floors were warm. The private pools were being filled.</p><p> \"The world has changed in a year,\" said Herman Chan, a real estate broker with Sotheby's International. \"We expected an upward trajectory at least, and it really kind of deflated. These companies aren't dying, but the cultural zeitgeist, that momentum of IPOs, is gone. You don't even hear anyone talking about it anymore.\"</p><p> The developers who had fought the odds of regulation and zoning to build their glass residences in the sky had timed their units to the IPOs. But on a recent visit with the Four Seasons sales team, they acknowledged that they are not seeing techie wealth. Interest is mostly coming from overseas buyers, young heirs to foreign fortunes and older executives looking for city pieds-a-terre, they said.</p><p> Also in time for the wave that was not a wave are more luxury towers: the Avery, the Harrison, 181 Fremont, the Mira.</p><p> \"The definition of luxury is scarcity, and there's so many now,\" Chan said. \"Nowadays, my buyers are getting a contingency period and inspectors. Things you would never ask for before. There's not 10 offers on a house anymore.\"</p><p> A case in point: A full-floor apartment in Pacific Heights was listed at $21.6 million and advertised that \"a sommelier-worthy wine cellar awaits 1,500 of your most prized bottles.\" But more than a year later and after a $5 million price cut, it is still on the market.</p><p> Prices for the top 5% of San Francisco area real estate listings \u2014 the cream of the crop \u2014 rose 7% between 2017 and 2018. This year, they have fallen more than 1%, according to data prepared for the New York Times by real estate listing service Zillow.</p><p> The malaise has spread south into Silicon Valley. A $10.8 million home listing in Portola Valley was slashed to $5.7 million. The median sale price for a home in San Jose has dropped 10% in a year to just under $1 million, according to data from Zillow.</p><p> Before the tech IPOs, Deniz Kahramaner, then a real estate data analyst with property brokerage Compass, had rallied packed rooms of real estate agents and investors about the bonanza that lay ahead. He had charts and estimates of thousands of new millionaires raising the average price of single-family homes in San Francisco above $5 million.</p><p> Now, he is more muted. \"The IPO cash-out hasn't played out as I mentioned in my original presentation,\" he said.</p><p> Kahramaner added, hopefully, that it is still early. \"People need more time,\" he said.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Instead of yachts, tech workers are funding more mundane ventures like college savings plans.</p><p> \"This year brought a lot of people back to reality,\" said Ryan Cole, a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital, a wealth management firm in San Francisco. \"We've had a lot of people fund 529 plans for their kids. Pretty boring stuff.\"</p><p> Some private wealth managers said they were actually somewhat relieved.</p><p> \"It's funny money until it's realized,\" said Jonathan DeYoe, another private wealth adviser. \"I've got Uber and Lyft clients that are disappointed. It's a different house now. It's a different school situation for the kids. But they're still by and large in good places. No one's impoverished.\"</p><p> And so workers who thought they would upgrade from Allbirds to Berluti shoes are remaining, after all, in the Allbirds.</p><p> As some rank-and-file tech workers realize they might not get rich from company stock, the allure of working long hours without comparable real money pay is also wearing thin, said labor organizers. They have found support this year in an industry long resistant to unions.</p><p> \"The incentives to take the licks that you do are in the hope of some sort of big payoff down the road,\" said Paul Thurston, who focuses on unionizing San Francisco tech workers and is the organizing director at the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.</p><p> Now, \"the engineers and the app designer and the developers are going to be treated a lot more like the employees that they are rather than like partners, which is what they're told pre-IPO,\" he said.</p><p> Jonathan Wright, organizing director of Engineers and Scientists of California, said he is in talks to unionize the workers of several big tech companies.</p><p> \"There's a promise: you work 100 hours a week, you sleep under your desk, and then you'll be rewarded with the wealth of Bezos,\" Wright said. \"That mythology has been fading for years. The day of the unicorn is over.\"</p><p> Where there is new wealth, it's coming from the older tech companies like Apple and Alphabet, whose stocks this year have soared. And some fortunes are still being made from the IPOs. While Uber's shares have fallen, the company's co-founder, Travis Kalanick, has sold more than $2 billion in stock, according to securities filings.</p><p> \"Especially with things like Uber, almost all the IPO wealth was going to a couple of people,\" said Kalena Masching, a Redfin agent in San Jose. \"They are not looking to buy a standard house here.\"</p><p> Another bright spot: female-led companies, with more becoming unicorns in 2019 than any other year, according to Aileen Lee, the venture capitalist who coined the word \"unicorn\" to refer to a private company valued at $1 billion or more.</p><p> And post-IPO parties are happening. They are just secret \u2014 and phone-free.</p><p> \"We're signing a lot more nondisclosures,\" said Jay Siegan, who books party entertainment for corporate tech clients. \"A year ago, people would set up social media stations at the party, signs with the hashtag for Instagram. Now we have clients asking guests to check their phones at the door or using those Yondr bags.\"</p><p> These are pouches used to lock phones en masse at concerts and events where someone might be tempted to record.</p><p> ------------</p><p> But in public, the tech world is all about reflection and self-critiquing after the year that was.</p><p> The IPO disappointment has gotten so extreme that two Silicon Valley techies are setting out to do what few have done before: Make fun of themselves.</p><p> David Cowan, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners, and Michael Fertik, founder of Reputation.com, are starting an online talk show called \"The Bubble Report.\" It will feature interviews with other tech executives. The point, they hope, is to poke fun at Silicon Valley from within Silicon Valley.</p><p> Cowan, either in character or just being very honest, decried the falling stock prices of newly public tech companies as victims of cruel Wall Street analysts.</p><p> \"It should be against the law for unscrupulous analysts to assess stocks based on cash flow and profit, to impugn a company based on eight lines of a financial report,\" he joked. \"Imagine how much more value we'd have in the stock market if we got rid of that arcane thinking.\"</p><p> Fertik said his inspiration to mock his industry came in part from realizing how far from reality it had moved.</p><p> \"I want people to understand that Silicon Valley is a deeply religious place that thinks of itself as agnostic,\" he said. \"It has some of the strengths and many of the frailties of organized religion.\"</p><p> For now, most people are waking up to find they are still on Earth. This is good news for those in San Francisco who mostly viewed the tech exuberance as bad news: housing-rights activists, first-time home buyers, and renters.</p><p> \"We are excited by any resetting of Bay Area rents that bring them down from their artificially inflated high,\" said Fred Sherburn-Zimmer, executive director of Housing Rights Committee, which fights against evictions. \"Eventually all bubbles burst.\"</p><p> Nellie Bowles and Kate Conger are New York Times writers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-6a694d4885b9c46caf94ac8a756da61a43b14c44</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTB-FTR1-DXVP-V17Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You say antitrust. I say: How much? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  There is little as fashionable in 2019 as the desire to curb Big Tech's power. But knowing how far regulators should go in putting limits on Silicon Valley's largest companies isn't straightforward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  At one extreme, there are calls to break up Big Tech.  <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>grabbed headlines during the week when she called for just that. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, argued that companies shouldn't offer their own products on platforms they controlled (like Apple's selling apps on its App Store -- something Spotify called out to European regulators on Wednesday). She also said she would roll back anticompetitive acquisitions, such as Facebook's takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Her pitch isn't perfect, as The New York Times's Kevin Roose pointed out -- it's too generic, misses easy wins and overlooks some big issues. But it is a bold, inspiring rally cry for Big Tech's biggest critics.</p><p>  At the other end of the spectrum: tech companies. Ideally, the likes of Facebook and Google would love to perpetually operate in the lightly regulated world that helped them grow so quickly. But even <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's chief executive, acknowledged that it was ''inevitable that there will be some regulation'' when he testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in April.</p><p>  There's plenty of room between those extremes. Take, for example, a report published Wednesday by the British government, which called for an overhaul of antitrust policies for Big Tech. Its main proposal: that a new regulator identify companies with ''strategic market status,'' then block some activities -- such as promoting their own products or services in search results over those belonging to competitors (hello, Google!).</p><p>  That, the report's authors say, is a ''more pro-business and pro-consumer solution'' than ''changing antitrust law to drive breakup'' of businesses.</p><p>  So who's right? Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>at least when he says regulatory intervention is inevitable. There's strong bipartisan support for such regulation. As for where a line should be drawn, that's harder to say.</p><p>  Breaking up big companies isn't easy: It's expensive and takes a long time. And it doesn't always go to plan. The last notable attempt to do so, when a judge ruled two decades ago that Microsoft be cleaved for having violated antitrust law, was overturned on appeal. So Ms. Warren could have her work cut out for her.</p><p>  But it may ultimately become a question of balancing ambition with need. Is it better to gamble on breaking up big companies, or guarantee that new rules curb some of their behavior? That's something that lawmakers are going to have to wrestle with.</p><p>  Trading off trust for profit to build A.I.</p><p>  When OpenAI was founded three years ago, it had a huge goal: to build artificial intelligence software that was as capable as the human brain. Its founders said that because it was a nonprofit with noble ambitions -- it had $1 billion in funding from backers to pay its way -- the public could trust it to build that so-called general artificial intelligence.</p><p>  Only, $1 billion doesn't go far with goals like that. Huge computing resources and big salaries to attract talent burn through cash. Actually, it turns out, some profits might be useful.</p><p>  So, Wired reported, Open AI announced that it was changing its business model. To keep up with Facebook and Google, it created a OpenAI L.P., a company that can take money from investors that need to return a profit, like venture funds. That will make it easier to raise funds. Down the line, it might monetize some of the technology it develops. But the company decided to cap the returns that investors will see -- to $100 for every dollar invested.</p><p>  One way to think of that figure is that OpenAI deems a 100-times return to be an ethical margin on building a general A.I. -- enough to make it a feasible endeavor, but not so much as to tar it with the Big Tech brush. That reasoning clearly holds if you inhabit Silicon Valley. But it will be interesting to see if that profit cap is enough to put everyone at ease.</p><p>  What the web could look like in 30 years</p><p>  On March 12, 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed an idea for linking digital files that his boss, Mike Sendall, called ''vague but exciting.'' It ultimately became the World Wide Web, and 30 years later we're left with much to love -- and hate -- about its existence.</p><p>  At an event at London's Science Museum on Tuesday to mark the web's passage into its fourth decade, Mr. Berners-Lee was asked what it might look like in another 30 years. Here's what he said:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''It's not, I think, for us to try and guess.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''Look at what's happened over the last 30 years. The web has changed really dramatically, and a lot of that we couldn't have predicted.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''What we can do is we can say what web we want.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''We want a web which is open. We want a web which is royalty-free. We want a web which is discrimination-free.''</p><p>  Worthy goals. And in an article he wrote this past week, Mr. Berners-Lee laid out steps that may be required to ensure they happen:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity and security in mind. ''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 ''And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable.''</p><p>  Thirty years on, Mr. Sendall's analysis might apply equally well to this proposal, too.</p><p>  And some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  Elon Musk really dislikes whistle-blowers. According to Businessweek, Mr. Musk, the Tesla chief executive, set out to destroy one employee who leaked details about raw materials wastage at the company.</p><p>  How does Google pay off executives accused of misconduct? Handsomely: Two shared a total of $135 million, according to details that emerged from a lawsuit during the week.</p><p>  Who will fund the next wave of tech start-ups? That'll be the millionaires who are created when companies like Airbnb and Uber go public.</p><p>  You should care about TikTok. You might never use it, but it could reshape social media as you know it.</p><p>  Scientists dropped a smartphone into a blender.

In November, Sacha Baron Cohen went viral. The comedian has pulled some pretty good pranks[1] in the past, but this video didn't show him fooling a politician as a rapper or playing a journalist from Kazakhstan. The vid showed him as himself delivering a speech to the Anti-Defamation League[2]. The focus of the speech was Internet companies in general and social media in particular. </p><p>He called them #8216;the greatest propaganda machine in history,#8217; attacked Facebook, and called on platforms to slow down and check facts before publishing content. But where does social media think it's going now?It's not just comedians who think that social media needs disruption.Elizabeth Warren has called for the break-up of what she calls #8216;Big Tech[3].#8217; Amazon, Facebook, and Google, she says, have too much power over the economy, society, and democracy. #8216;They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. In the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.#8217; Her administration would unwind mergers and break up all three companies.Other tech firms are feeling the pressure.Twitter, now a channel for outrage and anger, has tried to pre-empt criticism by banning paid political advertising. YouTube influencers now have to head into the boxing ring[4] to keep the audience's attention. And China's TikTok is the talk of the town while Snapchat is nowhere to be seen.What's going right with social media? What's going wrong? And why will social media be alright in the end?The reason that politicians and others are so worried about the power of social media is that it's still so popular. Facebook has nearly 2.5 billion monthly users.  Twitter is still the place to be for breaking news and discussions. Influencers might now look like an identical series of make-up artists, beauticians, and attention-grabbers, but brands are still keen to use them. Some reports suggest that the price of an Instagram post rose 44 percent[5] over the last year.As far as social media is concerned, everything is great.Platforms are still delivering services that people want to use, building audiences, and attracting advertisers. If it wasn't working \u2014 it wouldn't be popular. And if it wasn't popular, there wouldn't be a problem.What's going wrong is actually one thing that's gone right \u2014 and there's one thing social media can't fix.The thing that's gone right is the building of monopolies. That's bad news for consumers but good news for the monopoly. Every business owner wants a lock on the market. Competition is a great principle \u2014 right up until someone else is trying to eat your lunch.There are already a couple of fixes for that problem.First, the United States has anti-trust laws and regulators who are supposed to prevent companies from dominating marketplaces. The big monopolies are against the law, but can be given bigger teeth \u2014 and there's a good chance they will be. Bigger monopolies reign and are building despite laws. Monopolies are gaining in power and size despite the lobbyists declaring that the social media giants are paying to protect their interests.It's not entirely clear that drastic action is needed \u2014 or is it?Facebook might have a monopoly now but so did MySpace until Facebook wiped it out. The rise of TikTok has shown that it is still possible for an innovative new product to disrupt the market and steal an audience.Is the social media climate a winner-takes-all environment \u2014 but a new winner can quickly take it all away.One new direction for social media could be a platform that offers users real control over their privacy and their data while still keeping them in touch with their old school friends. That could be much more dangerous to Facebook than anything Elizabeth Warren could think of.The thing that social media platforms can't fix is the issue of free speech.Mark Zuckerberg's argument for refusing to take political ads is that he can't police the truthfulness of political advertising. He can only make clear who's paying for it and who's seeing it. Sacha Baron Cohen argues that social media companies are smart enough to create algorithms to remove white supremacist hate speech, and they may be. But who should they be the ones deciding what speech should be removed and what should stay? Do we want the likes of Zuch and Cohen to determine what can and cannot be said? Is that what we want in the U.S.?Someone has to program the algorithms \u2014 and someone will always object to the rules written into them.It's likely that the eventual solution won't be in banning speech but in returning to the principle underlying free speech. Fair speech has to include the clash of ideas. Bad ideas will then be rejected and good ideas will advance. We're not doing very well in that battle at the moment.People's judgments are struggling against an outsized flow of information and an ability to block out opinions they don't want to hear.The direction of social media is to make that situation change by improving education in critical thinking, in identifying misinformation, in overcoming our own biases, and in being willing to admit that we could be wrong.How do you police speech?Social media firms have found themselves with products that are incredibly popular. The products have given the companies themselves temporary but huge monopoly power. Now, social media is having to grapple with one of society's biggest questions: how do you police speech? Social Media can't answer that question. But as everyone else\u2014comedians and politicians alike\u2014try to answer it for them \u2014 social may well come up with answers that improve everyone.

FCC, and both sides treated it as a victory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a victory for the Ajit Pai-led Federal Communications Commission, the court upheld the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Open Internet Order, which classified broadband as an information service under Title I regulation, not a telecommunication service under Title II regulation. This means the FCC no longer regulates the internet. Instead, the Federal Trade Commission does.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an interview on Fox &amp; Friends, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the Obama administration's FCC wanted to treat the internet as a \"slow-moving utility.\"</p><p>\"In 2017, we decided no, we want the internet to move fast,\" Pai said. \"We want the market to determine how this technology develops. I'm very excited for what this means for consumers,\" he added, claiming that internet speeds are up 40 percent since repealing the Open Internet Order.</p><p>But the court also ruled that the FCC can't preempt state net neutrality laws, which validates California's controversial Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act, passed in 2018.</p><p>Now, net neutrality advocates plan on taking court and legislative fights over net neutrality to the states, while Big Cable and Big Telecom are calling on Congress to write a federal law and end the back-and-forth once and for all.</p><p>Evan Greer, deputy director of net neutrality advocacy group Fight for the Future, said FFTF will also fight for Congress to legislate net neutrality, and called on 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to support net neutrality.</p><p>\"All eyes are now on the Senate to do its job and pass the Save The Internet Act to fully restore net neutrality,\" she said. \"Every single 2020 presidential candidate must immediately commit to fully restoring net neutrality protections if elected. Meanwhile, the court decision creates a huge opportunity and a clear path forward for us to fight to restore net neutrality state by state. We fought for and won the strongest net neutrality protections in the country in California with overwhelming bipartisan support, and now we can copy and paste that strategy across the country.\"</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of the top privacy and free speech think tanks, said the FCC will likely face an onslaught of lawsuits from states over net neutrality.</p><p>\"Congress also has a responsibility to bring this debate to an end and reflect the super-majority opinion of the public that net neutrality should be the law of the land.,\" wrote EFF net neutrality experts Corynne McSherry, Katharine Trendacosta and Ernesto Falcon in a blog post. \"The House of Representatives has already done its job with the passage of the Save the Net Act but it remains blocked by the Senate's inaction, effectively doing the work big ISPs like AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast want. Congress and the states should both be acting to protect the Internet and its users.\"</p><p>Tom Struble, manager of Technology and Innovation for the R Street Institute, explained that based on the court's definition of \"preemption,\" the FCC can still trump state laws on net neutrality if the FCC decides to challenge them in court.</p><p>The FCC tried to say that it has authority from Congress to stop states from passing any net neutrality laws in the first place, but the court ruled that Congress never gave the FCC such broad authority.</p><p>\"That means state net neutrality laws are still vulnerable to preemption, but it will have to be done in a separate case,\" Struble said on Twitter.</p><p>The NCTA-Internet and Television Association and US Telecom, the two trade associations representing Big Cable and Big Telecom, called on Congress to legislate the issue.</p><p>\"Where do we go from here? While we are still reviewing the details, one thing is clear: Congress must end this regulatory rinse and repeat cycle by passing a strong national framework that applies to all companies, maintains our dynamic and open internet, and sustains our global digital leadership for the next generation and beyond,\" said US Telecom CEO Jonathan Spalter.</p><p>In an email to InsideSources, AEI visiting tech scholar Roslyn Layton said the FCC will likely sue states like California if they try to pass net neutrality laws, which means the fight is far from over.</p><p>She also worries that a brave new world of net neutrality litigation will hurt consumers and benefit Big Tech companies like Facebook and Google, which, she argues, \"freeload\" off of internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon.</p><p>\"Net neutrality litigation, which drives tens of millions of dollars annually and keeps law firms and legal advocates afloat, is a pittance for the Silicon Valley companies, represented by lead petitioner Internet Association,\" she said. \"They want a price control that enshrines their dominance and makes their internet access price zero. That abuse of the regulatory system has been struck down for now. Ultimately, the best way to resolve this is for Congress to come together and pass a permanent, legislative solution that's grounded in common sense.\"</p><p>Congressional efforts to legislate net neutrality have stalled due to stark differences between Democrats and Republicans over the issue.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

In the United States, for example, high marginal tax rates, wealth taxes, and single-payer health care have become mainstream ideas. Yet unless policymakers get their priorities right, the opportunity for meaningful reform could be squandered, leading to even deeper social and political divisions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, while the reforms that are needed are radical and sweeping, they are not the ones currently in vogue. The top priority should be creating high-wage jobs, and this goal should guide policymakers' approach to everything from technology, regulation, and taxes to education and social programs. Historically, no known human society has created shared prosperity purely through redistribution. Prosperity comes from creating jobs that pay decent wages. And it is good jobs, not redistribution, that provide people with purpose and meaning in life.</p><p>Creating such jobs requires that technological innovation be directed toward boosting demand for workers. Good jobs do not emerge naturally from free markets. Rather, they require labor-market institutions that protect and empower workers, generously funded education systems, and effective social safety nets. This is the institutional architecture that furnished the US and other advanced economies with four decades of strong, inclusive growth after World War II.</p><p>The massive growth in labor demand during that era rested on three pillars. First, businesses deployed technology in ways that increased labor productivity, thus fueling wage growth and demand for workers. At the same time, governments provided crucial support, by funding education and research, and (in some cases) becoming major purchasers of high-tech equipment. Most of today's defining technologies owe something to government-funded innovation from this period.</p><p>Second, governments during the postwar era shaped the business environment with minimum wages, workplace-safety regulations, and other labor- and product-market regulations. Such measures are often blamed for choking off employment. But they can actually create a virtuous cycle of growth, because the cost floor for labor creates an incentive for firms to rationalize and upgrade their production processes, thereby increasing productivity and thus demand. Similarly, by ensuring that product markets remain competitive, governments can prevent firms from charging monopoly prices and reaping higher profits without having to hire more workers.</p><p>Third, governments in the post-war era expanded access to education, which meant that more workers had the skills that were in demand. In the US, for example, the federal government made higher education and vocational training available to millions of citizens with the G.I. Bill, Pell Grants, support for research, and other measures. Yes, all of this investment in innovation and education required higher tax revenues. But moderately higher tax rates and economic growth itself were sufficient to make up the difference.</p><p>A similar institutional architecture took hold across much of the industrialized world during the postwar era. For example, in Scandinavia, shared prosperity was achieved not through redistribution, as is commonly assumed, but as a result of government policies and collective bargaining, which created an environment conducive to the creation of high-wage jobs.</p><p>This is not to suggest that the 1950s and 1960s were perfect. In the US, discrimination against African-Americans and women remained deeply ingrained, and educational opportunities were not equally distributed. Still, in many other ways, economic conditions then were better than they are now, particularly when it comes to the availability of high-wage jobs.</p><p>Having averaged about 2.5% per year between 1947 and 1987, private-sector wage growth in the US decelerated sharply after 1987, and ceased altogether after 2000 \u2013 a full seven years before the Great Recession. This stall has coincided with a period of weak productivity growth and a reorientation of investment toward automation, and away from the creation of new, higher-productivity tasks for humans. As a result, high-wage jobs have dried up, wages have stopped growing, and a larger share of prime-age adults have dropped out of the labor force.</p><p>More broadly, the institutional architecture that once underpinned job creation crumbled during this period. Protections for workers were steadily weakened, market concentration in many sectors increased, and the government abandoned its previous support for innovation. By 2015, federally funded research and development had fallen to 0.7% of GDP, down from 1.9% in the 1960s.</p><p>Many regard the falloff in the creation of high-wage jobs as the inevitable result of advances in artificial intelligence and robotics. It isn't. Technology can be used either to displace labor or to enhance worker productivity. The choice is ours. But to ensure that such decisions benefit workers, governments need to coax the private sector away from its singular focus on automation.</p><p>In the US, this might start with fixing tax policy, which is far too favorable toward capital income. Because firms can reduce their tax burden by deploying machines, they often have an incentive to pursue automation, even in cases where hired workers would actually be more productive. Government also needs to get back into the business of supporting technological innovation, in order to provide a counterweight to the big tech firms, whose business models are overwhelmingly geared toward automation at the expense of job creation. And, of course, expanding educational opportunities across the board is essential.</p><p>As in the postwar era, this institutional architecture will require higher tax revenues, especially in the US, where annual tax revenue relative to GDP is around 27%, well below the OECD average (34%). In raising that figure, the point should not be to punish the rich, but to remove distortions such as the favorable treatment of capital. That means broadening the tax base and increasing tax rates modestly (to avoid discouraging investment and innovation).</p><p>A society powered by shared prosperity is not out of reach. But getting there will require urgent action to align technology with workers' needs, prevent monopolization, and fix the tax code so that we can fund the investments we need. Restoring the post-war institutional architecture will be a job for humans only.</p><p>Daron Acemoglu is Professor of Economics at MIT and co-author of Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty and The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty (forthcoming from Penguin Press in September 2019).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSGHA-143483375</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSGHA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0W-NP01-F11P-X1M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1125\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business and Financial Times.

In the United States, for example, high marginal tax rates, wealth taxes, and single-payer health care have become mainstream ideas. Yet unless policymakers get their priorities right, the opportunity for meaningful reform could be squandered, leading to even deeper social and political divisions. In fact, while the reforms that are needed are radical and sweeping, they are not the ones currently in vogue. </p><p>The top priority should be creating high-wage jobs, and this goal should guide policymakers' approach to everything from technology, regulation, and taxes to education and social programs. Historically, no known human society has created shared prosperity purely through redistribution. Prosperity comes from creating jobs that pay decent wages. And it is good jobs, not redistribution, that provide people with purpose and meaning in life. Creating such jobs requires thattechnological innovation[1]be directed toward boosting demand for workers. Good jobs do not emerge naturally from free markets. Rather, they require labour-market institutions that protect and empower workers, generously funded education systems and effective social safety nets. This is the institutional architecture that furnished the US and other advanced economies with four decades of strong, inclusive growth after World War II. The massive growth in labour demand during that era rested on three pillars. First, businesses deployed technology in ways that increased labour productivity, thus fueling wage growth and demand for workers. At the same time, governments provided crucial support, by funding education and research, and (in some cases) becoming major purchasers of high-tech equipment. Most of today's defining technologies owe something togovernment-funded innovation[2]from this period. Second, governments during the postwar era shaped the business environment with minimum wages, workplace-safety regulations, and other labour- and product-market regulations. Such measures are often blamed for choking off employment. But they can actually create a virtuous cycle of growth, because the cost floor for labour creates an incentive for firms to rationalise and upgrade their production processes, thereby increasing productivity and thus demand. Similarly, by ensuring that product markets remain competitive, governments can prevent firms from charging monopoly prices and reaping higher profits without having to hire more workers. Third, governments in the post-war era expanded access to education, which meant that more workers had the skills that were in demand. In the US, for example, the federal government made higher education and vocational training available to millions of citizens with the G.I. Bill, Pell Grants, support for research, and other measures. Yes, all of this investment in innovation and education required higher tax revenues. But moderately higher tax rates and economic growth itself were sufficient to make up the difference. A similar institutional architecture took hold across much of the industrialized world during the postwar era. For example, in Scandinavia, shared prosperity was achieved not through redistribution, as is commonly assumed, but as a result ofgovernment policies and collective bargaining[3], which created an environment conducive to the creation of high-wage jobs. This is not to suggest that the 1950s and 1960s were perfect. In the US, discrimination against African-Americans and women remained deeply ingrained, and educational opportunities were not equally distributed. Still, in many other ways, economic conditions then were better than they are now, particularly when it comes to the availability of high-wage jobs. Having averaged about2.5% per year[4]between 1947 and 1987, private-sector wage growth in the US decelerated sharply after 1987 and ceased altogether after 2000 - a full seven years before the Great Recession. This stall has coincided with a period of weak productivity growth and a reorientation of investment toward automation, and away from the creation of new, higher-productivity tasks for humans. As aresult[5], high-wage jobs have dried up, wages have stopped growing, and a larger share of prime-age adults have dropped out of the labour force. More broadly, the institutional architecture that once underpinned job creationcrumbled[6]during this period. Protections for workers were steadily weakened, market concentration in many sectorsincreased[7], and the government abandoned its previous support for innovation. By 2015, federally funded research and development had fallen to 0.7% of GDP, down from 1.9% in the 1960s. Many regard the falloff in the creation of high-wage jobs as the inevitable result of advances in artificial intelligence and robotics. It isn't. Technology can be used either to displace labour or to enhance worker productivity. The choice is ours. But to ensure that such decisions benefit workers, governments need to coax the private sector away from its singular focus on automation. In the US, this might start with fixing tax policy, which is far too favourable toward capital income. Because firms can reduce their tax burden by deploying machines, they often have an incentive to pursue automation, even in cases where hired workers would actually be more productive. The government also needs to get back into the business of supporting technological innovation, in order to provide a counterweight to the big tech firms, whose business models are overwhelmingly geared toward automation at the expense of job creation. And, of course, expanding educational opportunities across the board is essential. As in the postwar era, this institutional architecture will require higher tax revenues, especially in the US, where annual tax revenue relative to GDP isaround 27%[8], well below the OECD average (34%). In raising that figure, the point should not be to punish the rich but to remove distortions such as the favourable treatment of capital. That means broadening the tax base and increasing tax rates modestly (to avoid discouraging investment and innovation). A society powered by shared prosperity is not out of reach. But getting there will require urgent action to align technology with workers' needs, prevent monopolisation, and fix the tax code so that we can fund the investments we need. Restoring the post-war institutional architecture will be a job for humans only.

Yet unless policymakers get their priorities right, the opportunity for meaningful reform could be squandered, leading to even deeper social and political divisions.

Historically, no known human society has created shared prosperity purely through redistribution. Prosperity comes from creating jobs that pay decent wages. And it is good jobs, not redistribution, that provide people with purpose and meaning in life. Creating such jobs requires that technological innovation be directed toward boosting demand for workers. Good jobs do not emerge naturally from free markets. Rather, they require labor-market institutions that protect and empower workers, generously funded education systems, and effective social safety nets. This is the institutional architecture that furnished the US and other advanced economies with four decades of strong, inclusive growth after World War II. The massive growth in labor demand during that era rested on three pillars. First, businesses deployed technology in ways that increased labor productivity, thus fueling wage growth and demand for workers. At the same time, governments provided crucial support, by funding education and research, and (in some cases) becoming major purchasers of high-tech equipment. Most of today's defining technologies owe something to government-funded innovation from this period. Second, governments during the postwar era shaped the business environment with minimum wages, workplace-safety regulations, and other labor- and product-market regulations. Such measures are often blamed for choking off employment. But they can actually create a virtuous cycle of growth, because the cost floor for labor creates an incentive for firms to rationalize and upgrade their production processes, thereby increasing productivity and thus demand. Similarly, by ensuring that product markets remain competitive, governments can prevent firms from charging monopoly prices and reaping higher profits without having to hire more workers. Third, governments in the post-war era expanded access to education, which meant that more workers had the skills that were in demand. In the US, for example, the federal government made higher education and vocational training available to millions of citizens with the G.I. Bill, Pell Grants, support for research, and other measures. Yes, all of this investment in innovation and education required higher tax revenues. But moderately higher tax rates and economic growth itself were sufficient to make up the difference. A similar institutional architecture took hold across much of the industrialized world during the postwar era. For example, in Scandinavia, shared prosperity was achieved not through redistribution, as is commonly assumed, but as a result of government policies and collective bargaining, which created an environment conducive to the creation of high-wage jobs. This is not to suggest that the 1950s and 1960s were perfect. In the US, discrimination against African-Americans and women remained deeply ingrained, and educational opportunities were not equally distributed. Still, in many other ways, economic conditions then were better than they are now, particularly when it comes to the availability of high-wage jobs. Having averaged about 2.5% per year between 1947 and 1987, private-sector wage growth in the US decelerated sharply after 1987, and ceased altogether after 2000 - a full seven years before the Great Recession. This stall has coincided with a period of weak productivity growth and a reorientation of investment toward automation, and away from the creation of new, higher-productivity tasks for humans. As a result, high-wage jobs have dried up, wages have stopped growing, and a larger share of prime-age adults have dropped out of the labor force. More broadly, the institutional architecture that once underpinned job creation crumbled during this period. Protections for workers were steadily weakened, market concentration in many sectors increased, and the government abandoned its previous support for innovation. By 2015, federally funded research and development had fallen to 0.7% of GDP, down from 1.9% in the 1960s. Many regard the falloff in the creation of high-wage jobs as the inevitable result of advances in artificial intelligence and robotics. It isn't. Technology can be used either to displace labor or to enhance worker productivity. The choice is ours. But to ensure that such decisions benefit workers, governments need to coax the private sector away from its singular focus on automation. In the US, this might start with fixing tax policy, which is far too favorable toward capital income. Because firms can reduce their tax burden by deploying machines, they often have an incentive to pursue automation, even in cases where hired workers would actually be more productive. Government also needs to get back into the business of supporting technological innovation, in order to provide a counterweight to the big tech firms, whose business models are overwhelmingly geared toward automation at the expense of job creation. And, of course, expanding educational opportunities across the board is essential. As in the postwar era, this institutional architecture will require higher tax revenues, especially in the US, where annual tax revenue relative to GDP is around 27%, well below the OECD average (34%). In raising that figure, the point should not be to punish the rich, but to remove distortions such as the favorable treatment of capital. That means broadening the tax base and increasing tax rates modestly (to avoid discouraging investment and innovation). A society powered by shared prosperity is not out of reach. But getting there will require urgent action to align technology with workers' needs, prevent monopolization, and fix the tax code so that we can fund the investments we need. Restoring the post-war institutional architecture will be a job for humans only.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Last thinks President Trump is here forever. Last, the editor of The Bulwark, a conservative site that's been hostile to Trump, argues that if Trump loses in November, he'll claim he was cheated out of the election. He'll force other Republicans to back up his claim. He'll get a TV show, hold rallies, be coy about running again in 2024.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He'll still be the center of everything Republican. Ambitious Republicans will have to lash themselves to the husk of the dying czar if they want to have any future in the party. The whole party will go Trump-crazed and brain-dead for another four years. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  I salute Last for coming up with a post-2020 scenario even more pessimistic than my own!</p><p>  My guess is that if Trump gets crushed in the election, millions of Republicans will decide they never liked that loser and jerk anyway. He'll get relegated to whatever bargain basement they are using to hold Sarah Palin. But something will remain: Trumpism.</p><p>  The basic Trump worldview -- on immigration, trade, foreign policy, etc. -- will shape the G.O.P. for decades, the way the basic Reagan worldview did for decades. A thousand smarter conservatives will be building a new party after 2020, but one that builds from the framework Trump established.</p><p>  I think Trumpism will survive Trump because the history of the modern Republican Party is the history of paradigm shifts.</p><p>  If you came of age with conservative values and around Republican politics in the 1980s and 1990s, you lived within a certain Ronald Reagan-Margaret Thatcher paradigm. It was about limiting government, spreading democracy abroad, building dynamic free markets at home and cultivating people with vigorous virtues -- people who are energetic, upright, entrepreneurial, independent-minded, loyal to friends and strong against foes.</p><p>  For decades conservatives were happy to live in that paradigm. But as years went by many came to see its limits. It was so comprehensively anti-government that it had no way to use government to solve common problems. It was so focused on cultivating strong individuals that it had no language to cultivate a sense of community and belonging. So, if you were right of center, you leapt. You broke from the Reagan paradigm and tried to create a new, updated conservative paradigm.</p><p>  My own leap came early. On Sept. 15, 1997, William Kristol and I wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal on what we called National Greatness Conservatism. We argued that the G.O.P. had become too anti-government. ''How can Americans love their nation if they hate its government?'' we asked. Only a return to the robust American nationalism of Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay and Theodore Roosevelt would do: ambitious national projects, infrastructure, federal programs to increase social mobility.</p><p>  The closest National Greatness Conservatism came to influencing the party was John McCain's 2000 presidential bid. He was defeated by a man, George W. Bush, who made his own leap, to Compassionate Conservatism. (You know somebody has made a paradigm leap when he or she starts adding some modifying word or phrase before ''Conservatism.'') This was an attempt to meld Catholic social teaching to conservatism.</p><p>  There were many other leaps over the decades. Sam's Club Republicans, led by Reihan Salam and my Times colleague Ross Douthat, pointed a way to link the G.O.P. to working-class concerns. Front Porch Republicans celebrated small towns and local communities. The Reformicons tried to use government to build strong families and neighborhoods. The Niskanen Center is an entire think tank for people who have leapt from libertarianism.</p><p>  Most actual Republican politicians rejected all of this. They stuck, mostly through dumb inertia, to an anti-government zombie Reaganism long after Reagan was dead and even though the nation's problems were utterly different from what they were when he was alive. Year after year, G.O.P. politicians clung to a dead paradigm, ran the same anti-Washington campaigns and had no positive governing philosophy once they got there.</p><p>  Steve Bannon's leap finally did what none of us could do. Donald Trump and Bannon took a low-rent strand of conservatism -- class-based ethnic nationalism -- that had always been locked away in the basement of the American right, and overturned the Reagan paradigm.</p><p>  Bannon and Trump got the emotions right. They understood that Republican voters were no longer motivated by a sense of hope and opportunity; they were motivated by a sense of menace, resentment and fear. At base, many Republicans felt they were being purged from their own country -- by the educated elite, by multiculturalism, by militant secularism.</p><p>  During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump and Bannon discarded the Republican orthodoxy -- entitlement reform, fiscal restraint, free trade, comprehensive immigration reform. They embraced a European-style blood-and-soil conservatism. Close off immigration. Close trade. We have nothing to offer the world and should protect ourselves from its dangers.</p><p>  It would have been interesting if Trump had governed as a big-government populist. But he tossed Bannon out and handed power to Jared Kushner and a bunch of old men locked in the Reagan paradigm. We got bigotry, incompetence and tax cuts for the wealthy.</p><p>  But by defeating the Reagan paradigm, Trump and Bannon gave permission to a lot of Republican politicians to make their own leaps. Over the last three years, it's been interesting to watch a series of Republican officeholders break free from old orthodoxies and begin to think afresh. You could see their eyes get wider: Suddenly I can think for myself. The range of possibilities is wider than I thought it was.</p><p>  Their newfound liberation didn't extend to crossing Trump, but because the president's political vision isn't exactly what you'd call fleshed out, there's a lot of running room within his paradigm.</p><p>  The post-2020, post-Trump Republican future is contained in those leaps. And that future is embodied by a small group of Republican senators in their 40s, including Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Ben Sasse. They all came of age when Reaganism was already in the rearview mirror. Though populist, three of them have advanced degrees from Harvard or Yale. They are not particularly close to one another. They may be joined by a common experience, but they are divided by ambition.</p><p>  Each has a different vision of where the country should go, but they start with certain common Trumpian premises:</p><p>  Everything is not OK. The free market is not working well. Wages are stagnant. Too much power is in the hands of the corporate elites. Middle America is getting screwed. Finance capitalism is unbalanced. American society is in abject decline. If Reaganism was ''Let's be free,'' the new mood is ''Take control.''</p><p>  Economic libertarianism is not the answer. Free markets alone won't solve our problems. G.D.P. growth alone is not the be-all and end-all of politics. We need policies to shore up the conservative units of society -- family, neighborhood, faith, nation. We need policies that build solidarity, not just liberty.</p><p>  The working class is the heart of the Republican Party. Once, businesspeople and entrepreneurs were at the center of the Republican imagination. Now it's clear that the party needs to stop catering to the corporate class and start focusing on the shop owners, the plumbers, the salaried workers. It needs to emphasize the dignity of work and honor those who are not trying to make millions, not looking for handouts, but just want to build middle-class lives in a stable social order. In Britain, the Conservative Party has built a majority around the working class, and that's what Republicans need to do here.</p><p>  China changes everything. The rise of a 1.4-billion-person authoritarian superpower means that free trade no longer works because the Chinese are not playing by the same rules. The U.S. government cannot just stand back and let China control the new technologies. ''Republicans are going to have to get used to the idea of industrial policy to counter China, at least in a few key industries,'' Mike Gallagher, a rising star among House Republicans, told me.</p><p>  The managerial class betrays America. Many of the post-Reagan positions seem like steps to the left. But these Republicans combine a greater willingness to use government with a greater hostility to the managerial class. The solution to too much corporate power is not handing power to Elizabeth Warren and a cloud of federal regulators. There's a difference between empowering workers and empowering the Washington elite.</p><p>  From these common premises the four senators go off in different directions.</p><p>  Rubio bases his vision in Catholic social teaching. A year ago, he wrote an essay for First Things titled, ''What Economics Is For,'' arguing that the purpose of markets is not growth but allowing each person to find dignity in work. He followed that up with a speech at Catholic University calling for ''common-good capitalism'' (remember what I said about modifying phrases) in which he criticized contemporary capitalism for its obsessive focus on maximizing shareholder value.</p><p>  His basic position is that American capitalism has become too much about finance. It needs to be balanced toward manufacturing. He, too, supports a ''pro-American industrial policy'' to meet the Chinese challenge.</p><p>  Hawley is the most populist of the group. His core belief is that middle-class Americans have been betrayed by elites on every level -- political elites, cultural elites, financial elites. The modern leadership class has one set of values -- globalization, cosmopolitanism -- and the Middle Americans have another set -- family, home, rootedness, nation. Corporate elites have concentrated so much power that they now crush the yeomen masses.</p><p>  Last November, Hawley gave a speech in which he sought to overturn the last 70 years of Republican foreign policy. He contended that the right had erred in trying to spread American values abroad. ''Imperial domination violates our principles and it threatens our character. Our aim must be to prevent imperialism, not to exercise it; to stop domination, not foster it,'' he said.</p><p>  Cotton has a less developed political vision but a more developed attitude: hawkishness. Whether it's China, the left, immigration or Big Tech, Cotton is hawkish. He sees a world threatened by disorder and gravitates toward the toughest positions in order to ward off threat. He is the most vocal foe of the Chinese ''pariah state.'' He wants sharp reductions in legal immigration.</p><p>  Sasse is the most sociological of the crew. He is a Tocquevillian localist, who notes that most normal Americans go days without thinking of national politics. His vision is centered on the small associations -- neighborhood groups, high school football teams, churches and community centers -- where people find their greatest joys, satisfactions and supports. Government's job, he says, is to ''create a framework of ordered liberty'' so that people can make their family and neighborhood the center of their lives.</p><p>  He is the most suspicious of government and politics today. ''I think politicians are arsonists,'' he told me over the phone last month. ''The main thing the G.O.P. does is try to light the Democrats on fire, and the main thing the Democrats do is light the Republicans on fire. That's why there's so little trust in politics.''</p><p>  Behind these public figures there is a posse of policy wonks and commentators supporting a new Working-Class Republicanism, including Oren Cass, Henry Olsen, J.D. Vance, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Saagar Enjeti, Samuel Hammond and, in his own way, Tucker Carlson.</p><p>  Cass, for example, has created a new think tank, the American Compass, to push the G.O.P. in a post-Trump direction. Cass, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, argues that free-market economists pay too much attention to G.D.P. growth. What matters is the kind of growth and whether it allows people to lead stable lives. He says there's too much emphasis on consumption. People should be seen as producers, and government should create the kind of jobs that allow people to earn dignity through work.</p><p>  He says the core of the economy is the industrial economy: manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure -- making things in the physical world. ''Investment in our economy has completely discounted the making of stuff,'' he told me in a recent interview. ''You have a V.C. industry that goes entirely to software. Private equity financial flow is about buying and trading companies.'' Government needs to engage in ''predistribution,'' to steer investment to manufacturing, and also to those Middle American parts of the country that are currently left out.</p><p>  ''The American labor force cannot be changed into what the economy wants,'' Cass says. ''We have to change the economy to what the American labor force can be successful in.''</p><p>  The intellectual future of conservatism will be wrestled over at a series of forums at the Center for Social, Cultural and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute that are being organized by Yuval Levin, a scholar there. Right now, the various factions are exchanging sarcastic one-liners on Twitter. Levin is bringing the players together. ''People should be talking to each other, not about each other,'' he told me.</p><p>  Levin thinks the prevailing post-Trump viewpoints define the problem too much in economic terms. The crucial problem, he argues, is not economic; it's social: alienation. Millions of Americans don't feel part of anything they can trust. They feel no one is looking out for them. Trump was a false answer to their desire for social solidarity, but the desire can be a force for good.</p><p>  ''What's needed,'' Levin says, ''is not just to expand economic conservatism beyond growth to also prioritize family, community and nation, but also to expand social conservatism beyond sexual ethics and religious liberty to prioritize family, community and nation. The coalition can be a powerful political force again if its different wings converge on these priorities, without each giving up on its longstanding aims.''</p><p>  The Republican Party looks completely brain-dead at every spot Trump directly reaches. Off in the corners, though, there's a lot of intellectual ferment on the right. But if there is one thing I've learned over the decades, it is never to underestimate the staying power of the dead Reagan paradigm.</p><p>  The Wall Street Journal editorial page stands as a vigilant guardian of the corpse, eager to rebut all dissenters. The former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania are staunch defenders of Minimal-Government Conservatism. Senator Ted Cruz seems to be positioning himself for a 2024 presidential run that seeks to triangulate all the pre-Trump and pro-Trump versions of the party into one stew.</p><p>  And if Joe Biden defeats Trump and begins legislating, as seems more and more likely, there's also the possibility that Republicans will abandon any positive vision and revert to being a simple anti-government party -- a party of opposition to whatever Biden is doing.</p><p>  But over the long term, some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the G.O.P. In the first place, that's where Republican voters are. When push comes to shove, Republican politicians are going to choose their voters over their donor class.</p><p>  Second, the working-class emphasis is the only way out of the demographic doom loop. If the party sticks with its old white high school-educated base, it will die. They just aren't making enough old white men. To have any shot of surviving as a major party, the G.O.P. has to build a cross-racial alliance among working-class whites, working-class Hispanics and some working-class Blacks.</p><p>  None of this works unless Republicans can deracialize their appeal -- by which I mean they must stop pandering to the racists in the party and stop presenting themselves and seeing themselves as the party of white people -- and wage a class struggle between diverse workers in their coalition and the highly educated coastal manager and professional class in the Democratic coalition.</p><p>  Rubio, Hawley, Sasse and Cotton are inching toward a G.O.P. future. What are the odds they'll succeed? They've got to be way under 50-50.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Last thinks President Trump is here forever. Last, the editor of The Bulwark, a conservative site that\u2019s been hostile to Trump, argues that if Trump loses in November, he\u2019ll claim he was cheated out of the election. He\u2019ll force other Republicans to back up his claim. He\u2019ll get a TV show, hold rallies, be coy about running again in 2024.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He\u2019ll still be the center of everything Republican. Ambitious Republicans will have to lash themselves to the husk of the dying czar if they want to have any future in the party. The whole party will go Trump-crazed and brain-dead for another four years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I salute Last for coming up with a post-2020 scenario even more pessimistic than my own!</p><p>My guess is that if Trump gets crushed in the election, millions of Republicans will decide they never liked that loser and jerk anyway. He\u2019ll get relegated to whatever bargain basement they are using to hold Sarah Palin. But something will remain: Trumpism.</p><p>The basic Trump worldview \u2014 on immigration, trade, foreign policy, etc. \u2014 will shape the G.O.P. for decades, the way the basic Reagan worldview did for decades. A thousand smarter conservatives will be building a new party after 2020, but one that builds from the framework Trump established.</p><p>I think Trumpism will survive Trump because the history of the modern Republican Party is the history of paradigm shifts.</p><p>If you came of age with conservative values and around Republican politics in the 1980s and 1990s, you lived within a certain Ronald Reagan-Margaret Thatcher paradigm. It was about limiting government, spreading democracy abroad, building dynamic free markets at home and cultivating people with vigorous virtues \u2014 people who are energetic, upright, entrepreneurial, independent-minded, loyal to friends and strong against foes.</p><p>For decades conservatives were happy to live in that paradigm. But as years went by many came to see its limits. It was so comprehensively anti-government that it had no way to use government to solve common problems. It was so focused on cultivating strong individuals that it had no language to cultivate a sense of community and belonging. So, if you were right of center, you leapt. You broke from the Reagan paradigm and tried to create a new, updated conservative paradigm.</p><p>My own leap came early. On Sept. 15, 1997, William Kristol and I <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB874276753849168000\">wrote a piece</url> for The Wall Street Journal on what we called National Greatness Conservatism. We argued that the G.O.P. had become too anti-government. \u201cHow can Americans love their nation if they hate its government?\u201d we asked. Only a return to the robust American nationalism of Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay and Theodore Roosevelt would do: ambitious national projects, infrastructure, federal programs to increase social mobility.</p><p>The closest National Greatness Conservatism came to influencing the party was John McCain\u2019s 2000 presidential bid. He was defeated by a man, George W. Bush, who made his own leap, to Compassionate Conservatism. (You know somebody has made a paradigm leap when he or she starts adding some modifying word or phrase before \u201cConservatism.\u201d) This was an attempt to meld Catholic social teaching to conservatism.</p><p>There were many other leaps over the decades. Sam\u2019s Club Republicans, led by Reihan Salam and my Times colleague Ross Douthat, pointed a way to link the G.O.P. to working-class concerns. Front Porch Republicans celebrated small towns and local communities. The Reformicons tried to use government to build strong families and neighborhoods. The Niskanen Center is an entire think tank for people who have leapt from libertarianism.</p><p>Most actual Republican politicians rejected all of this. They stuck, mostly through dumb inertia, to an anti-government zombie Reaganism long after Reagan was dead and even though the nation\u2019s problems were utterly different from what they were when he was alive. Year after year, G.O.P. politicians clung to a dead paradigm, ran the same anti-Washington campaigns and had no positive governing philosophy once they got there.</p><p>Steve Bannon\u2019s leap finally did what none of us could do. Donald Trump and Bannon took a low-rent strand of conservatism \u2014 class-based ethnic nationalism \u2014 that had always been locked away in the basement of the American right, and overturned the Reagan paradigm.</p><p>Bannon and Trump got the emotions right. They understood that Republican voters were no longer motivated by a sense of hope and opportunity; they were motivated by a sense of menace, resentment and fear. At base, many Republicans felt they were being purged from their own country \u2014 by the educated elite, by multiculturalism, by militant secularism.</p><p>During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump and Bannon discarded the Republican orthodoxy \u2014 entitlement reform, fiscal restraint, free trade, comprehensive immigration reform. They embraced a European-style blood-and-soil conservatism. Close off immigration. Close trade. We have nothing to offer the world and should protect ourselves from its dangers.</p><p>It would have been interesting if Trump had governed as a big-government populist. But he tossed Bannon out and handed power to Jared Kushner and a bunch of old men locked in the Reagan paradigm. We got bigotry, incompetence and tax cuts for the wealthy.</p><p>But by defeating the Reagan paradigm, Trump and Bannon gave permission to a lot of Republican politicians to make their own leaps. Over the last three years, it\u2019s been interesting to watch a series of Republican officeholders break free from old orthodoxies and begin to think afresh. You could see their eyes get wider: Suddenly I can think for myself. The range of possibilities is wider than I thought it was.</p><p>Their newfound liberation didn\u2019t extend to crossing Trump, but because the president\u2019s political vision isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call fleshed out, there\u2019s a lot of running room within his paradigm.</p><p>The post-2020, post-Trump Republican future is contained in those leaps. And that future is embodied by a small group of Republican senators in their 40s, including Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Ben Sasse. They all came of age when Reaganism was already in the rearview mirror. Though populist, three of them have advanced degrees from Harvard or Yale. They are not particularly close to one another. They may be joined by a common experience, but they are divided by ambition.</p><p>Each has a different vision of where the country should go, but they start with certain common Trumpian premises:</p><p>Everything is not OK. The free market is not working well. Wages are stagnant. Too much power is in the hands of the corporate elites. Middle America is getting screwed. Finance capitalism is unbalanced. American society is in abject decline. If Reaganism was \u201cLet\u2019s be free,\u201d the new mood is \u201cTake control.\u201d</p><p>Economic libertarianism is not the answer. Free markets alone won\u2019t solve our problems. G.D.P. growth alone is not the be-all and end-all of politics. We need policies to shore up the conservative units of society \u2014 family, neighborhood, faith, nation. We need policies that build solidarity, not just liberty.</p><p>The working class is the heart of the Republican Party. Once, businesspeople and entrepreneurs were at the center of the Republican imagination. Now it\u2019s clear that the party needs to stop catering to the corporate class and start focusing on the shop owners, the plumbers, the salaried workers. It needs to emphasize the dignity of work and honor those who are not trying to make millions, not looking for handouts, but just want to build middle-class lives in a stable social order. In Britain, the Conservative Party has built a majority around the working class, and that\u2019s what Republicans need to do here.</p><p>China changes everything. The rise of a 1.4-billion-person authoritarian superpower means that free trade no longer works because the Chinese are not playing by the same rules. The U.S. government cannot just stand back and let China control the new technologies. \u201cRepublicans are going to have to get used to the idea of industrial policy to counter China, at least in a few key industries,\u201d Mike Gallagher, a rising star among House Republicans, told me.</p><p>The managerial class betrays America. Many of the post-Reagan positions seem like steps to the left. But these Republicans combine a greater willingness to use government with a greater hostility to the managerial class. The solution to too much corporate power is not handing power to Elizabeth Warren and a cloud of federal regulators. There\u2019s a difference between empowering workers and empowering the Washington elite.</p><p>From these common premises the four senators go off in different directions.</p><p>Rubio bases his vision in Catholic social teaching. A year ago, he wrote an essay for First Things titled, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB874276753849168000\">\u201cWhat Economics Is For,\u201d</url> arguing that the purpose of markets is not growth but allowing each person to find dignity in work. He followed that up with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB874276753849168000\">speech at Catholic University</url> calling for \u201ccommon-good capitalism\u201d (remember what I said about modifying phrases) in which he criticized contemporary capitalism for its obsessive focus on maximizing shareholder value.</p><p>His basic position is that American capitalism has become too much about finance. It needs to be balanced toward manufacturing. He, too, supports a \u201cpro-American industrial policy\u201d to meet the Chinese challenge.</p><p>Hawley is the most populist of the group. His core belief is that middle-class Americans have been betrayed by elites on every level \u2014 political elites, cultural elites, financial elites. The modern leadership class has one set of values \u2014 globalization, cosmopolitanism \u2014 and the Middle Americans have another set \u2014 family, home, rootedness, nation. Corporate elites have concentrated so much power that they now crush the yeomen masses.</p><p>Last November, Hawley <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB874276753849168000\">gave a speech</url> in which he sought to overturn the last 70 years of Republican foreign policy. He contended that the right had erred in trying to spread American values abroad. \u201cImperial domination violates our principles and it threatens our character. Our aim must be to prevent imperialism, not to exercise it; to stop domination, not foster it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cotton has a less developed political vision but a more developed attitude: hawkishness. Whether it\u2019s China, the left, immigration or Big Tech, Cotton is hawkish. He sees a world threatened by disorder and gravitates toward the toughest positions in order to ward off threat. He is the most vocal foe of the Chinese \u201cpariah state.\u201d He wants sharp reductions in legal immigration.</p><p>Sasse is the most sociological of the crew. He is a Tocquevillian localist, who notes that most normal Americans go days without thinking of national politics. His vision is centered on the small associations \u2014 neighborhood groups, high school football teams, churches and community centers \u2014 where people find their greatest joys, satisfactions and supports. Government\u2019s job, he says, is to \u201ccreate a framework of ordered liberty\u201d so that people can make their family and neighborhood the center of their lives.</p><p>He is the most suspicious of government and politics today. \u201cI think politicians are arsonists,\u201d he told me over the phone last month. \u201cThe main thing the G.O.P. does is try to light the Democrats on fire, and the main thing the Democrats do is light the Republicans on fire. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so little trust in politics.\u201d</p><p>Behind these public figures there is a posse of policy wonks and commentators supporting a new Working-Class Republicanism, including Oren Cass, Henry Olsen, J.D. Vance, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Saagar Enjeti, Samuel Hammond and, in his own way, Tucker Carlson.</p><p>Cass, for example, has created a new think tank, the American Compass, to push the G.O.P. in a post-Trump direction. Cass, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, argues that free-market economists pay too much attention to G.D.P. growth. What matters is the kind of growth and whether it allows people to lead stable lives. He says there\u2019s too much emphasis on consumption. People should be seen as producers, and government should create the kind of jobs that allow people to earn dignity through work.</p><p>He says the core of the economy is the industrial economy: manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure \u2014 making things in the physical world. \u201cInvestment in our economy has completely discounted the making of stuff,\u201d he told me in a recent interview. \u201cYou have a V.C. industry that goes entirely to software. Private equity financial flow is about buying and trading companies.\u201d Government needs to engage in \u201cpredistribution,\u201d to steer investment to manufacturing, and also to those Middle American parts of the country that are currently left out.</p><p>\u201cThe American labor force cannot be changed into what the economy wants,\u201d Cass says. \u201cWe have to change the economy to what the American labor force can be successful in.\u201d</p><p>The intellectual future of conservatism will be wrestled over at a series of forums at the Center for Social, Cultural and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute that are being organized by Yuval Levin, a scholar there. Right now, the various factions are exchanging sarcastic one-liners on Twitter. Levin is bringing the players together. \u201cPeople should be talking to each other, not about each other,\u201d he told me.</p><p>Levin thinks the prevailing post-Trump viewpoints define the problem too much in economic terms. The crucial problem, he argues, is not economic; it\u2019s social: alienation. Millions of Americans don\u2019t feel part of anything they can trust. They feel no one is looking out for them. Trump was a false answer to their desire for social solidarity, but the desire can be a force for good.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s needed,\u201d Levin says, \u201cis not just to expand economic conservatism beyond growth to also prioritize family, community and nation, but also to expand social conservatism beyond sexual ethics and religious liberty to prioritize family, community and nation. The coalition can be a powerful political force again if its different wings converge on these priorities, without each giving up on its longstanding aims.\u201d</p><p>The Republican Party looks completely brain-dead at every spot Trump directly reaches. Off in the corners, though, there\u2019s a lot of intellectual ferment on the right. But if there is one thing I\u2019ve learned over the decades, it is never to underestimate the staying power of the dead Reagan paradigm.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial page stands as a vigilant guardian of the corpse, eager to rebut all dissenters. The former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania are staunch defenders of Minimal-Government Conservatism. Senator Ted Cruz seems to be positioning himself for a 2024 presidential run that seeks to triangulate all the pre-Trump and pro-Trump versions of the party into one stew.</p><p>And if Joe Biden defeats Trump and begins legislating, as seems more and more likely, there\u2019s also the possibility that Republicans will abandon any positive vision and revert to being a simple anti-government party \u2014 a party of opposition to whatever Biden is doing.</p><p>But over the long term, some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the G.O.P. In the first place, that\u2019s where Republican voters are. When push comes to shove, Republican politicians are going to choose their voters over their donor class.</p><p>Second, the working-class emphasis is the only way out of the demographic doom loop. If the party sticks with its old white high school-educated base, it will die. They just aren\u2019t making enough old white men.

We know Facebook's been reckless with securing their data, especially against developers[2] who take advantage of lax rules set in place. After all, that's how the data scandal occurred in the first place.Data Can Be DangerousWhen CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress a few months ago, South Carolina's Republican Senator Lindsey Graham asked Zuckerberg directly if there is an alternative to Facebook. Zuckerberg pointed out that Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon offered services that Facebook also offers. Graham clarified her point: could Facebook be a monopoly since it has no direct competitor? 'It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,' replies Zuckerberg. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/5aafe8a299365b02dce6ce2a/master/w_1164,c_limit/facebook_data_privacy-01.png\">https://media.wired.com/photos/5aafe8a299365b02dce6ce2a/master/w_1164,c_limit/facebook_data_privacy-01.png</url> Graham's question could be applied to Google and Amazon, too; who can compete with these three tech giants that offer unique products and save mass amounts of data on users and their habits? Is a monopoly inevitable?Tech In the Modern Day-to-DayTech giant monopolies (or 'alleged' monopolies) aren't new, and they're not unique to the 21st century. When IBM and Microsoft were the big players, they sold products that we used daily, but the companies weren't part of our daily lives themselves. Contrast this with Facebook's user engagement, and you'll quickly find that checking Facebook is a part of people's daily routines (often multiple times a day).A study by Pew Research Center[3] says 45% of American adults use Facebook to get at least some of their news. Similarly, most of us don't think twice when we turn to Google to explain something or solve a debate. And Amazon's been increasingly clogging up the postal system because we just can't get enough of free 2-day shipping.A Self-Generated Gold MineWhat does all of this consumerism amount to? A lot of self-generated data that may not sound too important or beneficial to us but which is very valuable to companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnews.cz/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/facebook-privacy-shortcuts.png\">https://www.cnews.cz/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/facebook-privacy-shortcuts.png</url> These companies start by asking for your permission to collect data to improve your experience on their site. Slowly and quietly, they add more data points to take from your habits, like how long you spend in a session, what you clicked on, and much more. Tech giants can claim to use data for algorithms that create more personalized feeds and results, and most consumers don't bat an eye. But what most users don't realize is that Facebook's and Google's ad platforms rake in 75% of all digital advertising dollars spent. Why are their ad platforms more robust than dedicated products? Well, for one, you can build profiles of Facebook users by demographic (age and gender), interests, relationship status, and much more. Without that type of user base, no one can come close to rivaling these capabilities.No Room for CompetitorsAmazon, too, accounts for the majority of e-book sales (over 83%) and nearly all online print sales (almost 90%). Additionally, Amazon's fast becoming a national e-commerce giant selling a wide variety of items in the U.S.; it generated 44% of all e-commerce sales last year.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/amazon-surveillance.jpg\">https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/amazon-surveillance.jpg</url> Albert Wenger is a managing partner at Union Square Ventures. Earlier in the year, Wenger spoke atan antitrust conference and said that a top priority for founders and venture capitalist firms alike is avoidingthe tech giants' 'kill zones.' These are areas where a tech giant would undoubtedly dominate and crush the competition. But how many 'kill zones' will these companies take over with their growing revenue streams? How can we put an end to this monopolistic behavior? Where is the realistic room for innovative startups to enter the market with fresh ideas? There may be none. And the tech giants have seen to that. Historically, when a competitor becomes a problem, one of the tech giants bends and acquires the competitor and their user base. Google bought out Waze, a Google Maps competitor. Amazon acquired Zappos, a strong competitor in the shoe arena, and Facebook bought Instagram and Whatsapp.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/5ab1a5c5ec5e9b19adb81e01/master/pass/GoogleCloudSecurity.jpgIn\">https://media.wired.com/photos/5ab1a5c5ec5e9b19adb81e01/master/pass/GoogleCloudSecurity.jpgIn</url> With the Old, Out With the NewAntitrust regulation largely looks to product price to determine whether there is a monopoly. And since, you guessed it, most of these tech giants offer free products, prices haven't changed for consumers. So these 1980s definitions of antitrust don't apply anymore, especially not to the world of tech. Instead, if we, for example, put a price on our data, wouldn't it seem that it has become more expensive for consumers? As AI investor Kai-Fu Lee wrote,'The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product.'The European Union's data protection regulations will help kickstart the data revolution. New rules require that companies who retain user data, like Facebook and Google, must put the user's data in an easily-transferable document that can be read by any website. By creating a data portability regulation, consumers can keep a close eye on their data, and startups can benefit from faster data acquisition, too. Each tech giant is walking on a very thin rope. If another data abuse scandal popped up, governments will not be as patient as they were with Facebook's mishandling of the Cambridge Analytica issue.A Fine LineAs artificial intelligence (AI) continues advancing rapidly, and as these companies quietly incorporate more robust AI into their algorithms, we're running out of time to secure our data before more can be leaked out. Additionally, AI offers better experiences for users and better prediction technology for all types of other technologies, like self-driving cars, the Internet of Things, and even drones.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://i2.wp.com/bigtechquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/google-data-2.jpg?fit=4252,2000...=1\">https://i2.wp.com/bigtechquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/google-data-2.jpg?fit=4252,2000...=1</url> How could any new startup compete with AI-backed products that have learned from billions of data points that have been collected over decades of user engagement? Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger is a professor at the University of Oxford, and he has an interesting possible solution. What if all companies who had a certain amount of market share were mandated to share data with other firms in their industry, upon request? The data wouldn't be full of personal information, but there exists valuable data without all of the details, too. Without an innovative and scalable regulation plan, however, the tech giants are free to do as they please, with minimal legal consequences. It's obvious that these companies won't draw the line themselves (after all, that wouldn't benefit them in the slightest), so it's time for consumers and governments to step up.

In the days since, other candidates have come out with their own ideas and proposals for regulating these companies as well.</p><p>Here s what the top presidential candidates have (or haven t) said about antitrust following Warren s proposal.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)</emphasis></h><p>Sen. Sanders has a lot in common with Warren, and the two have worked together frequently in the Senate. He has yet to make any public comments on Warren s proposal. However, he did lead an effort in Congress last year to force Amazon to increase its minimum wage for workers. The campaign eventually succeeded, and Amazon agreed to pay its workers more last fall.</p><p>Following Warren s announcement, Sanders kicked up his criticism of the e-commerce giant, tweeting:  Amazon must recognize that workers  rights don t stop at the minimum wage. Amazon must significantly improve working conditions at its warehouses and respect the constitutional right of its employees to form a union and bargain collectively for a better life. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)</emphasis></h><p>Sen. Harris has so far abstained from taking any specific position regarding Warren s proposal or antitrust enforcement in the tech sector. However, throughout her time in the Senate, she has proved to be a tough voice on data privacy, election security, and hate speech on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)</emphasis></h><p>Sen. Booker hasn t commented on Warren s proposal yet, but he s been a frequent critic of corporate consolidation for years. In 2017, Booker appeared on the Recode Decode podcast and criticized Amazon s acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>Booker said he was worried the merger would cut jobs and reduce pricing competition, particularly in urban areas where  we re having a hard enough time  getting supermarkets to move in already.  So I am skeptical of this particular merger, highly skeptical of it,  Booker said.  I believe this consolidation as well as other consolidations, we should be holding a far higher bar than we are when we approve these. </p><p>Booker also criticized antitrust enforcement at large in an Open Market Institute speech last October. He called on the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to do a  comprehensive review  of completed mergers to see whether the  promises and predications  made actually played out. If they didn t, he said, they should  take aggressive action when it s needed, because our very liberty is at stake. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)</emphasis></h><p>Sen. Klobuchar was one of the only candidates for president who mentioned issues like data privacy and net neutrality in her official campaign announcement. In February, she introduced legislation that would  modernize  antitrust enforcement and pivot back to the competition model that regulators upheld prior to the 1980s.</p><p> We ve got to look carefully at all of these deals,  Klobuchar said at SXSW.</p><p>Instead of commenting directly on Warren s proposal, Klobuchar offered a separate option to tax tech companies when they either exploit, sell, or give user data to third-party sources. The plan wasn t fully fleshed out, but a similar digital services tax has been discussed in the European Union. Last October, the UK Chancellor announced a 2 percent tax on the revenues of companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI)</emphasis></h><p>Rep. Gabbard responded to Warren s proposal in a tweet saying that she had plans to propose a similar measure in the House. It s unclear whether Warren is planning to introduce legislation this congressional term while she s a senator or wait until the 2020 elections.</p><p>Tulsi Gabbard</p><p>@TulsiGabbard  </p><p>Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren</p><p>@ewarren </p><p>Curious why I think FB has too much power? Let s start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts.

But he also said he was concerned about other issues, like data ownership and privacy, that involve tech giants but aren t necessarily covered by Warren s proposal.  There s a whole set of other issues that are less in the antitrust bucket,  he said.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juli\u00e1n Castro (D)</emphasis>, former HUD Secretary and mayor of San Antonio</h><p>Julian Castro said that Warren s plan was  worth considering.  However, he focused his comments more specifically toward antitrust enforcement at large and the power held by major tech companies without going into much detail.</p><p> I agree that we have to be much stronger in terms of antitrust enforcement,  he said.  I believe that we need to ask a lot more of people at the top in this country, and of wealthy corporations. I don t understand how Amazon made $11 billion in profit last year, paid no federal taxes, and at the same time, New York was about to offer them a $3 billion package to locate their second headquarters. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Hickenlooper (D)</emphasis>,former Colorado governor</h><p>John Hickenlooper came out positioning himself as a centrist when he announced his presidential bid, but he s also leaned into strengthening the enforcement of antitrust laws.</p><p> Right now it seems like we say, well, if we get down to [two or three] competitors, that s a competitive system. That s probably nonsense,  Hickenlooper said.</p><p>He also said he d like to see antitrust focus go beyond the tech giants.  What are the benefits to society when you have mergers of really large companies like these? Not just tech companies, but banks? It s in what we call  value capture,   he said.  It s the companies saying: Well, we don t need two HR teams, we ll lay these people off. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)</emphasis></h><p>Sen. Gillibrand has yet to comment on the issue. However, she did criticize Amazon s attempt to build a headquarters in the Long Island City neighborhood of New York City. The day after Amazon s announcement, Gillibrand responded saying,  One of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from the taxpayers while too many New York families struggle to make ends meet. </p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Website:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264252/presidential-candidates-breaking-up-big-tech-stance-warren-sanders-booker-klobuchar\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264252/presidential-candidates-breaking-up-big-tech-stance-warren-sanders-booker-klobuchar</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Makena Kelly<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecomp1299266</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNP-DVW1-JCTB-F1MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1532\"/><timeReceived>10:20 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Supporters cheered the decision as a victory for the free and open internet, where the deep pockets of big companies couldn't buy faster web speeds over struggling startups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, the issue has largely faded from the spotlight and has rarely come up on the presidential campaign trail. But internet policy experts say the FCC decision was far from the end of the story - and with just over 10 weeks until the election, time is running out for voters to ask the candidates to clarify their positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There are a number of unresolved issues surrounding net neutrality that are still going to be hot topics to be resolved by the next administration,\" said Doug Brake, a telecom policy analyst at the nonprofit Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.</p><p>What is net neutrality again? </p><p>Net neutrality rules, also known as \"open internet,\" prohibit internet service providers from favoring certain high-traffic websites, like Netflix and Amazon, by giving them greater bandwidth at the expense of smaller start-up companies. Advocates argue that it ensures an even playing field. An open internet also means banning fast lanes, which would allow ISPs like Verizon and AT&amp;T to pay extra to ensure smoother, speedier streaming for their users.</p><p>Internet companies have vowed to continue the fight against the regulation, pursuing it all the way to the Supreme Court if need be. This June, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected challenges to the net neutrality rules. The next president's administration, and the FCC, will face the colossal task of catching up to technology that evolves beyond its ability to regulate it.</p><p>Clinton would follow in Obama's footsteps on internet policy </p><p><person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>campaign website says she \"strongly supports the FCC decision under the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>to adopt strong network neutrality rules.\"</p><p>We have an obligation to protect an open internet and defend net neutrality: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/6CJVBl9j7e\">https://t.co/6CJVBl9j7e</url>&amp;mdash; <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>(@HillaryClinton) June 29, 2016 // </p><p>While she would be following in the <person><nameText>Obama administration's </nameText></person>footsteps, Clinton has her own decade-long record of supporting net neutrality. While serving as a New York senator, she co-sponsored the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, which sought to amend the 1934 Communications Act to ensure net neutrality.</p><p>\"The internet as we know it does not discriminate among its users,\" she said in 2006. \"It does not decide who can enter its marketplace and it does not pick which views can be heard and which ones silenced.\"</p><p>Ten years later, adopting tech sector-friendly policies is proving to be a smart fundraising strategy for the Democratic nominee. This week she wrapped up a fundraising tour that included several Silicon Valley hotspots. One of the events was hosted by Apple CEO Tim Cook, with tickets selling for $2,700 to $50,000.</p><p>Clinton has also worked broadband issues into her infrastructure platform.</p><p>\"By 2020, I want 100 percent of American households to have access to quality, affordable high-speed internet, no matter where they live,\" Clinton told supporters at a dinner in New Hampshire last November.</p><p>Trump - no policy yet, except for a tweet </p><p>The Republican nominee's position is unclear, but it's a reasonable assumption that he will line up with his party's opposition to net neutrality, which is seen as needless government regulation.</p><p>In fact, the only public acknowledgment of the issue from Donald Trump is a 2014 tweet weighing in on net neutrality when it dominated the headlines.</p><p>Obama's attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.&amp;mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014 // </p><p>\"Obama's attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target the conservative media,\" he tweeted. He was referring to the 1940s law requiring newscasters to report the news in a balanced manner, which was repealed in 1987. It's unclear what it has to do with net neutrality; open internet rules don't give the FCC the power to interfere with any political content, conservative or otherwise.</p><p>The Trump campaign did not respond to McClatchy's request for comment.</p><p>His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, co-sponsored the Internet Freedom Act in 2011, which sought to kill net neutrality by prohibiting the FCC \"from further regulating the internet.\" </p><p>EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE </p><p>EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM </p><p>The positions of Trump's opponents for the Republican nomination shed a bit more light on the party's opposition to open internet regulation.</p><p>Texas Sen. Ted Cruz famously called net neutrality \"Obamacare for the internet.\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said regulation of the internet was illogical.</p><p>\"While the FCC plan supposedly seeks to prevent ISPs from playing favorites, it does so by giving that power to another entity: government,\" Rubio wrote in an opinion piece for Politico in March. \"The answer to correcting injustice in an economy is to increase consumer power, not government power.\"</p><p>  var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push(['embed']); </p><p>EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM </p><p>The details of internet policy aside, there are other reasons the sector might not support Trump.</p><p>\"The tech community is full of immigrants who started their companies here, so many of them were founded by immigrants,\" said Marvin Ammori, a First Amendment lawyer well-known for his work on net neutrality issues who's general counsel for Hyperloop One, a tech company backed by Elon Musk that's working on an ultra-fast transit system. \"So if you're anti-immigrant you're not going to be popular in (Silicon) Valley. If you're anti-gay you're not going to be popular in the Valley. . . . So it does put Republicans at a disadvantage even if they're progressive on some tech issues.\"</p><p>How much does it matter to the internet's future who becomes president? </p><p>\"The president does matter,\" Ammori said, pointing out that the president's party gets to pick three of the five FCC commissioners, as well as appoint the solicitor general, who would defend the regulations in front of the Supreme Court - or not.</p><p><person><nameText>Trump and Clinton </nameText></person>go after each other for racism - Election RewindDonald Trump and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>attacked each other for being racist on Thursday, with Trump calling Clinton a bigot and Clinton saying Trump has a lot in common with white supremacists.</p><p>\"This (net neutrality) was a 3-2 vote, If you get another Republican in there they could undermine everything the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>has done,\" he said.</p><p>EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE </p><p>Despite the FCC decision, some ISPs are finding loopholes to go around net neutrality rules. For example, they might set monthly data limits for users but exempt certain apps or websites. This is known as \"zero rating,\" and some internet advocates argue it gives certain content preferential treatment. </p><p>\"These policies will have to evolve and change, and as carriers try to introduce new services and 'innovative pricing models,' what ends up happening is you always have to make sure it remains an even playing field,\" Ammori said.</p><p>One of the clearest examples is T-Mobile's unlimited streaming service \"Binge On.\" While it might seem like a good thing for consumers, some internet policy experts worry that while it's technically legal, its model infringes on net neutrality. Users are allowed to stream video without it counting toward their monthly data cap - but only as long as they stream from a select group of content providers.

Avigilon launched its initial public offering last November, raising about $25-million in the process.</p><p>It is the only company on the Toronto Stock Exchange to make an initial public offering in the previous two quarters, based on data from PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p>Smaller exchanges, such as the TSX Venture Exchange, see more activity, but most of that comes from junior mining and oil and gas operations. Such firms tend to be high risk operations that rely on capital markets for funding.</p><p>Brad Cherniak, a partner at Sapient Capital Partners, said that many factors in the past few years have pushed Canadian businesses away from listing publicly. Global economic uncertainty has certainly played a part, given the volatility that crises such as the turmoil in Europe have produced in the stock market.</p><p>But the realities behind going public have also changed in the past decade. Companies today take longer to prepare to go public, given the overwhelming amount of regulatory and shareholder scrutiny they face when listing on a stock exchange, he said.</p><p>\"There's a bigger and bigger requirement to disclose your strategy, basically disclose everything today,\" Mr. Cherniak said.</p><p>\"Companies are under severe pressure to be transparent, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but you have to tell the public to a greater degree than in the past what you're doing, what your vision is. All those things.\"</p><p>Changing trends in how growing businesses raise funds have also factored in to the IPO market, he said. For example, many startups today will look to selling their business to a larger competitor instead of listing, given the large sums many big tech firms have paid for quick growing startups in the past few years.</p><p>\"It's almost become a game of giants,\" Mr. Cherniak said.</p><p>Private equity funds have also moved into acquiring smaller companies, given a slowdown in the number of corporate mega-deals in the past few years. That has made them very active acquirers of companies that in the past would have been golden candidates for an initial public offering, Mr. Cherniak said.</p><p>But while there may seem to be a dearth of non-resource companies listing in Canada, Bill Demers, partner at Ernst &amp; Young and the firm's Canadian IPO leader, said the IPO market functions very much in cycles. Given the economic uncertainty prevailing in global stock markets, that has led to some companies delaying their decision.</p><p>\"When you look at it, there are a lot of companies waiting to go public, but they are waiting for the right time,\" he said,</p><p>Robert Deluce, chief executive of Porter Airlines Inc., for example, has cited poor market conditions as the main reason the upstart airline has not made an initial public offering yet.</p><p>Market conditions have cast a lot of worrisome outlooks for Canadian IPOs this year. The first quarter of 2012 was one of the weakest on record for companies in this country looking to raise capital on exchanges. A report last month from PricewaterhouseCoopers said that weakness has left the Canadian IPO market \"struggling for traction.\"</p><p>Tom Kloet, chief executive of TMX Group Inc., said the \"pipeline\" for listings looks good domestically and internationally. A slowdown in the first quarter was due to \"macro-economic facts,\" and does not reflect growing demand for capital at large and small companies or the amount of capital available to invest, he added.</p><p>But while IPOs may be sluggish now, Lawrence Wilder, partner and corporate securities lawyer with Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP, said it is important to remember that Canada still offers smaller companies a conducive environment to raising money in the capital markets.</p><p>The Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange maintain lower capital requirements to list than do those outside of Canada, allowing smaller firms to raise money more easily. That means an abundance of smaller cap firms here, and as well, investors who are more receptive to buying into such companies.</p><p>\"Contrast that to a place like the United States, where markets tend to only look at you and give you attention when you're north of $500-million - sometimes even more than that,\" he said.</p><p>For Avigilon, going public has been a huge success. The company raised $5-million for its investors by listing, and pulled in a further $20-million to help with product development and expanding into new markets.</p><p>Avigilon's target markets include Eastern Europe, where it recently opened a branch in Russia. Sales offices have also been established in Dubai, Mexico City and Johannesburg.</p><p>Since going public, sales have continued to grow at a phenomenal pace. In its most recent quarterly report, Avigilon posted revenue of $17.8million, a 77% increase from a year earlier.</p><p>\"I think it's a testament to the fact that no matter how bad things get in the markets, there's always an appetite for fast-growing companies with good opportunities,\" said Alexander Fernandes, president and chief executive of Avigilon.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jshmuel@nationalpost.com\">jshmuel@nationalpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Getty Images, Thinkstock/;

Here is the border of your property; here is the border of your body; here is the border of a city, a state, a nation - and to cross any of these boundaries without permission is to transgress. But one of the most significant boundary lines in our lives is not this way, and one piece of ubiquitous technology is making this line increasingly permeable and uncertain, at a cost that we may only be starting to comprehend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a thought experiment: where do you end? Not your body, but you, the nebulous identity you think of as your \"self\". Does it end at the limits of your physical form? Or does it include your voice, which can now be heard as far as outer space; your personal and behavioral data, which is spread out across the impossibly broad plane known as digital space; and your active online personas, which probably encompass dozens of different social media networks, text message conversations, and email exchanges?</p><p>This is a question with no clear answer, and, as the smartphone grows ever more essential to our daily lives, that border's only getting blurrier.</p><p>Michael Patrick Lynch, a professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut and director of the school's Humanities Institute, which promotes interdisciplinary research, says that the notion of an \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">extended self</url> \" was coined by the philosophers Andy Clark and David Chalmers in 1998.</p><p>\"They argued that, essentially, the mind and the self are extended to those devices that help us perform what we ordinarily think of as our cognitive tasks,\" Lynch says. This can include items as seemingly banal and analog as a piece of paper and a pen, which help us remember, a duty otherwise performed by the brain. According to this philosophy, the shopping list, for example, becomes part of our memory, the mind spilling out beyond the confines of our skull to encompass anything that helps it think.</p><p>\"Now if that thought is right, it's pretty clear that our minds have become even more radically extended than ever before,\" Lynch says. \"The idea that our self is expanding through our phones is plausible, and that's because our phones, and our digital devices generally - our smartwatches, our iPads - all these things have become a really intimate part of how we go about our daily lives. Intimate in the sense in which they're not only on our body, but we sleep with them, we wake up with them, and the air we breathe is filled, in both a literal and figurative sense, with the trails of ones and zeros that these devices leave behind.\"</p><p>This gets at one of the essential differences between a smartphone and a piece of paper, which is that our relationship with our phones is reciprocal: we not only put information into the device, we also receive information from it, and, in that sense, it shapes our lives far more actively than would, say, a shopping list. The shopping list isn't suggesting to us, based on algorithmic responses to our past and current shopping behavior, what we should buy; the phone is.</p><p>At the beginning of his recent book <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">The Internet of Us</url>, Lynch uses a thought experiment to illustrate how thin this boundary is. Imagine a device that could implant the functions of a smartphone directly into your brain so that your thoughts could control these functions. It would be a remarkable extension of the brain's abilities, but also, in a sense, it wouldn't be all that different from our current lives, in which the varied and almost limitless connective powers of the smartphone are with us nearly 100% of the time, even if they aren't - yet - a physiological part of us.</p><p>One of the biggest shifts is the undoing of a border that we used to perceive between the virtual and the physical world</p><p>  Moira Weigel    </p><p>According to data released in 2017 by the analytics firm Flurry, American consumers spent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">five hours per day</url> on their mobile devices, and showed a dizzying 69% year-over-year increase in time spent in apps like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The prevalence of apps represents a concrete example of the movement away from the old notion of accessing the Internet through a browser and the new reality of the connected world and its myriad elements - news, social media, entertainment - being with us all the time.</p><p>When Moira Weigel, a writer and junior fellow at Harvard University, was researching her book <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating</url>, she found that 2009, as the Facebook and Twitter mobile platforms were taking off and our social media identities became increasingly woven into our daily life, seemed to be a focal point in the transition away from separate notions of online and IRL (\"in real life\"). She points to online dating as a good example. Even if you hadn't met someone on an app, you wouldn't go out with them before checking out their Facebook profile or their Instagram. Our online identities had become a part of who we were in the world - whether we were aware of it or not.</p><p>\"In the 90s and even through the early 2000s, for many people, there was this way of thinking about cyberspace as a space that was somewhere else: it was in your computer. You went to your desktop to get there,\" Weigel says. \"One of the biggest shifts that's happened and that will continue to happen is the undoing of a border that we used to perceive between the virtual and the physical world.\"</p><p>                     The debate over what it means for us to be so connected all the time is still in its infancy, and there are wildly differing perspectives on what it could mean for us as a species. One result of these collapsing borders, however, is less ambiguous, and it's becoming a common subject of activism and advocacy among the technologically minded. While many of us think of the smartphone as a portal for accessing the outside world, the reciprocity of the device, as well as the larger pattern of our behavior online, means the portal goes the other way as well: it's a means for others to access us.</p><p>Most obviously, this can take the form of the omnipresent harassment that many people experience online, as well as more specific tactics, like revenge porn and the leaking of nude pictures; doxxing, or the revealing of someone's personal details; and swatting, the practice of calling a Swat team to an individual's home under false pretenses.</p><p>Less clear to most people, however, is the extent to which the companies that make the technology, apps, and browsers that we use are not just tracking but shaping our behavior. While this issue has recently come to the fore as a result of revelations like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">Cambridge Analytica</url> scandal, Weigel sees the unfettered access to our data, through our smartphone and browser use, of what she calls the big five tech companies - Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon - as a legitimate problem for notions of democracy. Thanks to the border-breaking nature of these technologies, and particularly the smartphone, the success of these companies has put an unfathomable amount of wealth, power, and direct influence on the consumer in the hands of just a few individuals - individuals who can affect billions of lives with a tweak in the code of their products.</p><p>\"This is where the fundamental democracy deficit comes from: you have this incredibly concentrated private power with zero transparency or democratic oversight or accountability, and then they have this unprecedented wealth of data about their users to work with,\" Weigel says. \"We've allowed these private companies to take over a lot of functions that we have historically thought of as public functions or social goods, like letting Google be the world's library. Democracy and the very concept of social goods - that tradition is so eroded in the United States that people were ready to let these private companies assume control.\"</p><p>                     Considering the magnitude of the iPhone's impact, it's hard to believe that it came out barely over a decade ago. But while the influence of both the phone itself and the tech revolution as a whole can often feel irresistible - look no further than those usage numbers - there are measures that could be taken to help shore up our crumbling borders.</p><p>Tim Hwang, a writer and researcher in San Francisco who used to work as the global public policy lead for artificial intelligence and machine learning at Google, has thought extensively about how these devices foster the functioning of the collective in addition to the individual. About a decade ago, he explains, the rhetoric around the Internet was that the crowd would prevent the spread of misinformation, filtering it out like a great big hive mind; it would also help to prevent the spread of things like hate speech. Obviously, this has not been the case, and even the relatively successful experiments in this, such as Wikipedia, have a great deal of human governance that allows them to function properly. He says that the pessimism resulting from this realization has led us to give power to the platforms so that they can regulate themselves - allowing Facebook to tell us what's true and what's not - but that there is another approach to the way we actually exist in these spaces.</p><p>\"Are there tools, are there designs we can put in place to allow communities to do a better job at self-governance?\" Hwang asks. \"Do we want to give more moderation to particular users? Does the platform want to grant users more power to control issues of harassment and hate speech, knowing that, in some cases, it might be over-applied?\"</p><p>Weigel sees two potential opportunities for limiting the amount of influence the big five has on consumers. The first would be legal; she cites a growing body of work exploring possible antitrust suits designed to break up these companies. Writing in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">Logic</url>, a magazine Weigel co-founded, K Sabeel Rahman, an associate professor of law at Brooklyn Law School who writes about inequality and democracy in the modern economy, compares these potential efforts to those that broke up the industrialists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \"Today, as technology creates new forms of power, we must also create new forms of countervailing civic power,\" Rahman writes. \"We must build a new civic infrastructure that imposes new kinds of checks and balances.\"</p><p>The other option is for workers, many having entered tech with idealistic rather than financial motives, to help regulate and restrict their own employers. Many have already begun to express regret over the effectiveness of their innovations, a phenomenon perhaps best exemplified by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">Center for Humane Technology</url>, led by the former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris. But Weigel views these efforts with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">suspicion</url> due to the idea that they often follow the same playbook as the paternalistic, top-down design infrastructure that created these problems in the first place.</p><p>A more fitting example of positive change, Weigel suggests, took place in June, when Google employees <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/iphone-apple-privacy-smartphones-extension-of-ourselves\">successfully campaigned</url> for the company to stop its work with the Pentagon on Project Maven, a program that improved the effectiveness of military drones.</p><p>\"Reading the New York Times, especially until about six months ago, whenever this tech backlash started, I feel like you could be forgiven for thinking there were five people in the tech industry,\" Weigel says, laughing. \"In fact, these are huge companies that employ tens of thousands of people, many of whom don't necessarily agree with everything the companies are doing. I think that engineers have enormous power to influence these companies for the better right now.\"</p><p>Lynch, the University of Connecticut philosophy professor, also believes that one of our best hopes comes from the bottom up, in the form of actually educating people about the products that they spend so much time using. We should know and be aware of how these companies work, how they track our behavior, and how they make recommendations to us based on our behavior and that of others. Essentially, we need to understand the fundamental difference between our behavior IRL and in the digital sphere - a difference that, despite the erosion of boundaries, still stands.</p><p>\"Whether we know it or not, the connections that we make on the Internet are being used to cultivate an identity for us - an identity that is then sold to us afterward,\" Lynch says. \"Google tells you what questions to ask, and then it gives you the answers to those questions.\"</p><p>And we should especially recognize this when it seems least clear: in those situations online that most closely seek to emulate the structures and dynamics of real life. Like, for example, your relationships.

Indeed, much of his second presidential campaign is dedicated to proving just how dissimilar he and the president are. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sanders is here to unify, the Vermont senator claims, whereas Trump is here to divide. His policies work for average, everyday Americans, whereas Trump\u2019s only help the upper class. And on and on. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But behind the mudslinging, Trump and Sanders share a populist appeal that differs more in structure than in substance. It\u2019s a similarity that pundits noticed in 2016 when Sanders first vied for the Democratic nomination. Both Trump and Sanders were fiery, outsider candidates who tapped into public discontentment by vowing to take on an out-of-touch establishment. Trump\u2019s election lent credibility to this sentiment. </p><p>As the electorate\u2019s frustration becomes more poignant, so toodoes the resemblance between the two candidates who know how to channel it. It\u2019s the horseshoe theory unfolding right before our eyes. Philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye theorized that the far left and far right are not opposite ends of a linear political continuum. Rather, the political spectrum is bent, like a horseshoe, and the extremists of each side stare across its narrow void. The more extreme the policy, the closer it is to the other side\u2019s. </p><p>Today\u2019s polarization has allowed both sides to dismiss this theory as unfair and inaccurate. But one look through Sanders\u2019s policies proves that perhaps it isn\u2019t that far off the mark after all. </p><p>At a Washington Post live event on Tuesday, Sanders railed against the corporate and political establishments. \u201cWe are taking on the establishment,\u201d he declared, which includes \u201cWall Street, the pharmaceutical companies, the top 1%, the corporations,\u201d who \u201caren\u2019t working for the American people.\u201d </p><p>On social media censorship, Sanders sounded shockingly familiar to many far-right conservatives who argue companies like Facebook and Google have too much sway. Sanders vowed to support \u201cvigorous\u201d antitrust laws that would break up big tech: \u201cThey determine who we communicate with,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey have too much incredible political power.\u201d </p><p>On trade: \u201cWe need trade policies that are fair for the American people, fair for poor people around the world, and not just designed to make the CEOs of multinational corporations even richer than they are today,\u201d Sanders said.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest difference between this election and the last is that instead of denying the similarity in rhetoric, Sanders is embracing it. \u201cA lot of people voted for Trump because they gave up on the political establishment,\u201d Sanders admitted. \u201cWell, I gave up on the political establishment a long time ago.\u201d </p><p>Of course, Sanders is doing all he can to distance himself from Trump\u2019s controversial statements and decisions, labeling him a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cbigot\u201d repeatedly. He has to. If he\u2019s going to win the Democratic nomination this time around, he must convince voters that he can take on Trump and win. But his strategy also includes setting himself as the real anti-establishment candidate who offers real solutions. Sanders will disparage Trump while using his similarities to Trump to his advantage, establishing himself as the only one who can offer definitive change. </p><p>For example: \u201cTrump promised to drain the swamp,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t. Instead, he brought in more billionaires than any other president in the history of the United States.\u201d </p><p>Sanders and Trump might be addressing interchangeable problems, but the solutions the self-identified Democratic socialist is offering are wildly different from Trump\u2019s. Sanders wants expansive government interference and regulation for just about everything: \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a high minimum wage, Wall Street regulation, student loan debt forgiveness \u2014 you name it. And Trump, to his credit, has actually reduced bureaucratic regulation. </p><p>We won\u2019t know exactly how Sanders\u2019s policies stack up to Trump\u2019s unless he wins the Democratic nomination, but recent polls indicate voters favor Trump\u2019s policies over Sanders\u2019: Roughly 7 out of 10 Americans report that they\u2019re satisfied with their private health insurance plans, and 51% approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy. </p><p>It\u2019s easy to dismiss Sanders as an unrealistic nut, but don\u2019t underestimate his appeal. After all, it\u2019s that very same outsider appeal that elevated Trump to the White House in 2016. And if Sanders is right about one thing, it\u2019s this: He was the Donald Trump of the Democratic Party before Donald Trump even thought about running for president.Story URLPhoto Caption:Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders delivers a speech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2258510583</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPV-2TH1-JBHT-D54N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Then he launched his own start-up, based at \"Silicon Roundabout\", a new hub of tech firms in east London. Bolstered by finance from the City, he resisted the lure of a foreign takeover, ultimately listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a plausible biography\u2014given the necessary addition of animal spirits\u2014but an imaginary one. Britain has no digital equivalent of the 18th-century industrial innovators who turned technology into commercial leadership. Its more recent prowess in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology has not been emulated in the digital sphere. <person><nameText>David Cameron's </nameText></person>government should ponder this failure and address the reasons for it. Luck is one of them, but so are national and European regulations and a tepid climate for entrepreneurs. </p><p>Britain has one of the biggest online economies. Its researchers invented both the web and the computer. It has the English language\u2014which helps to link it with California's Silicon Valley and Indian high-tech\u2014and great universities. There are thriving tech clusters in Bristol, London and elsewhere (see</p><p>). More so than other European countries, Britain should be competing with America as a tech leader. </p><p>Yet it has nurtured relatively few big tech companies and no huge ones. In particular, Britain has vanishingly few \"platform\" firms\u2014ie, the sort that, like Microsoft, Google or Facebook, have built and marketed a service or piece of software on which other businesses and applications rely. That is where the real money is: platforms tend to yield lots of jobs in spin-offs and ancillary enterprises. Britain has Autonomy, which makes specialised search software, and ARM, which designs the microchips for Apple's iPhones. Both are leaders in their fields, but neither is a giant. More damningly, they are the only two innovative tech outfits in the FTSE index of leading shares. </p><p>There should surely be more. Individual ideas and people are the key, obviously, but there are three problems with Britain's tech ecology that its government could ameliorate. One is the absence of a market as big and homogeneous as American tech firms enjoy. Another is a relative shortage of capital for start-ups and growing firms. The third is the lack of entrepreneurs who combine technological expertise, business acumen and the sort of balls that, in 2006, reputedly let Mark Zuckerberg turn down Yahoo!'s offer of $1 billion for Facebook.</p><p>Begin with the market. You might think that distance and geography would be marginal considerations for tech firms. You would be wrong. For American firms, a domestic market of 300m interconnected English-speaking consumers is a big advantage. Easy transatlantic communications should help British firms conquer that market; but they also encourage American firms to snap up promising British companies. Europe is fragmented not only by multiple languages but also by the lack of a properly common market in services, including digital ones, so tech firms must still overcome assorted legal and bureaucratic barriers to trade across the EU. Digital firms should be able to benefit from the single market just as mobile-phone companies such as Nokia and Vodafone have. Proper implementation across the union of the directive on liberalising the services market, passed in 2006, would be a start.</p><p>When it comes to finance, Britain lags not only Silicon Valley, where many entrepreneurs see investing in the next generation as a sort of moral responsibility. In 2010 high-tech firms in Israel attracted $1.3 billion in venture capital, nearly twice as much as in Britain, whose economy is ten times as big. George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, made some progress in his most recent budget by increasing the tax relief available for investors in start-ups. He should now look at the capital-gains tax regime: investors who make speculative bets and hit the jackpot should be able to keep and reinvest more of their winnings. Designing a system that rewards such risks but does not allow people to shelter their income from tax is tricky, but not impossible. It would help British businesspeople to think bigger, too: the absence of funding for growth is one reason some sell up at a relatively early stage. The 50% top income-tax rate creates further problems, by making it harder for entrepreneurs to recruit and retain the best people.</p><p>The gripe about Britain being poor at gestating bold entrepreneurs is an old one: the stereotype is of boffins who are good at generating ideas, but lose out to thrusting Americans when it comes to monetising them. There would be less truth in that caricature if British graduates in disciplines such as science and engineering gained some familiarity with business as part of their studies (it is noteworthy that the best British universities discourage students from earning money while they learn, while at American ones most are obliged to).</p><p>The government should be more relaxed about bolstering the supply of indigenous entrepreneurs with foreigners, as well as about admitting more workers with technical and commercial skills that are in short supply. Beneath its wrongheaded, headline goal to slash net immigration, the government has sensibly made sure that a route remains open for entrepreneurs. The trouble is, it is not always obvious which would-be newcomer will end up striking gold: when a six-year-old Sergey Brin emigrated from Russia to America with his family, it was not yet clear that he would one day co-found Google. By cutting the numbers of foreign students it allows in, current immigration policy is shrinking the commercial pool as well as the academic one. London is a magnet for creative types everywhere; capitalise on that\u2014and let more of them in. </p><p>Mr Cameron is keen on the tech industry, seeing it as a source of growth in lean times, and a way of weaning the economy off its dependence on flighty finance. Should our imaginary tech superstar materialise, it would be a shame if Britain's <person><nameText>Bill Gates </nameText></person>were turned away at the border, or left Britain of his own accord for another country where his talents would be more generously nurtured and rewarded. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-6C2EBA1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53G7-YM21-DY2R-23RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

China's leading search engine Baidu has just warned that revenues for the first quarter would decline by 5 to 13 per cent compared with a year ago. Herman Yu, Baidu\u2019s chief financial officer said:\u00a0\u201cMost shops, restaurants and malls across China were closed down\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so consequently the rebound for online marketing after the Chinese new year has been slow this year.\u201d Baidu makes three-quarters of its revenues from advertising but\u00a0 Lex comments there is some hope\u00a0in its\u00a0video unit iQiyi, China\u2019s Netflix rival. Last quarter, subscription revenues rose more than a fifth.\u00a0</p><p>Chinese start-ups are also suffering, reports our Beijing team, with the\u00a0outbreak cutting off their access to funding. Already enduring a \u201ccapital winter\u201d that began last year as a venture capital boom turned into a bust, they have now been hit by most face-to-face meetings with investors being put on hold.\u00a0\u201cA lot of VCs actually stopped bringing new deals to their investment committees because they can\u2019t really meet and get the feel of [start-up] founders,\u201d said Zhao Chen, managing partner of the start-up accelerator Plug and Play China.</p><p>Some emerging technologies are proving their worth though in the fight against the virus, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globaldata.com/emerging-technologies-proving-worth-in-fight-against-coronavirus-in-china-says-globaldata/\"> according to the GlobalData research firm</url>. Examples:\u00a0Canadian start-up BlueDot used AI on\u00a0news reports, social media platforms and Chinese government documents to predict the outbreak before it was announced. Robot developer TMiRob deployed 10 disinfection robots across wards in major hospitals in Wuhan. The start-up Antwork is using drones to deliver medical supplies in\u00a0Zhejiang province.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets are tanking again today and Richard Waters, in his Inside Business column, says coronavirus has been the catalyst for the kind of pause in the upward march of Big Tech that was starting to look overdue.

Door closing for DoorDash</emphasis><br/>\u00a0Filing for\u00a0an\u00a0 initial public offering \u00a0is a gutsy move by the lossmaking SoftBank-backed start-up, given Wall Street is gripped by coronavirus fears, says Lex. But as funding dries up, it needs the capital to fight the likes of Uber Eats, Grubhub and Postmates in the low-margin, cash-intensive food delivery fight. Meanwhile, Amy Lewin has cooked up an analysis on the state of food, grocery and meal-kit delivery in Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Putting papal values on AI</emphasis><br/>IBM and Microsoft have signed an\u00a0\u201cethical resolution\u201d with the Vatican to develop artificial intelligence in a way that will protect the planet and human rights. The \u201cRome Call for AI Ethics\u201d, presented to Pope Francis on Friday, calls for AI to safeguard the rights of all humankind, particularly the weak and underprivileged, and for new regulations in fields such as facial recognition.

The first two \u2014 money and technology \u2014 are being tackled with zeal. The third challenge is harder: how should countries regulate their airspace so that vast fleets of drones and flying vehicles can operate safely?

In the last three years, major media and communications companies have announced mergers that have led, or will lead, to executive staffing shake-ups, layoffs, and other changes. Many of this election cycle's Democratic presidential candidates have spoken out against the growing list of bipartite media behemoths, issuing letter after letter and statement after statement predicting negative outcomes. Here's what the candidates have said about three of the consolidations that have taken place since 2016, when AT...nd Time Warner first proposed a merger.AT...ime WarnerAT...nd Time Warner first proposed a merger in late October 2016[1], just a month before the presidential election. </p><p>Trump, still a candidate at the time, said that he would block the merger at a campaign rally because it was 'too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,' according to Vox.[2] (The New Yorker's Jane Mayer later reported[3] that Trump's attempted interventions into the merger were likely in retaliation against CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, and that months before the Department of Justice sued[4] to block the merger, Trump had directed his then-Chief of Staff John Kelly to pressure the DOJ to file the lawsuit.) Also Read: CBS and AT...nd Carriage Spat, Agree to New Distribution Deal[5] How did the current Democratic presidential candidates react?Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard responded on Twitter[6] a few days after the announcement, stating that the proposed plan was a 'bad deal for the American people,' and that 'bigger is not always better.' Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called on 'the administration' to 'kill' the merger to avoid 'higher prices and fewer choices for the American people' in a tweet[7]. The following month, the DOJ filed a lawsuit[8] against the companies to block the merger, citing antitrust laws. By February 2017, after the Senate Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee held a hearing[9] on the proposed merger in December 2016, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 a ranking member of the subcommittee \u2014 sent a letter to the DOJ's Attorney General Jeff Sessions,[10] outlining how the department should review the AT...ime Warner deal. And in June 2017, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Sanders [11]sent a different letter[12] to Sessions, urging that the DOJ again 'closely scrutinize' the then-proposed acquisition. By May 2018, the situation became further convoluted when the Washington Post reported[13] that AT...ad paid the consulting company of Michael Cohen, Trump's then-personal lawyer, nearly $600,000 for 'insights' into understanding the Trump administration. Warren sent a letter[14] to AT... CEO in response, requesting that he answer a number of questions about the payments amidst concerns 'about corruption and whether AT...[Cohen's consulting company], and the Trump Administration were engaged in a pay-for-play operation.' Also Read: AT...eets Q2 Earnings Mark as WarnerMedia Growth Offsets TV Subscriber Losses[15] 'AT...ad a significant financial interest in whether the Department of Justice would contest the proposed merger with Time Warner, whether the Federal Communications Commission would overturn net neutrality rules, and whether the Administration would push a tax plan that gave huge breaks to corporations like AT... the letter[16] said. Despite the protestations, the merger was ultimately upheld in June[17] following a ruling from a federal judge. Though the decision was a major defeat for the DOJ, the department chose not to pursue further litigation[18] and allow the merger to move forward.T-Mobile-SprintIn April 2018, T-Mobile's CEO, John Legere, released a video[19] with Marcelo Claure, Sprint's chief executive, to announce their plans to merge their respective companies. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee first shared his optimism[20] for the then-proposed merger that same day, citing the potential new jobs that would be created in his state, where T-Mobile is headquartered. (Inslee announced his presidential candidacy almost a year later.) Also Read: Sprint and T-Mobile's $26 Billion Merger Approved by Justice Department[21] The companies submitted a formal application to the Federal Communications Commission to approve the $26 billion deal by June 2018. But the following year, in February, several senators \u2014 including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Warren, Sanders, and Booker \u2014 raised alarms to both the Department of Justice's antitrust division[22] and the FCC[23] to request that the two entities reject the proposed merger. 'For more than 30 years, our enforcers have understood that fostering robust competition in telecommunications markets is the best way to provide every American with access to high-quality, cutting-edge communications at a reasonable price,' read the two letters, addressed separately to Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. 'This merger will turn the clock back, returning Americans to the dark days of heavily consolidated markets and less competition, with all of the resulting harms.' Sanders followed up the joint letter a day later with a Facebook post describing[24] the merger as representing a 'gross concentration of power that runs counter to the public good.' Also Read: ViacomCBS Merger Caps Hollywood's 'Eat or Get Eaten' Consolidation Era[25] Three months later, following concerns over a report[26] that senior White House officials were in favor of the merger, Booker, Klobuchar, and Warren sent a letter[27] to Delrahim, reiterating that the DOJ's decision on whether to allow a T-Mobile-Sprint merger should be free of 'improper political influence.' The backlash escalated in June when several state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit[28] against T-Mobile, Sprint, and their respective parent companies, to block the merger. But by late July, Pai[29] and the DOJ essentially approved[30] the merger as long as Sprint services like Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Sprint prepaid were divested to the TV satellite provider Dish, with the idea being that Dish's new offerings would make up for Sprint's absence. Still, several senators and now-presidential candidates continued to fight back against the merger. Booker issued a statement[31] on the same day as the DOJ's approval, arguing that the merger 'will have harmful and long-lasting effects on workers and consumers who will now likely pay higher prices for worse service with fewer offerings' and that he was skeptical of how the wireless service would improve for rural consumers, as the companies have claimed. Also Read: New Poll Finds 92% of Americans Are Worried Mergers Will Lead to Biased News[32] Julin Castro, formersecretary of Housing and Urban Development, spoke out that same day on Twitter[33] and said the merger 'benefits business and hurts consumers \u2014 particularly low-income consumers.'Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio extended his 'condolences[34]' on the same platform for T-Mobile and Sprint subscribers. And earlier this month, Klobuchar, Warren, Booker, and Gillibrand sent another letter[35] to Pai \u2014 who was first nominated to the FCC under the Obama administration and designated as chairman under Trump's \u2014 urging that the FCC 'issue a public notice and seek public comment' to determine whether a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint would be in the public interest. 'We have serious concerns that the terms of the settlement may prove insufficient to protect competition, innovation, and the public interest,' the letter said. 'We remain concerned about the lack of transparency in the FCC's merger review process and the lack of certainty on whether this merger will protect competition and consumers.'Viacom-CBSAfter years of speculation, media giants Viacom and CBS announced last Tuesday that the companies were merging[36] to become the $28 billion 'ViacomCBS.' (The long-linked companies last split in 2006.) On the day of the announcement, Warren tweeted[37] that ViacomCBS was a deal that raised 'serious concerns for consumers, employees, and the entire sector.' The following day,Sanders sent an email to his campaign supporters[38] to explain his critique of corporate media and news organizations, where he touched upon ViacomCBS and other recent media consolidations. Also Read: Bob Bakish to Earn More Than $31 Million as ViacomCBS CEO[39] 'Today, as a result of massive mergers and takeovers, only a few larger corporations like Verizon, AT...Comcast, Fox, Disney, Viacom, and CBS control the vast majority of what we see, hear, and read. And there is news that Viacom and CBS want to merge next,' Sanders wrote. 'This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy. Because in case you haven't heard, these corporations have an agenda that serves their bottom line.'What about the other candidates?The candidates who haven't explicitly addressed the above media mergers have spoken more broadly about antitrust issues in the tech world, particularly when it comes to companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. According to a roundup of candidate views by Politico[40], 10 candidates \u2014 including former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Klobuchar, and Castro \u2014 say they need to see more federal antitrust investigations before determining whether to break up those companies. Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has said that regulators need more resources before they can begin investigations, while entrepreneur Andrew Yang said that those companies could break themselves up, though that wouldn't necessarily solve all current problems. Meanwhile, candidates like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Gillibrand have called for stronger regulations on large tech companies, while author and activist Marianne Williamson joined Warren, Sanders, Gabbard, and de Blasio, who said they would want to break those companies up. Also Read: Why ViacomCBS Might Still Be Too Small[41] In an interview with Axios[42] last November, Trump said that his government was looking into antitrust investigations, but also defended the companies from the European Union's regulatory fines. 'I'm not looking to hurt these companies, I'm looking to help them,' he said in the interview. 'As far as antitrust is concerned, we'll have to take a look at that but I want them to do well. I want Amazon to do well. I want Google to do well. I want Facebook \u2014 I want all of 'em to do [well] \u2014 these are great companies.'Related stories from TheWrap: Bob Bakish to Earn More Than $31 Million as ViacomCBS CEO[43]Can ViacomCBS' 5

Inevitably, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/retail-investors-hunt-risk-in-rush-to-trade-asic-20200506-p54q9t\">speed and volatility</url> of the adjustment made it hard to carefully consider what should be sold and bought.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imagine that the bulk of the holdings had been in sectors such as food retailing, food and beverage manufacture, household and personal products, biotechnology, telecommunications and IT.</p><p>This eclectic mix would have held up relatively well. While it is not a cohesive mix, it has a bent to lower-growth companies that, on aggregate, tend to match the rate of economic growth. It's doubtful many would have considered this an optimal mix in the heyday of 2019.</p><p>On the other side of the ledger have been the hard-hit sectors of consumer services and durables, real estate trusts, insurance and retail. Once again, there is nothing to build a picture around these sectors as a group. But within them there were stocks that had long been favoured by the market representing attractive themes such as travel or media and consumer brand preferences that had shown their capacity to maintain their status - Nike, for example.</p><p>Equity managers are now in a game of probabilities and scenario modelling. Does one resist the call to realise stocks that have been beaten up on the basis they have been dealt a bad hand and it will pass, or slide into the relatively safety of the sectors that are less affected? Valuations of defensive stocks are unappealing to growth managers, while the earnings certainty in the other sectors is low.</p><p>Yet the leadership of growth is narrowing. There are plenty of charts showing that Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Facebook and Microsoft have accounted for all of the recovery in the S&amp;P 500. To be fair, they and a few others have been the predominant cause of the outperformance of the US market for the past four years.</p><p>Yet they are not without challenges. Valuation is one - and never ignore the regulatory cloud - while many are dependent on consumer and advertising trends, which may change in coming years.</p><p>Fund managers may capitulate and include these stocks in a portfolio regardless of their stated process, as the risk of underperforming and losing clients is too great. Overcharging for this momentum-driven fixation is inappropriate, as some do via high and, even more egregiously, performance fees.</p><p>The real money is in those that can achieve satisfactory outcomes without the herd mentality. To cut to the chase, one can these days hold big tech stocks without fees and then find a complementary fund manager with companies that don't have the same profile yet are in a similar growth theme.</p><p>This path assumes the nature of companies that dominated the past 10 years will be those that do now, which comes back to the debate on what a global equity portfolio should look like at present.</p><p>Lost souls of the past decade yearn for the return of value stocks. The characteristics are low price-to-book and price-to-sales ratios with relatively higher dividend yields and lower price to earnings. It's not hard to spot the flaws in these ratios and most so-called value investors have a much more intricate view of value, yet it has been clear the investment universe at large has been reluctant to take on strategies that rely on turnarounds or a change in sentiment.</p><p>Big downturns in equity markets have often been associated with a regime change in leadership. The temporal resilient nature of old-fashioned companies such as supermarkets sits at odds with what we have assumed will be future trends.</p><p>Is healthcare and biotech the new information technology? The resurgence of attention to this sector is easy to understand but, akin to IT, a small handful are likely winners with many more failing. The over-reaching hand of governments is a new reality, which - unlike the unfolding of IT into everyday activity - will cast a shadow over such a sector.</p><p>Equity portfolios in terms of sector exposure, dressed up as pure stock selection, have been a feature of recent years. Yet investors are told to diversify, implicitly tolerating some component underperformance which will be redeemed under alternative scenarios. An equity portfolio that claims to capture all conditions is belying reality. Traditional roles of growth and defensive equity allocations are appropriate even within changing circumstances.</p><p>Expectations that funds do magic tricks by changing positions in weeks underplay the complexity of what we have seen. Nonetheless, an evolution is appropriate and it is incumbent on the manager to give a coherent rationale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520274297</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YW5-GKJ1-DY19-C2T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>10:44 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They stopped to face the rays, knees bent, palms open at their sides, eyes closed. After several moments of silent contemplation, the reverie ended and they went on their way. Scenes like this happen a lot at 1440 Multiversity, a luxury retreat in Scotts Valley full of babbling brooks, bearded gurus and \"wellness\". Lots of wellness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The centre, nestled in 75 acres of a former bible college, is the brainchild of Scott Kriens, a tech executive who made a fortune helping to build the internet.</p><p>He set up Juniper Networks, a maker of hardware, with several colleagues in 1996 and ran it for a dozen years. In 2017, he and his wife opened 1440 on the doorstep of Silicon Valley, just as the web's darker elements were coming to light. Their hope? That the campus will become a spiritual laboratory - a mountain refuge where tech's luminaries can tune out from the chaos they have unleashed, and consider how best to fix it.</p><p>Kriens said: \"Sometimes, the best way to go faster is to slow down.\" At a time when breaking up Big Tech has become a ticket for presidential hopefuls, 1440's arrival seems apt. \"I have huge respect for being in the right place at the right time,\" said Kriens. \"We've had a lot of support and participation from a lot of names you'd recognise in the Valley.\"</p><p>The site, which offers courses such as \"Awakening to your life purpose\", is a sign of the existential crisis at ground zero of the tech revolution. Executives are reckoning with creations that have altered how people communicate, meet, mate, vote and feel about themselves.</p><p>The phenomenon is not limited to tech.</p><p>The Business Roundtable, a group representing 181 of America's top companies, last week rejected its core tenet since the 1990s: that the purpose of a corporation is to make profits for shareholders. The new mandate includes paying fair wages, protecting the environment and treating suppliers fairly. The sudden bout of \"wokeness\" at corporate titans - signatories included Jamie Dimon, head of JP Morgan - was dismissed by many as a publicity stunt. Yet the sentiment it sought to head off - that there is a deep flaw in the system, which regulators and the public are waking up to - is palpable in Silicon Valley. Sydney Mintz, a rabbi at San Francisco's Emanu-El synagogue, gestured towards some smartphones wrapped in black bags, arrayed around an altar with a flickering electric candle. \"They're resting right now,\" she said. \"And what we're doing is having full faith that when we turn them on, things are going to be fine.\"</p><p>Mintz travelled to 1440 to help lead Tech-Free Shabbat, a course based on the Jewish period of rest. Instead of a break from work, the course calls for a break from tech - 25 hours without a screen.</p><p>\"Technologies have been challenging Shabbat for the past 4,000 years,\" Mintz said. \"This is just the next iteration. It is the most powerful challenge because it's so pervasive and invasive. I'm not antitech at all, but in order for us to retain our humanity, and our essence, we have to cease from technology for a period of time. This ancient wisdom isn't just for the Jews anymore.\"</p><p>The idea for this iteration of that ancient wisdom started a decade ago, in the house of Tiffany Shlain. A film-maker and co-founder of the Webby Awards, she instituted the policy with her husband and two daughters. \"It's the best thing I've ever done - individually or as a parent. I race towards these days off,\" Shlain said. \"I feel we've created a society that has no room for reflection.\"</p><p>Sprinklings of this shift have begun to appear in \"screen time\" apps - from Apple, Google and Facebook - that let users track and reduce device use. Shlain's method is blunter, addressing the difficulty of having a phone but not instinctively reaching for it at all hours.</p><p>Tristan Harris, founder of the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco, saw how what he calls the \"attention economy\" was built. A decade ago, he studied at Stanford University's Persuasive Technology Lab, learning the \"full stack\" of tactics to tweak behaviour, from clicker training for dogs to Las Vegas slot machines. One of his classmates was Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram. \"We weren't learning persuasive technology to manipulate people,\" Harris said. \"But of course ... this whole discipline got co-opted into what would be really good at hijacking people's psychology to get them looking at things on screens.\"</p><p>Kriens, 61, is hopeful that 1440, where a giant redwood tree or glass of crystal-infused water is always in reach, may help Silicon Valley reorient itself. He said: \"To the degree we can affect leaders, it's the greatest upstream leverage that I know.\"</p><p>On the weekend The Sunday Times visited, a group from Google had commandeered a large portion of the campus. So has Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg used one of the $700-a-night suites? Or indulged in the \"Soul Shift\" course? Kriens declined to respond directly: \"We've had a lot of interesting guests.\"</p><p>He added: \"These are tough problems, and we're trying to harness something that is more powerful than we know.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>1440 Multiversity, where highpowered guests are encouraged to see the world beyond their screens</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-152306443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWR-NST1-JCBW-N2W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 25, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002KE2</classCode><className>JUNIPER NETWORKS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

The consensus view that the global and UK economy would avoid recession in 2019 proved correct \u2014 just \u2014\u00a0 although the slow pace of economic growth remains a worry for investors.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2020, our experts are more optimistic, even though trade deals, trade wars and next year\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/us-presidential-election\">US election</url> mean political uncertainty will still be hanging over markets. </p><p>Last year\u2019s panel predicted the UK would end the year with a different prime minister and that unloved UK stocks would stage a comeback \u2014 although the fabled \u201cBoris bounce\u201d was a long time coming.</p><p>How much\u00a0\u201cbounce back\u201d is left for the UK in 2020 remains a moot point. This year\u2019s panel all agreed that investors around the world will have to be far more selective in their hunt for returns as new threats appear on the horizon \u2014 climate change, protectionism and liquidity risk.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Our panel of experts was:\u00a0Jonathan Guthrie, the FT\u2019s head of Lex; Chris Giles, the FT\u2019s economics editor; Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International; Simon Edelsten, fund manager at Artemis; Abbie Llewellyn-Waters, global equities fund manager at Jupiter; and Mark Nash, head of global bonds at Merian Global Investors.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOMO (fear of missing out) was the acronym the panel chose one year ago to sum up the likely dilemma for investors in 2019. What could it be in 2020?</emphasis>\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Maike Currie:</emphasis> The best suggestion I\u2019ve heard is IMF \u2014 it\u2019s mostly fiscal. With a bit of a nod to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82d59c4e-0224-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47\"> Christine Lagarde</url>, who is now president of the European Central Bank and has called for fiscal expansion, monetary policy is running out of road. We need to see fiscal growth in the UK, Europe, US and Japan. The biggest risk for investors is that central bank policies will fail to generate growth, bearing in mind that interest rates are already turning negative and that governments will also shy away from fiscal stimulus.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Giles:</emphasis>\u00a0The global economy avoided recession in 2019, but we\u2019ve had the slowest global growth since the financial crisis \u2014 largely due to the trade war. US-China tensions are not resolved, but they\u2019re no longer\u00a0deteriorating. That said, manufacturing and industrial companies have been the most troubled sectors this year, and I expect they will still hold off investing next year. There\u2019s a bit more confidence around, but in global terms, I think GDP growth of 3.5 per cent is the best investors can hope for.</p><p>As for the UK, it\u2019s another year of slow growth, but I don\u2019t think Brexit will have a huge effect until nearer the end of 2020. I don\u2019t see a tidal wave of business investment, but I don\u2019t see calamity \u2014 just a holding pattern. It\u2019s perfectly possible we\u2019ll get a rate cut from the Bank of England in 2020, but I think they\u2019ll wait to see the fiscal impact of the new government\u2019s agenda first. February\u2019s Budget will consist of a very long list of capital projects.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon Edelsten:</emphasis> The word I would use to sum up the year ahead is relief. Only a few months ago when the yield curve inverted, people were saying we were going to hell in a hand basket, but the level of panic is not supported by the evidence. New car registrations in France are picking up, as are house sales in the US \u2014 and I\u2019d expect the British property market to pick up too following the election result. Whether you voted leave or remain, seeing a UK government in place for five years (and maybe even 10) means some of the uncertainty is going away. This will ease some of the tension for boards who have delayed investment spending decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jonathan Guthrie: </emphasis>An acronym that investors cannot ignore in 2020 is ESG [environmental, social and governance] \u2014 the Lex team\u2019s more exciting summary is\u00a0\u201cGreta Expectations\u201d as the climate change debate starts to impact on company balance sheets. What we will see is further erosion of the value of big oil companies. Given the rise in the oil price, the oil companies have not had the kind of share price bump you\u2019d expect.\u00a0They have enormous stranded assets, because they\u2019ve got a lot of hydrocarbons in the ground that they can\u2019t pump out or dig out without trashing the climate.</p><p>The US is likely to be weaker than expected, but we\u2019re sanguine about China. Since 2000, economists have predicted 19 out of the last zero-debt crises \u2014 the main Chinese banks will be fine.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mark Nash:</emphasis> It feels like we\u2019re in a mid-cycle correction, not an end of cycle situation. The US Federal Reserve has been slow and reluctant to cut rates this year, so the dollar has remained strong. When you consider that emerging markets are now 60 per cent of global GDP, you can see how dollar strength has put a brake on the global economy. My sense is that the Fed has now probably done enough; if the dollar weakens, this should ignite more positivity and reflation for the global economy and also for commodity prices.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Which sectors and stocks hold the most potential in the year ahead?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jonathan:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d776a75c-4368-4207-b33f-dd75a2062e1b\"> Cinema stocks</url> have been bashed by the rise of streaming and gaming, but this is one area where the Lex team thinks the correction has gone too far. The grocers are another \u2014 they\u2019re not going to be killed by Amazon in the way that some people think, which has been propelling       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ce6992c-8b75-4f88-8b08-2002333baaaf\"> Ocado.</url>\u00a0</p><p>We think very large car companies such as Toyota and Volkswagen are over-discounted, and that activists breaking up industrial conglomerates in Europe could unlock quite a lot of value.\u00a0</p><p>And move over tech bros \u2014 my US Lex colleague Elaine Moore sees a big opportunity for\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/364e704a-9cb6-11e9-9c06-a4640c9feebb\"> \u201cfemtech\u201d</url> apps based on female health and fertility.</p><p>We are bearish about oil, European banks, and we dislike any proposition which is based on the upward revaluation of assets rather than the production of cash flow. Burford and SoftBank have already come a cropper; I think there will be more to come in 2020.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon:\u00a0</emphasis>A few weeks ago, you could have said the UK market had great potential \u2014 but it has already repriced. The housebuilders have moved an incredibly long way.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris:</emphasis> So you think the Boris bounce is done?\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon:</emphasis> I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but investors have to take a stock by stock approach. An awful lot of British businesses have gone bust in 2019 and some of the biggest British companies are in oil. Sitting in trackers is likely to be dangerous.\u00a0</p><p>Where we see opportunities include managing wind farms, but also the industrial automation sector. The trade war has held back demand, but that pressure could now ease.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Abbie Llewellyn-Waters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">:</emphasis> Two sustainable investment themes that interest me are preventive healthcare \u2014 looking beyond the big pharma companies to diagnostics and vaccines \u2014 and financial inclusion. There are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jupiteram.com/UK/en/Institutional-Investors/Insights/Abbie-Llewellyn-Waters/Abbie-Llewellyn-Waters-What-is-financial-inclusion-UK-Institutional-July-2019\"> 1.7bn people worldwide</url> who still don\u2019t have access to a bank account. Some 70 per cent of all consumer transactions around the world are still done in cash. Creating access to financial services is a massive growth opportunity.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Maike:\u00a0</emphasis>We\u2019ve already mentioned the surge of interest in ESG investing, but we\u2019re moving towards a broader definition of what makes a sustainable investment. For example, cyber security is a huge risk for businesses, but it isn\u2019t covered by standard definitions of ESG. Disruptive tech is another one, and that\u2019s shortening the life of companies.\u00a0Amazon will destroy your business far quicker than Brexit. The science behind rating systems and scoring remains erratic, but the increased focus should hopefully raise standards.\u00a0</p><p>More generally, there has been talk of a rotation from growth into value investing for some time \u2014 but for that to happen, you\u2019ve got to believe that we\u2019re at the beginning of an upward cycle. I don\u2019t think we are.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In 2020, how much could political developments alter the investment outlook?\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon:</emphasis> As the Brexit negotiations restart, any early mention of the words\u00a0\u201cno deal\u201d could cause quite a shock.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris: </emphasis>The most important lesson is not to say silly things like\u00a0\u201cwe\u2019re keeping our cards close to our chest\u201d when everyone realised the UK didn\u2019t even know what was written on those cards. It\u2019s all about trade-offs and both the EU and the UK will have to decide winners and losers within their own jurisdictions. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019ve just won a majority to stuff certain interest groups, because you\u2019re not going to have to face the electorate. But still they can be very powerful when people hurt.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jonathan:</emphasis> Looking ahead to February\u2019s Budget, it seems quite unlikely that the wealthy will be taxed hard by an Old Etonian prime minister \u2014 despite his new fan base in the north of England.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris:</emphasis> I agree that a general attack on the wealthy is not going to happen, but high-end housing in London could be the one exception. London is not an area where the Tories are getting their votes, and it would go down very well outside the capital.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon:\u00a0</emphasis>As for the US election, like it or not, Trump\u2019s a shoo-in. He\u2019s getting less dangerous, in terms of tweets hitting the market. His re-election could bring more relief to markets, as Wall Street will know who they are dealing with.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Maike: </emphasis>Domestic and international politics will remain a big risk to the investment outlook. With protectionism on the rise globally, trade disputes will be an ongoing international conflict. It\u2019s not just about the US and China. There\u2019s South Korea and Japan \u2014 economic and strategic allies of the US. And Brexit, of course, is an example of protectionism in Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are the biggest potential threats for investors?\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Abbie:</emphasis> The market has completely mispriced carbon risk. Taxing carbon emissions is not an if, but when. Corporations that understand these risks have already sought to mitigate them by decarbonising where they can. We could get a cash cost of carbon much more quickly than investors are anticipating because corporations are leading the change, not policymakers. </p><p>If carbon becomes a cash cost in the form of taxation, we also run significant inflation risk, which could have a big impact on global growth estimates, [and] loan book default risk across the financial markets, including at investment banks as well as central banks.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jonathan: </emphasis>Over the past year or so, subjects being debated at climate summits are becoming matters for financial markets. Oil explorers are collapsing as the cost of capital is extremely high \u2014 they just can\u2019t get finance.\u00a0A Lex colleague went to an oil conference in Aberdeen recently, and described it as a reverse seance \u2014 the dead joining hands and trying to contact the living.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon: </emphasis>The speed at which the agenda changes is faster than most businesses can cope with. Consumers are driving this too \u2014 we\u2019re already seeing sales of plastic bottles falling. Investors can get very excited about these themes at a stock level, but it will impact companies\u2019 costs rather than revenues for a while.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Abbie: </emphasis>There are opportunities for the companies that get ahead, identify the risks and change their business model. Inequality risk is another issue that should concern investors \u2014 there\u2019s a \u00a32.5bn <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73dd0976-83d4-11e9-b592-5fe435b57a3b\"> equal pay suit</url> looming for Tesco, and several big tech companies have recently been named in a lawsuit seeking damages after the deaths of children in the Congo who were       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-50812616\"> mining cobalt</url>, a core material in lithium-ion batteries.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris:</emphasis> Even if the trade side of global relations eases, there is still toxicity in the tax side \u2014 particularly the tech taxes proposed by France and the UK which are making the US very cross. We could be heading for the Wild West of global taxation.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jonathan:</emphasis> When reading company filings next year, another area investors should watch is finance directors who think up groovy new definitions of profits to make the chief executive look good, when the actual statutory numbers aren\u2019t doing so well.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liquidity \u2014 or rather the lack of it \u2014 has been a key theme this year. How could this develop in 2020?\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Maike:</emphasis>\u00a0This problem isn\u2019t going to go away. The frictionless flow of capital across markets is under threat from the trade war, and potentially any tax war. Retail investors find liquidity risk hard to fully understand.\u00a0It\u2019s not a constant, it changes. I fear that more risk warnings from regulators will just be seen as wallpaper.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon:</emphasis> The Financial Conduct Authority will require us to tell investors how much of our funds we can liquidate within a day, within a month \u2014 so it\u2019s possible to model this. You can only use the past as your guide, but it tends to be property funds and corporate bond funds that are hard to liquidate in crashes \u2014 global equities are OK.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Maike:</emphasis> Retail investors in Neil Woodford\u2019s funds didn\u2019t expect liquidity risks \u2014 and the irony with Woodford is that he was the one fund manager who listed all of his holdings online. He didn\u2019t hide the fact that he was investing in these illiquid stakes, but retail investors don\u2019t have that level of knowledge \u2014 hence why they outsource investment decisions to fund managers.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon:\u00a0</emphasis>I think everyone wants to keep the reputation of this industry as high as possible and many investors have cause to feel let down this year. In 2020, I think we will see a much higher level of disclosure and fund managers doing more to communicate in simple and clearer terms that investors can understand. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mark:\u00a0</emphasis>Regulators are in an unenviable position, as they will have to be more active to support investors when choosing to gate funds. I would expect fund liquidity rules will change with moves to weekly or monthly liquidity and constraints on what managers can do as well.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Maike:</emphasis> The solution could be moving from daily trading to weekly trading on certain funds, or a more radical option could lie on the distribution side \u2014 whether some of these funds should be made available to retail investors at all.</p><p>What I find the most worrying [about the suspension of Woodford funds and property funds] is that it could put people off investment and retirement saving.
