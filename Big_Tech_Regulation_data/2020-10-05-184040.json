The European market has suffered a 16pc decline while the UK market has suffered a 22pc fall. </p><p>\"This Covid effect means their power to affect and influence our daily lives is becoming increasingly removed from public control. It also represents a loss to us all, as most of the value of trillions of gigabytes of data, derived directly from us every year, is held privately by these companies instead of being available for the common good,\" said Mr Meadway. </p><p>The IPPR report suggests that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">competition policy alone is not the answer to dealing with Big Tech's dominance</url>. Instead, the UK must find ways to share and use data so it can be used for public benefit rather than private profit.</p><p>One solution would be the creation of a regulator that could give local authorities and organisations in the UK communal ownership of data in a way that protects privacy, the report claims. </p><p>The regulator would be part of a new Office for the Digital Common, and would have the power to protect valuable UK digital data, such as that derived from the NHS, from unfair international exploitation.</p><p>It also recommends steps to bring the value created by data under local and regional control, as is already being pioneered by innovative cities such as Amsterdam and Barcelona.</p><p>\"Local authorities, metro mayors and devolved administrations can do the same in the UK,\" said Mr Meadway.</p><p>For instance, they could compel companies to share data as a pre-condition of winning a service contract, and push for locally collected data to be made open to use by others. </p><p>\"Competition policy alone, at least in the sense of simply trying to break up some of these digital giants, could both reduce the value to the public of operating at scale - and, by creating smaller digital companies with similar business models, could simply reproduce some of the socially damaging behaviour we have seen,\" said Mr Meadway.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">Big Tech faced a grilling from the US Congress</url> last week over its swelling powers in an unprecedented hearing that saw the bosses of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple all appear together by videolink for the first time.</p><p>The chief executives of the firms were labelled \"cyber barons\" amid accusations that they had acted to squash smaller competitors with aggressive tactics, including introductions of copycat products and acquisitions made to eliminate rivals. </p><p>In the UK, efforts to tackle the powers of Big Tech had been led by Britain's competition watchdog, but it has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">accused of \"passing the baton\"</url> on tech giants after claiming that \"existing laws are not suitable for effective regulation\" and that a new \"regulatory regime\" should be established. </p><p>The Competition and Markets Authority claimed in recommendations to the government that a \"digital markets unit\" should be given powers to stop tech firms from engaging in \"exploitative and exclusionary practices\" and issue fines if they fail to comply. </p><p>Calls have been made across Europe too for a new technology regulator in the bloc, where companies currently face patchwork regulation in different countries. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64998433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HR-P7T1-F021-60W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Meanwhile, the music streaming service Spotify filed an antitrust complaint in Europe against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone's operating system and app store.</p><p>Wednesday's dual attacks provide more fodder in a worldwide debate about whether stricter rules need to be drawn up to handcuff or even break up leading tech companies as they try to grow into new markets.</p><p>\"What you're seeing is a broad recognition that there is a problem,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at Open Markets, an institution that studies corporate monopolies and advocates for more competitive markets.</p><p>The British government's new report was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to former President Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don't face enough competition and says that existing rules are outdated and need to be strengthened.</p><p>\"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" Furman said. \"Some say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the U.K. can do better.\"</p><p>As for Spotify, the streaming service's beef with Apple centers on a 30 percent tax that digital services have to pay to use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system, making Spotify subscriptions more expensive than Apple Music.

Joyce and Xu observe that 'pay-setting institutions for top executives may have allowed them to extract a higher share of the surplus companies generate. A large part of executive pay comes from bonuses and exercised stock options, institutions that have existed for a long time but really took off with force in the last few decades.'</p><p>In turn, the report cites a 2001 study by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, which states that stock options can be constructed to reward CEOs for luck as well as performance, especially in companies with weak governance.</p><p>And the use of compensation consultants and 'peer groups' to benchmark top executive salaries is meant to guard against excessive pay but - in reality, says the report - may be skewed to justify inflated salaries, citing a 2011 study by John Bizjak, Michael Lemmon and Thanh Nguyen.</p><p>The report goes on to point to the risk of the UK following the US, where wages for non-college-educated men have not risen for five decades and where rising mortality for less-educated white men and women in middle age has caused average life expectancy in America to fall for the last three years - something that has not happened for a century.</p><p>Deaton says: 'I think people getting rich is a good thing, especially when it brings prosperity to others. But the other kind of getting rich - 'taking' rather than 'making', rent-seeking rather than creating, enriching the few at the expense of the many, taking the free out of free markets - is making a mockery of democracy. In that world, inequality and misery are intimate companions.'</p><p>The report also notes that the share of income going to the 1 percent richest households has nearly tripled in the last four decades, from 3 percent in the late 1970s to around 8 percent today.</p><p>Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, says in a statement: 'I can't think of anything more important than understanding what drives the inequalities we see today and working out what we might do to influence them. Everything from early childhood education to the regulation of 'big tech', from the design of the benefit system to the effects of globalization, from the role of men and women in the home to the design of corporate governance, matters for producing the outcomes we see. We will be examining them all.'</p><p>The IFS Deaton Review is part of a five-year project, initiated by the IFS and funded by the Nuffield Foundation.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d2gw7wlacudg7o.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/field/image/Angus%20Deaton.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRMAG-30874</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHS-HY81-JB73-1003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468489</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>irmagazine.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 17, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Securities Underlying Options</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDgxRTU2QTREMEQyNEFBQjhFQzI1MDgwMzZEREFCQkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTgzOTk5NTQzNzBCNDFBREI3N0E3MDlEMjQzRUEyN0Y</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Stock Options</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg2NENENTFGNTQwNEI4NUJDMjBBNzc3NzgyNTlCQTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUU2OTQ1RTEwODA1NERCNEE0MDQxNEQwODAzOTNGMzg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000404</classCode><className>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTJGRkVBNjc4MzI3NDA5MTlEMDI1NjU2NzMyNkYzNTc</classCode><className>Corporate Governance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000667</classCode><className>EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001561</classCode><className>SHAREHOLDERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E</classCode><className>Shareholders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

The committee is also recommending a cross-sector AI Code to try to steer developments in a positive, societally beneficial direction \u2014 though not for this to be codified in law (the suggestion is it could \u201cprovide the basis for statutory regulation, if and when this is determined to be necessary\u201d). Among the five principles they\u2019re suggesting as a starting point for the voluntary code are that AI should be developed for \u201cthe common good and benefit of humanity\u201d, and that it should operate on \u201cprinciples of intelligibility and fairness\u201d. Though, elsewhere in the report, the committee points out it can be a challenge for humans to understand decisions made by some AI technologies \u2014 going on to suggest it may be necessary to refrain from using certain AI techniques for certain types of use-cases, at least until algorithmic accountability can be guaranteed. \u201cWe believe it is not acceptable to deploy any artificial intelligence system which could have a substantial impact on an individual\u2019s life, unless it can generate a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it will take,\u201d it writes in a section discussing \u2018intelligible AI\u2019. \u201cIn cases such as deep neural networks, where it is not yet possible to generate thorough explanations for the decisions that are made, this may mean delaying their deployment for particular uses until alternative solutions are found.\u201d A third principle the committee says it would like to see included in the proposed voluntary code is: \u201cAI should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families or communities\u201d. Though this is a curiously narrow definition \u2014 why not push for AI not to diminish rights, period? \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if \u2018follow the law\u2019 is too hard to say,\u201d observes Sam Smith, a coordinator at patient data privacy advocacy group, medConfidential, discussing the report. \u201cUnlike other AI \u2018ethics\u2019 standards which seek to create something so weak no one opposes it, the existing standards and conventions of the rule of law are well known and well understood, and provide real and meaningful scrutiny of decisions, assuming an entity believes in the rule of law,\u201d he adds. Looking at the tech industry as a whole, it\u2019s certainly hard to conclude that self-defined \u2018ethics\u2019 appear to offer much of a meaningful check on commercial players\u2019 data processing and AI activities. Topical case in point: Facebook has continued to claim there was nothing improper about the fact millions of people\u2019s information was shared with professor Aleksandr Kogan. People \u201cknowingly provided their information\u201d is the company\u2019s defensive claim. Yet the vast majority of people whose personal data was harvested from Facebook by Kogan clearly had no idea what was possible under its platform terms \u2014 which, until 2015, allowed one user to \u2018consent\u2019 to the sharing of all their Facebook friends. (Hence ~270,000 downloaders of Kogan\u2019s app being able to pass data on up to 87M Facebook users.) So Facebook\u2019s self-defined \u2018ethical code\u2019 has been shown to be worthless \u2014 aligning completely with its commercial imperatives, rather than supporting users to protect their privacy. (Just as its T&amp;Cs are intended to cover its own \u201crear end\u201d, rather than clearly inform people\u2019s about their rights, as one US congressman memorably put it last week.) \u201cA week after Facebook were criticized by the US Congress, the only reference to the Rule of Law in this report is about exempting companies from liability for breaking it,\u201d Smith adds in a MedConfidential response statement to the Lords report. \u201cPublic bodies are required to follow the rule of law, and any tools sold to them must meet those legal obligations. This standard for the public sector will drive the creation of tools which can be reused by all.\u201d Health data \u201cshould not be shared lightly\u201d The committee, which took evidence from Google -owned DeepMind as one of a multitude of expert witnesses during more than half a year\u2019s worth of enquiry, touches critically on the AI company\u2019s existing partnerships with UK National Health Service Trusts. The first of which, dating from 2015 \u2014 and involving the sharing of ~1.6 million patients\u2019 medical records with the Google-owned company \u2014 ran into trouble with the UK\u2019s data protection regulator. The UK\u2019s information commissioner concluded last summer that the Royal Free NHS Trust\u2019s agreement with DeepMind had not complied with UK data protection law. Patients\u2019 medical records were used by DeepMind to develop a clinical task management app wrapped around an existing NHS algorithm for detecting a condition known as acute kidney injury. The app, called Streams, has been rolled out for use in the Royal Free\u2019s hospitals \u2014 complete with PR fanfare. But it\u2019s still not clear what legal basis exists to share patients\u2019 data. \u201cMaintaining public trust over the safe and secure use of their data is paramount to the successful widespread deployment of AI and there is no better exemplar of this than personal health data,\u201d the committee warns. \u201cThere must be no repeat of the controversy which arose between the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and DeepMind. If there is, the benefits of deploying AI in the NHS will not be adopted or its benefits realised, and innovation could be stifled.\u201d The report also criticizes the \u201ccurrent piecemeal\u201d approach being taken by NHS Trusts to sharing data with AI developers \u2014 saying this risks \u201cthe inadvertent under-appreciation of the data\u201d and \u201cNHS Trusts exposing themselves to inadequate data sharing arrangements\u201d. \u201cThe data held by the NHS could be considered a unique source of value for the nation. It should not be shared lightly, but when it is, it should be done in a manner which allows for that value to be recouped,\u201d the committee writes. A similar point \u2014 about not allowing a huge store of potential value which is contained within publicly-funded NHS datasets to be cheaply asset-stripped by external forces \u2014 was made by Oxford University\u2019s Sir John Bell in a UK government-commissioned industrial strategy review of the life sciences sector last summer. Despite similar concerns, the committee also calls for a framework for sharing NHS data be published by the end of the year, and is pushing for NHS Trusts to digitize their current practices and records \u2014 with a target deadline of 2022 \u2014 in \u201cconsistent formats\u201d so that people\u2019s medical records can be made more accessible to AI developers. But worryingly, given the general thrust towards making sensitive health data more accessible to third parties, the committee does not seem to have a very fine-grained grasp of data protection in a health context \u2014 where, for example, datasets can be extremely difficult to render truly anonymous given the level of detail typically involved. Although they are at least calling for the relevant data protection and patient data bodies to be involved in provisioning the framework for sharing NHS data, alongside Trusts that have already worked with DeepMind (and in one case received an ICO wrist-slap). They write:  We recommend that a framework for the sharing of NHS data should be prepared and published by the end of 2018 by NHS England (specifically NHS Digital) and the National Data Guardian for Health and Care should be prepared with the support of the ICO [information commissioner\u2019s office] and the clinicians and NHS Trusts which already have experience of such arrangements (such as the Royal Free London and Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts), as well as the Caldicott Guardians [the NHS\u2019 patient data advocates]. This framework should set out clearly the considerations needed when sharing patient data in an appropriately anonymised form, the precautions needed when doing so, and an awareness of the value of that data and how it is used. It must also take account of the need to ensure SME access to NHS data, and ensure that patients are made aware of the use of their data and given the option to opt out. As the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal has clearly illustrated, opt-outs alone cannot safeguard people\u2019s data or their legal rights \u2014 which is why incoming EU data protection rules (GDPR) beef up consent requirements to require a clear affirmative. (And it goes without saying that opt-outs are especially concerning in a medical context where the data involved is so sensitive \u2014 yet, at least in the case of a DeepMind partnership with Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust, patients do not even appear to have been given the ability to say no to their data being processed.) Opt-outs (i.e. rather than opt-in systems) for data-sharing and self-defined/voluntary codes of \u2018ethics\u2019 demonstrably do very little to protect people\u2019s legal rights where digital data is concerned \u2014 even if it\u2019s true, for example, that Facebook holds itself in check vs what it could theoretically do with data, as company execs have suggested (one wonders what kind stuff they\u2019re voluntarily refraining from, given what they have been caught trying to manipulate). The wider risk of relying on consumer savvy to regulate commercial data sharing is that an educated, technologically aware few might be able to lock down \u2014 or reduce \u2014 access to their information; but the mainstream majority will have no clue they need to or even how it\u2019s possible. And data protection for a select elite doesn\u2019t sound very equitable. Meanwhile, at least where this committee\u2019s attitude to AI is concerned, developers and commercial entities are being treated with favorable encouragement \u2014 via the notion of a voluntary (and really pretty basic) code of AI ethics \u2014 rather than being robustly reminded they need to follow the law. Given the scope and scale of current AI-fueled sandals, that risks the committee looking naive. Though the government has made AI a strategic priority, and policies to foster and accelerate data-sharing to drive tech developments are a key part of its digital and industrial strategies. So the report needs to be read within that wider context. The committee does add its voice to questions about whether/how legal liability will mesh with automated decision making \u2014 writing that \u201cclarity is required\u201d on whether \u201cnew mechanisms for legal liability and redress\u201d are needed or not. \u201cWe recommend that the Law Commission consider the adequacy of existing legislation to address the legal liability issues of AI and, where appropriate, recommend to Government appropriate remedies to ensure that the law is clear in this area,\u201d it says on this. \u201cAt the very least, this work should establish clear principles for accountability and intelligibility. This work should be completed as soon as possible.\u201d But this isn\u2019t exactly cutting edge commentary. Last month the government announced a three-year regulatory review focused on self-driving cars and the law, for instance. And the liability point is already generally well-aired \u2014 and in the autonomous cars case, at least, now having its tires extensively kicked in the UK. What\u2019s less specifically discussed in government circles is how AIs are demonstrably piling pressure on existing laws. And what \u2014 if anything \u2014 should be done to address those kind of AI-fueled breaking points. (Exceptions: Terrorist content spreading via online platforms has been decried for some years, with government ministers more than happy to make platforms and technologies their scapegoat and even toughen laws; more recently hate speech on online platforms has also become a major political target for governments in Europe.) The committee briefly touches on some of these societal pressure points in a section on AI\u2019s impact on \u201csocial and political cohesion\u201d, noting concerns raised to it about issues such as filter bubbles and the risk of AIs being used to manipulate elections. \u201c[T]here is a rapidly growing need for public understanding of, and engagement with, AI to develop alongside the technology itself. The manipulation of data in particular will be a key area for public understanding and discussion in the coming months and years,\u201d it writes here. However it has little in the way of gunpowder \u2014 merely recommending that research is commissioned into \u201cthe possible impact of AI on conventional and social media outlets\u201d, and to investigate \u201cmeasures which might counteract the use of AI to mislead or distort public opinion as a matter of urgency\u201d. Elsewhere in the report, it also raise an interesting concern about data monopolies \u2014 noting that investments by \u201clarge overseas technology companies in the UK economy\u201d are \u201cincreasing consolidation of power and influence by a select few\u201d, which it argues risks damaging the UK\u2019s home-grown AI start-up sector. But again there\u2019s not much of substance in its response. The committee doesn\u2019t seem to have formed its own ideas on how or even whether the government needs to address data being concentrating power in the hands of big tech \u2014 beyond calling for \u201cstrong\u201d competition frameworks. This lack of conviction is attributed to hearing mixed messages on the topic from its witnesses. (Though may well also be related to the economic portion of the enquiry\u2019s focus.) \u201cThe monopolisation of data demonstrates the need for strong ethical, data protection and competition frameworks in the UK, and for continued vigilance from the regulators,\u201d it concludes. \u201cWe urge the Government, and the Competition and Markets Authority, to review proactively the use and potential monopolisation of data by the big technology companies operating in the UK.\u201d The report also raises concerns about access to funding for UK AI startups to ensure they can continue scaling domestic businesses \u2014 recommending that a chunk of the 163;2.5BN investment fund at the British Business Bank, which the government announced in the Autumn Budget 2017, is \u201creserved as an AI growth fund for SMEs with a substantive AI component, and be specifically targeted at enabling such companies to scale up\u201d. No one who supports the startup cause would argue with trying to make more money available. But if data access has been sealed up by tech giants all the scale up funding in the world won\u2019t help domestic AI startups break through that algorithmic ceiling. Also touched on: The looming impact of Brexit, with the committee calling on the government to \u201ccommit to underwriting, and where necessary replacing, funding for European research and innovation programmes, after we have left the European Union\u201d . Which boils down to another whistle in a now very long score of calls for replacement funding after the UK leaves the EU. Funding for regulators is another concern, with a warning that the ICO must be \u201cadequately and sustainably resourced\u201d \u2014 as a result of the additional burden the committee expects AI to put on existing regulators. This issue is also on the radar of the UK\u2019s digital minister, Matt Hancock, who has said he\u2019s considering what additional resources the ICO might need \u2014 such as the power to compel testimony from individuals. (Though the ICO itself has previously raised concerns that the minister and his data protection bill are risking undermining her authority.) For now it remains to be seen how well armed the agency will be to meet the myriad challenges generated and scaled by AI\u2019s data processors. \u201cBlanket AI-specific regulation, at this stage, would be inappropriate,\u201d the report adds. \u201cWe believe that existing sector-specific regulators are best placed to consider the impact on their sectors of any subsequent regulation which may be needed. We welcome that the Data Protection Bill and GDPR appear to address many of the concerns of our witnesses regarding the handling of personal data, which is key to the development of AI. The Government Office for AI, with the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, needs to identify the gaps, if any, where existing regulation may not be adequate. The Government Office for AI must also ensure that the existing regulators\u2019 expertise is utilised in informing any potential regulation that may be required in the future.\u201d The committee\u2019s last two starter principles for their voluntary AI code serve to underline how generously low the ethical bar is really being set here \u2014 boiling down to: AI shouldn\u2019t be allowed to kill off free schools for our kids, nor be allowed to kill us \u2014 which may itself be another consequence of humans not always being able to clearly determine how AI does what it does or exactly what it might be doing to us. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN748088120180417</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4D-N9D1-J9XT-P2C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The latest worries are voiced by a panel of external reviewers appointed by the Google-owned AI company to report on its operations after its initial data-sharing arrangements with the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) ran into a major public controversy in 2016. The DeepMind Health Independent Reviewers\u2019 2018 report flags a series of risks and concerns, as they see it, including the potential for DeepMind Health to be able to \u201cexert excessive monopoly power\u201d as a result of the data access and streaming infrastructure that\u2019s bundled with provision of the Streams app \u2014 and which, contractually, positions DeepMind as the access-controlling intermediary between the structured health data and any other third parties that might, in the future, want to offer their own digital assistance solutions to the Trust. While the underlying FHIR (aka, fast healthcare interoperability resource) deployed by DeepMind for Streams uses an open API, the contract between the company and the Royal Free Trust funnels connections via DeepMind\u2019s own servers, and prohibits connections to other FHIR servers. A commercial structure that seemingly works against the openness and interoperability DeepMind\u2019s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman has claimed to support. \u201cThere are many examples in the IT arena where companies lock their customers into systems that are difficult to change or replace. </p><p>Such arrangements are not in the interests of the public. And we do not want to see DeepMind Health putting itself in a position where clients, such as hospitals, find themselves forced to stay with DeepMind Health even if it is no longer financially or clinically sensible to do so; we want DeepMind Health to compete on quality and price, not by entrenching legacy position,\u201d the reviewers write. Though they point to DeepMind\u2019s \u201cstated commitment to interoperability of systems,\u201d and \u201ctheir adoption of the FHIR open API\u201d as positive indications, writing: \u201cThis means that there is potential for many other SMEs to become involved, creating a diverse and innovative marketplace which works to the benefit of consumers, innovation and the economy.\u201d \u201cWe also note DeepMind Health\u2019s intention to implement many of the features of Streams as modules which could be easily swapped, meaning that they will have to rely on being the best to stay in business,\u201d they add. However, stated intentions and future potentials are clearly not the same as on-the-ground reality. And, as it stands, a technically interoperable app-delivery infrastructure is being encumbered by prohibitive clauses in a commercial contract \u2014 and by a lack of regulatory pushback against such behavior. The reviewers also raise concerns about an ongoing lack of clarity around DeepMind Health\u2019s business model \u2014 writing: \u201cGiven the current environment, and with no clarity about DeepMind Health\u2019s business model, people are likely to suspect that there must be an undisclosed profit motive or a hidden agenda. We do not believe this to be the case, but would urge DeepMind Health to be transparent about their business model, and their ability to stick to that without being overridden by Alphabet. For once an idea of hidden agendas is fixed in people\u2019s mind, it is hard to shift, no matter how much a company is motivated by the public good.\u201d \u201cWe have had detailed conversations about DeepMind Health\u2019s evolving thoughts in this area, and are aware that some of these questions have not yet been finalised. However, we would urge DeepMind Health to set out publicly what they are proposing,\u201d they add. DeepMind has suggested it wants to build healthcare AIs that are capable of charging by results. But Streams does not involve any AI. The service is also being provided to NHS Trusts for free, at least for the first five years \u2014 raising the question of how exactly the Google-owned company intends to recoup its investment. Google of course monetizes a large suite of free-at-the-point-of-use consumer products \u2014 such as the Android mobile operating system; its cloud email service Gmail; and the YouTube video sharing platform, to name three \u2014 by harvesting people\u2019s personal data and using that information to inform its ad targeting platforms. (And while Google stopped data-mining Gmail for ad targeting purposes last year it does still extract keyword data to customize individuals\u2019 search results, for example, and for other purposes such as feeding its machine learning algorithms, according to NBC.) Hence the reviewers\u2019 recommendation for DeepMind to set out its thinking on its business model to avoid its intentions vis-a-vis people\u2019s medical data being viewed with suspicion. The company\u2019s historical modus operandi also underlines the potential monopoly risks if DeepMind is allowed to carve out a dominant platform position in digital healthcare provision \u2014 given how effectively its parent has been able to turn a free-for-OEMs mobile OS (Android) into global smartphone market OS dominance, for example. So, while DeepMind only has a handful of contracts with NHS Trusts for the Streams app and delivery infrastructure at this stage, the reviewers\u2019 concerns over the risk of the company gaining \u201cexcessive monopoly power\u201d do not seem overblown. They are also worried about DeepMind\u2019s ongoing vagueness about how exactly it works with its parent Alphabet, and what data could ever be transferred to the ad giant \u2014 an inevitably queasy combination when stacked against DeepMind\u2019s handling of people\u2019s medical records. \u201cTo what extent can DeepMind Health insulate itself against Alphabet instructing them in the future to do something which it has promised not to do today? Or, if DeepMind Health\u2019s current management were to leave DeepMind Health, how much could a new CEO alter what has been agreed today?\u201d they write. \u201cWe appreciate that DeepMind Health would continue to be bound by the legal and regulatory framework, but much of our attention is on the steps that DeepMind Health have taken to take a more ethical stance than the law requires; could this all be ended? We encourage DeepMind Health to look at ways of entrenching its separation from Alphabet and DeepMind more robustly, so that it can have enduring force to the commitments it makes.\u201d Responding to the report\u2019s publication on its website, DeepMind writes that it\u2019s \u201cdeveloping our longer-term business model and roadmap.\u201d \u201cRather than charging for the early stages of our work, our first priority has been to prove that our technologies can help improve patient care and reduce costs. We believe that our business model should flow from the positive impact we create, and will continue to explore outcomes-based elements so that costs are at least in part related to the benefits we deliver,\u201d it continues. So it has nothing to say to defuse the reviewers\u2019 concerns about making its intentions for monetizing health data plain \u2014 beyond deploying a few choice PR soundbites. On its links with Alphabet, DeepMind also has little to say, writing only that: \u201cWe will explore further ways to ensure there is clarity about the binding legal frameworks that govern all our NHS partnerships.\u201d \u201cTrusts remain in full control of the data at all times,\u201d it adds. \u201cWe are legally and contractually bound to only using patient data under the instructions of our partners. We will continue to make our legal agreements with Trusts publicly available to allow scrutiny of this important point.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing in our legal agreements with our partners that prevents them from working with any other data processor, should they wish to seek the services of another provider,\u201d it also claims in response to additional questions we put to it. \u201cWe hope that Streams can help unlock the next wave of innovation in the NHS. The infrastructure that powers Streams is built on state-of-the-art open and interoperable standards, known as FHIR. The FHIR standard is supported in the UK by NHS Digital, NHS England and the INTEROPen group. This should allow our partner trusts to work more easily with other developers, helping them bring many more new innovations to the clinical frontlines,\u201d it adds in additional comments to us. \u201cUnder our contractual agreements with relevant partner trusts, we have committed to building FHIR API infrastructure within the five year terms of the agreements.\u201d Asked about the progress it\u2019s made on a technical audit infrastructure for verifying access to health data, which it announced last year, it reiterated the wording on its blog, saying: \u201cWe will remain vigilant about setting the highest possible standards of information governance. At the beginning of this year, we appointed a full time Information Governance Manager to oversee our use of data in all areas of our work. We are also continuing to build our Verifiable Data Audit and other tools to clearly show how we\u2019re using data.\u201d So developments on that front look as slow as we expected. The Google-owned U.K. AI company began its push into digital healthcare services in 2015, quietly signing an information-sharing arrangement with a London-based NHS Trust that gave it access to around 1.6 million people\u2019s medical records for developing an alerts app for a condition called Acute Kidney Injury. It also inked an MoU with the Trust where the pair set out their ambition to apply AI to NHS data sets. (They even went so far as to get ethical signs-off for an AI project \u2014 but have consistently claimed the Royal Free data was not fed to any AIs.) However, the data-sharing collaboration ran into trouble in May 2016 when the scope of patient data being shared by the Royal Free with DeepMind was revealed (via investigative journalism, rather than by disclosures from the Trust or DeepMind). None of the ~1.6 million people whose non-anonymized medical records had been passed to the Google-owned company had been informed or asked for their consent. And questions were raised about the legal basis for the data-sharing arrangement. Last summer the U.K.\u2019s privacy regulator concluded an investigation of the project \u2014 finding that the Royal Free NHS Trust had broken data protection rules during the app\u2019s development. Yet despite ethical questions and regulatory disquiet about the legality of the data sharing, the Streams project steamrollered on. And the Royal Free Trust went on to implement the app for use by clinicians in its hospitals, while DeepMind has also signed several additional contracts to deploy Streams to other NHS Trusts. More recently, the law firm Linklaters completed an audit of the Royal Free Streams project, after being commissioned by the Trust as part of its settlement with the ICO. Though this audit only examined the current functioning of Streams. (There has been no historical audit of the lawfulness of people\u2019s medical records being shared during the build and test phase of the project.) Linklaters did recommend the Royal Free terminates its wider MoU with DeepMind \u2014 and the Trust has confirmed to us that it will be following the firm\u2019s advice. \u201cThe audit recommends we terminate the historic memorandum of understanding with DeepMind which was signed in January 2016. The MOU is no longer relevant to the partnership and we are in the process of terminating it,\u201d a Royal Free spokesperson told us. So DeepMind, probably the world\u2019s most famous AI company, is in the curious position of being involved in providing digital healthcare services to U.K. hospitals that don\u2019t actually involve any AI at all. (Though it does have some ongoing AI research projects with NHS Trusts too.) In mid 2016, at the height of the Royal Free DeepMind data scandal, the panel of external reviewers met for the first time. DeepMind says it established the panel in February 2016, though there was no formal announcement then and the first meeting was not held until June 14. The group\u2019s initial report was published in July 2017. The panel has now produced a second report looking at how the division is operating. And it\u2019s fair to say that much has happened in the tech industry since the panel was appointed to further undermine public trust in tech platforms and algorithmic promises \u2014 including the ICO\u2019s finding that the initial data-sharing arrangement between the Royal Free and DeepMind broke U.K. privacy laws. The eight members of the panel for the 2018 report are: Martin Bromiley OBE; Elisabeth Buggins CBE; Eileen Burbidge MBE; Richard Horton; Dr. Julian Huppert; Professor Donal O\u2019Donoghue; Matthew Taylor; and Professor Sir John Tooke. In their latest report the external reviewers warn that the public\u2019s view of tech giants has \u201cshifted substantially\u201d versus where it was even a year ago \u2014 asserting that \u201cissues of privacy in a digital age are if anything, of greater concern.\u201d At the same time politicians are also gazing rather more critically on the works and social impacts of tech giants. Although the U.K. government has also been keen to position itself as a supporter of AI, providing public funds for the sector and, in its Industrial Strategy white paper, identifying AI and data as one of four so-called \u201cGrand Challenges\u201d where it believes the U.K. can \u201clead the world for years to come\u201d \u2014 including specifically name-checking DeepMind as one of a handful of leading-edge homegrown AI businesses for the country to be proud of. Still, questions over how to manage and regulate public sector data and AI deployments \u2014 especially in highly sensitive areas such as healthcare \u2014 remain to be clearly addressed by the government. Meanwhile, the encroaching ingress of digital technologies into the healthcare space \u2014 even when the techs don\u2019t even involve any AI \u2014 are already presenting major challenges by putting pressure on existing information governance rules and structures, and raising the specter of monopolistic risk. Asked whether it offers any guidance to NHS Trusts around digital assistance for clinicians, including specifically whether it requires multiple options be offered by different providers, the NHS\u2019 digital services provider, NHS Digital, referred our question on to the Department of Health (DoH), saying it\u2019s a matter of health policy. The DoH in turn referred the question to NHS England, the executive non-departmental body which commissions contracts and sets priorities and directions for the health service in England. And at the time of writing, we\u2019re still waiting for a response from the steering body. Ultimately it looks like it will be up to the health service to put in place a clear and robust structure for AI and digital decision services that fosters competition by design by baking in a requirement for Trusts to support multiple independent options when procuring apps and services. Without that important check and balance, the risk is that platform dynamics will quickly dominate and control the emergent digital health assistance space \u2014 just as big tech has dominated consumer tech. But publicly funded healthcare decisions and data sets should not simply be handed to the single market-dominating entity that\u2019s willing and able to burn the most resource to own the space. Nor should government stand by and do nothing when there\u2019s a clear risk that a vital area of digital innovation is at risk of being closed down by a tech giant muscling in and positioning itself as a gatekeeper before others have had a chance to show what their ideas are made of, and before even a market has had the chance to form. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN894905020180620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SKX-43X1-J9XT-P4WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 20, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The latest worries are voiced by a panel of external reviewers appointed by the Google-owned AI company to report on its operations after its initial data-sharing arrangements with the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) ran into a major public controversy in 2016. The DeepMind Health Independent Reviewers\u2019 2018 report flags a series of risks and concerns, as they see it, including the potential for DeepMind Health to be able to \u201cexert excessive monopoly power\u201d as a result of the data access and streaming infrastructure that\u2019s bundled with provision of the Streams app \u2014 and which, contractually, positions DeepMind as the access-controlling intermediary between the structured health data and any other third parties that might, in the future, want to offer their own digital assistance solutions to the Trust. While the underlying FHIR (aka, fast healthcare interoperability resource) deployed by DeepMind for Streams uses an open API, the contract between the company and the Royal Free Trust funnels connections via DeepMind\u2019s own servers, and prohibits connections to other FHIR servers. A commercial structure that seemingly works against the openness and interoperability DeepMind\u2019s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman has claimed to support. \u201cThere are many examples in the IT arena where companies lock their customers into systems that are difficult to change or replace. </p><p>Such arrangements are not in the interests of the public. And we do not want to see DeepMind Health putting itself in a position where clients, such as hospitals, find themselves forced to stay with DeepMind Health even if it is no longer financially or clinically sensible to do so; we want DeepMind Health to compete on quality and price, not by entrenching legacy position,\u201d the reviewers write. Though they point to DeepMind\u2019s \u201cstated commitment to interoperability of systems,\u201d and \u201ctheir adoption of the FHIR open API\u201d as positive indications, writing: \u201cThis means that there is potential for many other SMEs to become involved, creating a diverse and innovative marketplace which works to the benefit of consumers, innovation and the economy.\u201d \u201cWe also note DeepMind Health\u2019s intention to implement many of the features of Streams as modules which could be easily swapped, meaning that they will have to rely on being the best to stay in business,\u201d they add. However, stated intentions and future potentials are clearly not the same as on-the-ground reality. And, as it stands, a technically interoperable app-delivery infrastructure is being encumbered by prohibitive clauses in a commercial contract \u2014 and by a lack of regulatory pushback against such behavior. The reviewers also raise concerns about an ongoing lack of clarity around DeepMind Health\u2019s business model \u2014 writing: \u201cGiven the current environment, and with no clarity about DeepMind Health\u2019s business model, people are likely to suspect that there must be an undisclosed profit motive or a hidden agenda. We do not believe this to be the case, but would urge DeepMind Health to be transparent about their business model, and their ability to stick to that without being overridden by Alphabet. For once an idea of hidden agendas is fixed in people\u2019s mind, it is hard to shift, no matter how much a company is motivated by the public good.\u201d \u201cWe have had detailed conversations about DeepMind Health\u2019s evolving thoughts in this area, and are aware that some of these questions have not yet been finalised. However, we would urge DeepMind Health to set out publicly what they are proposing,\u201d they add. DeepMind has suggested it wants to build healthcare AIs that are capable of charging by results. But Streams does not involve any AI. The service is also being provided to NHS Trusts for free, at least for the first five years \u2014 raising the question of how exactly the Google-owned company intends to recoup its investment. Google of course monetizes a large suite of free-at-the-point-of-use consumer products \u2014 such as the Android mobile operating system; its cloud email service Gmail; and the YouTube video sharing platform, to name three \u2014 by harvesting people\u2019s personal data and using that information to inform its ad targeting platforms. (And while Google stopped data-mining Gmail for ad targeting purposes last year it does still extract keyword data to customize individuals\u2019 search results, for example, and for other purposes such as feeding its machine learning algorithms, according to NBC.) Hence the reviewers\u2019 recommendation for DeepMind to set out its thinking on its business model to avoid its intentions vis-a-vis people\u2019s medical data being viewed with suspicion. The company\u2019s historical modus operandi also underlines the potential monopoly risks if DeepMind is allowed to carve out a dominant platform position in digital healthcare provision \u2014 given how effectively its parent has been able to turn a free-for-OEMs mobile OS (Android) into global smartphone market OS dominance, for example. So, while DeepMind only has a handful of contracts with NHS Trusts for the Streams app and delivery infrastructure at this stage, the reviewers\u2019 concerns over the risk of the company gaining \u201cexcessive monopoly power\u201d do not seem overblown. They are also worried about DeepMind\u2019s ongoing vagueness about how exactly it works with its parent Alphabet, and what data could ever be transferred to the ad giant \u2014 an inevitably queasy combination when stacked against DeepMind\u2019s handling of people\u2019s medical records. \u201cTo what extent can DeepMind Health insulate itself against Alphabet instructing them in the future to do something which it has promised not to do today? Or, if DeepMind Health\u2019s current management were to leave DeepMind Health, how much could a new CEO alter what has been agreed today?\u201d they write. \u201cWe appreciate that DeepMind Health would continue to be bound by the legal and regulatory framework, but much of our attention is on the steps that DeepMind Health have taken to take a more ethical stance than the law requires; could this all be ended? We encourage DeepMind Health to look at ways of entrenching its separation from Alphabet and DeepMind more robustly, so that it can have enduring force to the commitments it makes.\u201d Responding to the report\u2019s publication on its website, DeepMind writes that it\u2019s \u201cdeveloping our longer-term business model and roadmap.\u201d \u201cRather than charging for the early stages of our work, our first priority has been to prove that our technologies can help improve patient care and reduce costs. We believe that our business model should flow from the positive impact we create, and will continue to explore outcomes-based elements so that costs are at least in part related to the benefits we deliver,\u201d it continues. So it has nothing to say to defuse the reviewers\u2019 concerns about making its intentions for monetizing health data plain \u2014 beyond deploying a few choice PR soundbites. On its links with Alphabet, DeepMind also has little to say, writing only that: \u201cWe will explore further ways to ensure there is clarity about the binding legal frameworks that govern all our NHS partnerships.\u201d \u201cTrusts remain in full control of the data at all times,\u201d it adds. \u201cWe are legally and contractually bound to only using patient data under the instructions of our partners. We will continue to make our legal agreements with Trusts publicly available to allow scrutiny of this important point.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing in our legal agreements with our partners that prevents them from working with any other data processor, should they wish to seek the services of another provider,\u201d it also claims in response to additional questions we put to it. \u201cWe hope that Streams can help unlock the next wave of innovation in the NHS. The infrastructure that powers Streams is built on state-of-the-art open and interoperable standards, known as FHIR. The FHIR standard is supported in the UK by NHS Digital, NHS England and the INTEROPen group. This should allow our partner trusts to work more easily with other developers, helping them bring many more new innovations to the clinical frontlines,\u201d it adds in additional comments to us. \u201cUnder our contractual agreements with relevant partner trusts, we have committed to building FHIR API infrastructure within the five year terms of the agreements.\u201d Asked about the progress it\u2019s made on a technical audit infrastructure for verifying access to health data, which it announced last year, it reiterated the wording on its blog, saying: \u201cWe will remain vigilant about setting the highest possible standards of information governance. At the beginning of this year, we appointed a full time Information Governance Manager to oversee our use of data in all areas of our work. We are also continuing to build our Verifiable Data Audit and other tools to clearly show how we\u2019re using data.\u201d So developments on that front look as slow as we expected. The Google-owned U.K. AI company began its push into digital healthcare services in 2015, quietly signing an information-sharing arrangement with a London-based NHS Trust that gave it access to around 1.6 million people\u2019s medical records for developing an alerts app for a condition called Acute Kidney Injury. It also inked an MoU with the Trust where the pair set out their ambition to apply AI to NHS data sets. (They even went so far as to get ethical signs-off for an AI project \u2014 but have consistently claimed the Royal Free data was not fed to any AIs.) However, the data-sharing collaboration ran into trouble in May 2016 when the scope of patient data being shared by the Royal Free with DeepMind was revealed (via investigative journalism, rather than by disclosures from the Trust or DeepMind). None of the ~1.6 million people whose non-anonymized medical records had been passed to the Google-owned company had been informed or asked for their consent. And questions were raised about the legal basis for the data-sharing arrangement. Last summer the U.K.\u2019s privacy regulator concluded an investigation of the project \u2014 finding that the Royal Free NHS Trust had broken data protection rules during the app\u2019s development. Yet despite ethical questions and regulatory disquiet about the legality of the data sharing, the Streams project steamrollered on. And the Royal Free Trust went on to implement the app for use by clinicians in its hospitals, while DeepMind has also signed several additional contracts to deploy Streams to other NHS Trusts. More recently, the law firm Linklaters completed an audit of the Royal Free Streams project, after being commissioned by the Trust as part of its settlement with the ICO. Though this audit only examined the current functioning of Streams. (There has been no historical audit of the lawfulness of people\u2019s medical records being shared during the build and test phase of the project.) Linklaters did recommend the Royal Free terminates its wider MoU with DeepMind \u2014 and the Trust has confirmed to us that it will be following the firm\u2019s advice. \u201cThe audit recommends we terminate the historic memorandum of understanding with DeepMind which was signed in January 2016. The MOU is no longer relevant to the partnership and we are in the process of terminating it,\u201d a Royal Free spokesperson told us. So DeepMind, probably the world\u2019s most famous AI company, is in the curious position of being involved in providing digital healthcare services to U.K. hospitals that don\u2019t actually involve any AI at all. (Though it does have some ongoing AI research projects with NHS Trusts too.) In mid 2016, at the height of the Royal Free DeepMind data scandal, the panel of external reviewers met for the first time. DeepMind says it established the panel in February 2016, though there was no formal announcement then and the first meeting was not held until June 14. The group\u2019s initial report was published in July 2017. The panel has now produced a second report looking at how the division is operating. And it\u2019s fair to say that much has happened in the tech industry since the panel was appointed to further undermine public trust in tech platforms and algorithmic promises \u2014 including the ICO\u2019s finding that the initial data-sharing arrangement between the Royal Free and DeepMind broke U.K. privacy laws. The eight members of the panel for the 2018 report are: Martin Bromiley OBE; Elisabeth Buggins CBE; Eileen Burbidge MBE; Richard Horton; Dr. Julian Huppert; Professor Donal O\u2019Donoghue; Matthew Taylor; and Professor Sir John Tooke. In their latest report the external reviewers warn that the public\u2019s view of tech giants has \u201cshifted substantially\u201d versus where it was even a year ago \u2014 asserting that \u201cissues of privacy in a digital age are if anything, of greater concern.\u201d At the same time politicians are also gazing rather more critically on the works and social impacts of tech giants. Although the U.K. government has also been keen to position itself as a supporter of AI, providing public funds for the sector and, in its Industrial Strategy white paper, identifying AI and data as one of four so-called \u201cGrand Challenges\u201d where it believes the U.K. can \u201clead the world for years to come\u201d \u2014 including specifically name-checking DeepMind as one of a handful of leading-edge homegrown AI businesses for the country to be proud of. Still, questions over how to manage and regulate public sector data and AI deployments \u2014 especially in highly sensitive areas such as healthcare \u2014 remain to be clearly addressed by the government. Meanwhile, the encroaching ingress of digital technologies into the healthcare space \u2014 even when the techs don\u2019t even involve any AI \u2014 are already presenting major challenges by putting pressure on existing information governance rules and structures, and raising the specter of monopolistic risk. Asked whether it offers any guidance to NHS Trusts around digital assistance for clinicians, including specifically whether it requires multiple options be offered by different providers, the NHS\u2019 digital services provider, NHS Digital, referred our question on to the Department of Health (DoH), saying it\u2019s a matter of health policy. The DoH in turn referred the question to NHS England, the executive non-departmental body which commissions contracts and sets priorities and directions for the health service in England. And at the time of writing, we\u2019re still waiting for a response from the steering body. Ultimately it looks like it will be up to the health service to put in place a clear and robust structure for AI and digital decision services that fosters competition by design by baking in a requirement for Trusts to support multiple independent options when procuring apps and services. Without that important check and balance, the risk is that platform dynamics will quickly dominate and control the emergent digital health assistance space \u2014 just as big tech has dominated consumer tech. But publicly funded healthcare decisions and data sets should not simply be handed to the single market-dominating entity that\u2019s willing and able to burn the most resource to own the space. Nor should government stand by and do nothing when there\u2019s a clear risk that a vital area of digital innovation is at risk of being closed down by a tech giant muscling in and positioning itself as a gatekeeper before others have had a chance to show what their ideas are made of, and before even a market has had the chance to form. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN894905020180620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM2-TCD1-DXCW-D2X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 20, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The independent review published Wednesday says global tech giants don't face enough competition and that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.The British government commissioned the review, which was led by Harvard University professor Jason Fuhrman, a chief economic adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama. The 150-page report adds to growing calls by leaders in the U.S. and the European Union for stricter regulation of technology companies.Most Read Business StoriesRecommendations include setting up a new 'digital markets unit' to give people more control over their data and giving more power to regulators to tackle illegal anti-competitive practices. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-SE1297571552478764142251762500014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SE-129757</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-3NT1-JCMN-Y13V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"161\"/><timeReceived>12:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Today File</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week proposed breaking up the biggest U.S. tech companies, slamming them for having too much market and political power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British report was released the same day that Swedish music-streaming service Spotify said it filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone's operating system and app store. Spotify's beef with Apple centres on a 30 per cent tax that it and other digital services have to pay to use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system, making Spotify subscriptions more expensive than Apple Music.</p><p>The British government's review was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don't face enough competition and said that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.</p><p>\"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" Furman said. \"Some say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the U.K. can do better.\"</p><p>Britain's House of Lords recently called for a new digital regulatory authority to provide overall oversight.</p><p>EU authorities also have faced down big tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has slapped whopping fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay back billions in back taxes. EU, German and Austrian authorities are looking separately into Amazon's marketplace platform over complaints of unfair practices.</p><p>Britain's financial secretary, Philip Hammond, said the government would respond later this year to the report's recommendations, any of which must be approved by Britain's Parliament to take effect.</p><p>Recommendations include setting up a new \"digital markets unit\" tasked with giving people more control over their data by using open standards. That would let people move or share their personal information if they switch to a new digital service.</p><p>The report's authors said by making it easier for people to switch, \"data mobility\" would result in new digital services while creating new business opportunities to manage the data.</p><p>The report also recommended:</p><p>- getting big companies to share key data sets with startups, while safeguarding personal information. The report said data sharing can help foster innovation and new business ideas. The panel cited as an example Uber's release of data to help improve infrastructure and planning decisions.</p><p>- drawing up a code of conduct to lay out acceptable behaviour for tech companies in their relationships with users. The report said clarifying unfair conduct would allow disputes to be resolved more easily.</p><p>- rewriting rules so authorities can better stop digital mergers likely to \"damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice.\" This should include letting Britain's competition regulator take into account the scale and likelihood of any harm in merger cases as well as requiring digital companies with \"strategic market status\" to inform the authority of all intended acquisitions.</p><p>Hammond said he asked Britain's competition authority to act on another recommendation: carrying out a study of the country's digital ad market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. According to the report, publishers complain that because the digital advertising supply chain is opaque, it's hard for them to get a fair return on ads that go with their content.</p><p>--</p><p>This version corrects the spelling of Furman's name. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week proposed breaking up the biggest U.S. tech companies, slamming them for having too much market and political power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British report was released the same day that Swedish music-streaming service Spotify said it filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone's operating system and app store. Spotify's beef with Apple centers on a 30 percent tax that it and other digital services have to pay to use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system, making Spotify subscriptions more expensive than Apple Music.</p><p>The British government's review was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don't face enough competition and said that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.</p><p>\"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" Furman said. \"Some say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the U.K. can do better.\"</p><p>Britain's House of Lords recently called for a new digital regulatory authority to provide overall oversight.</p><p>EU authorities also have faced down big tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has slapped whopping fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay back billions in back taxes. EU, German and Austrian authorities are looking separately into Amazon's marketplace platform over complaints of unfair practices.</p><p>Britain's financial secretary, Philip Hammond, said the government would respond later this year to the report's recommendations, any of which must be approved by Britain's Parliament to take effect.</p><p>Recommendations include setting up a new \"digital markets unit\" tasked with giving people more control over their data by using open standards. That would let people move or share their personal information if they switch to a new digital service.</p><p>The report's authors said by making it easier for people to switch, \"data mobility\" would result in new digital services while creating new business opportunities to manage the data.</p><p>The report also recommended:</p><p>- getting big companies to share key data sets with startups, while safeguarding personal information. The report said data sharing can help foster innovation and new business ideas. The panel cited as an example Uber's release of data to help improve infrastructure and planning decisions.</p><p>- drawing up a code of conduct to lay out acceptable behavior for tech companies in their relationships with users. The report said clarifying unfair conduct would allow disputes to be resolved more easily.</p><p>- rewriting rules so authorities can better stop digital mergers likely to \"damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice.\" This should include letting Britain's competition regulator take into account the scale and likelihood of any harm in merger cases as well as requiring digital companies with \"strategic market status\" to inform the authority of all intended acquisitions.</p><p>Hammond said he asked Britain's competition authority to act on another recommendation: carrying out a study of the country's digital ad market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. According to the report, publishers complain that because the digital advertising supply chain is opaque, it's hard for them to get a fair return on ads that go with their content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BILLBD-8502431</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BILLBD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMR-MF01-DYRK-V26W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5545</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>billboard.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18997\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week proposed breaking up the biggest U.S. tech companies, slamming them for having too much market and political power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The British report was released the same day that Swedish music-streaming service Spotify said it filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone's operating system and app store. Spotify's beef with Apple centers on a 30 percent tax that it and other digital services have to pay to use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system, making Spotify subscriptions more expensive than Apple Music.</p><p> The British government's review was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don't face enough competition and said that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.</p><p> \"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" Furman said. \"Some say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the U.K. can do better.\"</p><p> Britain's House of Lords recently called for a new digital regulatory authority to provide overall oversight.</p><p> EU authorities also have faced down big tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has slapped whopping fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay back billions in back taxes. EU, German and Austrian authorities are looking separately into Amazon's marketplace platform over complaints of unfair practices.</p><p> Britain's financial secretary, Philip Hammond, said the government would respond later this year to the report's recommendations, any of which must be approved by Britain's Parliament to take effect.</p><p> Recommendations include setting up a new \"digital markets unit\" tasked with giving people more control over their data by using open standards. That would let people move or share their personal information if they switch to a new digital service.</p><p> The report's authors said by making it easier for people to switch, \"data mobility\" would result in new digital services while creating new business opportunities to manage the data.</p><p> The report also recommended:</p><p> - getting big companies to share key data sets with startups, while safeguarding personal information. The report said data sharing can help foster innovation and new business ideas. The panel cited as an example Uber's release of data to help improve infrastructure and planning decisions.</p><p> - drawing up a code of conduct to lay out acceptable behavior for tech companies in their relationships with users. The report said clarifying unfair conduct would allow disputes to be resolved more easily.</p><p> - rewriting rules so authorities can better stop digital mergers likely to \"damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice.\" This should include letting Britain's competition regulator take into account the scale and likelihood of any harm in merger cases as well as requiring digital companies with \"strategic market status\" to inform the authority of all intended acquisitions.</p><p> Hammond said he asked Britain's competition authority to act on another recommendation: carrying out a study of the country's digital ad market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. According to the report, publishers complain that because the digital advertising supply chain is opaque, it's hard for them to get a fair return on ads that go with their content.</p><p> ___</p><p> This version corrects the spelling of Furman's name.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE - This photo combo of images shows the Amazon, Google and Facebook logos.

In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week proposed breaking up the biggest U.S. tech companies, slamming them for having too much market and political power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British report was released the same day that Swedish music-streaming service Spotify said it filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone's operating system and app store.</p><p>Spotify's beef with Apple centres on a 30 per cent tax that it and other digital services have to pay to use Apple's \"in-app\" payment system, making Spotify subscriptions more expensive than Apple Music.</p><p>The British government's review was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to former U.S. president Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don't face enough competition and said that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.</p><p>\"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\" Furman said. \"Some say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the U.K. can do better.\"</p><p>Britain's House of Lords recently called for a new digital regulatory authority to provide overall oversight.</p><p>EU authorities have also have faced down big tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has slapped whopping fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay back billions in back taxes. EU, German and Austrian authorities are looking separately into Amazon's marketplace platform over complaints of unfair practices.</p><p>Britain's financial secretary, Philip Hammond, said the government would respond later this year to the report's recommendations, any of which must be approved by Britain's Parliament to take effect.</p><p>Recommendations include setting up a new \"digital markets unit\" tasked with giving people more control over their data by using open standards. That would let people move or share their personal information if they switch to a new digital service.</p><p>The report's authors said by making it easier for people to switch, \"data mobility\" would result in new digital services while creating new business opportunities to manage the data. The report also recommended:</p><p>getting big companies to share key data sets with startups, while safeguarding personal information. The report said data sharing can help foster innovation and new business ideas. The panel cited as an example Uber's release of data to help improve infrastructure and planning decisions;</p><p>drawing up a code of conduct to lay out acceptable behaviour for tech companies in their relationships with users. The report said clarifying unfair conduct would allow disputes to be resolved more easily;</p><p>rewriting rules so authorities can better stop digital mergers likely to \"damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice.\" This should include letting Britain's competition regulator take into account the scale and likelihood of any harm in merger cases as well as requiring digital companies with \"strategic market status\" to inform the authority of all intended acquisitions.</p><p>Hammond said he asked Britain's competition authority to act on another recommendation: carrying out a study of the country's digital ad market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. According to the report, publishers complain that because the digital advertising supply chain is opaque, it's hard for them to get a fair return on ads that go with their content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019031453765786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMT-4601-JBTY-W0DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CFJT</classCode><className>SPOTIFY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In a damning report that singled out Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg for what it said was a failure of leadership and personal responsibility, the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the companies had proved ineffective in stopping harmful content and disinformation on their platforms. </p><p>'The guiding principle of the 'move fast and break things' culture often seems to be that it is better to apologize than ask permission,' committee chairman Damian Collins said. 'We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.' Collins said the age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end. 'The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator,' he said. Facebook became the focus of the committee's 18-month inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleged that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had obtained the data of millions of users of the social network[1]. Zuckerberg apologized last year for a 'breach of trust' over the scandal. But he refused to appear[2] three times before British lawmakers, a stance that showed 'contempt' toward parliament and the members of nine legislatures from around the world, the committee said. 'We believe that in its evidence to the committee Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at times misleading answers to our questions,' Collins said. 'Mark Zuckerberg continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world's biggest companies.' The lawmaker identified major threats to society from the dominance of tech companies such as Facebook - which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram - Google and Twitter. Democracy was at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalized adverts from unidentifiable sources, they said, and social media platforms were failing to act against harmful content and respect the privacy of users. Companies like Facebook were also using their size to bully smaller firms that relied on social media platforms to reach customers, it added.

Continue reading UK s COVID-19 health data contracts with Google and Palantir finally emerge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Contracts for a number of coronavirus data deals that the U.K. government inked in haste with U.S. tech giants, including Google  and Palantir, plus a U.K.-based AI firm called Faculty, have been published today by openDemocracy and law firm Foxglove   which had threatened legal action for withholding the information.</p><p>Concerns had been raised about what is an unprecedented transfer of health data on millions of U.K. citizens to private tech companies, including those with a commercial interest in acquiring data to train and build AI models. Freedom of Information requests for the contracts had been deferred up to now.</p><p>In a blog post today, openDemocracy and Foxglove write that the data store contracts show tech companies were  originally granted intellectual property rights (including the creation of databases), and were allowed to train their models and profit off their unprecedented access to NHS data. </p><p> Government lawyers have now claimed that a subsequent (undisclosed) amendment to the contract with Faculty has cured this problem, however they have not released the further contract. openDemocracy and Foxglove are demanding its immediate release,  they add.</p><p>They also say the contracts show that the terms of at least one of the deals   with Faculty   were changed  after initial demands for transparency under the Freedom of Information Act. </p><p>They have published PDFs of the original contracts for Faculty, Google, Microsoft and Palantir. Amazon Web Services was also contracted by the NHS to provide cloud hosting services for the data store.</p><p>Back in March, as concern about the looming impact of COVID-19 on the UK s National Health Service (NHS) took hold, the government revealed plans for the health service to work with the aforementioned tech companies to develop a  data platform    to help coordinate its response, touting the  power  of  secure, reliable and timely data  to inform  effective  pandemic decisions.</p><p>However the government s lack of transparency around such massive health data deals with commercial tech giants   including the controversial firm Palantir, which has a track record of working with intelligence and law enforcement agencies to track individuals, such as supplying tech to ICE to aid deportations   raises major flags.</p><p>As does the ongoing failure by the government to publish the amended contracts   with the claimed tightened IP clauses.</p><p>The (now published, original) Google contract   to provide  technical, advisory and other support  to NHSX to tackle COVID-19   is dated March 1, and specifies that services will be provided by Google to the NHS for zero charge.</p><p>The Palantir contract, for provision of its Foundry data management platform services, is dated as beginning March 12 and expiring June 11   with the company charging a mere \u00a31 ($1.27) for services provided.</p><p>While the Faculty contract   providing  strategic support to the NHSX AI Lab    has a value in excess of \u00a31M (including VAT), and an earlier commencement date (February 3), with an expiry date of August 3.</p><p>The government announced its plan to launch an AI Lab within NHSX, the digital transformation branch of the health service, just under a year ago   saying then that it would plough in \u00a3250 million to apply AI to healthcare related challenges, and touting the potential for  earlier cancer detection, discovering new treatments and relieving the workload on our NHS workforce. </p><p>The lab had been slated to start spending on AI in 2021. Yet the Faculty contract, in which the AI firm is providing  strategic support to the NHSX AI Lab,  and described as an  AI Lab Strategic Partner,  suggests the pandemic nudged the government to accelerate its plan.</p><p>We ve reached out to the Department of Health with questions.</p><p>Last month, NHS England and NHS Improvement responded to an FOI request that TechCrunch filed in early April asking for the contracts   but only to say a response was delayed, already around a month after our original request. (The normal response time for U.K. FOIs is within 20 working days, although the law allows for  a reasonable extension of time to consider the public interest test. )</p><p>Earlier this month, The Telegraph reported that Google-owned DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman   who has since moved over to work for Google in a policy role   was temporarily taken on by the NHS in March, in a pro bono advisory capacity that reportedly included discussing how to collect patient data.</p><p>An NHSX spokesperson told Digital Health that Suleyman had  volunteered his time and expertise for free to help the NHS during the greatest public health threat in a century,  and denied there had been any conflict of interest.</p><p>The latter refers to the fact that when Suleyman was still leading DeepMind  the company inked a number of data-sharing agreements with NHS Trusts   gaining access to patient health data as part of an app development project. One of these contracts, with the Royal Free NHS Trust, was subsequently found to have breached U.K. data protection law. Regulators said patients could not have  reasonably expected  their information to be shared for this purpose. The Trust was also reprimanded over a lack of transparency.</p><p>Google has since taken over DeepMind s health division and taken on most of the contracts it had inked with the NHS   despite Suleyman s prior insistence that NHS patient data would not be shared with Google.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/under-pressure-uk-government-releases-nhs-covid-data-deals-big-tech/\">https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/under-pressure-uk-government-releases-nhs-covid-data-deals-big-tech/</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Natasha Lomas<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2584888</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602P-T9S1-F08D-547C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1004\"/><timeReceived>9:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 5, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Senior managers will also be subject to these fines and held liable in a criminal context.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      See related\u00a0</p><p>In extreme cases, the regulator will also disrupt offending companies' business operations, and order internet service providers (ISPs) to block non-compliant platforms or apps entirely from UK markets as a last resort.</p><p>\"The era of self-regulation for online companies is over. Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough,\" said the government's digital secretary Jeremy Wright.</p><p>\"Tech can be an incredible force for good and we want the sector to be part of the solution in protecting their users. However, those that fail to do this will face tough action.\"</p><p>Home Secretary Sajid Javid also reinforced the notion that large tech firms have a \"moral duty\" to protect their younger users from harmful and extremist content.</p><p>\"Despite our repeated calls to action, harmful and illegal content - including child abuse and terrorism - is still too readily available online,\" he said. \"That is why we are forcing these firms to clean up their act once and for all.\"</p><h>Putting big tech firmly in the government's sights</h><p>As to which firms will be subject to these rules, the government cites companies that \"allow users to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online\". This translates to social media platforms, file hosting sites, messaging services, public discussion forums, and search engines.</p><p>The government has also hinted it would target the biggest companies first, with the regulator's initial 'risk-based' focus hitting companies that pose the clearest risk of harm to users. This will either be due to the scale of the platforms, or issues with online content that have already been identified.</p><p>Powers will span issuing notices to companies for breaching standards, to \"substantial\" fines for failures to remove harmful or extremist content. The scale of these fines, however, have not been defined. Senior managers, too, will be individually subject to regulatory action if found to have led their companies to breach standards.</p><p>Underpinning the regulations will be a duty of care and several codes of practice. These latter documents are particularly relevant to minimising the spread of disinformation, and extremist content online. A 'safety by design' framework too will inform developers when they create any new digital products or services from scratch.</p><p>The white paper insists that any action taken will be proportionate and designed not to stifle innovation in the digital economy. Legislative action, therefore, will be coupled with measures to promote 'tech safety', for example, as well as digital literacy to empower users to manage their own online activity and the risks this involves.</p><p>The overall package of measures, however, has been branded by critics as too \"vague\". Although the trade organisation techUK, for instance, said the measures were a \"significant step forward\", this vision will not be achieved if difficult problems are trade-offs are ignored.</p><p>\"A regulator, whether new or existing, will not thank anyone for being handed a vague remit,\" said techUK's head of policy Vinous Ali.</p><p>\"It is vital that the Government is clear about what it wants to achieve and the trade-offs necessary to do it. That means providing clear definitions of online harms and setting out how difficult boundary issues should be addressed.\"</p><p>The information commissioner Elizabeth Denham, meanwhile, said the need for these proposals reflected users' growing mistrust of online services.</p><p>\"People want to use these services, they appreciate the value of them, but they're increasingly questioning how much control they have of what they see, and how their information is used,\" said Denham.\u00a0</p><p>\"That relationship needs repairing, and regulation can help that. If we get this right, we can protect people online while embracing the opportunities of digital innovation.\"</p><h>How these plans compare against other ideas</h><p>These proposals jointly-devised between the Home Office and the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) have been several months in the making. Although the plans are subject to change, they set out for the first time how the government intends to reign in the worst tendencies of internet giants like Facebook and Google.</p><p>Ideas such as an internet regulator and a statutory 'duty of care' have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/33352/how-policymakers-are-plotting-to-reign-in-the-tech-sector\">explored extensively by a chorus of policymakers, including the Labour opposition, the House of Lords' communications committee, and the DCMS select committee</url>.</p><p>But the government's white paper sets out how such measures could translate into legislation, and what this means for many companies subject to these rules. However, there are a handful of differences between what organisations such as the DCMS select committee are proposing, and what the government is.</p><p>\"Disinformation is clearly harmful to democracy and society as a whole. The social media companies must have a responsibility to act against accounts and groups that are consistently and maliciously sharing known sources of disinformation,\" said chair of the committee Damian Collins MP.</p><p>\"The white paper does not address the concerns raised by the select committee into the need for transparency for political advertising and campaigning on social media. Again, it is vital that our electoral law is brought up to date as soon as possible so that social media users know who is contacting them with political messages, and why.\"</p><p>The House of Lords' communications committee, meanwhile, wouldn't have gone as far as the government in establishing a fully-fledged regulator; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/33184/lords-demand-digital-supervisor-to-govern-tech-regulation\">instead suggesting an interim Digital Authority</url>. This body would oversee the work of existing regulators, nullify regulatory overlaps and suggest any changes to future processes so the raft of problems can be tackled now.</p><p>\"If you make a new regulatory body then you will waste a long time before anything happens,\" its chair Lord Gilbert told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">IT Pro</emphasis> in March. \"In the meantime, all of these bodies need to be brought together, they need to be forward-thinking, and they need to be de-duplicated.</p><p>\"In time the new powerful Digital Authority may say the existing regulatory structure is not quite right and we need to either merge, change or set up some new bodies. But we don't want that to get in the way of doing stuff.\"</p><p>As for the Labour Party, these plans just don't go far enough. Its shadow digital secretary Tom Watson MP would also establish an independent regulator, in the same mould as this government's, but give this organisation the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/32937/labour-wants-to-create-a-regulator-with-the-power-to-break-up-tech\">power to break up monopolies</url>, among a suite of tougher powers.</p><p>\"The public and politicians of all parties agree these platforms must be made to take responsibility for the harms, hate speech and fake news they host,\" he said. \"The concern with these plans is that they could take years to implement. We need action immediately to protect children and others vulnerable to harm.</p><p>\"These plans also seem to stop short of tackling the overriding data monopolies causing this market failure and do nothing to protect our democracy from dark digital advertising campaigners and fake news.\"</p><h>Yet another punt into the long grass?</h><p>The government is spinning these proposals as decisively tough, and a world-first in regulating some of the biggest companies on the planet. This is indeed, as the government claims, the prelude to the world's first 'online safety' laws of its kind. And <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/31947/has-the-government-finally-lost-its-patience-with-silicon-valley\">it's remarkable to chart the journey that ministers have been on</url>.</p><p>They'll be glad, therefore, to hear the plans have largely been welcomed by the industry, in principle at least. NCC Group, for example, says these proposals strike \"the right balance\". Specifically, the security firm's global CTO Ollie Whitehouse says that appointing an independent regulator will ensure regulation will keep pace with an evolving online environment.</p><p>But organisations on all sides of the debate have found quibbles with these plans, ranging from techUK's charge of being too vague to the Labour Party's accusations that these do nothing to resolve deep-rooted and systemic issues in the tech sector. Even NCC Group's Whitehouse believes the regulations won't be effective unless they are underpinned with online safety awareness and education in schools.</p><p>This, of course, also comes in the wake of the fallout from a mass shooting in New Zealand, and voices critical of tech companies for not removing a live stream of the tragedy quickly enough. Just in the last few hours, the country's privacy commissioner John Edwards branded Marck Zuckerberg and his company Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/social-media/33404/new-zealand-privacy-commissioner-brands-facebook-as-morally-bankrupt\">\"morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide (Myanmar), facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions\"</url>.</p><p>His comments, posted onto Twitter and now deleted, are indicative of an incredibly emotionally-charged debate. It also brings into perspective what the phrase 'online harms', something that has not up to now been adequately defined, means to people in reality.</p><p>The government has now, at least, released a chart outlining three categories of online harms, as it sees things, including harms with a clear legal definition, harms with a less clear legal definition, and underage exposure to legal content. But it's still uncertain how the government, and its new regulator, will effectively enforce these laws.</p><p>The chorus of voices reacting critically to these proposals shouldn't be seen as disparaging, rather it betrays the idea of just how complex an issue online regulation is. There's perhaps a good reason that no country has yet attempted to reign in the ever-ballooning tech sector. So it's just as well that the government has opened their plans up to an extensive period of public consultation, immediately after putting their cards onto the table.</p><p>But given the white paper's release was already delayed, having been touted for 'winter 2018/19', some may see <url normalizedValue=\"https://dcms.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5nm7sPoxilSoTg9\">the 12-week consultation</url> as kicking the issue into the long grass, as the government has arguably done with Brexit.</p><p>This is justified, as we probably won't see any finalised proposals until the end of the year. But if the government uses this time to finetune and clearly establish the implementation of these measures, as against just playing for time, the sector might well be in a healthier place for it. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPITPR-33408athttpswwwitprocouk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPITPR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV6-0C11-JB2G-R2NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464401</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

All indices are higher. The Dow is up one percent. The other ones are doing even better. The triple stack shows, we are two points off all-time highs for the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ is gaining more than two percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those are the markets and these are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In just a moment, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make their first speech together since she was announced as the running mate for the Democratic vice presidency.</p><p>The U.K. is now officially in it is longest and deepest or rather, its sharpest and deepest recession on record.</p><p>And Moderna shares are rallying after winning a new vaccine deal with the U.S. government.</p><p>Live from New York, middle of the week, it is a Wednesday, it is the 12th of August. I'm Richard Quest. And I mean business, of course.</p><p>Good evening. Wall Street can live with Kamala Harris as a vice presidential nominee. That seems to be the reaction from the Street when you look at the views following the announcement that Kamala Harris will be the Democratic vice presidential nominee for Joe Biden.</p><p>In this next hour, you are going to see the two of them together for the first time as running mates. Now, it's a moderate choice in the eyes of chief executives. She favors higher Wall Street taxes, but doesn't want to break up the banks.</p><p>Because of her deep roots in Silicon Valley, she was Attorney General of California and she does of course, represent California, her views on regulation is to -- her views on tech is regulate it, not break it up. And those views closely align with Joe Biden's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You ready to go to work?</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Oh, my God. I am so ready to go to work.</p><p>BIDEN: First of all, is the answer yes?</p><p>HARRIS: The answer is absolutely yes, Joe. And I am ready to work. I am ready to do this with you, for you. I'm just -- I'm just deeply honored, and I am very excited.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jessica Dean, we are going to see them in the next hour together or at least as close as one can with social distancing. Do we have any idea how this works today.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: How this works today? Well, Richard, we are going to find out in just about an hour. Look, what we know is that all the Biden events that I have been going to as a correspondent, that my colleagues have been going to, have all been socially distanced. They have followed protocols, and they have spaced us six feet apart.</p><p>Everyone has had their temperature taken. We suspect that that will be the case today.</p><p>What remains to be seen is how close Kamala Harris and Joe Biden will get. What we don't know either is have either of them been tested for COVID-19 before meeting?</p><p>I asked Joe Biden about that about two or three week ago. At that point, he had still not been tested is what he told me. So, we will see today just how close they can get. But there is no question about it. This is so very different than a typical rollout for a vice presidential nominee.</p><p>Typically, we would have a big rally with thousands of supporters screaming, signs, all of that. We will certainly not have that today, but we will see just how close physically they can get.</p><p>QUEST: And in terms of campaigning, this is -- I realize I am just asking for rampant speculation here, but I mean, is it -- is it intended that they get on planes and go places? I guess, they have to do some traveling around the country.</p><p>DEAN: Right. No. It is an excellent question, and one that a lot of people are asking. It is one that the Biden campaign has been asking itself a lot over the last several months.</p><p>What I think is important perspective when you're asking that question, what will the campaign trail will look like for Harris and Biden moving forward is that the Biden campaign has very purposefully developed a stark contrast between the way it and Joe Biden would handle the coronavirus pandemic and the way that President Trump and his administration have handled the pandemic.</p><p>So while President Trump had that rally in Tulsa with thousands of people inside, not abiding my social distancing rules or with the mask mandate.</p><p>The Biden campaign really wants to draw that contrast and has made a big effort to make sure that they are seen as very different, that they are taking all of the precautions.</p><p>So if you put all of that together, it would really be surprising to see them jetting around the United States like a typical campaign in the fall before an election.</p><p>I think what you can much more expect to see is a lot of these socially distanced events like we have seen in the last couple months from Joe Biden.</p><p>[15:05:36]</p><p>QUEST: Jessica, thank you. Jessica Dean in Washington.</p><p>Jessica was perhaps too diplomatic to point out, so I shall -- regardless, Joe Biden of course is 77 years old. He would be the oldest President to take office if wins in November, and in itself creates a new importance and relevance of Kamala Harris, being a heartbeat away from the presidency.</p><p>It's different if you are just sort of in your 50s or 60s. But when you are 77 or 78, it takes on a new significance.</p><p>Now the agenda, therefore, has to be the same as Biden's. Firstly, expanding Medicare, that's the U.S. government program for the elderly -- healthcare for the elderly.</p><p>Also some student debt forgiveness, debt-free public college. Monthly tax credits, tax coverage and so on.</p><p>When she is on the campaign trail, on the trail looking at her own views and policies, this is how she summed it up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS: I want to be really clear because I don't want to leave you with any misimpressions. I am not a socialist. I believe in the virtues of capitalism, if capitalism is actually working.</p><p>But one of the points that one must understand is capitalism presupposes that people, if they are on equal footing, can compete and the best will rise.</p><p>Well, that's a fallacy in America today. Because most people are not starting out on the same base, and over the past many decades, the rules have been written in a way that have not been in support of working people and working families in America.</p><p>We have got to deal with that. Part of what I am proposing is that we change the Tax Code.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Patti Solis Doyle is with me, the former Joe Biden Chief of Staff and former Hillary Clinton political campaign manager. So, you know this territory really well, Patti. Let's just -- what sort of capitalist is she?</p><p>I mean, she was against Medicare-for-All when AOC and others brought that up. She seems to be a realistic capitalist?</p><p>PATTI SOLIS DOYLE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: That's absolutely right, Richard. She seems very realistic. She seems very grounded.</p><p>But the bottom line is, she is going to be the kind of capitalist that puts forth Joe Biden's agenda because he is at the top of the ticket.</p><p>Joe Biden, when he was Vice President, was the kind of Vice President who was a partner in governing, but prior to that, on the campaign trail, it was about making sure that he supported Obama's agenda. And I'm sure that that is what Kamala Harris is going to do on the campaign trail for the next three months.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But if we glean -- bearing in mind she will obviously have an influence on that agenda as the vice presidential nominee, what do you glean from the way she views for example, Big Tech? What does she -- I mean, coming from California where these areas are so significant, gives one a different perspective, don't you think?</p><p>DOYLE: Yes, absolutely. She's a senator from California. You know, the Senator of Silicon Valley, so to speak and she has worked with tech companies in the past.</p><p>But, again, Joe Biden has taken on a pretty aggressive stance in terms of issues like privacy when it comes to tech companies. So while Kamala Harris will be a voice in the room, and certainly the last voice in Joe Biden's ear as they govern, for the next three months, she is going to have to really support the current agenda, and Joe Biden's agenda.</p><p>When it comes to governing, however, as I said, that last voice in the ear of the President when the tough decisions come to his desk -- that was Joe Biden's role for Barack Obama, and when he chose Kamala Harris, that's the kind of person he wants.</p><p>So for now, you are not going see much daylight between vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and the top of the ticket, Joe Biden.</p><p>[15:10:16]</p><p>QUEST: Patti, can I take us into some real deep water, if I may? The last 24 hours since the announcement, you know, I have lost count by the number of times I have heard this is a historic decision, this is a historic move, for all the reasons that we know. First woman of color to be on the top of a -- or part of a major ticket.</p><p>Which begs the really horrible question, is America ready for that person? Bearing in mind what we have seen and the underbelly of this country during Black Lives Matter, is America ready, not just for a woman, but a woman of color?</p><p>DOYLE: You know, this is such an important question, Richard. But what we've seen over the last several months is a real reckoning in the United States when it comes to racial inequality and tackling that problem not just when it comes to social issues, but also in the workplace, when it comes to police reform, across all different sectors.</p><p>And I think that the picking of Kamala Harris is not only history making, it could be transformational because you opened up this segment, you know, Vice President Biden is 77 years old.</p><p>I am not saying, you know that he is not fit to serve, he absolutely is. He is more dynamic and engaging than I have ever actually seen him. And I worked for him.</p><p>But it is very possible that Kamala Harris could very well be our next President. And as a -- after Joe Biden. And as a woman, and as a woman of color, I think it says so much about the United States, about our country and who we are and who we are becoming.</p><p>We have shifted in very many great ways in terms of our demographics. But certainly about who we are and what we care about. And as a woman of color myself, and having worked for Hillary Clinton and spent a great deal of my career trying to get women elected to higher office, this is going to have great, great impact in how we treat women not only in politics, but in the workplace and across all sectors.</p><p>QUEST: Finally though, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. There are certain states that you are not going to try and even get. You are not going to get some of those deep states. But those three, you need to get.</p><p>They are the ones where Donald Trump won in total by aggregate of 100,000 votes. How does Kamala Harris play there?</p><p>DOYLE: Kamala Harris does a great deal of -- helps Joe Biden a great deal with cross-sectors, but certainly with women voters, African-American voters, progressive voters.</p><p>She brings energy to the ticket. She brings energy to those particular sectors of voters, and she is proven on the campaign trail. She has an incredible career. She is qualified. She is experienced. And I think in those states -- and frankly, the rest of the eight battle ground states, she is really going to energize our base and she's going to get people out to vote and that's really important.</p><p>Remember, Donald Trump won by 80,000 votes across three states. I think Kamala Harris can really help to bring all of those voters out in November.</p><p>QUEST: We will talk more, I promise you. We will come back to you numerous times between now and Election Day as you will hopefully help us understand what is happening. Patti, good to see you. I appreciate your time with us. Thank you.</p><p>DOYLE: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we will of course be taking the Kamala Harris and Joe Biden together when we see them in just about an hour from now.</p><p>Billions of dollars and billions of lives. The vaccines, and the race, and did the Russians get there first? But never mind. Moderna has got the big contract from the U.S. government.</p><p>[15:17:16]</p><p>QUEST: The major indices are all up ask. The S&amp;P is flirting with an all- time high again. Have a look at the numbers and it will show where the markets are.</p><p>Each major -- oh look, no 88 if I remember correctly, 88 is number that we are looking for in the S&amp;P to see if it is going to finish at an all-time high. My producer will tell me if I am wrong on that.</p><p>The NASDAQ is up two and a quarter percent. He just told me I am right. There is a first. So, there we are. That's the way the markets are looking.</p><p>Tesla is up double digits after announcing a stock split. That's normal after a stock split. But even so, it just shows the enthusiasm for Tesla in the market.</p><p>Moderna shares surged this morning. The U.S. government is ordering 100 million doses of Moderna's vaccine going into Phase 3 trials. It is a $1.5 billion order. Moderna has given back most of the gains by the way. It was up 10 percent.</p><p>Russia's vaccine begins Phase 3 trials today. And interestingly, only 2,000 people in their Phase 3 compared to the tens of thousands that are now in other Phase 3s elsewhere.</p><p>Eric Rubin is with me, Dr. Eric Rubin, Infectious Disease Professor at Harvard and the editor-in-chief of \"The New England Journal of Medicine.\"</p><p>Doctor, well, I mean, I think this is getting very interesting in terms of where we stand. For example, Moderna selling $1.5 billion worth of vaccines. And you look at way the E.U. has bought and all the others have bought. But still, no certainty in all of this?</p><p>DR. ERIC RUBIN, INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: I think that's absolutely true. We don't know which, if any of the vaccine candidates that are being pursued right now are going to be successful.</p><p>We have early indications that are in the right direction, but they are far from showing that the vaccine will actually prevent disease.</p><p>QUEST: They are trending in the right direction, but I would have thought that so much money is being spent that, surely, by now they would have an inkling.</p><p>I mean, it might not work very well, but by know they pretty much know that all those in testing aren't going to harm you?</p><p>[15:20:06]</p><p>RUBIN: That is certainly not true. I would say that the -- each of the vaccine candidates out there, all of them, could be still relatively dangerous or entirely safe. The small number of patients that have received it so far are not enough of an indication yet to tell us how well they are going to work, nor how safe they are going to be.</p><p>QUEST: Bearing all that in mind, let's just briefly reflect on Russia. Two thousand on a Phase 3 trial sounds low when on this program we have had the vaccine CEOs talking in the tens of thousands.</p><p>RUBIN: Yes. That's correct. I think that's a very small number to test both for safety because we would -- we could well miss one in a thousand, but very severe reactions that occur relatively uncommonly in a group that size, and for whether or not it works. Because we have to get a certain number of cases before we can tell -- we can have a statistical sample large enough to tell whether or not it works.</p><p>So I think that is a very small number.</p><p>QUEST: Doctor, I know the answer to this question before I ask it, but I am going to ask it anyway. Would you give your family the Russia vaccine?</p><p>RUBIN: I am going to give you a slightly longer answer, but it will mean no. There is a balance here.</p><p>If this were an Ebola outbreak in this country for example, and my family were threatened, I might take more of a risk with a vaccine. It's all a matter of risk and benefit, because Ebola is a hundred percent lethal disease.</p><p>But given the risks of COVID-19, which are real and severe, but are not -- where we know how to control infection, I would not use this vaccine yet.</p><p>QUEST: Doctor, what's the name of the dog? What's your dog's name?</p><p>RUBIN: Chester. And I can't shut him up. I'm sorry.</p><p>QUEST: No, don't apologize. Please, I suggest you go and take Chester for a walk. Good to see you, sir. Get some fresh air after all of this vaccine talk. Really good to see you. I appreciate your time, sir. Thank you sir. Next time we would like get to see Chester as well, I promise you. Thank you.</p><p>Now, New Zealand is re-imposing restrictions. Four new cases reported in the first 102 days. That doesn't sound many, but bear in mind, New Zealand has had a perfect record for the last 102 days.</p><p>It happened Auckland, and now, 1.5 million people are on lockdown. Bars, restaurants, and many shops forced to close. It is really simple. They are not taking any chances.</p><p>The entire country facing some level of tighter restrictions. Andy Foster is the Mayor of Wellington. He joins me now from New Zealand.</p><p>So I mean, these measures, particularly in Auckland, they sound absolutely extreme and daunting bearing in mind the low number of cases involved.</p><p>Is this an overreaction rather than trying to manage the cases?</p><p>MAYOR ANDY FOSTER, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND: Good morning, Richard, and good morning to all of your listeners.</p><p>No, I don't think so. I think New Zealand's approach has been to go hard, go early, and the fact that we've had up until now, 102 days actually free of COVID in our community meant we were able to do an extraordinary number of thing which most other parts of the world weren't able to do safely.</p><p>So, we had crowds of 30,000 to 40,000 people at rugby matches. We had concerts and those sorts of things, with live audiences, which people were able to do safely and business being able to get up and going again.</p><p>I think the clear message from our perspective is that you can't have -- you can't sacrifice health and hope to have your economy going well.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But, Mayor, the -- New Zealand has had several cases over the last 102 days of, if you like, imported COVID where you tested people at airports on arrival. They have been found to have it and had to go into quarantine.</p><p>This is the first case of community transmission. Do you know how this family -- because it is all one family -- and they hadn't travelled. Is it known how they got it?</p><p>FOSTER: No. This is one of the things that the health authorities and the government are looking into at the moment. They've said that they will get some answers to us within about 72 hours of the announcements which were made, our time 9:00 a day and a half ago.</p><p>And is he we should have some clearer answers about that very soon.</p><p>QUEST: But for somebody in your position, I mean, at best, you are going to be chasing your tail on this, because if your goal is eradication, then it only takes one or two cases like this to require total lockdown with the devastating impact -- now, I know -- we discussed this on this program many times, the balance between -- you know, you don't put economies first, so to speak. It is not a zero sum game.</p><p>But I don't know how you balance that.</p><p>FOSTER: Well, I think that there are a number of different elements to this. One of the key ones is contact tracing. So good contact tracing. I've got to say we probably have been a bit slack have been slack when we got to -- we've got a four level system.</p><p>So, Level 4 is essentially a complete lookdown except for the very essential going out and getting food and medical supplies and the services that provide those key thing.</p><p>[00:00:50]</p><p>FOSTER: Level 1 is basically everything is fine with the exception of the border. And the guide here is in theory, we should have been contact tracing at that point.</p><p>If you do good contact tracing, ultimately, you can check if somebody is diagnosed with COVID, then you can check who they have been in contact with very, very quickly and you can isolate all of those people rather than isolate the entire economy.</p><p>QUEST: Mayor, I am grateful you have given us time. It is an early start for you there, but I am sure you have been up for hours anyway. Thank you, sir. We will talk more as this goes on.</p><p>FOSTER: Absolutely. I wish you well.</p><p>QUEST: And certainly, as well, if God forbid Wellington becomes involved, then we'll talk more. Thank you.</p><p>The United Kingdom has suffered its worst GDP on record, and in fact, the U.K. is now the worst in terms of GDP loss than all other developed economies. After the break, we'll talk about that.</p><p>QUEST: Hello. I'm Richard Quest. A lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS still the come.</p><p>The U.K. economy fell off a cliff. GDP in the second quarter was just frighteningly low, Isa Soares will be with us in just a moment to discuss that.</p><p>And the CEO of the Boston Red Sox, the major league baseball's struggle at holding its season during a pandemic and playing without a crowd.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>And we'll discuss the reality of that in terms of the profitability of the game. But all of that comes after we've heard the news because this is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>The full Democratic ticket challenging Donald Trump for the White House will soon appear in public together for the first time. In other words, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are scheduled to address supporters in Biden's home state of Delaware. We'll obviously carry that live here for you on CNN.</p><p>Three people including the driver have been killed when a train derailed in eastern Scotland on Wednesday morning. The train left the tracks in a narrow valley, leaving several carriages overturned. Six people were taken to hospital and the authorities are investigating the cause.</p><p>The billionaire media tycoon Sumner Redstone is passed away. Redstone started out joining movie theaters, eventually controlling multiple studios and T.V. networks like Viacom, CBS and Paramount Pictures. His later years were marred by scandal and questions about his mental competency. Sumner Redstone was 97.</p><p>The U.K. economy shrank by 20 percent in the second quarter. It's the deepest recession of any major global economy. Now, some are blaming the government's slow response to the coronavirus both in terms of when the lockdown was introduced, then also how it was withdrawn. Look at those numbers, the U.K. GDP from the previous quarter down 20.4. Isa Soares is with me from London. And, Isa, I mean, this doesn't mean that the U.K. economy is, you know, 20 percent smaller than it was. This was a contraction. And the numbers are frightening then.</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They are. There's a -- these are colossal numbers, Richard, if we look just the second quarter, 20.4 percent contraction, the steepest we have seen since the ONS began taking records in the 1950s. And this is, like you said, a contraction due to the lockdown. And the reason for this is why the contraction is so severe, specifically, as you pointed out, in light of the other G7 countries, if we can bring that graphic up, it is incredibly steep when compared to other countries. And the reason for that, Richard, is because the U.K. went into lockdown later, and it lasted longer. And it lasted during the second quarter which you compare with the likes of Italy, much of their lockdown happened in the first quarter, Richard, and they came out in the second quarter. That's the one of the first reasons.</p><p>The second is because the U.K. industry is so reliant on -- the U.K. economy is reliant on emphasis on services and retail, that's the dynamics of it. According to the ONS, Richard, I was looking through their file today for that report, they said that the pandemic has erased 17 years of economic growth in two quarters. And when you look at the U.K. in comparison with the likes of France, Italy, Canada, Germany right there on your screen, you can see why it's such a colossal decline, but like you clearly pointed out, Richard, this is second quarter.</p><p>If we look at month by month, as I was looking today, you saw in the month of June, we've seen a sharp rise of a little -- I don't mean to sharp, I take it back -- an eight percent rise, still below the levels of February but pretty significant nevertheless. When we look at the sectors, Richard, the sectors that have been most exposed on lockdown are the ones that have been the hardest hit. Let's show you the graph. Services down almost 20 percent. We've got production also down 16.9 percent, and construction down 35 percent. The question now is, what does that recovery look like? How can -- how does the U.K. recover?</p><p>Now, the BoE said today, the economic fallout is less severe than expected. The question now is, Richard, you know, the recovery, the bouncing back, how long is that going to take? And how long is that going to look like? Or, what's that going to look like? Because I know you've been speaking about a V-shaped recovery. One (INAUDIBLE) I spoke to said, perhaps it would be a slanted V, depending on the risks we're facing. And those risks will be fully felt come autumn when we know the furlough scheme is pulled from under our rugs here in the U.K., Richard.</p><p>QUEST: So, I mean, that's the -- that's the debating point now, isn't it? I mean, no, sorry. Not debating point, but that is the issue that's being debated in the U.K., whether or not or to stop the job retention scheme as planned, or replace it with something and/or continue it.</p><p>[15:35:09]</p><p>SOARES: Indeed, whether it's tax cuts, and -- but we have already heard from the Chancellor. He said that -- the furlough scheme has lasted long enough, and they won't be expanding it. So, now, it's looking at other -- what other fiscal policy does the government have up their sleeve? But in many ways, Richard, the damage has already been done. I'm not talking just about quarterly contractions in GDP, but also about the job losses, 730,000 jobs lost in the quarter. And that's not obviously not taking consideration people in furlough.</p><p>And then you have the risks. And while the sun may be shining out today record heat that we're seeing here in the U.K., you know, we beg -- we wonder whether there's going to be local lockdowns and what that impact might have. On top of that, you have the Brexit negotiations, which also are not going anywhere. So, so much uncertainty at this moment, and that is the concern. When you're looking at the U.K. economy and a potential recovery, you've got risks and stumbling blocks all along the way, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Isa Soares. Isa Soares is in London. Thank you. The American -- the various American sports leagues are finding different ways to ensure that they can recover something from the 2020 season. But as they plan, as well, of course, for the next season and beyond, in an era of COVID, how do you have large scale sports events with or without crowds? We'll talk about it after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Welcome back. Now, the vexed question of how to run major sport -- the major league sports at the time of coronavirus, and the different ways? Well, now two of college football's power five conferences are pushing their seasons into the spring. That gets added the Big Ten and the Pac-12 are out. Both cited that the inability to operate in a bubble with students, apparently, it's simply not possible to run, they believe, these events with students in a bubble. Many programs bring in more than $100 million a year. U.S. sports trying a variety of ways in which to keep things going. And so far, so good for Basketball.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>The NBA is operating entirely in a bubble. All those involved remaining in a bubble in Orlando in Florida. Hockey has started back up in Canada, one bubble in Edmonton, another in Toronto. Again, all the players remain basically onsite in a small defined area. Baseball, Major League Baseball is not doing so. It's joining 28 cities and it is traveling between them all. Even though there have been outbreaks in St. Louis, Miami, Canada are so skeptical, it wouldn't even allow the Blue Jays to play in Toronto. So, Sam Kennedy is with me, Chief Executive of the Boston Red Sox. Good to have you, Sam. Nice, as always, to talk. How is it going? This idea of traveling to play? Is it workable?</p><p>SAM KENNEDY, CEO, BOSTON RED SOX (via Skype): Well, so far, it's going well. We've had a few hiccups as you know, you mentioned Miami and St. Louis, and it could happen to anyone, given the contagious nature of this disease. But so far, we've had less than half of one percent positivity rates since July 1st in terms of testing. So, as long as we all follow the protocols in terms of health and safety, we should be able to get through our regular season and onto a postseason. And it's been fantastic to have baseball back during the summer months here, as we all grapple with this terrible pandemic that is affecting so many of us around the globe.</p><p>QUEST: And now, on the commercial front, I mean, no playing in front of crowds. I was surprised to learn that 50 percent of revenue does come from ticket sales. I thought it would be a lot less. I thought it's mainly with sponsorship, but I was surprised that the crowd actually is a significant part of the revenue. So, if you haven't got that revenue, how -- you can't make -- you can't make ends meet. Therefore, what does that do to the finances of the company and the club?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, it's a great question. It's been -- it's very, very difficult, as you point out. We're about a $10-billion industry at Major League Baseball. And as you said, more than 50 percent of our revenues come from our fans and supporters coming through the gates each and every year. Obviously, we play every day from April through the end of September. And then, postseason play. And so, we have so much of our revenue tied up in our fan support. Our revenues have been decimated. Each Major League Baseball club owner will be suffering losses, well over $100 million each club. So, there's been a lot of debt capacity that's been -- that's been drawn upon, and we're financing our way, hopefully, to the other side.</p><p>Of course, our ownership group is involved with Liverpool Football Club, and we've had to play behind closed doors over there. So, it is devastating on a short-term basis. But we're all in this for the long haul. We see light at the end of the tunnel, and we hope to welcome fans and supporters back into our venues when the elected officials tell us that it's safe to do so.</p><p>QUEST: You know, we're a business program and much as we like the sport on the field, we need to know the hard lines, the hard-buffed lines, so to speak. When you talk about Liverpool at Anfield and you talk about yourselves, the Boston Red Sox, how long do you think you can keep it going without fans?</p><p>KENNEDY: Great question. Our hope, obviously, the virus will determine that, the answer to that question. The good news for supporters of Liverpool and fans of the Red Sox, John Henry and Tom Werner and the Fenway Sports Group partnership are well-capitalized and have the ability to keep going. So, as I said, we're in this for the long haul. But realistically, we're hopeful to have fans and supporters back at Anfield and at Fenway Park as soon as humanly possible. We're talking over here in Boston to our elected officials now about the possibility, and I stress the possibility of having fans return in September, if at all possible.</p><p>We've had good positive data with the trends here in Massachusetts. But in other parts of the country, that's not the case. We are part of a larger ecosystem. So, the truth is, we just don't know. We're going to have to be very smart and shrewd with our resources to make sure we get through to a day when there is therapeutics and vaccine readily and widely available. And I know the world is working on that scientific problem. But we hope it's no more than a one-season impact as opposed to two or three seasons. It's very difficult to go (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>QUEST: Sam, good to have you on the program. And so, let's talk again as the season sort of does wind its unhappy way through all of this, and to catch up again and find out how things do progress. I'm grateful you've given me time tonight. Thank you.</p><p>Now, in all of this, let's have a little bit of cheer and not only from Sam, of course, that they are actually playing. But let's have a little bit of cheer from the airline industry which has been so badly affected. The CEO of AirAsia, Tony Fernandes, told me things are bad but getting better and even suggested a V-shaped recovery might be possible, in a moment.</p><p>QUEST: It's not all in gloom in the airline industry, says Tony Fernandes, the chief executive of AirAsia. He even used the phrase, green shoots of recovery. And he spoke to me from Malaysia headquarters earlier this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TONY FERNANDES, CEO, AIRASIA GROUP: I'm still smiling, still standing. Our planes are flying in all our countries. We have about seven percent load factors. So, you know, it could be worse, of course it could be a lot better. But there's light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>QUEST: The future in a sense, you're quoted a couple of weeks ago saying you know, you can see a path to profitability. Do you still see that?</p><p>FERNANDES: Absolutely. I think the only, you know, question mark is How quick international borders open. They're going open. Our first one is Singapore, which I estimate will be sometime this month. And that's a big step forward for us. And then I think you'll be able to see other Southeast Asian countries opening. China has opened up a little bit to us as well. So, you know, that it's just the speed of the opening of borders, the demand is there. Most definitely the demand is there. And it's pretty v- shaped, it's pretty v-shaped.</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>FERNANDES: Yes. I mean, if you look at our domestic traffic, we keep adding capacity. The number of people who probably didn't know Malaysia or Thailand as well as they do now, because they're flying to different destinations today, wherever we can for all the (INAUDIBLE) and you know, in some of our routes, we're almost back to pre-COVID frequency.</p><p>QUEST: The possibility of your selves and Malaysia coming together.</p><p>[15:50:06]</p><p>QUEST: You know, it's a marriage whose invitation I have been hearing about for as long as both being around. And is it going to happen? Do you see any realistic possibility of yourselves of Malaysia coming together?</p><p>FERNANDES: Yes, I mean, firstly, we're Southeast Asian, we're (INAUDIBLE) we're in Thailand, we're in Indonesia. As local carriers, well, the Philippines is the local carrier. Obviously, our biggest airline is in Malaysia. I've always said that, you know, we're two different airlines. There are people such as yourself, highly-paid executives, who like to fly in business class and have a bit of champagne. And there are those in my market who, you know, are happier without the champagne.</p><p>I think we serve two different markets. And I think these two airlines should exist. It's like saying, should Mercedes Benz merge with a very low- cost car company. So, I think the two of us play a vital role in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia. And it's like a five-star hotel and a three-star hotel, very different products. So, I've skirted around the question that for 18 years, we've --</p><p>QUEST: Yes, very impressive. Very impressive, Tony. You've managed to --</p><p>FERNANDES: For 18 years, we have searched. You know, you can never say never. But I would -- I don't think it's a necessity.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, you're the first sort of CEO of an airline I've spoken to who, I wouldn't say you're optimistic, you're realistic, but you're certainly more positive than the rest of them that I've spoken to, which makes me wonder whether you're being a little rose-tinted spectacles, been through this crisis now, but as you come out the other, as well as things seem to be getting better. Are you being too optimistic?</p><p>FERNANDES: Well, that's -- we need optimism now, OK? If we put our heads in the sand and try and die, then we might as well close down now. Flying is important. Flying is an important part of the economy. And I can only tell you that and why I, you know, delay the interview a few times is I wanted to make sure that I had a story to tell you. And right now, we have a story. We are flying in all our countries.</p><p>We are filling up planes to 70 to 75 percent. We have capacity of about 50 percent of pre-COVID. That's real. That's real. We are cashflow of positive minus a couple of creditors that we have to deal with. So, by no means are we out of the woods, but there is light. It isn't all doom and gloom.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Tony Fernandes with a bit of cheer or at least, not all doom and gloom on the airline industry. The billionaire media executive Sumner Redstone has died at the age of 97. He built a sprawling empire, including movie studios, of course distribution television, CBS, Viacom, and so on. But it was a life that was also marred by controversy both in his personal life and of course in the corporations in which he owned. CNN's Brian Stelter looks back at the life of one of the industry's most colorful characters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: A media titan, whose turbulent personal life drew almost as many headlines as his deal-making, Sumner Redstone built a multi-billion-dollar business over several decades, a sprawling empire that includes Viacom and CBS with marquee brands, like MTV, Comedy Central, Showtime, and Nickelodeon. Redstone foresaw the primacy of T.V. programming, hit movies, or in a word, content.</p><p>SUMNER REDSTONE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE NATIONAL AMUSEMENTS THEATER CHAIN: I coined the phrase, content is key. Now, the phrase is ubiquitous, echoed wherever you turn.</p><p>STELTER: Born in Boston in 1923, Redstone went to Harvard Law and worked as an army codebreaker during World War II. In 1954, he left a lucrative law career to work for his dad's movie theater chain.</p><p>REDSTONE: Money, and I mean it sincerely, has never motivated me. The passion to win has motivated me.</p><p>STELTER: He built a handful of drive-ins into a conglomerate, then used his movie theater fortune to buy Viacom, Paramount and CBS. But Redstone's life was almost cut short in 1979. He survived a Boston hotel fire by hanging off the window ledge suffering third degree burns over 40 percent of his body. His personal life was stormy too, marked by legal battles with his family. When he was 92, a former girlfriend challenged his mental competency after he cut her from his will.</p><p>[15:55:09]</p><p>STELTER: A judge ultimately ruled in Redstone's favor. He also reconciled with his previously estranged daughter, Sherry. Now, she controls the media empire, that Redstone leaves behind.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Brian Stelter. If we're going to look at the markets before we take a short break, and you'll see that now -- let me just tell you, the S&amp;P did go through, its all-time high and then retreated. The Dow is up one percent, it's coming off the top. This is sort of a -- the air is coming out of the balloon. We did hit an all-time high on the S&amp;P and then it sort of couldn't really finish the deal. Look at the Dow 30 and you will see that Boeing trails the pack as it -- but Apple is the best of the day, apps Apple and Microsoft.</p><p>And Tesla has to be the star. It's announced the stock split 541. And the shares still rise, double digits, which arguably mean -- I mean, the stock or obviously, the -- that price, the split has not taken effect yet. So, but obviously, it's an indication of what the market is thinking. We'll take a PROFITABLE MOMENT after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's PROFITABLE MOMENT, two views on the economic effects of the coronavirus, the U.K. where GDP fell by 20 percent in Q2, arguably much worse than it could have needed to have been because of the way in which the country locked down late. And New Zealand, the first whiff of any local transmission and shutting down the larger city, Auckland, in the most draconian of measures, because they don't want to let it get out of the gate. Major League Baseball is quickly becoming a cautionary tale with players and staff on at least three teams testing positive since the season resumed last month.</p><p>The New Zealand view is the one that says it's not a zero-sum game between full lockdown and economic opening up because if you get the ability to do both. If you don't lock down or you don't deal with the cases when they come up, then you end up in some very serious trouble indeed, further down the road. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. The closing bell coming up any seconds now. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. I'll see you tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020081201cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K8-FNB1-JB20-G2R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000CMB0</classCode><className>AIRASIA GROUP BHD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>U.K.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Recession</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Ten</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pac-12</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>MLB</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NBA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sumner Redstone</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>AirAsia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Airline Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Entertainment Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Market</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

The Ministers of Digital and Home Affairs, Nicky Morgan and Priti Patel, have finally put forward proposals to control the harmful content circulating on social networks (in particular, those dangerous to minors or related to terrorist activities) and their scope is much less ambitious than was anticipated a year ago at the start of the public consultation period. A clear sign, british media has interpreted, that Downing Street wants to avoid a conflict with American industry in the post-Brexit era, when Johnson's will is to close a new trade deal with Washington and bet on innovation and technology as the UK's growth engines.</p><p><br/>The first sign of the transfer was the announcement that a new regulatory body will not be created to control the contents of the Internet. The Johnson government suggests that this task will fall to Ofcom, the agency that already regulates the activities of public and private televisionands and radios, as well as telecommunications companies. \"With Ofcom at the helm of a strong and proportionate regulatory regime, we have an incredible opportunity to lead the rest of the world in driving a thriving digital economy, based on advanced technology, that protects and trusts all citizens of the UNITED Kingdom,\" said Morgan.<br/>Ofcom has never addressed content monitoring, let alone protecting users' security. Its designation as a new \"vigilante\" of networks in the UK raises serious doubts, both as to its technical capacity to control such a vast area as for its final sanctioning authority.<br/>Because the second sign that Downing Street wants to avoid a confrontation with Facebook, Google or YouTube has become clear when ministers have announced that a second phase of public consultations will open, \"until spring 2020,\" before making a decision on future sanctions. The key lies in the Government's final willingness to provide the regulatory body with the capacity to bring criminal proceedings, to identify specific company managers as personally. block its contents.\" The only thing that will convince us that this project is not wet paper will be the concrete designation of the responsibility of the managers, accompanied by criminal proceedings. It's all or nothing, and it won't work if they don't have a regulatory body with the tools that allow it to take on the big tech companies,\" said Andy Burrows, the online security spokesman for the NSPPC child advocacy organization.<br/>The case of Molly Russell, the youngest under the age of 14 who committed suicide in 2017, provoked a cry in British public opinion for greater regulation of social media. His parents found the Instagram account for the least content and unresting messages about depression and suicide. Digital platforms insist on their ability to self-regulate, although in recent years new cases of online abuse of minors have continued to emerge.<br/>It's not all criticism of the government's efforts. The Barnardo Association for the Protection of Minors in the UK has shown its willingness to cooperate with Downing Street and welcomed the announced progress. \"We cannot expect minors to defend themselves. We need a regulatory law in place as soon as possible. And to do so, we will have to have the skills necessary for their effectiveness and to hold big companies accountable,\" said the association's president, Javed Khan.<br/>In the background of the debate is thetension between Dominic Cummings, Johnson's top adviser on Downing Street, who is driving a large-scale renewal in the UK economy where technological innovation would be key, and Interior Minister Priti Patel, a policy of ideas very conservative that has however made flag of the fight against child abuse on the internet. \"The Internet can be the tool to connect people and drive innovation,\" she said, \"but also the place where criminals, including paedophiles, are hiding, capable of causing great harm.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The situation in the EU</emphasis><br/>The UK has begun to set a digital path on its own shortly after reaffirming Brexit. Eu countries can also introduce national laws to regulate the Network, although, as Natalia Martos, founder and CEO of Legal Army, argues, little sense has to move away from a common strategy. \"Spain has sovereignty to develop these rules. Different is that it must then be subject to the legislation passed in Brussels. It would be a little unwise to legislate with this independence,\" he says. This is what happens with industry regulations, such as the prohibition of advertising tobacco on the internet and determining on which websites and in which time slots alcoholic beverages can be advertised according to their graduation.<br/>The regulations that regulate the internet in Spain have become outdated. The Law on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce dates from 2002, the result of a European Directive adopted two years earlier. As Martos comments, the most relevant part is the part that alludes to the legal responsibility of the publishers of a website for its contents. \"They are not responsible unless they have effective knowledge of the content that third parties add. That is, if on Facebook or Twitter they post something abusive, that incites hatred or is sexist, and they are warned, they are responsible for what is circulating there,\" he says.<br/>The Community position has been strengthened in recent years thanks to its court. Two sentences, for cases reported in Estonia, have taken into account the profit obtained through the spread of criminal conduct in an internet forum. \"If sales go up and the publisher keeps the content, it can be charged, as justice in the European Union has done. With such an old regulation, it is normal for jurisprudence to increase responsibility in some way,\" explains Martos, who advocates to improve legislation and adapt it to all the changes of the last two decades.<br/>In Europe, the founder of Legal Army clarifies, there is some reluctance to power amassed by American tech giants. Some experts even talk about digital warfare. The data protection regulation, in force for almost two years, is a clear example of these intentions. \"Competition Commissioner Vestager is up against these companies. I wouldn't be surprised if it pushed for some kind of regulation. It's a way to prevent the mass spread of criminal behavior,\" he concludes.<br/>Digitisation matters, at least according to speeches, both in Spain and in the Commission. The laws that are to come will review a content outdated by the great evolution that has been experienced on the internet. Martos is clear that they will start with gentle control mechanisms, such as codes of good practice, to make the leap to mandatory regulation. A regulation that will always combine rights and freedoms in the publication of content with legal restrictions. \"The same was the case with the data regulation and privacy protection of users. It is an obvious concern given the drifts taken by the Network,\" he ditches.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10829467</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6W-CY91-DY1R-B242-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1170\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group. </p><p>Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry. </p><p>Under the plan, expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card. </p><p>The British government isn't operating the system. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America. </p><p>Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements. </p><p>One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized. </p><p>\"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\" </p><p>Critics note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found. </p><p>The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\" </p><p>There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them. </p><p>Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down. </p><p>Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics.</p><p>Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube. </p><p>In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data. </p><p>\"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites. </p><p>Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic. </p><p>\"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said. </p><p>AgeID spokesman James Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p>\"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p>Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex. </p><p>Lawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted this month of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said. </p><p>Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on Monday but an administrative error delayed it by six months. The digital secretary, Jeremy Wright, vows it will eventually come into force. </p><p>\"There are also those who do not want those measures to be brought in at all,\" Wright told lawmakers. \"Age verification for online porn needs to happen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALSNN-BS0097980929</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALSUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMC-8NS1-DY37-F15S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306883</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Baltimore Sun Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Baltimore Sun</publicationName><edition>AdvanceBulldog Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 21, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>APFN-EU--Britain-Porn Block</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

This can range from a big tech company being investigated for its inappropriate uses of personal data to exciting announcements about a new technology, which in itself can raise questions about personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a fascinating and evolving area of law. It encompasses advances in modern cultural, which not only play a large part of the work we do at DACB, but also affects our personal lives. Below we explore a few key topics which have been a theme of recent months, crystal ball gazing to look ahead to what further developments may arise during 2019 and a highlight of interesting tech projects which the DACB team have been involved in and which data protection has been a key feature.</p><p>Big tech and privacy</p><p>The GDPR has given the regulators greater power to force companies to comply with the law and to heavily fine those who repeatedly or flagrantly breach it. Increasingly we are seeing the regulators turn their attention (some may say their wrath) towards the big tech companies, who to date had treated personal data as an asset which they could exploit for their own commercial advantage. One example of how a European regulator has taken action is the recent ruling against Google LLC (for more information see  this article). More locally, the ICO is continuing its investigation against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica - whilst the outcome of this investigation is yet to be determined, one thing is clear, these companies are now under significant scrutiny from the regulators and indeed the media. It will be interesting to see how these companies adapt their technology and procedures to enable them to continue to offer cutting edge solutions whilst acting in the confines of data protection laws.</p><p>Looking forward - AI and Blockchain</p><p>Artificial intelligence, driverless cars, the internet of things, Blockchain - these are all examples of cutting edge technologies in which personal data is used.</p><p>Blockchain, for example, has potential to transform entire industries, such as banking, logistics and healthcare and the ICO has advised that it is currently compiling guidance on Blockchain. One of its key features is that it creates a permanent immutable record of every transaction, storing personal data in the ledger indefinitely. This directly conflicts with the GDPR principle that data should be stored for no longer than is necessary.</p><p>Interestingly, in the ICO's Information Rights Strategic Plan 2017-2021, they emphasised that they will work with tech developers and innovators to ensure privacy enhancing techniques and tools are built in to evolving technology by design. They are also keen to keep abreast of evolving technologies, enabling them to anticipate the need for guidance on particular issues. It will be interesting to see the balance the ICO tries to strike between the two competing interests once it publishes its technology strategies.</p><p>Work which DACB are involved in</p><p>DACB have a dedicated team of data protection lawyers who advise technology companies across a range of sectors - including health, retail, insurance, media and banking to name a few. Over the last couple of years, we have been working closely with these companies to help them prepare for the GDPR, running training workshops, carrying out internal audits and remediating standard policies and contracts. Some interesting projects we are involved in include:</p><p> Working with NHS Digital on the legal aspects to the new NHS app, which enables members of the public to access their health records and book GP appointments online;Supporting a client who uses Facebook to collect personal information to pass on to corporate organisations who pay the individuals on Facebook to promote their products; andPresenting at the ICO's \"citizen's jury\" on AI.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p><p><br/> Mr Christopher Air<br/> DAC Beachcroft LLP <br/> Portwall Place<br/> Portwall Lane<br/> Bristol<br/> BS1 6NA<br/> UK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONDAQ-10821422</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONDAQ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGR-M681-DYX7-J138-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">149522</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mondaq Ltd.

The British government wants to require porn websites to verify their users are adults. The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy and censorshi. </p><p>It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it. \"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group. Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry. Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card. The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America. Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements. One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized. \"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\" The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN68836866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-32N1-JC8S-D1H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The British banking group reported full-year 2018 consolidated profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of \u00a31.62 billion, up from the year-ago \u00a3752 million.</p><p>* Credit Suisse Group AG swung back to profit for the first time in four years, mainly due to the Swiss banking group's restructuring program, which it completed at the end of 2018. The group booked full-year 2018 consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of CHF2.06 billion, compared to a loss of CHF983 million a year ago.

The Spanish lender had until Feb. 12 to call the five-year bonds, issued in 2014.</p><p>On lawsuits</p><p>* New York-based Rosen Law Firm filed a class-action lawsuit against Wirecard AG to recover alleged losses suffered by investors that purchased the German financial technology firm's securities between April 7, 2016, and Feb. 1, 2019.</p><p>In other news</p><p>* Netherlands-based Euronext NV revised its takeover offer for all the issued and outstanding shares of Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS Holding ASA, increasing its offer price to 158 Norwegian kroner per share from an initial 145 kroner per share and overtaking U.S.-based Nasdaq Inc.'s offer of 152 kroner per share.</p><p>* Malta's Bank of Valletta PLC shut down all of its operations Feb. 13 following an attempt by hackers to access its systems. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat reportedly said hackers had made four international transactions totaling  13 million, adding that the process of recovering the money had begun.</p><p>Featured during the week on S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</p><p>NordLB moves toward public-sector rescue amid state aid concerns: The German state-owned lender is getting closer to a public sector-backed recapitalization and is likely to abandon the shelved minority stake bid by two private equity funds. The biggest barrier for a public rescue is EU state aid regulation.</p><p>London's clearing industry confident it can thrive in no-deal Brexit: The European Union's EU's temporary access deal for clearing houses is expected to be rolled over after a year if necessary and the U.K. industry is dismissive of attempts by German rival, Eurex, to lure the interest rate swaps business to Frankfurt.</p><p>'Big tech' a larger threat to banks than fintech, says Financial Stability Board: Companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Tencent may be a bigger competitive threat to financial institutions than fintech, a report from the global advisory body says.

Each year, these symposia provide key antitrust regulators and industry leaders a forum to discuss recent developments and unveil future enforcement priorities. This year's events focused on technology and innovation, merger control and enforcement, antitrust and public policy, and litigation trends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Takeaways</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology and Innovation</p><p>At Fordham, the influence of the current populist and pro-enforcement political environment was evident as discussions focused on how antitrust regulation and enforcement can keep up with the digital or \"Big Tech\" economy and be better equipped to intervene in anticompetitive conduct. Several panelists emphasized procedural or structural changes their respective agencies had made or were considering to appropriately evaluate such a rapidly evolving area. For example, Daniel Francis, associate director for Digital Markets at the FTC, noted that the FTC has formed a new Technology Task Force that will focus on enforcement in technology markets to keep pace with the changing digital economy. At Georgetown, Bilal Sayyed, director of the FTC's Office of Policy Planning, similarly highlighted that one of the FTC's highest priorities is publishing guidance on the application of antitrust law to conduct by dominant technology firms. He also noted that big data and artificial intelligence may be topics of the FTC's future hearings.</p><p>Some panelists noted the challenges associated with regulating the evolving digital economy from a substantive perspective. At Fordham, for example, Alexandre Barreto de Souza, president of CADE, emphasized the importance of understanding different types of data and how remedies affect both sides of a data-driven platform. At Georgetown, Barry Nigro, principal deputy attorney general at the DOJ, stated that, although antitrust tools will need to be improved as regulators learn more about Big Tech, traditional tools like the consumer welfare standard can adequately ensure that Big Tech companies behave competitively. Also at Georgetown, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), remarked that the CMA was focused on avoiding past mistakes of non-intervention on tech mergers, soliciting complaints about past tech acquisitions and investigating the digital advertising sector. Andreas Mundt, president of German Bundeskartellamt, likewise noted at Georgetown that his office is becoming more engaged in digital markets, including by prohibiting Facebook's collection of data as conduct that allegedly breaches privacy rules and constitutes abuse of a dominant position (a decision that has been stayed pending appeal), as well as by conducting a sector inquiry into online advertising.</p><p>Merger Control and Enforcement</p><p>Merger enforcement was another popular topic at both events. At Georgetown, Barry Nigro touted the DOJ's use of binding arbitration to define the relevant product market in merger cases for its potential time and cost savings. He also suggested that agencies' continued ability to conduct \"quick look\" searching review in merger cases is at risk if U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's approach to Tunney Act review in the CVS/Aetna deal becomes commonplace. Nigro reasoned that agencies may have to extensively investigate all overlaps (even those that they believe do not present material antitrust issues) if Tunney Act review were to require the DOJ to prove via testimony or other evidence the absence of anticompetitive effects in areas outside of the agency's complaint. Meanwhile, at Fordham, former DOJ Deputy Assistant Attorney General Andrew Finch remarked that aggressive vertical merger enforcement will likely continue and that the DOJ and FTC are moving forward to create a single guidance document on non-horizontal mergers as an update to the DOJ's 1984 guidelines. In his Fordham remarks, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim also stressed the DOJ's commitment to international cooperation and comity in reviewing mergers to prevent inefficiencies and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Notably, there was no criticism of foreign authorities' targeting of U.S. tech companies.</p><p>At Georgetown, Kathy O'Neill, senior director of Investigation and Litigation at the DOJ, noted that the DOJ will not limit its analysis to traditional market share and concentration, but will continue to explore vertical theories, such as foreclosure. Ian Conner, deputy director at the FTC's Bureau of Competition, remarked that the FTC is looking to continue its trend of reviewing consummated mergers. Additionally, several regulators at Georgetown stressed that merging parties should raise efficiency defenses early in the merger review process. At Fordham, Andrew Finch stated that the DOJ has not changed its approach to fashioning behavioral and structural relief, and confirmed the DOJ's historical preference for the latter. Regulators shared similar sentiments at Georgetown, where Gail Levine, deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, observed that behavioral remedies are rarely imposed. She further signaled openness to the possibility of unbundling as a remedy, as has been used in Europe.</p><p>Antitrust and Public Policy</p><p>Panelists also opined about the direction of various antitrust policies. At Fordham, FTC Chairman Simons signaled support for reauthorizing the U.S. Safe Web Act as a permanent part of the FTC Act, as it gives the FTC strong power on cross-border enforcement actions. For example, Simons highlighted the important efficiencies gained by effective information sharing in cross-border enforcement actions and noted that the Safe Web Act broadens the FTC's ability to share confidential information with foreign law enforcers.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Georgetown, Gail Levine discussed the \"unintended consequences\" of mixing political goals with antitrust, including that adopting measures designed to protect domestic firms can leave them ill-equipped to compete abroad. Also at Georgetown, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive at the CMA, stressed that the upcoming U.K. election and Brexit decision will significantly influence antitrust review and that the CMA has already started to independently investigate mergers despite a parallel review in Brussels.</p><p>Litigation Trends</p><p>Finally, conference panelists spoke on trends in antitrust litigation, including how varying approaches to antitrust claims create challenges in bringing and defending against class action litigation. At Fordham, for example, panelists discussed a potential divide over the standard of review in franchise no-poach cases. Some courts, panelists noted, have denied motions to dismiss after concluding that quick-look or per se analysis may apply to the claims, but other courts could be persuaded by the DOJ's position (outlined in statements of interest filed in other franchise no-poach cases) asking courts to apply the more permissive rule of reason. Despite this uncertainty, Fordham panelists noted that additional guidance may emerge as courts issue rulings in cases that survived motions to dismiss and are now approaching the class certification stage. Panelists similarly suggested that the analysis in these cases may be clarified by challenges to class allegations at the motion to dismiss stage.</p><p>Also at Fordham, panelists emphasized how the presence or absence of raw data can impact a putative class action. Panelists, for example, discussed cases in which courts have grappled with how many uninjured class members could be sufficient to defeat class certification. Panelists also remarked on the importance of this data in the indirect purchaser class action context, particularly when courts require plaintiffs to show that a proposed class is \"ascertainable\" under Rule 23, i.e., that class members can be identified through objective criteria and a reliable and administratively feasible process. As one panelist noted, plaintiffs may face challenges obtaining the downstream data needed to make this showing.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

From cross-border payments, to alternative lending, InsurTech disruptors, to digital banks, London has been the birthplace of great FinTech start-ups, as identified in our report for the Global FinTech Hub Federation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the UK cannot yet claim to be a natural home for FinTech scale-ups.</p><p>A commonly-shared description of the shift into scaling is that a start-up becomes a scale-up by proving its business model.</p><p>The start-up phase is all about honing the product to perfectly fit the market, bringing acquisition costs below customer lifetime revenue, and getting those first revenue-positive customers in the door.</p><p>Then you can start scaling.</p><p>So far, too few of our FinTech darlings can truly claim to have entered scale-up mode.</p><p>This is not a FinTech-specific problem. The UK struggles to support firms in nearly all sectors into and through the scale-up period of their life-cycle. We have all heard the stats that anything between 50% and 90% of all small businesses fail.</p><p>Given the productive nature of scale-up businesses, it's a problem the Government is keen to solve. In his recent Budget, the Chancellor announced Treasury backing for a multi-billion programme of support targeted specifically at scale-ups.</p><p>So what can the UK's FinTech sector do to help companies transition successfully from start-up to scale-up?</p><p>Our recent  Power Up: UK business report on the scale-up challenge identified increased collaboration between high growth start-ups and large corporates as a potential solution.</p><p>In the FinTech space, small amounts of collaboration have been happening for some time; most notably between banks and alternative lenders. But now is the time to think more seriously about the benefits both parties can receive from collaboration. In Insurance, the collaboration goes a stage further - most notably because of the cost of capital and access to regulation.</p><p>The Power Up report identifies eight models for start-up collaboration with big business, from low cost and speculative options such as running a hackathon programme, to acquisition which requires significant investment and commitment. The key is for businesses to be clear about what they want to achieve and pick the right model to meet specific objectives.</p><p>The early stages of FinTech have been characterised by start-ups bringing single products to market that attempt to offer significantly better value and experience than the equivalent product at a financial services institution.</p><p>Where these institutions have offered multiple financial products and services, in many cases little attention has been paid to relatively niche areas of their offering. This created a clear opportunity for disruption from start-ups.</p><p>It hasn't been too hard for start-ups to beat banks on pricing and user experience in areas like retail FX, or small business loans. Where the start-ups find it tricky is in both customer acquisition and distributing their product. Early-adopters have flocked to these products, but breaking through into the mainstream takes considerably more effort. For a new bank or Insurance offering, what's the magic number? 10,000 customers 100,000 customers? In China for example, a new bank launched and secured over 800,000 customers in just 4 days. A huge feat when you look at it out of context.</p><p>The average person doesn't want individual providers for each of the financial products they use, they prefer the ease of a one-stop shop, such as a bank.</p><p>And therein lies the potential for collaboration. Much in the same way a supermarket owns the shelf space upon which the products of other companies sit, the bank can provide the metaphorical shelf space for new, innovative products created by start-ups. A concept explored in our Open Banking report.</p><p>This enables the start-ups to dramatically increase reach, cut costs of acquisition, and get into scale-up mode.</p><p>At the same time the institution can offer a better user experience, enhancing the relationship with their customers at a time when big tech companies might start treading on their territory.</p><p>Of course, it's not all so easy when it comes to the nuts and bolts of collaboration.</p><p>Big financial services institutions have very different cultural norms to start-ups. Start-ups might be suspicious of a bank or insurer stealing their ideas, institutions might not see the immediate benefit of handing customers off to a potential rival. The start-up might agree a deal with one part of a bank, but then find ten more people need to be convinced as well. The institution might not be certain the start-up will properly protect its customer, especially when the start-up is the subject of only light-touch regulation.</p><p>The ability of start-ups and institutions to overcome these barriers will play a crucial role in their survival and success, which is why we recommend the below 'to do list' for business.</p><p> Corporates should seek to collaborate with aspiring scaleups who can complement their capabilities and help stimulate the innovation that they are unable to achieve in-house.Corporates should streamline the processes that early stage businesses are subjected to during procurement and other functions to make it easier, cheaper and therefore more appealing for young businesses to engage and work with them.Aspiring scaleups should target partnerships with corporates who share their vision, can help them develop their offering and are able to connect them to bigger consumer networks.Scaleups should equally hold traditional business to account - work with the ones that deliver on the promise of engaging at the right pace and level. The worst possible positon for some of these is too many badge collectors or POC hell.</p><p>Access the full  Power Up: UK business report, including the findings from its survey of UK businesses</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

It said that issue would be refined in coming months through consultations on an eventual law.</p><p>Britain's proposal comes amid renewed momentum from governments - from Australia and New Zealand to the European Union - to force companies to take more responsibility for the content they disseminate, from pirated music to extremist manifestos. Those calls have grown since allegations that Russia abused social-media tools to inject polarising disinformation into the 2016 US presidential election - and were amplified after last month's terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, which the attacker broadcast live over Facebook.</p><p>The new proposals and laws represent a shift from an older model, where companies ha often remained protected by generation-old rules that shield them from liability for content their users disseminate. Companies generally have signed on to voluntary measures to curb the spread of illicit content, but increasingly face legal obligations, too.</p><p>Germany last year implemented a law that threatens up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 million ($78m) in fines for companies that systematically fail to remove hate speech.</p><p>\"The era of self-regulation for online companies is over,\" said Jeremy Wright, Britain's digital secretary. \"Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough.\" Big tech companies say they already work hard to remove illicit and harmful content, and increasingly use automated artificial-intelligence tools to do so. While tech executives increasingly say they also embrace regulation, TechUK, a lobby group for firms including Facebook, Google, Amazon.com and Apple, said the British proposal would need to become more specific to avoid subjecting companies to uncertainty. \"Not all legitimate concerns about online harms can be addressed through regulation,\" it said.</p><p>Facebook said it supports new internet regulations, and plans to work with the British government and parliament to help shape the rules. But the company also raised what has often been a tense issue for tech companies facing content restrictions: how to balance the removal of potentially harmful postings with Silicon Valley's more general embrace of free speech and free enterprise.</p><p>\"New rules for the internet should protect society from harm while also supporting innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech,\" said Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of British public policy. \"These are complex issues to get right.\" How to police internet content is one of several topics in a broader debate over how governments should exercise control over big technology companies whose products are woven deeply into millions of businesses and billions of daily lives. In recent months, European nations have pressured the US to participate in a new round of international talks about how to tax digital profits. Both the EU and Britain have commissioned reports that suggest potential tweaks to some antitrust enforcement against big tech firms. The EU passed a new copyright directive and a regulation mandating more transparency in how big tech platforms treat the businesses that rely on them.</p><p>On Monday, the EU plans to release a report it commissioned asking for guidelines for the ethical deployment of artificial-intelligence tools in the bloc.</p><p>Some lobbyists say adding regulations in Europe or the US could risk slowing economic growth and putting Western companies at a disadvantage in a technological race with China. \"Tech is becoming a highly-regulated industry, especially in Europe,\" said Christian Borggreen, vice president for Europe at US-based Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association. \"It will be interesting to see how this will impact Europe's ability to create innovative companies and be a future leader.\" Removing terrorist content has been a particular focus of many governments. Last week, security officials from the Group of Seven nations met tech companies including Google and Facebook, to discuss their co-operation with the removal of terrorist content, and called on the companies to accelerate their work.The EU is currently debating a proposed law that would threaten fines of up to 4 per cent of annual worldwide revenue for companies that don't comply with a regime that mandates the removal of all terrorist material within an hour of being posted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-fb08f2ee59b711e995e7a5d627790025ebddc5e580c34811ff4086a67a1185b8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV5-TYX1-JD3N-53FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A reckoning is coming for the biggest digital platforms.\u201d</p><p>The move comes as governments from Germany to Japan, in response to widespread calls for a curb on big tech\u2019s power, unveil measures to protect citizens from privacy breaches and anti-competitive practices thrown up by the digital economy.</p><p>Philip Marsden, a member of the Furman review and a professor of law and economics at the College of Europe, Bruges, said that, while he did not envisage the new regulator being \u201ca 1,000-person quango\u201d, he believed the unit should be \u201cfunded well and have a lot of digital and competition expertise\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>He said the regulator should also have the potential to hand out fines that could exceed the cap that applies to the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p><p>In a report published on Wednesday the CMA outlined a new regulatory regime for the digital sector. \u201cWe are concerned that [Google and Facebook] are both now so large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms,\u201d the CMA said.</p><p>Its investigation found that Google accounted for more than 90 per cent of all revenues earned from search advertising in the UK in 2018, with about \u00a36bn.</p><p>Meanwhile Facebook accounted for almost half of all UK display advertising revenues, earning more than \u00a32bn in the same year.</p><p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said on Wednesday that digital services \u201cmust work for everyone, so that the incredible benefits of digital technologies are properly harnessed, consumers are protected and innovation thrives across the economy.\u201d</p><p>Andrea Leadsom, secretary of state for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), has pledged to bring out a new white paper including proposed legislation to reform competition rules in the first quarter of next year, which is set to include the details of a new \u201cdigital markets unit\u201d.</p><p>Individuals within BEIS have been meeting with competition lawyers and academics over the past few months to establish the scope of a new regulator.\u00a0</p><p>Antitrust experts believe the overhaul to digital competition laws is both radical and necessary. \u201cThe European Commission has been handling all the big antitrust cases and now we have to scale up our national capacity for doing that [in light of an impending Brexit],\u201d said Greg Taylor, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute whose work focuses on digital competition law. \u201cSo it makes sense for bold action at the earliest opportunity.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The move has been welcomed by industry representatives. \u201cCompetitive markets are extremely important to ensuring consumer choice and driving up standards,\u201d said Antony Walker, deputy chief executive of TechUK, a non-profit industry group. \u201cTechUK believes an informed regulator is vital to securing this.\u201d</p><p>Critics, however, have expressed concern about the scope of any intervention.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMission creep is a concern,\u201d said an antitrust lawyer familiar with the matter. \u201cThere is engagement happening now [between technology companies and BEIS] to make sure everyone has a say and to ensure there are boundaries to what is being imposed, and checks and balances to prevent mission creep within the system.\u201d</p><p>A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWe want the UK to be the best place in the world to work and grow a business, which is why we are considering how to take forward proposed reforms to the competition landscape\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We will respond to the review in due course.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It is a proportionate tax, and a tax that is deliberately designed as a temporary tax.\"</p><p>But Mnuchin warned: \"If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies.\"</p><p>He added: \"We're going to have some private conversations about that and I'm sure the president and Boris [Johnson] will be speaking on it as well. This is an important issue that we'll deal with.\"</p><p>The spat between the US and UK over the tech tax comes at a sensitive time in transatlantic relations as Johnson seeks a trade deal with America - which is the UK's largest single-nation trading partner - to show he can make a success of Brexit. He hopes to seal a deal with the EU at the same time.</p><p>At a separate press conference in Davos, Donald Trump heaped praise on Johnson and insisted the prime minister's approach would result in a successful UK-EU trade deal after Brexit.</p><p>But the US has expressed its displeasure over the government's digital tax plans which it views as a targeted attack on US tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.</p><p>Downing Street later said: \"Imposing additional [car] tariffs would harm consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. We feel [the digital tax] is a proportionate step to take in the absence of a global solution. We made our own decisions in relation to taxation and will continue to do so.\"</p><p>As well as defending the tech tax, Javid raised eyebrows as he told the panel that a deal with the EU was \"of course, the first priority\" over one with the US.</p><p>Mnuchin jokily replied: \"I was a bit disappointed. I thought we'd go first. They [the Europeans] might be a little bit more difficult to deal with than we are, anyway.\"</p><p>Until now, No 10 has been treading a careful line that both the EU and US talks can be conducted in parallel, while refusing to say either one is a priority.</p><p>France, which has been planning its own 3% tax on major US tech firms, announced a truce with Washington on Wednesday in which it will not collect revenues from targeted companies this year, while it gives the OECD the chance to hammer out a global deal. The US had threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on French goods including wine and cheese, but will also now suspend that tax plan. </p><p>Government sources said the digital services tax was included in the Conservative party's election manifesto and was one of the few taxes that was actually popular with voters.</p><p>Earlier this month the US and China signed a Phase 1 trade in which the US secured greater market access to the world's second biggest economy in exchange for shelving or lowering tariffs on some Chinese goods.</p><p>Trump told reporters that he had wanted to get the Chinese talks out of the way before turning to Europe.</p><p>\"They [the EU] are actually more difficult to do business with than China. All you have to do is ask Boris. But I think Boris is going to be OK too. I think he's going to come out great. He's got a lot of guts. He's done a terrific job.</p><p>\"They're in a good position, which they would never have been able to do before Boris.\"</p><p>Trump said he wanted to see the US trade deficit with the EU dealt with before he comes up for re-election in November and said of the Europeans: \"They have trade barriers where you cannot trade, they have tariffs all over the place. They make it impossible.\"</p><p>Javid was encouraged by Mnuchin's insistence that the US was looking forward to agreeing a \"big trade deal\" with Britain. The government believes that ceasing to be aligned with EU regulations will make it easier to secure a deal with the US.</p><p>\"A trade agreement between the sixth largest economy in the world and the largest economy in the world could benefit all consumers in terms of jobs and prices. It's hugely important,\" Javid said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-59642189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-XX51-F021-6304-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><timeReceived>8:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.</p><p>Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.</p><p>Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.</p><p>The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.</p><p>Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.</p><p>One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.</p><p>\"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p>Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p>They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.</p><p>The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p><p>There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them.</p><p>Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.</p><p>Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics .</p><p>Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.</p><p>In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.</p><p>\"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites.</p><p>Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.</p><p>\"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said.</p><p>MindGeek spokesman Jim Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p>\"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p>Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex.</p><p>Lawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted last week of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said.</p><p>Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on July 15 but an administrative error delayed it by six months. The digital secretary, Jeremy Wright, vows it will eventually come into force.</p><p>\"There are also those who do not want those measures to be brought in at all,\" Wright told lawmakers. \"Age verification for online porn needs to happen.\"</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

In her speech at the launch of London Tech Week, Theresa May noted that the author of the report recommending establishment of such a body, Professor Jason Furman, will be charged with setting up the specialised unit and advising the government on its implementation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Furman Report on digital markets</p><p>The Furman Report ('Report', published in March 2019) was far reaching in its proposals and, it would seem, inspired some of the views put forward by the Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Lord Tyrie - in a letter before publication of the Report and more recently in a speech and a subsequent appearance before the House of Lords. Overall the Report's panel of experts determined that the competition rules as they currently stand (antitrust/behavioural review and merger control/transactional review) are inadequate for dealing with the (often novel) concerns that arise in modern digital markets and that UK competition policy needs to be updated accordingly.</p><p>Notably, the Report concludes that large tech players face inadequate competition - with digital markets demonstrating high levels of concentration and tending to \"tip\" to a \"winner\" who takes most or all of the market. Combined with alleged under-enforcement in merger reviews (noting that five big tech players have made over 400 acquisitions in the last 10 years and implying that some of these deals should probably not have been allowed), start-ups and new entrants appear, in the panel's view, to face considerable challenges.</p><p>'Digital Markets Unit'</p><p>Amongst the specific proposals put forth in the Report to address some of these concerns is the creation of a new 'Digital Markets Unit'. This body would regulate platforms designated as having 'strategic market status' (a status that would also require such platforms to flag to the CMA all acquisitions they intend to make - regardless of whether the UK's jurisdictional thresholds for merger control are met). More specifically, the Report recommends that the Digital Markets Unit:</p><p> establishes a digital platform 'code of conduct' for platforms that have been designated as having a 'strategic market status';pursues personal data mobility and systems with open standards where these will deliver greater innovation and competition;uses 'data openness' as a tool to encourage competition (where necessary and proportionate to achieve its aims);cooperates with a wide range of stakeholders but with powers to impose solutions and to monitor, investigate and sanction non-compliance;is empowered to impose measures where a company holds a 'strategic market status' - with enduring market power over a strategic bottleneck market; andis resourced with the capability, specialist skills and funding required to perform its functions successfully.</p><p>A paper published recently by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) confirmed that UK government has \"carefully weighed up the evidence and agree with the Digital Competition Expert Panel that there is a strong case for establishing a procompetition Digital Markets Unit, tasked with securing competition, innovation and beneficial outcomes for consumers and businesses in the digital economy\". The UK government will later this year provide its analysis of Furman's recommendations as part of a broader competition \"green paper\" which intends to stimulate discussion.</p><p>It remains to be seen what the Digital Markets Unit will look like in practice and what the scope of its role and powers will be. Crucially, the Report refrained from recommending whether it should sit within an existing regulator (ie the CMA or the Office of Communications - Ofcom), or as a new standalone regulator. The CMA has expressed disagreement with the latter approach on the basis that this would dilute existing pools of expertise. Amelia Fletcher, who co-authored the Report, recently suggested that the Digital Markets Unit could go hand-in-hand with a proposed Online Harms Regulator.</p><p>International focus</p><p>These discussions come amid a flurry of developments and commentary, both in the UK and abroad, focused on digital markets. Competition authorities globally are grappling with questions about whether current enforcement tools are adequate for dealing with the challenges posed by digital markets. In short, they are confronted with the issue of how best to harness the clear benefits of digitisation (pro-consumer innovation, etc) whilst, at the same time, curbing what some see as the development of 'ecosystems' in which (it is alleged) large tech players derive significant competitive advantage and secure positions that appear increasingly unassailable.</p><p>Prominent critics and reformers (such as Lord Tyrie and Senator Elizabeth Warren in the US) have, in particular, described a tendency towards more concentrated markets in which a small number of tech players dominate - citing, for example that five tech giants alone reportedly have a combined market cap in excess of US$3.5 trillion (greater than the GDP of most advanced nations). It is their view that this level of concentration and corporate power (especially in dynamic tech markets which feature so prominently in modern life) not only has implications for properly functioning and competitive markets, but also for social cohesion and democracy.</p><p>The UK government itself acknowledges that the status quo might not be acceptable with the UK Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, recently suggesting that UK competition rules may no longer be \"fit for purpose\" in an age of increased digitisation. In his words, \"the Furman review is really focused on the proposition that as the economy changes, the regulatory structures that we have in place have to change with them\".</p><p>To see the full article click here</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

If we don't see a pro-business withdrawal agreement signed before the month is out, this challenge will become even more pronounced and entrenched. The Brexit clock is ticking.</p><p>\"It's critical to remember that 95 per cent of small firms have never made use of the UK's points-based immigration system.

So, with Brexit looming, bosses must fear that the struggle to find qualified workers will only get worse.</p><p>Here's Reuter's take:</p><p>Unemployment unexpectedly rose to 4.1% in the three months to September from a 43-year low of 4.0% the previous quarter, as slowing job creation failed to keep pace with rising job-seeker numbers. Britain's economy added 23,000 jobs in the third quarter, a fraction of the 350,000 created over the previous 12 months.</p><p>Moreover, in the year to September there was an exodus of workers from the eight eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004. Their numbers fell by 154,000 to 881,000, a record 15 percent drop that overwhelmed a small rise in workers from elsewhere in the EU. Britain has said EU citizens already in the country will be free to stay after Brexit but many fear bureaucratic hurdles or see improved prospects in their home countries.</p><p>Sectors such as hotels and restaurants, social care, food processing and construction rely especially heavily on EU staff, particularly for lower-paid jobs.</p><p>\"We already have record numbers of vacancies, and the signs are that these skills shortages will further intensify over the next few months as EU workers no longer find the UK an attractive place to work,\" said Tom Hadley, policy director at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation trade association.</p><p>block-time published-time 3.41pm GMT </p><p> Some Brexit supporters will probably feel that that the departure of EU workers should be welcomed, as it frees up jobs for other people. </p><p>But Professor <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/nov/13/deadline-italy-2019-budget-uk-unemployment-markets-business-live?page=with:block-5bea9b8de4b064ce090a3ec0#block-5bea9b8de4b064ce090a3ec0\">Guglielmo Meardi</url> of Warwick Business School argues that this is wrong -- it could actually cost jobs.</p><p>Here's his take on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/nov/13/deadline-italy-2019-budget-uk-unemployment-markets-business-live?page=with:block-5bea9b8de4b064ce090a3ec0#block-5bea9b8de4b064ce090a3ec0\">the 132,000 fall in EU workers in the UK</url> :</p><p>\"The record fall in the number of EU workers is not just linked with wage growth, it is also linked with the rise in unemployment.</p><p>\"In some occupations these EU workers are competitors for British workers and employers now have to pay more to recruit the remaining British or foreign workforce.</p><p>\"However, in other sectors they are complementary to British workers and are needed to keep business alive.

Today is the deadline for Rome to submit a revised 2019 budget to the European Commission for approval -- and it's not clear that the EC will be any more impressed than last time.</p><p>Italy's new government appears to be sticking to its principles, arguing that the country needs a new stimulus to boost its growth. That means more spending, and higher borrowing than the EU would like.</p><p>The original plan forecast a deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2019. That sparked Brussels' disapproval, especially as EU officials suspect the growth forecasts underpinning the budget are too optimistic.</p><p>If Italy doesn't back down, it could potentially face EU sanctions. But its coalition of populist and anti-establishment parties remain committed to the spending and tax plans which won them power this year (and which Italian voters clearly want!).</p><p> Paolo Pizzoli,  senior economist at ING, suspects economy minister Giovanni Tria may make some small concessions to the EC, but perhaps nothing too significant.</p><p> Pizzoli writes:</p><p>We don't expect the government to amend its 2.4% deficit/GDP target, often considered as the unmovable political standpoint. However, on the back of poor data releases, we believe the new draft might include less optimistic GDP projections and/or the inclusion of automatic spending cuts to ensure that the 2.4% target is an absolute maximum. </p><p>This would be a small signal of flexibility towards softening the confrontational stance towards the EU, in an environment where the Italian government is being increasingly isolated within the EU Council.</p><p>  Also coming up today </p><p>The latest UK unemployment figures may show the jobless rate remains at its lowest since the mid-1970s.

New labour markets figures show a 132,000 drop in the number of citizens from other European Union countries working in Britain. The trend is driving job vacancies in the UK to a record high; there are now some 845,000 unfilled positions. Business groups warn that it's getting harder for firms to hire qualified staff. Today's jobs report also shows that the UK unemployment rate has risen to 4.1%, up from a 43-year low of 4.0%. That's because an extra 21,000 lost their jobs in the last quarter. However, the number of people IN work rose by 23,000 during the period, taking the employment total to a new high. There's good news on wages too; basic pay growth picked up to 3.2% year, while total pay (including bonuses) rose by 3.1%. That means real wages are rising, but we're still not back at pre-crisis levels after a decade. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, sums up the situation: \"The underlying state of the labour market remains strong despite unusually weak employment growth and the consequent small rise in unemployment. \"There was a significant increase in full time and permanent employment, largely offset by falling self-employment, temporary and part time work. Regular pay strengthened slightly and, with inflation falling, real pay growth has strengthened significantly. \"The slight rise in unemployment is partly explained by more people of working age entering the labour market and actively looking for work than in the past. However, if future employment growth continues to fall short of the increase in job seekers, then further modest rises in unemployment can be expected. \"Much will depend on whether the current economic and business uncertainty over Brexit and the world economy can be reduced in the coming months. \"Employers can expect to face continued recruitment and retention pressures and need to prioritise workforce planning.\" That's all for today, I think. Goodnight! Back in the markets, the pound is surging amid reports that a Brexit withdrawal agreement has finally been agreed. Sterling has surged almost two cents, to $1.3027 and on track for one of its biggest jumps this year. It's also hitting six-month highs against the euro, at (EURO)1.154, meaning one euro is worth 86.6p. According to Westminster sources, cabinet ministers will be shown the text tonight, ahead of a full cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Irish media group RTE is reporting that the plan includes a backstop agreement in which the whole UK remains in a customs arrangement, but with \"deeper\" provisions for Northern Ireland on the customs and regulatory side. Our politics liveblog has all the details: There was a particularly sharp drop in workers from eight EU countries: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia This chart shows the full details: Here's Alasdair Ross of the Economist Intelligence Unit: The Federation of Small Businesses fears that UK firms are facing a dearth of talent, now that EU nationals are in short supply. FSB chairman Mike Cherry says more firms are reporting problems hiring the right staff: \"More than one in three small firms now say lack of access to the right skills is holding back growth - up from roughly a quarter at this time last year. \"One in five small employers rely on staff from the EU. With net migration from Europe falling, it's increasingly a challenge for firms to recruit from the vital pool of EU talent based here in the UK. If we don't see a pro-business withdrawal agreement signed before the month is out, this challenge will become even more pronounced and entrenched. The Brexit clock is ticking. \"It's critical to remember that 95 per cent of small firms have never made use of the UK's points-based immigration system. If they're lumbered with complex paperwork to bring in EU staff post-Brexit that will cause a significant drag on the billions they contribute to the economy each year. Today's jobs report shows that British firms are creating much fewer new jobs than a year ago. So, with Brexit looming, bosses must fear that the struggle to find qualified workers will only get worse. Here's Reuter's take: Unemployment unexpectedly rose to 4.1% in the three months to September from a 43-year low of 4.0% the previous quarter, as slowing job creation failed to keep pace with rising job-seeker numbers. Britain's economy added 23,000 jobs in the third quarter, a fraction of the 350,000 created over the previous 12 months. Moreover, in the year to September there was an exodus of workers from the eight eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004. Their numbers fell by 154,000 to 881,000, a record 15 percent drop that overwhelmed a small rise in workers from elsewhere in the EU. Britain has said EU citizens already in the country will be free to stay after Brexit but many fear bureaucratic hurdles or see improved prospects in their home countries. Sectors such as hotels and restaurants, social care, food processing and construction rely especially heavily on EU staff, particularly for lower-paid jobs. \"We already have record numbers of vacancies, and the signs are that these skills shortages will further intensify over the next few months as EU workers no longer find the UK an attractive place to work,\" said Tom Hadley, policy director at the Recruitment and Employment Confederation trade association. Some Brexit supporters will probably feel that that the departure of EU workers should be welcomed, as it frees up jobs for other people. But Professor Guglielmo Meardi of Warwick Business School argues that this is wrong -- it could actually cost jobs. Here's his take on the 132,000 fall in EU workers in the UK: \"The record fall in the number of EU workers is not just linked with wage growth, it is also linked with the rise in unemployment. \"In some occupations these EU workers are competitors for British workers and employers now have to pay more to recruit the remaining British or foreign workforce. \"However, in other sectors they are complementary to British workers and are needed to keep business alive. Without them businesses are forced to close, contributing to the rise in unemployment. \"Ending free movement now appears to be a totally pointless aim for the UK. The effect of announcing this policy was more than enough to bring down net immigration from the EU and, given earning and demographic trends, it is very unlikely to be reversed.\" Yesterday, we were reporting that the oil price has jumped, after Saudi Arabia appeared to pave the way for supply cuts in 2019. The situation has reversed today, though; crude prices are falling sharply. Brent crude has shed 3.35% to $67.77 per barrel, and US crud has hit its lowest level of the year. So what changed? Well, Donald Trump weighed in last night, arguing that Opec should take steps to get the oil price down, not throttling supply to get it up again..... Over in the City, outsourcing and construction firm Interserve has just insisted that its turnaround programme is on track, after watching its shares sink to a new 30-year low. In a statement to shareholder, Interserve says: Interserve notes recent press commentary surrounding the Group and the movement in its share price. Interserve confirms that the implementation of the Group's strategy and the Fit for Growth transformation programme remains on track and the Group continues to expect a significant operating profit improvement in 2018, in line with management's expectations. The 'movement' in Interserve's shares has been sharp, and largely one-way. On Monday they shed 10%, and were down another 20% earlier today, to their lowest level since 1985. Delays at a Derby waste energy plant have fuelled concerns over Interserve's financial health. And pressure is mounting; this morning, one former shareholder told the BBC that Interserve would struggle to raise the extra capital it needs. However, shares are recovering as I type - now only down 6% today, following this announcement. Here's the chancellor, Philip Hammond's take: Those budget measures included a \u00a33bn giveaway that mainly benefited higher earners. That's been criticised by those who think the money could have been better directed, perhaps to fund schools or to cushion the impact of universal credit. Labour, though, have resisted pressure to oppose the measures - side-stepping a Tory tax trap?... Here's our economics editor Larry Elliott on the UK jobs data: The countdown to Brexit has seen the number of workers in Britain from the former communist countries of eastern Europe fall at its sharpest rate since modern records began more than two decades ago. Official figures covering the summer and early autumn showed a 154,000 drop over the past year in the number of people employed from eight countries - including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - that joined the EU in the early 2000s. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the year-on-year fall to 881,000 in the number of these workers in the period of July to September was the largest since 1997. The annual 132,000 drop in the number of workers from the EU as a whole was also unprecedented. Employment from the rest of the world grew by 34,000. The decline came as the latest ONS statistics showed tentative signs of easing in demand for labour but a marked increase in earnings growth. While the number of people employed grew by 23,000 between June and September, the number of jobless people rose by 21,000 to 1.38 million. The unemployment rate edged up from 4% to 4.1%. More here: Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, has analysed today's UK labour market report, and says it provides \"mixed, but broadly favourable, news.\" Unemployment rose by some 21000 in the third quarter, and the rate now stands at 4.1%. But, with an increase in the population of over-16s, employment also rose over this period. Particularly positive is the news of a huge increase (some 104000 over the quarter) in the number of full-time employees, this being accompanied by a decline of 58000 in the number of part-time employees, and also a decline in the number of self-employed workers. Underemployment, taking the form of people working fewer hours than they would like and working in less secure circumstances than they would like, has been a problem in recent years, but seems now to be in decline. \"The three-month measure of total pay increase rose to 3% in September, and the three-month measure of regular pay increase rose to 3.2%. The less reliable single-month figures indicate some easing off of this rate of increase in the most recent month, so the good news on pay still needs to be treated with a measure of caution. The sectors leading the growth in pay are construction and distribution.\" Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has flagged up that Britain is making good progress in helping disabled people into the workplace. She says the government's \" Disability Confident\" programme, which helps firms recruit and retain disabled people and people with health conditions, is paying off. \"As we celebrate the anniversary of Disability Confident, we can see seismic shifts in opportunities for disabled people, with almost a million more in work since 2013. \"That's empowering almost a million more disabled people with new career opportunities, and creating a brighter future. \"Since 2010, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen in every single region of the UK. And with an average of 1,000 people moving into work each and every day, and three quarters of all new jobs in permanent, full time and high skilled roles, this shows our welfare reforms are working and delivering for people across the country.\" This chart, from the Resolution Foundation think tank, shows clearly how EU nationals stopped coming to the UK to work after the EU referendum, or decided to leave: Resolution have tweeted some more useful charts too: Here's economist Sam Tombs on the drop in EU nationals working in the UK: Britain's unions aren't impressed by the news that nominal pay (excluding inflation) has hit a 10-year high. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady points out that wages are still below their pre-crisis level, once you adjust for the cost of living. \"Pay is rising at a snail's pace and wages aren't expected to return to their pre-crash value for at least another 6 years. \"Boosting pay packets must be a priority. That means the government putting the minimum wage up to \u00a310 as quickly as possible. And it means giving unions the freedom to enter every workplace and negotiate fair pay rises.\" Today's jobs report shows the impact of the high street retail crisis on Britain's labour force: Although 132,000 new jobs were created between June 2017 and 2018, the number of people working in wholesaling, retailing and motor vehicle repairs fell by 73,000. This was the largest annual fall in the number of jobs in that sector since June 2010. Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, fears that firms will keep struggling to find staff, which could push wages higher. \"This data suggests that the labour market is now pretty tight. Unemployment remains very low in historic terms, but is unlikely to fall much further, given the slowdown in job creation. The result of this is likely to be further upward pressure on wages as companies struggle for find workers to fill vacancies. We are likely to hear much more about worker shortages in the coming year.\" Of course, if firms can't hire enough staff, they'll struggle to grow and become more productive - which isn't great for wages in the long term..... With EU workers departing, the number of unfilled jobs in the UK had hit a record level. According to the ONS, there were 845,000 job vacancies for August to October 2018. This was: 14,000 more than for May to July 2018 44,000 more than for a year earlier the highest since comparable records began in 2001 The Institute of Directors say the pool of labour talent is shrinking [as EU workers head for the nearest port or airport in record numbers] Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, explains: \"With pay packets finally picking up, households and retailers will have something to cheer about as we reach the festive period. Meanwhile, businesses are continuing to show resilience by opening up positions and pushing for new hires. \"However, we're unlikely to be entering a 'new dawn' for persistent wage growth just yet, as firms are facing ongoing struggles investing in their productivity. Business leaders are also finding it more and more difficult to fill openings as the pool of available talent shrinks. Pawel Adrjan, economist at jobs site indeed.com, reckons UK firms are being forced to raise wages because labour is in shorter supply, as EU workers head home. Brexit is now having a significant impact on the jobs market. Today's unemployment report shows a record decline in the number of workers from other EU countries in the UK. However, the number of people born outside the UK working here has risen. Here's the details from the ONS: UK nationals working in the UK increased by 448,000 to 29.00 million EU nationals working in the UK fell by 132,000 to 2.25 million (the largest annual fall since comparable records began in 1997) Non-EU nationals working in the UK increased by 34,000 to 1.24 million. Has Britain's long run of falling unemployment ended?.... UK wage growth is less impressive once you account for inflation, of course. While nominal pay jumped by 3.2% per year (a 10-year high), real pay (adjusted for inflation) only rose by 0.9% - the best since the end of 2016. The number of people unemployed in the UK has risen by 21,000 in July-September, driving the jobless rate up to 4.1%. But.... the number of people IN work rose by 23,000 over the quarter, to 32.41m. That's the highest total since record began in 1971, leaving the employmenr rate near a record high at 75.5%. BREAKING: Britain's unemployment has risen to 4.1% in the three months to September. That's up from the 43-year low of 4%. But there's better news on earnings. Average pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 3.2% per year in the last quarter -- the biggest rise in a decade. More to follow! A new opinion poll suggests that the budget row hasn't hurt the Italian government's popularity. Support for the far-right League party has risen. EU budget battles are sometimes painted as clash between rule-making Northern members and rule-breaking Southerners. But the chief economist of Germany's Deutsche bank argues that Europe should accept that austerity is not the answer. Instead, they should help Italy cut its massive (EURO)2 trillion debt mountain. Writing in the FT, David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, says Italy has actually been more disciplined than popularly thought: Contrary to widespread prejudice, Italy has been a frugal country. Its debt overhang is a legacy from before it entered the eurozone. Since then it has achieved a primary budget surplus (the excess of revenue over non-interest spending) almost every year. By comparison, all other eurozone countries, with the exception of Germany, have racked up cumulative primary deficits. Italy's new debt since 2000 has been used to pay interest; it has not financed spending. Plus, the country has also achieved a current account surplus in recent years. So what's the solution? Folkerts-Landau argues that Europe must reduce Italy's debt servicing costs, creating space for targeted spending. To achieve that, the EC's bailout fund (the European Stability Mechanism) would have to get involved by helping Italy buyback some debt. Interest on the ESM loan would be payable when Italy's economy had achieved higher productivity and growth. It's an interesting idea --- but it would involve Brussels putting a lot of trust in Rome -- at a time when euroscepticism is rising. More here.... European stock markets have opened higher, amid hopes that Rome and Brussels could patch up their differences. The FTSE 100 is up 30 points, led by Vodafone (+7%) which is outlining cost-cutting plans this morning after posting an (EURO)7.8bn loss (partly due to writedowns). Traders are shrugging off the big losses in Asia earlier today, after Wall Street's wobble: Italy's problems are compounded by the fact that its economy is slowing. There was no growth in the last quarter, forcing several economists to downgrade their forecasts. That gives Rome even less wriggle-room to raise spending without breaching deficit limits (set as a percentage of GDP). Just in: An Italian government minister has predicted that Rome will not make many changes to its 2019 budget today. Lorenzo Fioramonti, a junior minister for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, told CNBC that: \"I don't expect the Italian government to make any substantial revisions,\" \"I think there may be a dialogue around some potential second steps, but I think the bulk, the core of what's being proposed will stay the same.\" Fioramonti also argued that Brussels needs to rethink its whole approach to economic policy, and recognise that Italy needs help to escape its weak growth and high debt. \"It is important that Europe comes to the realization that having a founding member in such a level of distress requires a collective effort to change.\" Bloomberg also expects Italy to remain committed to its previous fiscal plans, despite the EC's concerns. It says: In response to the European Commission's request for a fresh budget from Italy, the most you can expect today from Rome is a few tweaks. With Finance Minister Giovanni Tria saying meeting the EU demand would be \"suicide,\" Italy is likely to stick to its guns. Deputy Premiers Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini would rather risk a possible escalation of their spat with Brussels than go back on campaign promises. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle over Italy's budget plans is intensifying. Today is the deadline for Rome to submit a revised 2019 budget to the European Commission for approval -- and it's not clear that the EC will be any more impressed than last time. Italy's new government appears to be sticking to its principles, arguing that the country needs a new stimulus to boost its growth. That means more spending, and higher borrowing than the EU would like. The original plan forecast a deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2019. That sparked Brussels' disapproval, especially as EU officials suspect the growth forecasts underpinning the budget are too optimistic. If Italy doesn't back down, it could potentially face EU sanctions. But its coalition of populist and anti-establishment parties remain committed to the spending and tax plans which won them power this year (and which Italian voters clearly want!). Paolo Pizzoli, senior economist at ING, suspects economy minister Giovanni Tria may make some small concessions to the EC, but perhaps nothing too significant. Pizzoli writes: We don't expect the government to amend its 2.4% deficit/GDP target, often considered as the unmovable political standpoint. However, on the back of poor data releases, we believe the new draft might include less optimistic GDP projections and/or the inclusion of automatic spending cuts to ensure that the 2.4% target is an absolute maximum. This would be a small signal of flexibility towards softening the confrontational stance towards the EU, in an environment where the Italian government is being increasingly isolated within the EU Council. Also coming up today The latest UK unemployment figures may show the jobless rate remains at its lowest since the mid-1970s. Economists hope that wage growth (including bonuses) has picked up, to 3% from 2.7% last month. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Unemployment is expected to remain at current multi decade lows of just 4%. In the eyes of the market, the UK is at full employment. A slight tweak higher or lower is unlikely to have a big impact on the value of the pound. Therefore, dealers will focus on earnings data once again. Average weekly earnings are expected to increase to 3% in the three months to September, a significant jump from 2.7% the previous month. Weekly earnings excluding bonus are expected to remain constant at 3.1%. The strongest pace of the growth in a decade. Global stock markets are edgy, after Wall Street suffered a bad Monday. The Dow shedding 600 points last night, while Apple plunged by 5% after several key suppliers cut their own forecasts. This has already rocked Asia, where the Japanese stock market has lost 2% in a nervy sell-off.

In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week proposed breaking up the biggest U.S. tech companies, slamming them for having too much market and political power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British report was released the same day that Swedish music-streaming service Spotify said it filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, accusing it of stifling competition through its control over the iPhone\u2019s operating system and app store. Spotify\u2019s beef with Apple centers on a 30 percent tax that it and other digital services have to pay to use Apple\u2019s \u201cin-app\u201d payment system, making Spotify subscriptions more expensive than Apple Music.</p><p>The British government\u2019s review was led by Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was a chief economic adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama. The report found that global tech giants don\u2019t face enough competition and said that existing rules are outdated and need to be beefed up.</p><p>\u201cThe digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation,\u201d Furman said. \u201cSome say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the U.K. can do better.\u201d</p><p>Britain\u2019s House of Lords recently called for a new digital regulatory authority to provide overall oversight.</p><p>EU authorities also have faced down big tech companies. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has slapped whopping fines on Google and ordered Apple to pay back billions in back taxes. EU, German and Austrian authorities are looking separately into Amazon\u2019s marketplace platform over complaints of unfair practices.</p><p>Britain\u2019s financial secretary, Philip Hammond, said the government would respond later this year to the report\u2019s recommendations, any of which must be approved by Britain\u2019s Parliament to take effect.</p><p>Recommendations include setting up a new \u201cdigital markets unit\u201d tasked with giving people more control over their data by using open standards. That would let people move or share their personal information if they switch to a new digital service.</p><p>The report\u2019s authors said by making it easier for people to switch, \u201cdata mobility\u201d would result in new digital services while creating new business opportunities to manage the data.</p><p>The report also recommended:</p><p>\u2014 Getting big companies to share key data sets with startups, while safeguarding personal information. The report said data sharing can help foster innovation and new business ideas. The panel cited as an example Uber\u2019s release of data to help improve infrastructure and planning decisions.</p><p>\u2014 Drawing up a code of conduct to lay out acceptable behavior for tech companies in their relationships with users. The report said clarifying unfair conduct would allow disputes to be resolved more easily.</p><p>\u2014 Rewriting rules so authorities can better stop digital mergers likely to \u201cdamage future competition, innovation and consumer choice.\u201d This should include letting Britain\u2019s competition regulator take into account the scale and likelihood of any harm in merger cases as well as requiring digital companies with \u201cstrategic market status\u201d to inform the authority of all intended acquisitions.</p><p>Hammond said he asked Britain\u2019s competition authority to act on another recommendation: carrying out a study of the country\u2019s digital ad market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. According to the report, publishers complain that because the digital advertising supply chain is opaque, it\u2019s hard for them to get a fair return on ads that go with their content.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This combination of photo images shows the Amazon, Google and Facebook logos.

State officials in California and Washington are reviewing Amazon's business practices to determine whether the company is violating any laws with respect to the independent merchants that sell goods on its site. </p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, June 12, 2020, that California is examining the retail giant's business practices, focusing partly on how Amazon treats independent sellers on its platform. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File)LONDON (AP) \u2014  Britain's competition watchdog has provisionally approved Amazon's plan to buy a stake in food delivery company Deliveroo, saying it would not have a negative impact on customers by reducing choice or raising prices. The Competition and Markets authority approved a deal that will see Amazon take a 16% stake in the delivery platform. The authority warned it would re-assess if Amazon, which has a dominant presence in online retail, sought to increase its stake further. 'We've carefully considered how this investment could affect competition between the two businesses in future,'' said the CMA's Stuart McIntosh, who chaired the inquiry into the deal. 'Looking closely at the size of the shareholding and how it will affect Amazon's incentives, as well as the competition that the businesses will continue to face in food delivery and convenience groceries, we've found that the investment should not have a negative impact on customers.' The investigation was important because it suggested that authorities are giving more scrutiny to the expansion of big tech firms. But it was mired in confusion. While the deal had not been billed as a takeover by Amazon, the authority wanted to see if the agreement could 'result in Amazon and Deliveroo ceasing to be distinct.' Deliveroo described the approval as a win for British businesses. 'The minority investment will enable British born, British bred Deliveroo to compete against well-capitalized overseas rivals and continue to innovate for customers, riders and restaurants.'' it said. 'As the British economy recovers from the damage caused by COVID-19, a stable regulatory environment is critical. We therefore urge the CMA to conclude their review as swiftly as possible.' Deliveroo's delivery bikes and scooters are ubiquitous in many major cities, particularly in Europe. Besides Britain, it operates in several countries in the region and in Asia, including Germany, France, Italy and Australia.

It's a young company that is completely immune to the unstable North American cannabis sector because its focus is growing pot for the bourgeoning European market. The watchdog is set to make a final decision by Aug. 6.7 Stocks That Aggressive Investors Can Buy Now[1]There's nothing like a steep market correction to test the risk appetite of even the most seasoned investor. With many investors seeing their 401k's down 25%, 30% or more, it's not surprising that many investors are taking money off the table. And even during the most bullish market conditions, keeping some powder dry is a prudent decision. But if you have an above-average risk appetite, then sitting on the sidelines is not your cup of tea. If you're an investor with above-average risk tolerance, there are some opportunities to profit in this market. But you have to be looking in the right places. At this time, the small-cap sector offers some interesting choices. Small-cap stocks are companies that have a market cap of less than $2 billion. Many of these stocks fall under the category of penny stocks, but that doesn't make them bad. In some cases, they're just obscure companies. But right now, many investors will take growth wherever they can get it. And that's why you should take a careful look at the 7 stocks we have in this presentation. The cost of entry is not high and the potential reward is worth your interest. View the \"7 Stocks That Aggressive Investors Can Buy Now\"[2].

The reports said the Federal Trade Commission may seek a court injunction that would block Facebook's 'interoperability' plans for Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, which involves revising them to use the same underlying software. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)LONDON (AP) \u2014 Britain's competition watchdog on Wednesday signaled its willingness to push for stricter rules to counter Google and Facebook 's dominance of online advertising.  The Competition and Markets Authority said in an interim report it's concerned that the U.S. tech giants have become 'entrenched\" players in the U.K.'s 13 billion pound ($17 billion) digital advertising market, with 'negative consequences\" for the people and businesses that use them.  Google's 6 billion pounds in search advertising revenue last year accounted for more than 90% of the U.K. total, while Facebook's 2 billion pounds in display ad revenue was equivalent to almost half the U.K. total.  Big doesn't necessarily mean bad and the two companies provide innovative and valuable products and services, the authority added.  However, it said a \"lack of real competition to Google and Facebook could mean people are already missing out on the next great new idea from a potential rival.\" Lack of proper choice for consumers and higher prices for advertises could mean higher costs for flights, electronics, insurance and other online purchases, it said. 'Most of us visit social media sites and search on the internet every day, but how these firms work can be a mystery,\" the authority's Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said.  'Digital advertising fuels big businesses like Google and Facebook and we have been building a picture of how this complex new market works,\" he added. Coscelli said the authority looked at how the big tech platforms collect and use personal data, which lets Google and Facebook more effectively target ads than their rivals. They looked at how the companies monetized this data, and what it means for rivals as well as people and businesses that use their services.  There's a strong argument for a new regulatory regime that includes rules covering the behavior of online platforms and giving people greater control over their own data, the authority said.  It will now hold a consultation, which Google and Facebook said they will contribute to, before issuing a final report next year.  Google said it will 'continue to work constructively with the CMA and the government on these important areas.\"  Facebook said it's 'fully committed to engaging in the consultation process\" and agrees with the CMA 'that people should have control over their data and transparency around how it is used.\" Companies Mentioned in This Article </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AMCN134119157668877363275776100170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIPR-134119</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSB-Y711-JCMN-Y4NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"528\"/><timeReceived>5:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>MarketBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And the group of regulators that sit around the table at the EU are the most influential blocs of regulators - and if we're outside of that group and we're an observer we're not going to have the kind of effect that we need to have with big tech companies. Because that's all going to be decided by that group of regulators.\"</p><p>Denham added a point long argued by the Remain camp: that the UK will have no say on the standards and regulations implemented in the technology industry, which companies will still have to follow if they hope to trade with the Continent:</p><p>\"The European Data Protection Board will set the weather when it comes to standards for artificial intelligence, for technologies, for regulating big tech. So we will be a less influential regulator, we will continue to regulate the law and protect UK citizens as we do now, but we won't be at the leading edge of interpreting the GDPR - and we won't be bringing British values to that table if we're not at the table.\"</p><p>However, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, quashed any hopes of the UK having a seat. Speaking in front of the International Federation for European Law, <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-18-3962_en.htm\">he suggested</url> that an adequacy decision - which is granted if a non-EU state's laws are in compliance with EU regulations - would be the only thing on that table.</p><p>Adequacy decisions enable trade and data flows, but do not allow countries to be involved in shaping regulations or laws in Europe.</p><p>\"The United Kingdom decided to leave our harmonised system of decision-making and enforcement,\" said Barnier. \"It must respect the fact that the European Union will continue to work on the basis of this system, which has allowed us to build a single market, and which allows us to deepen our single market in response to new challenges.</p><p>\"And, as indicated in the European Council guidelines, the UK must understand that the only possibility for the EU to protect personal data is through an adequacy decision. It is one thing to be inside the Union, and another to be outside.</p><p>\"Brexit is not, and never will be, in the interest of EU businesses; and it will especially run counter to the interests of our businesses if we abandon our decision-making autonomy. This autonomy allows us to set standards for the whole of the EU, but also to see these standards being replicated around the world. This is the normative power of the Union, or what is often called 'the Brussels effect'.</p><p>\"And we cannot, and will not, share this decision-making autonomy with a third country, including a former Member State who does not want to be part of the same legal ecosystem as us.\"</p><p>With the ICO excluded from any sort of GDPR rulemaking - through which European data protection agencies can work together to coordinate regulatory actions - UK businesses will need to use an alternative agency to act as their lead regulator post-Brexit.</p><p>We have asked the ICO for a comment and will update when we hear back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMPTG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMPTG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFC-T5J1-DYWJ-F0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172297</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Computing</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33179\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 29, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

And the group of regulators that sit around the table at the EU are the most influential blocs of regulators - and if we're outside of that group and we're an observer we're not going to have the kind of effect that we need to have with big tech companies. Because that's all going to be decided by that group of regulators.\"</p><p>Denham added a point long argued by the Remain camp: that the UK will have no say on the standards and regulations implemented in the technology industry, such as for artificial intelligence, which companies will still have to follow if they hope to trade with the Continent:</p><p>\"The European Data Protection Board will set the weather when it comes to standards for artificial intelligence, for technologies, for regulating big tech. So we will be a less influential regulator, we will continue to regulate the law and protect UK citizens as we do now, but we won't be at the leading edge of interpreting the GDPR - and we won't be bringing British values to that table if we're not at the table.\"</p><p>However, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, quashed any hopes of the UK having a seat. Speaking in front of the International Federation for European Law, <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-18-3962_en.htm\">he suggested</url> that an adequacy decision - which is granted if a non-EU state's laws are in compliance with EU regulations - would be the only thing on that table.</p><p>Adequacy decisions enable trade and data flows, but do not allow countries to be involved in shaping regulations or laws in Europe.</p><p>\"The United Kingdom decided to leave our harmonised system of decision-making and enforcement,\" said Barnier. \"It must respect the fact that the European Union will continue to work on the basis of this system, which has allowed us to build a single market, and which allows us to deepen our single market in response to new challenges.</p><p>\"And, as indicated in the European Council guidelines, the UK must understand that the only possibility for the EU to protect personal data is through an adequacy decision. It is one thing to be inside the Union, and another to be outside.</p><p>\"Brexit is not, and never will be, in the interest of EU businesses; and it will especially run counter to the interests of our businesses if we abandon our decision-making autonomy. This autonomy allows us to set standards for the whole of the EU, but also to see these standards being replicated around the world. This is the normative power of the Union, or what is often called 'the Brussels effect'.</p><p>\"And we cannot, and will not, share this decision-making autonomy with a third country, including a former Member State who does not want to be part of the same legal ecosystem as us.\"</p><p>With the ICO excluded from any sort of GDPR rulemaking - through which European data protection agencies can work together to coordinate regulatory actions - UK businesses will need to use an alternative agency to act as their lead regulator post-Brexit.</p><p>We have asked the ICO for a comment and will update when we hear back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UKNET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UKNET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SF7-4P91-DYWJ-F014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300551</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>V3.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"36943\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 29, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF3C</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION REGULATION &amp;

As promised[1], the country is seeking to empower an independent regulator to enforce the rules which target violent material, posts encouraging suicide, disinformation, cyber-bullying, and child exploitation. Over the coming weeks, the government will consult on the types of punishments available to the new watchdog, including fines, blocking access to sites, and holding senior members of tech companies accountable for their failures.Both Facebook and Google have previously denied responsibility for the content published on their sites, evoking[2] the communications act in the US to overcome lawsuits accusing them of enabling terrorism and spreading extremist views. </p><p>But calls for big tech to be regulated have grown in recent years following a spate of controversial incidents, the most recent of which was the live-streaming[3] of the mass shooting in New Zealand on Facebook.Google, meanwhile, has been called out for the spread of conspiracy theories[4] on YouTube. And Twitter has long grappled with toxic abuse[5] on its site. Execs from all three companies have also appeared[6]before[7]Congress[8] in relation to Russian activity on their respective platforms during the 2016 US election.The new measures form part of the \"Online Harms White Paper,\" a joint proposal from the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Home Office, and have received the blessing of Prime Minister Theresa May.\"The internet can be brilliant at connecting people across the world - but for too long these companies have not done enough to protect users, especially children and young people, from harmful content,\" said May in a statement. \"That is not good enough, and it is time to do things differently. We have listened to campaigners and parents, and are putting a legal duty of care on internet companies to keep people safe.\"Earlier this year, the DCMS referred to Facebook's senior management as \"digital gangsters[9]\" in its report on fake news online. It added that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had shown \"wilful contempt\" toward the UK parliament by twice failing to appear before the committee. Facebook-owned Instagram was also recently forced to blur self-harm images[10] on its app in the UK following the suicide of British schoolgirl Molly Russell. Her parents said her death came as a result of viewing images of self-harm on Instagram and Pinterest.

Na verdade, eu quase o ignorei. Mas a notifica\u00e7\u00e3o usou o termo COVID-19, e meus olhos se arregalaram.    \u00c0s 7 horas da manh\u00e3, eu estava com os olhos turvos, sem cafe\u00edna e ainda me adaptando \u00e0 minha nova realidade de n\u00e3o poder sair de casa. Mas, pelo que pude perceber, esse rastreador estava me dizendo que havia uma poss\u00edvel correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre a frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria do meu sono e as novas manchetes sobre o coronav\u00edrus. Isso era real ou baboseira de marketing?    A Whoop pode ter sido a primeira empresa de tecnologia vest\u00edvel a me alertar sobre a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre m\u00e9tricas em um dispositivo e o COVID-19, mas certamente n\u00e3o foi a \u00faltima. Parecia que as empresas de vest\u00edveis, grandes e pequenas, tiveram a mesma ideia: que seus dispositivos pudessem ser \u00fateis na luta contra a doen\u00e7a.   \u2022 [Review] Huawei Watch GT2: \u00f3tima autonomia em um rel\u00f3gio que tem de tudo um pouco \u2022 Snapdragon Wear 4100 da Qualcomm \u00e9 nova aposta da marca para tentar melhorar smartwatches Wear OS   Parecia promissor \u2014 uma progress\u00e3o l\u00f3gica de como os wearables nos \u00faltimos anos obscureceram cada vez mais a fronteira entre a tecnologia de bem-estar e os dispositivos m\u00e9dicos.    Apple Watches e alguns  outros  rel\u00f3gios inteligentes agora podem fazer eletrocardiogramas \u2014 um teste que pode medir a atividade el\u00e9trica do batimento card\u00edaco \u2014 diretamente do pulso. Mas os vest\u00edveis se concentraram principalmente em coisas como sono, sa\u00fade reprodutiva e doen\u00e7as card\u00edacas. Detectar doen\u00e7as infecciosas \u00e9 um territ\u00f3rio novo e, sem d\u00favida, n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo para o qual esses dispositivos foram realmente projetados.    Para cada hist\u00f3ria emocionante de um Apple Watch ou Fitbit salvando a vida de algu\u00e9m, existe outra hist\u00f3ria oculta sobre a tecnologia da sa\u00fade vendendo promessas falsas e marketing obscuro que se passa por ci\u00eancia .    Com as apostas sobre o COVID-19 t\u00e3o altas, quanto disso \u00e9 um desejo genu\u00edno das empresas de vest\u00edveis de emprestar seus conhecimentos durante uma crise sem precedentes? Quanto uma a\u00e7\u00e3o de rela\u00e7\u00f5es p\u00fablicas visa aumentar a boa vontade no momento em que os consumidores s\u00e3o mais cuidadosos com suas carteiras? E ser\u00e1 que existe um futuro em que o seu smartwatch o avise antes que voc\u00ea fique doente?    Pode parecer fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica, mas h\u00e1 motivos para acreditar que os vest\u00edveis podem ser \u00fateis na detec\u00e7\u00e3o de infec\u00e7\u00f5es. Se os pesquisadores conseguem descobrir como, a tempo de fazer a diferen\u00e7a contra o COVID-19, a\u00ed j\u00e1 \u00e9 outra hist\u00f3ria.     Minha conversa pelo Zoom com Michael Snyder foi a primeira entrevista que j\u00e1 fiz em que algu\u00e9m que n\u00e3o fosse eu estava usando v\u00e1rios rel\u00f3gios inteligentes \u2014 tr\u00eas rel\u00f3gios e um anel inteligente Oura , para ser mais precisa. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito motivo para isso tudo, a n\u00e3o ser que voc\u00ea seja um cr\u00edtico de tecnologia ou esteja pesquisando poss\u00edveis aplica\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o que esses dispositivos podem fazer. Snyder, diretor de gen\u00f4mica e medicina personalizada da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Stanford, se encaixa neste \u00faltimo caso.    Snyder lidera um dos dois estudos relacionados ao coronav\u00edrus nos quais a Fitbit est\u00e1 envolvida, o Estudo de Dados de Vest\u00edveis, que busca estudar se vest\u00edveis podem prever o COVID-19. (O outro \u00e9 o estudo DETECT do Scripps Research Translational Institute, que visa melhorar a detec\u00e7\u00e3o e a conten\u00e7\u00e3o de surtos).    Ele me disse que h\u00e1 realmente evid\u00eancias cl\u00ednicas de que os vest\u00edveis podem ser capazes de detectar doen\u00e7as infecciosas precocemente com base em um estudo pela Stanford publicado em 2017 que descobriu que esses dispositivos podem ser \u00fateis para identificar quando voc\u00ea fica doente detectando anormalidades fisiol\u00f3gicas.    Michael Snyder, diretor de gen\u00f4mica e medicina personalizada de Stanford, usa muitos dispositivos vest\u00edveis em sua busca para ver se eles podem ajudar a detectar doen\u00e7as infecciosas precocemente. Imagem: Steve Fisch/ Stanford    As m\u00e9tricas exatas que os pesquisadores est\u00e3o estudando variam, dependendo o que os sensores que o smartwatch ou rastreador de fitness de um participante podem rastrear.    De maneira geral, enquanto os fabricantes de dispositivos m\u00f3veis fornecem acesso ao hardware, uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o para os pesquisadores estudarem (sua base de usu\u00e1rios) e dados para aqueles que optam por participar, os pesquisadores m\u00e9dicos s\u00e3o os que tentam encontrar padr\u00f5es nos dados.    Existem diferen\u00e7as, dependendo do estudo, mas os pesquisadores com quem conversei est\u00e3o examinando uma ampla gama de m\u00e9tricas que incluem frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca, variabilidade da frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca, sono, n\u00edveis de satura\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00eanio no sangue, frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria, temperatura da pele e at\u00e9 atividade geral para encontrar um liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre os sintomas de COVID-19 e os dados rastreados por dispositivos vest\u00edveis.    Se isso parece muita coisa, \u00e9 porque ainda n\u00e3o sabemos muito sobre o novo coronav\u00edrus, e os pesquisadores est\u00e3o procurando algo que possa se destacar.    Uma m\u00e9trica significativa \u00e9 a frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca. O estudo de Stanford de 2017 e um estudo mais recente de 2020 da Scripps Research observam uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre as infec\u00e7\u00f5es e a frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca em repouso elevada.    Mas enquanto o estudo da Scripps se concentrou em saber se os dados dos dispositivos vest\u00edveis poderiam ajudar a detectar surtos em tempo real, o estudo anterior de Stanford focou na possibilidade de detectar infec\u00e7\u00f5es antes que os sintomas externos apare\u00e7am.    Snyder participou do estudo de Stanford, que envolveu o monitoramento de m\u00e9tricas, incluindo frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca e n\u00edveis de SpO2 (satura\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00eanio), em v\u00e1rios dispositivos.    Em uma ocasi\u00e3o durante o desenvolvimento do estudo, Snyder visitou seu irm\u00e3o na zona rural de Massachusetts. Duas semanas depois, ele estava voando para a Noruega com escala em Frankfurt e, na \u00faltima etapa do voo, ele notou que os n\u00edveis de oxig\u00eanio no sangue informados em seu rastreador de fitness pareciam anormalmente baixos e sua frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca anormalmente alta.    Mais tarde, Snyder teve uma febre baixa e suspeitou que a doen\u00e7a de Lyme pudesse ser a culpada \u2014 uma suspeita que foi confirmada posteriormente por um teste de anticorpos. Como Snyder havia coletado sangue antes de visitar seu irm\u00e3o, esse era um caso bem claro \u2014 essas amostras haviam dado negativo para a doen\u00e7a.    A experi\u00eancia levou sua equipe a examinar mais de dois anos de dados de Snyder. Eles descobriram que, al\u00e9m do epis\u00f3dio de Lyme, ele esteve doente outras tr\u00eas vezes \u2014 e em uma dessas vezes, Snyder havia sido assintom\u00e1tico.    Durante uma infec\u00e7\u00e3o, explicou Snyder, seu sistema imunol\u00f3gico produz algo chamado prote\u00edna C-reativa . Uma infec\u00e7\u00e3o grave, como a doen\u00e7a de Lyme, resultaria em n\u00edveis extremamente elevados desta prote\u00edna espec\u00edfica, algo que Snyder notou em exames de sangue subsequentes, mesmo que no momento ele n\u00e3o tivesse realmente se sentido mal.    A equipe ent\u00e3o descobriu que todas as vezes que seus n\u00edveis de prote\u00edna C-reativa aumentavam, a frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca e a temperatura da pele de Snyder aumentavam antes que os sintomas aparecessem. Esses resultados foram iguais para outras tr\u00eas pessoas envolvidas no estudo. Todas as vezes foram observados batimentos card\u00edacos elevados antes das pessoas adoecerem.   \u201cEstamos falando de dezenas de milh\u00f5es de pessoas com smartwatches que podem ser protetores de sa\u00fade para doen\u00e7as infecciosas como o COVID-19.\u201d   Reportagens, m\u00eddias sociais e confer\u00eancias de imprensa do governo enfatizaram que portadores assintom\u00e1ticos podem transmitir o COVID-19 sem nem mesmo saber. As pessoas infectadas tamb\u00e9m podem espalhar o v\u00edrus nos dias que antecedem a tosse e a febre.    Dito isto, ser \u201cassintom\u00e1tico\u201d pode ser um nome impr\u00f3prio se m\u00e9tricas invis\u00edveis como frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca, frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria ou at\u00e9 temperatura da pele puderem indicar uma infec\u00e7\u00e3o. Se uma empresa de vest\u00edveis pudesse criar um algoritmo que alertasse todas as pessoas potencialmente doentes com um rastreador ou smartwatch antes que os sintomas externos aparecessem, os benef\u00edcios seriam imensos.    As pessoas saberiam quando se autoisolar. Os trabalhadores da linha de frente receberiam um aviso, e os profissionais de sa\u00fade poderiam ter uma imagem mais precisa das taxas de infec\u00e7\u00e3o. Voc\u00ea poderia fazer uma triagem para cuidar de popula\u00e7\u00f5es vulner\u00e1veis \u200b\u200bcom mais efici\u00eancia. O mais importante, voc\u00ea poderia reduzir drasticamente a taxa de infec\u00e7\u00e3o.    Esse \u00e9 o objetivo final.    No momento, o Estudo de Dados de Vest\u00edveis de Stanford est\u00e1 procurando participantes \u2014 especificamente, pessoas que tiveram um caso confirmado ou suspeito de COVID-19, foram expostas a algu\u00e9m que teve ou pode ter COVID-19 ou pessoas que est\u00e3o em situa\u00e7\u00e3o de maior risco de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, como trabalhadores essenciais.    Quando um n\u00famero suficiente de pessoas entrar no site de Stanford e fornecer os seus dados, a segunda fase envolver\u00e1 a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um painel pessoal que pode informar as pessoas quando elas est\u00e3o ficando doentes. E embora o algoritmo do estudo original de Stanford tenha sido desenvolvido usando um rel\u00f3gio Basis e alguns outros dispositivos descontinuados, este novo estudo pretende ser independente do dispositivo. Fitbits, Apple Watches e an\u00e9is Oura s\u00e3o apenas alguns dos acess\u00f3rios inclu\u00eddos.    \u201cMuitas pessoas que t\u00eam um smartwatch e est\u00e3o doentes t\u00eam se inscrito\u201d, diz Snyder. \u201cH\u00e1 muitos usu\u00e1rios de rel\u00f3gios inteligentes por a\u00ed. Existem 30 milh\u00f5es de usu\u00e1rios ativos da Fitbit nos EUA, milh\u00f5es da Apple Watch. Estamos falando de dezenas de milh\u00f5es de pessoas com rel\u00f3gios inteligentes que podem ser protetores de sa\u00fade para doen\u00e7as infecciosas como o COVID-19.\u201d    Parece bom demais para ser verdade e, sinceramente, existem muitos obst\u00e1culos no caminho.    Snyder me disse que eles est\u00e3o trabalhando a todo vapor em Stanford e acredita que a primeira fase do estudo ser\u00e1 realizada em quest\u00e3o de semanas. Ainda assim, as empresas de vest\u00edveis ter\u00e3o que obter autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o de Medicamentos e Alimentos (FDA) dos EUA antes de lan\u00e7ar os recursos preditivos de COVID-19, que \u00e9 um processo totalmente diferente.    Veja o Withings Move ECG , um rel\u00f3gio que oferece capacidade de eletrocardiograma assim como o Apple Watch, anunciado na CES 2019. Apesar de solicitar a libera\u00e7\u00e3o do FDA e receber uma marca\u00e7\u00e3o CE (o equivalente europeu), ele ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel nos EUA.    Al\u00e9m do mais, existe o simples fato de que a medicina n\u00e3o se move t\u00e3o rapidamente quanto a tecnologia \u2014 por um bom motivo. \u00c9 verdade que os testes em humanos para uma vacina contra o COVID-19 j\u00e1 est\u00e3o em andamento , mas ainda estamos a v\u00e1rios meses ou anos de uma vacina vi\u00e1vel produzida em massa.    Os pesquisadores podem ter encontrado uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o potencial entre os dados biom\u00e9tricos e o COVID-19, mas isso n\u00e3o significa que, no pr\u00f3ximo ano, estaremos verificando nossos pulsos para ver se estamos infectados. Embora a FDA tenha um programa piloto para acelerar os recursos m\u00e9dicos baseados em software, n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro se o software relacionado ao COVID-19 seria incluso como parte deste programa.    \u201cEsse software precisa antes ser lan\u00e7ado como um estudo de pesquisa, porque esses n\u00e3o s\u00e3o dispositivos medicamente aprovados\u201d, admite Snyder. \u201cAssim que voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a entrar no lado m\u00e9dico da coisa, tudo fica muito, muito regulamentado.\u201d     Voc\u00ea provavelmente nunca ouviu falar da Ava, um rastreador de sa\u00fade reprodutiva , a menos que voc\u00ea ou seu parceiro tenham tido problemas para ter filhos. Mas em Lichtenstein, o governo j\u00e1 equipou cerca de 2.000 cidad\u00e3os \u2014 mesmo aqueles que n\u00e3o estavam tentando ter um beb\u00ea \u2014 com uma pulseira Ava para ver se a detec\u00e7\u00e3o precoce do COVID-19 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel.    Entre as empresas de vest\u00edveis, a Ava se destaca como uma das poucas que se envolve de maneira proativa em pesquisas cl\u00ednicas e publica estudos em revistas m\u00e9dicas revisadas por pares. A pulseira \u00e9 um produto m\u00e9dico licenciado, que recebeu a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o da FDA como dispositivo m\u00e9dico de Classe Um em 2016 .    \u00c0 medida que a pandemia global piorava, a fundadora da Ava, Lea von Bidder, estava disposta a divulgar que a empresa estava procurando parceiros de pesquisa para ver se seus dispositivos e conhecimentos cl\u00ednicos poderiam ser utilizados.    O compromisso da Ava com a pesquisa cient\u00edfica faz com que pare\u00e7a o candidato ideal para o desenvolvimento r\u00e1pido de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o vest\u00edvel para o COVID-19. A empresa tem experi\u00eancia na obten\u00e7\u00e3o de aprova\u00e7\u00e3o regulat\u00f3ria, emprega uma equipe cl\u00ednica al\u00e9m de uma equipe de dados e j\u00e1 possu\u00eda as permiss\u00f5es necess\u00e1rias para acelerar o processo. E, como Stanford, a Ava j\u00e1 havia investigado infec\u00e7\u00f5es \u2014 no caso, durante a gravidez \u2014 e j\u00e1 possu\u00eda alguns dados.    O resultado \u00e9 o estudo COVI-GAPP , que tentar\u00e1 verificar se os cinco par\u00e2metros medidos por Ava \u2014 temperatura da pele, frequ\u00eancia de pulso em repouso, perfus\u00e3o, frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria e variabilidade da frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca \u2014 podem ser usados \u200b\u200bpara criar um algoritmo que identificaria o COVID-19 em um est\u00e1gio inicial, \u201cmesmo quando n\u00e3o h\u00e1 sintomas t\u00edpicos da doen\u00e7a\u201d.    2.000 cidad\u00e3os de Lichtenstein est\u00e3o usando o rastreador Ava em um grande estudo para ver se ele consegue detectar o COVID-19 cedo. Foto: Victoria Song/Gizmodo    Em termos de objetivos, este estudo COVI-GAPP e o Estudo de Dados de Vest\u00edveis da Stanford n\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito diferentes. Ambos coletar\u00e3o dados, procurar\u00e3o padr\u00f5es e, espera-se, construir\u00e3o um algoritmo capaz de detectar o COVID-19 antes que os sintomas apare\u00e7am. H\u00e1 uma diferen\u00e7a not\u00e1vel, no entanto, em termos de expectativas.    Ao telefone, von Bidder parecia determinada, mas tamb\u00e9m realista ao discutir o que o estudo espera alcan\u00e7ar. Por exemplo, enquanto Snyder espera desenvolver um algoritmo vi\u00e1vel \u2014 ou pelo menos um prot\u00f3tipo de um \u2014 para ajudar a crise nos pr\u00f3ximos meses, von Bidder tem como alvo uma segunda onda potencial de infec\u00e7\u00f5es por COVID-19.    De fato, os primeiros \u201cresultados tang\u00edveis\u201d do estudo COVI-GAPP n\u00e3o s\u00e3o esperados at\u00e9 o \u00faltimo trimestre de 2020. Depois disso, o estudo passar\u00e1 para uma segunda fase, que incluiria toda a popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Lichtenstein \u2014 e isso pressup\u00f5e que os pesquisadores encontrem alguma coisa a princ\u00edpio.    \u201cAinda nem sabemos como esses par\u00e2metros interagem com o COVID-19\u201d, von Bidder me disse. \u201cVamos come\u00e7ar por a\u00ed. Essa coisa toda pode nunca funcionar. Acho que h\u00e1 motivos suficientes para acreditar que vai funcionar, mas ainda n\u00e3o sabemos se funcionar\u00e1 r\u00e1pido o suficiente. Minha suposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 que chegaremos l\u00e1, caso contr\u00e1rio, eu n\u00e3o investiria todo esse tempo e dinheiro na tentativa de descobrir, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o simples assim\u201d.   \u201cVoc\u00ea poderia dizer \u00e0s pessoas que elas est\u00e3o com COVID-19 quando n\u00e3o t\u00eam e dizer a outras pessoas que n\u00e3o t\u00eam, quando elas est\u00e3o doentes.\u201d   Mesmo que os pesquisadores encontrem uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as m\u00e9tricas que a Ava pode rastrear e o COVID-19, ainda h\u00e1 uma quest\u00e3o de sensibilidade e especificidade. N\u00e3o \u00e9 muito \u00fatil se um dispositivo vest\u00edvel puder detectar que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 com febre quando voc\u00ea j\u00e1 sabe que est\u00e1. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m a quest\u00e3o de como notificar algu\u00e9m sobre um diagn\u00f3stico potencialmente traum\u00e1tico.    \u201c\u00c9 melhor dizer para voc\u00ea: \u2018Voc\u00ea definitivamente tem COVID-19\u2019 , ou dizer: \u2018Ei, voc\u00ea pode ter COVID-19, fa\u00e7a o teste\u2019?\u201d, perguntou von Bidder. \u201cEssa \u00e9 uma aplica\u00e7\u00e3o altamente m\u00e9dica, porque voc\u00ea realmente interfere e precisa ter muita certeza do que est\u00e1 fazendo. Voc\u00ea poderia dizer \u00e0s pessoas que elas est\u00e3o com COVID-19 quando elas n\u00e3o est\u00e3o e dizer a outras pessoas que n\u00e3o est\u00e3o quando elas est\u00e3o doentes.\u201d    Snyder tamb\u00e9m foi franco quanto a poss\u00edveis limita\u00e7\u00f5es. A temperatura da pele, embora seja uma m\u00e9trica l\u00f3gica para determinar se uma pessoa pode ter COVID-19, n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo que todos os rastreadores podem medir. Al\u00e9m disso, muitas pessoas infectadas com o novo coronav\u00edrus podem nunca ter febre . A precis\u00e3o das leituras de temperatura da pele tamb\u00e9m depende de qu\u00e3o frequentemente, ou n\u00e3o, uma pessoa usa seu dispositivo.    Por fim, ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro se algum algoritmo poderia distinguir entre tipos de infec\u00e7\u00f5es virais \u2014 como o dispositivo poderia diferenciar entre uma gripe ou resfriado comum e o COVID-19?    Al\u00e9m do mais, h\u00e1 a quest\u00e3o de saber se os vest\u00edveis seriam capazes de detectar a infec\u00e7\u00e3o com rapidez suficiente.   O problema com os dados \u00e9 que eles podem ser muito ruidosos.   \u201cMinha \u00fanica preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 que, mesmo considerando indiv\u00edduos sintom\u00e1ticos, o grau mais alto de transmiss\u00e3o e difus\u00e3o viral realmente est\u00e1 no per\u00edodo pr\u00e9-sintom\u00e1tico\u201d, disse Thomas Tsai, professor assistente do Departamento de Pol\u00edtica e Gerenciamento de Sa\u00fade da Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, ao Gizmodo por telefone. \u201cEnt\u00e3o, na verdade, \u00e9 improv\u00e1vel que os vest\u00edveis possam prever o per\u00edodo mais infeccioso.\u201d    Tsai continuou observando que \u00e9 bom que esse tipo de pesquisa esteja acontecendo. Quanto mais aprendermos sobre o COVID-19, melhores as autoridades de sa\u00fade p\u00fablica poder\u00e3o enfrentar a pandemia de maneira eficaz.    O problema com os dados \u00e9 que eles podem ser muito ruidosos. Sua frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca pode se elevar porque voc\u00ea est\u00e1 assistindo a um filme de terror, e talvez sua frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria adormecida n\u00e3o seja ideal porque seu gato mia muito alto todas as noites \u00e0s 4 da manh\u00e3.    Voltando ao estudo de Stanford de 2017, Tsai \u00e9 um pouco c\u00e9tico sobre a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre prote\u00ednas C-reativas e frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca.    Uma r\u00e1pida atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o: o estudo identificou altos n\u00edveis de prote\u00edna C-reativa com frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca elevada como sinal de doen\u00e7a. No entanto, os vest\u00edveis dispon\u00edveis comercialmente podem nem ter os sensores apropriados para medir de forma consistente e precisa os n\u00edveis de prote\u00edna C-reativa. Mesmo que essa correla\u00e7\u00e3o seja confirmada no atual estudo em andamento, n\u00e3o \u00e9 garantido que tenha um impacto na forma como os m\u00e9dicos tratam a COVID-19.    \u201cA prote\u00edna C-reativa \u00e9 um marcador muito inespec\u00edfico para a inflama\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, explica Tsai. \u201cMinha preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 quando olhamos para tr\u00e1s e tentamos encontrar padr\u00f5es entre a frequ\u00eancia card\u00edaca e alguns marcadores que vemos, retrospectivamente, em padr\u00f5es baseados em dados ruidosos. Eles podem realmente n\u00e3o mudar o curso cl\u00ednico.\u201d     Mas mesmo que o sinal seja encontrado, a burocracia n\u00e3o foi a lugar algum. O estudo COVI-GAPP \u00e9 um ponto fora da curva. O dispositivo Ava n\u00e3o apenas tem experi\u00eancia em superar obst\u00e1culos regulat\u00f3rios, mas o governo de Lichtenstein tamb\u00e9m foi r\u00e1pido, proativo e pronto para abrir a carteira para financiar esse tipo de pesquisa em dispositivos m\u00e9dicos. Lichtenstein tamb\u00e9m tem uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o pequena e confinada.    Mas os EUA s\u00e3o uma na\u00e7\u00e3o grande e extensa, que foi lenta e mal preparada para impedir a dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de COVID-19. Em fevereiro, a FDA emitiu uma Autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Uso de Emerg\u00eancia para dispositivos m\u00e9dicos \u00e0 luz da pandemia. Se ele for \u00fatil permanece um mist\u00e9rio. No entanto, isso levou as pessoas a serem criativas em encontrar novas maneiras de usar a tecnologia para ajudar na falta de equipamentos que salvam vidas, como ventiladores e equipamentos de prote\u00e7\u00e3o individual.    A Fitbit tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 trabalhando com pesquisadores para encontrar maneiras de detectar a COVID-19 mais cedo. Foto: Victoria Song/Gizmodo    Tamb\u00e9m poderia teoricamente ser usado por empresas de vest\u00edveis que implementam algoritmos de detec\u00e7\u00e3o. Pedi \u00e0 FDA que esclarecesse se consideraria aprova\u00e7\u00f5es de rastreamento r\u00e1pido para um algoritmo para detectar precocemente o COVID-19 usando o software para vest\u00edveis existentes.    Em resposta, a FDA me enviou sua pol\u00edtica de sa\u00fade digital para o COVID-19 . De acordo com a pol\u00edtica, a maioria dos aplicativos e sistemas de software para \u201cvigil\u00e2ncia e comunica\u00e7\u00e3o em sa\u00fade p\u00fablica\u201d n\u00e3o exige autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o ou aprova\u00e7\u00e3o, pois n\u00e3o s\u00e3o dispositivos m\u00e9dicos.    A pol\u00edtica tamb\u00e9m declara que a FDA \u201cn\u00e3o pretende impor os requisitos da Lei de Alimentos, Medicamentos e Cosm\u00e9ticos no momento para determinados softwares de menor risco\u201d \u2014 mas n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro se os algoritmos de detec\u00e7\u00e3o precoce se enquadram nessa categoria. Provavelmente n\u00e3o.    Para softwares de alto risco \u2014 qualquer tipo de recurso de diagn\u00f3stico, por exemplo \u2014 a pol\u00edtica se refere ao processo da Autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Uso de Emerg\u00eancia. Isso significa que, mesmo com processos acelerados, verificar esse tipo de tecnologia experimental provavelmente levar\u00e1 mais tempo do que qualquer um gostaria. Dito isto, uma orienta\u00e7\u00e3o clara da FDA \u00e9 absolutamente necess\u00e1ria do ponto de vista de seguran\u00e7a.    Para o consumidor m\u00e9dio, as linhas entre os recursos educacionais e os dispositivos de diagn\u00f3stico \u00e0s vezes podem ser muito t\u00eanues.    Pegue o Whoop, por exemplo, o rastreador do sono que eu estava testando quando vi uma notifica\u00e7\u00e3o sobre COVID-19. A pol\u00edtica de sa\u00fade digital da FDA explica por que o Whoop pode implementar rapidamente uma m\u00e9trica da frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria: enquanto o pr\u00f3prio aplicativo Whoop explica a poss\u00edvel rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria e COVID-19, a empresa fornece a m\u00e9trica para monitoramento passivo ou registro no di\u00e1rio do usu\u00e1rio. O Whoop n\u00e3o vai dizer se voc\u00ea tem COVID-19 ou o que fazer se sua frequ\u00eancia respirat\u00f3ria mudar drasticamente da noite para o dia.    Emily Capodilupo, vice-presidente de ci\u00eancia e pesquisa de dados do Whoop, disse em um recente podcast que o rastreador \u201cn\u00e3o \u00e9 um dispositivo m\u00e9dico\u201d e que o objetivo n\u00e3o \u00e9 \u201cdiagnosticar qualquer doen\u00e7a ou condi\u00e7\u00e3o, especialmente que n\u00e3o seja COVID-19 ou gripe\u201d.    A ideia \u00e9 conscientizar os usu\u00e1rios de suas linhas de base, com o conhecimento de que uma mudan\u00e7a repentina e dr\u00e1stica pode sinalizar\u2026 alguma coisa. Dito isto, o Whoop tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 participando de um estudo com a Cleveland Clinic e Universidade Central de Queensland, na Austr\u00e1lia, para ver se h\u00e1 uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o potencial entre a taxa respirat\u00f3ria e COVID-19. Vale a pena repetir: nenhum dispositivo vest\u00edvel no mercado pode diagnosticar o COVID-19.   Mas a parte da pesquisa n\u00e3o \u00e9 exatamente o problema. \u00c9 o que vem depois.   E n\u00e3o h\u00e1 indica\u00e7\u00e3o de que o Whoop (ou Fitbit, Oura, Apple ou outros grandes fabricantes de vestu\u00e1rio) estejam anunciando que podem fazer isso. Mas isso n\u00e3o impediu as pessoas de comprarem em p\u00e2nico qualquer coisa que lhes desse uma chance maior de prevenir (ou sobreviver) a doen\u00e7as.    De acordo com a American Lung Association, as pessoas tamb\u00e9m est\u00e3o adquirindo ox\u00edmetros de pulso \u2014 e impedindo que eles possam ser vendidos para hospitais e pessoas que realmente precisam deles \u2014 porque podem detectar ou quantificar precocemente a falta de ar, um sintoma bem conhecido de COVID-19.    \u201cA fixa\u00e7\u00e3o nas leituras do ox\u00edmetro de pulso pode fornecer uma falsa sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de seguran\u00e7a\u201d, afirmou Albert Rizzo, diretor m\u00e9dico da American Lung Association, em comunicado . \u201cEm alguns casos, eles pegam problemas nos pulm\u00f5es antes que voc\u00ea tenha problemas com a falta de ar. No entanto, tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que o dispositivo mostre n\u00edveis saud\u00e1veis \u200b\u200bde satura\u00e7\u00e3o de oxig\u00eanio mesmo com problemas respirat\u00f3rios, o que pode levar alguns indiv\u00edduos a adiar a procura de cuidados urgentemente necess\u00e1rios.\u201d    N\u00e3o \u00e9 absurdo se preocupar que os consumidores possam analisar todos esses estudos e desenvolver expectativas irreais que possam causar mais danos do que o pretendido, ou deixar os profissionais de sa\u00fade limpando a bagun\u00e7a da Big Tech.    \u201cEu n\u00e3o diria \u00e0s pessoas para comprar uma pulseira Ava para esse prop\u00f3sito amanh\u00e3\u201d, diz von Bidder, da Ava. \u201cN\u00f3s claramente dizemos \u00e0s pessoas para n\u00e3o fazer isso\u201d.     Caso um algoritmo preciso, implementado de maneira bem pensada, liberado pela FDA, que funcione em qualquer dispositivo seja desenvolvido e distribu\u00eddo para rastreadores de atividade f\u00edsica e smartwatches em todo o mundo, a privacidade \u00e9 um grande asterisco. Afinal, as empresas de tecnologia treinam seus algoritmos com muitos e valiosos dados de sa\u00fade.    Tecnicamente, a Lei de Portabilidade e Responsabilidade do Seguro de Sa\u00fade (HIPAA) existe para proteger suas informa\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dicas, mas especialistas v\u00eam dizendo h\u00e1 anos que a legisla\u00e7\u00e3o precisa evoluir com o tempo, principalmente no que diz respeito \u00e0 tecnologia vest\u00edvel .    Conversei com Whoop, Fitbit, Stanford e Ava sobre como eles est\u00e3o abordando a privacidade de dados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos estudos de COVID-19. As respostas gerais foram as seguintes: todos os padr\u00f5es \u00e9ticos est\u00e3o sendo respeitados, todos os dados s\u00e3o agregados, nenhum deles est\u00e1 sendo compartilhado com os anunciantes e todos os estudos s\u00e3o totalmente aceitos.    Capodilupo, do Whoop, me disse que o Whoop s\u00f3 come\u00e7ou a investigar COVID-19 quando os usu\u00e1rios que testaram positivo os contataram e ofereceram seus dados.    Dito isso, Snyder mencionou que um grande atrativo da colabora\u00e7\u00e3o com a Fitbit \u00e9 a experi\u00eancia da empresa em gerenciar muitos dados em tempo real. Quando perguntei \u00e0 Fitbit sobre isso, a empresa reiterou seu compromisso com a privacidade e disse que nenhum dado coletado \u00e9 pessoalmente identific\u00e1vel. E, novamente, todo mundo precisa optar por compartilhar seus dados ao se inscrever no estudo de Stanford.    Mas a parte da pesquisa n\u00e3o \u00e9 exatamente o problema. \u00c9 o que vem depois.    Quem tem a propriedade sobre algum algoritmo em potencial que \u00e9 criado? Como convencer as empresas de dispositivo vest\u00edveis a implementar tecnologias que n\u00e3o possuem em seus dispositivos (especialmente se n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro como ser\u00e1 monetizado)? Quem consegue ver com que frequ\u00eancia voc\u00ea fica doente e quem \u00e9 o propriet\u00e1rio desses dados? O HIPAA (legisla\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es do ramo da sa\u00fade dos EUA) protege essas informa\u00e7\u00f5es se elas n\u00e3o estiverem sendo compartilhadas diretamente com os profissionais de sa\u00fade, mas enviadas aos usu\u00e1rios como uma notifica\u00e7\u00e3o? Se a FDA agilizar aprova\u00e7\u00f5es para recursos de diagn\u00f3stico vest\u00edveis durante a pandemia, isso cria um novo precedente quando tudo acabar?    Enquanto a Stanford est\u00e1 trabalhando em um algoritmo independente de dispositivo, \u00e9 menos claro se um potencial algoritmo do estudo COVI-GAPP funcionar\u00e1 universalmente.    A Whoop afirma que come\u00e7ou a investigar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre os dados que re\u00fane e a COVID-19 depois que os usu\u00e1rios entraram em contato. Foto: Victoria Song/Gizmodo    Fabricantes de vest\u00edveis est\u00e3o colaborando com os pesquisadores e deixando que eles assumam a lideran\u00e7a agora. No entanto, depois que a pesquisa for conclu\u00edda, esses fabricantes poder\u00e3o criar seus pr\u00f3prios algoritmos de detec\u00e7\u00e3o de COVID-19 propriet\u00e1rios.    Idealmente, como a  a futura tecnologia de rastreamento de contatos da Apple e do Google , qualquer algoritmo de detec\u00e7\u00e3o de COVID-19 para wearables funcionaria em qualquer dispositivo dispon\u00edvel para ado\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida e generalizada, e n\u00e3o apenas em uma marca espec\u00edfica. No caso de algoritmos propriet\u00e1rios, todos devemos ser um pouco cautelosos.    Fitbit e Withings s\u00e3o duas empresas de wearables que j\u00e1 divulgaram tend\u00eancias de como seus usu\u00e1rios foram impactados pelo COVID-19. Todos os dados s\u00e3o agregados, mas voc\u00ea tem uma ideia do quanto essas empresas sabem sobre n\u00f3s.    A Withings, por exemplo, publicou um blog post que inclui uma discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o por pa\u00eds de quanto peso as pessoas ganharam (ou n\u00e3o) desde que as pol\u00edticas de bloqueio come\u00e7aram, que tipos de exerc\u00edcios as pessoas est\u00e3o fazendo e quanto as pessoas dormem.    A Fitbit publicou v\u00e1rios blog posts, completos com gr\u00e1ficos, mapas e tabelas sobre atividade f\u00edsica , padr\u00f5es de sono e se as pessoas ao redor do mundo est\u00e3o cumprindo ordens de lockdown com base na contagem de passos.    A Fitbit usa seus dados agregados para produzir gr\u00e1ficos chamativos. Imagem: Fitbit    Estes dados, embora valiosos, n\u00e3o est\u00e3o exatamente no mesmo n\u00edvel que os dados em seus registros m\u00e9dicos. Mas previs\u00f5es precoces de infec\u00e7\u00e3o? Isso \u00e9 mais uma \u00e1rea cinzenta e n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro se as pessoas trocar\u00e3o seus dados de sa\u00fade pelo que poderia ser um diagn\u00f3stico para salvar vidas.    \u201cA preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o com a privacidade \u00e9 justificada. \u00c9 uma das principais raz\u00f5es pelas quais as pessoas n\u00e3o compram um rastreador de fitness ou um smartwatch\u201d, disse Ramon Llamas, diretor de pesquisa da IDC que \u00e9 especialista em tecnologia vest\u00edveis, ao Gizmodo. \u201cMas se adicionarmos o COVID-19 \u00e0 mistura e surgir uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o vi\u00e1vel, algumas pessoas podem mudar de ideia. Algumas dessas fabricantes talvez fa\u00e7am as coisas do jeito certo.\u201d    Llamas disse que toda a pesquisa aponta para um fato simples: a conveni\u00eancia supera tudo. Embora existam desvantagens potenciais para a maioria das novas tecnologias, um aplicativo ou uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o matadora facilita as compensa\u00e7\u00f5es de privacidade \u2014 especialmente aquelas que poderiam salvar sua vida.    Por exemplo, o primeiro Apple Watch foi caracterizado como um luxo desnecess\u00e1rio , mas milh\u00f5es j\u00e1 se acostumaram com a ideia de possuir um \u2014 ou dar um de presente \u2014 com base na premissa de que isso poderia melhorar sua sa\u00fade.    Se um smartwatch puder dizer com seguran\u00e7a quando voc\u00ea est\u00e1 doente \u2014 ou prestes a ficar \u2013, isso pode deixar a quest\u00e3o da privacidade de lado para algumas pessoas. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que os recursos de detec\u00e7\u00e3o precoce possam n\u00e3o ser convenientes o suficiente para suprimir as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es com a privacidade.    Em vez de provocar excita\u00e7\u00e3o ou al\u00edvio, as ferramentas de diagn\u00f3stico de COVID-19 podem, em vez disso, evocar imagens dist\u00f3picas do Minority Report e do Black Mirror. \u00c9 imposs\u00edvel julgar de qualquer maneira at\u00e9 que a tecnologia esteja totalmente desenvolvida e pronta para o mercado de massa.    \u201cAlgumas pessoas podem pensar em dizer, tudo bem, do que tenho que desistir para ter esse pouco de conveni\u00eancia e tranquilidade?\u201d Llamas disse. \u201c\u00c9 uma quest\u00e3o ainda a ser resolvida, mas se alguma coisa for suficiente para dar \u00e0s pessoas uma pausa.\u201d     Ent\u00e3o, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que os rel\u00f3gios inteligentes possam ajudar a mitigar a dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o de COVID-19? A resposta \u00e9 insatisfat\u00f3ria.    Nem tudo \u00e9 conversa de marketing \u2014 h\u00e1 evid\u00eancias confi\u00e1veis \u200b\u200bde que os wearables podem nos ajudar a entender melhor e, na melhor das hip\u00f3teses, detectar precocemente doen\u00e7as infecciosas. Mas tamb\u00e9m existem muitas perguntas n\u00e3o respondidas e vari\u00e1veis \u200b\u200bdesconhecidas que dificultam a afirma\u00e7\u00e3o com certeza de que os wearables ser\u00e3o \u00fateis no momento .    Mesmo que seja encontrada uma inova\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9 evidente que isso mude a maneira como as autoridades de sa\u00fade p\u00fablica abordam essa pandemia, disse Tsai. O que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio s\u00e3o mais testes \u2014 o que as autoridades de sa\u00fade v\u00eam repetindo ad nauseum desde que tudo isso come\u00e7ou.    O impulso de, pelo menos, tentar resolver os problemas causados \u200b\u200bpelo COVID-19 com tecnologia vest\u00edvel \u00e9 compreens\u00edvel. Mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 importante lembrar que quaisquer algoritmos, softwares ou dispositivos que eventualmente cheguem ao mercado, eles n\u00e3o restaurar\u00e3o magicamente o mundo de volta ao que era. Afinal, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 como colocar o novo coronav\u00edrus de volta em uma caixa .    Os cientistas dizem que a pandemia provavelmente permanecer\u00e1 at\u00e9 que uma vacina seja desenvolvida ou que a imunidade natural seja disseminada. H\u00e1 muito potencial para uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o baseada em wearables \u2014 e muitos obst\u00e1culos regulat\u00f3rios que existem para proteger o p\u00fablico de todas as esquinas.    Se um dia, em breve, seu pulso tocar e seu smartwatch perguntar se voc\u00ea gostaria de participar de um estudo secreto de 19, talvez valha a pena considerar oferecer seus dados para a ci\u00eancia. Talvez fazer isso ajude a tornar uma futura pandemia menos tenebrosa.

The book is a neat time lapse of the past seven years in Silicon Valley \u2014 from the giddy days of Facebook\u2019s $104bn initial public offering in May 2012 to the public\u2019s dawning realisation that perhaps multi-billionaire tech founders are not going to make the world a better place after all.</p><p>Now a tech writer for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Yorker</emphasis>, Wiener was a broke, 25-year-old assistant at a literary agency when she decided to jump ship and apply for a job at a tech company. \u201cPrivileged and downwardly mobile,\u201d as she puts it. Embarrassed to still be reliant on her parents to subsidise rent and medical bills she joins a New York ebook company. When this does not work out she moves to the West Coast to work at a data analytics company and then moves again to join software development platform GitHub.</p><p>The thrill of working in an industry where youth and ambition are sought out and richly rewarded is understandable. In California optimism and urgency infuse everything. The proximity to so much confidence and money is intoxicating. Tech \u201cpromised what so few industries or institutions could, at the time: a future\u201d.</p><p>As a liberal-arts major, Wiener was never going to be one of the engineers offered a vast sign-up bonus and generous equity stake, but the change in her income is immediate and hard to relinquish, even as her doubts about the work grow more difficult to ignore.</p><p>Gradually she realises that seemingly ephemeral online interactions are being preserved forever and that big data means scraping all sorts of personal information without ever asking permission. At one start-up employees can access \u201cGodMode\u201d to track personal information of online users, leaving Wiener paranoid about who might be watching her own scrolling habits.</p><p>The author is a gifted writer and presents a clear-eyed account of her own limitations as a tech employee while offering cultural analysis of the sector. As she learns about venture capital, KPIs (\u201ckey performance indicators\u201d for the rest of us) and open-source software the reader does too.</p><p>When describing the past few years as \u201ca moment of corporate obsequiousness to young men\u201d she backs it up with statistics. Fewer than 5 per cent of contributors to the open-source community are women, for instance. At one company, Wiener is one of eight women out of 60 employees. The industry\u2019s fondness for subverting corporate norms like hierarchy, business hours, job titles and HR leads to bullying and worker exhaustion. \u201cSexism, misogyny, and objectification did not define the workplace \u2014 but they were everywhere. Like wallpaper, like air.\u201d </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis> began as an essay in American literary magazine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N+1</emphasis> four years ago and the trends Wiener described then have accelerated. I nodded in recognition of her description of San Francisco as a city \u201ctrapped in nostalgia for its own mythology\u201d where homeless encampments are expanding and wealthy young workers use exercise as their primary cultural activity.</p><p>The housing crisis means her impressive-sounding salary is eaten up in living costs. At one point she and two flatmates, who have a combined income of more than $400,000, share a rent-controlled apartment because they cannot afford to live alone.</p><p>The start-ups Wiener works for are never named, although enough breadcrumbs are dropped for those who care to guess. In fact no names are given, which becomes tiresome when applied to well-known companies. Airbnb is \u201ca millennial-friendly platform for renting strangers\u2019 bedrooms\u201d and Amazon \u201cthe online superstore\u201d. Uber is \u201can on-demand ride-sharing start-up\u201d and Lyft is its \u201ccuter\u201d rival. After a while the lack of proper nouns is distracting.</p><p>This is a minor niggle. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis> is an artful contribution to the war on tech exceptionalism. As an account of the industry through the eyes of a worker it is an interesting companion to Emily Guendelsberger\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">On the Clock</emphasis>, which described blue-collar jobs at some of America\u2019s biggest companies as being at the mercy of algorithms, zero-hours contracts and data tracking. Both books suggest that tech companies are in mindless pursuit of optimisation for its own sake without too much interest in the human cost. Such criticism may not halt rising share prices but it does give more weight to the political pushback that has already led to increased tech regulation.</p><p>There is a trend for talented young women writing non-fiction to be described as millennial Joan Didions. Wiener has been paid the same compliment. But the New York-born writer\u2019s jokes and self deprecation reminded me more of Nora Ephron. In places <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uncanny Valley</emphasis> reads like a comedy screenplay. She describes one colleague as someone who wore \u201cjeans that were so tight I felt I already knew him\u201d and another with the unappetising habit of \u201csticking his hand thoughtfully down the back of his own waistband\u201d. The book has been optioned for a movie by one of the producers of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Social Network</emphasis>, the film that skewered Facebook. I can\u2019t wait.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0008317887?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0008317887\"> Uncanny Valley: A Memoir</url></emphasis>, by Anna Wiener, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Farrar, Straus and Giroux, RRP$13.99/4th Estate, RRP\u00a316.99, 284 pages</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Elaine Moore is the FT\u2019s deputy Lex editor</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Join our online book group on Facebook at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"> FT Books Cafe</url>.

On Monday, the major exchanges dropped from 5 to 7 percent, a bit worse than was expected but not enough to set significant records.</p><p>Suddenly, there's a lot to worry about: a weakening world economy, looming U.S. military retaliation and shaken consumer confidence. The best guess is that the economic impact of the attacks will ripple through America's industries like a chain reaction, gutting the profitability of some and improving the outlook of others.</p><p>At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board and other central banks are providing a strong stimulus with lower interest rates and a large infusion of extra cash to the banking system.</p><p>In the end, the outcome may turn on what investors choose to put their faith in: the future or current events.</p><p>\"This market is reacting to short-term events,\" said Kurt Brouwer, a partner in investment management firm Brouwer &amp; Janachowski in Tiburon. \"But there's a lot of good news that isn't having much impact. You have to ask, 'Do you believe there's a future for high quality companies in corporate America? What do I really believe in?' Then put your money where your mouth is.\"</p><p>Sense of pessimism</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst point-loss ever but only its 14th-worst drop in percentage. It fell 684.81 points, or 7.13 percent, to 8,920.70.</p><p>The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index fell 53.77 points, or 4.92 percent, to 1,038.77 -- breaking its low for the year.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite index also dropped below its low for the year, closing down 115.82 points, or 6.83 percent, at 1,579.55.</p><p>Tech stocks were hammered, with semiconductor and software companiesfalling more than the Nasdaq. Tom McManus, an equity portfolio strategist at Banc of America Securities, warned investors in a conference call that big tech companies were still expensive compared to their prospects for growth. The semiconductor industry is suffering from a glut of capacity as well as weak demand, so prices could keep declining, he said.</p><p>Recreational industries</p><p>Some industries at the epicenter of last week's shock suffered the most during Monday's sell-off. Airline, hotel and auto companies were the worst performers in Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, while only electronic defense companies benefited much.</p><p>In San Francisco, the Pacific Exchange opened with two minutes of silence with American flags hanging from all four walls and tiny red, white and blue ribbons sprouting from traders' lapels. \"It was the quietest moment I've ever heard,\" said Mark Cormier, a veteran trader and managing partner of Pacific Research and Trading in San Francisco.</p><p>The major relief was that the computerized systems worked without a hitch for the 2,700 stocks and 1,100 options traded in San Francisco.</p><p>\"It would be nice if the market held up as well as the systems,\" said Dale Carlson, vice president for corporate affairs at the Pacific Exchange.</p><p>The market declined even in the face of a concerted effort by central bankers to give investors hope. The Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates half a percentage point, lowering the key federal funds rate to 3 percent, its eighth cut this year.</p><p>Major banks, such as Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase, cut their prime rates from 6.5 to 6.0 percent, making business and consumer loans pegged to the key rate cheaper.</p><p>Economists believe more cuts are likely.</p><p>Overseas, the European Central Bank, which had resisted cutting rates all summer, joined the effort. Central banks around the world have been pumping tens of billions of dollars of liquidity into the global financial system since the attacks to meet increasing demands for cash.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill visited Wall Street on Monday to bolster confidence. \"Our economy was beginning to rebound before this event, and we will rebound, and we will do well,\" O'Neill said during his visit.</p><p>Companies pitch in</p><p>More than 75 U.S. companies said they plan to take advantage of loosened regulations on buying back their stock. General Electric, Intel and Walt Disney all said they would buy more of their own stock. Some, such as 3Com, said the attacks prompted their decision.</p><p>\"We are entering the market today as a clear signal of confidence in our company and the public equity markets,\" 3Com President and CEO Bruce Claflin said. \"The events of last week do not diminish one iota our confidence in the economic and political systems of this country, and other free market countries in which we do business.\"</p><p>However, other markets also showed the new mood of defensiveness. Gold, a typical haven in times of war and uncertainty, hit an 18-month high of $293.25 an ounce in London. But it weakened slightly in New York.</p><p>Some investment advisers said they couldn't make any precise predictions of how the world will respond economically.</p><p>\"Over my career, I've learned
