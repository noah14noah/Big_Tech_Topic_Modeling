Is enough being done by tech giants to protect our data and our democracy? Are social media companies doing all they can to tackle terrorism or online bullying? Can the boss of Facebook really refuse to answer questions from MPs? How much screen-time should our children have before bedtime?</p><p>Questions about our relationship with the internet and technology are never out of the spotlight. Essentially, this is a debate about getting the balance right. It's about how we harness the enormous benefits and the huge opportunities that technology brings, whilst ensuring that proper protections and safeguards are in place for the negatives.</p><p>In the first industrial revolution, at some point people said: \"It's great we have a coal industry. But you know what? It's not OK to send kids down the mines\". Eventually change came.</p><p>Today, after years in which a free, unfettered internet was allowed to run riot without any restrictions, people and governments around the world are now saying that it's time for large global technology firms to recognise they have social responsibilities, as well as multi-billion dollar rewards.</p><p>This debate about the behaviour of big tech is every bit as relevant for the music industry. In recent months, as the Copyright Directive was debated endlessly in Europe, creators and rights holders have been slogging it out with Google's YouTube.</p><p>But when we accuse YouTube of ripping-off creators, that doesn't mean we're 'anti-big tech'. We're not latter-day Luddites and we're not seeking to live in the past. We just want the future to be fairer, to protect the long-term sustainability of a music industry that brings enjoyment to millions and contributes [pounds sterling]4.5 billion to the UK economy.</p><p>But let's be clear about this: the music industry is not anti-big tech; it's anti-bad tech. Astonishing developments in technology have meant aspiring artists can create and record the sound of a whole orchestra from a laptop in their bedroom, and then have their music and videos streamed across the world to reach previously undreamt-of audiences.</p><p>In the music industry, we have productive relationships with companies like Spotify and Apple Music. Global industry revenues for these paid services amount to [pounds sterling]4.7 billion, meaning streaming is now the largest single source of recorded music industry revenue. UK artist Ed Sheeran's song 'Shape Of You' is the most streamed track of all time on Spotify.</p><p>But, as Labour's shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, pointed out in a speech he gave on big tech and its responsibilities in February, there are problems too. Using UK Music figures, he highlighted what he called the way some platforms \"cater to the business interests of the few at the expense of the many\". He went on to say: \"Just look at how YouTube profits from musicians' work without fair remuneration. YouTube pays creators just [pounds sterling]0.00054p per stream.\"</p><p>YouTube is now one of the main ways people listen to music. It accounts for 84 per cent of all video streaming services with 85 per cent of visitors regularly coming to the site for music.</p><p>However, at present, a song needs to be streamed on YouTube 14,500 times before a creator can earn the equivalent of just one hour on the National Living Wage for a 25-year-old. How can we encourage kids from all backgrounds to become singer/songwriters or performing artists if they would be better off working at Sports Direct?</p><p>Tom Watson was also right when he put the spotlight on Google for the amount it was spending on Brussels lobbyists to undermine \"simple copyright reforms\" that would benefit many creators in the music industry. YouTube exploits legal loopholes, which enables it to pay creators a tiny amount in royalties and rates that are way below that of other digital music services. These loopholes are a result of so-called 'safe harbours' created long before something like YouTube could even be imagined. That's why we need copyright changes to close those loopholes.</p><p>YouTube and its allies spent a fortune running scare stories about the impact of copyright changes. Contrary to what has been dramatically predicted by YouTube, copyright protections will not mean the \"death of the internet\". Neither will it spell the end of memes and mash-ups. Those are just myths spread as part of a desperate attempt by certain tech companies to keep the vast majority of money they make out of the creative content of others.</p><p>Ultimately, tech giants must not allow their services to be used to subvert democracy, to spread online abuse or to cheat music creators out of their deserved rewards.</p><p>I am certain that Margot James, the government's minister for Digital and the Creative Industries, gets this. So too does the Conservative chair of the cross-party DCMS Select Committee, who has been trying to hold the Facebook CEO to account.</p><p>In an era when politicians from all parties seem divided on almost every issue facing the country, the need for big tech to face up to its responsibilities would appear to be a refreshing source of political consensus. Legislation, a new regulator, is all on the way.</p><p>Once they were the great change-makers, empowering people, bringing innovation and forging a brave new world. Today it is the likes of Google that are swimming against the tide of history. Our rapidly evolving relationship with them--in the music industry and in every other part of our lives--is turning into one of the defining battles of our times. In a song that has been streamed more than 53 million times, somebody once sang, \"a change is gonna come\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-581176442</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 581176442</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTG-XT71-DYTM-9461-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 UBM Information Ltd.</copyright><publicationName>Pro Sound News Europe</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0269-4735</issn><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Arts and entertainment industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cyberbullying</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Music industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Royalties</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Royalties (Intellectual property)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

But veterans of the 103-year old watchdog say that the agency increasingly runs the risk of being outmatched by the very tech giants it oversees without more cash, cutting-edge staff and stronger legal teeth. \"For a long time the FTC itself has been pointing out the gaps in its authority,\" said Terrell McSweeny, a Democratic commissioner who concluded her three-year tenure last month. \"What I find hopeful about this moment is that people are realizing the consequences of that and having a conversation about it.\" </p><p>On Tuesday, the FTC gained its newest chairman, Joe Simons, and soon he'll be surrounded by a full complement of four other commissioners. They'll be expected to monitor everything from the fast-growing footprint of companies like Amazon to the security practices of the entire tech industry. Already, they face their first, high-profile test: an investigation into Facebook's recent privacy mishaps. In March, the FTC announced it would probe Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed names, \"likes\" and other personal information for up to 87 million of the social site's users. If the FTC finds that Facebook erred, it could result in massive fines - penalties that some experts say the agency must levy in order to send an early message that it is able, and willing, to police the country's tech behemoths. \"Will the new FTC have the will to take on today's challenges aggressively?\" asked Jessica Rich, the former director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC really is under-resourced. So if it steps up and takes on the challenges, it still will have a limited amount of resources to do that.\" The FTC's purview is vast. It reviews hospital mergers, responds to consumer reports about robocalls and ensures that products labeled as \"made in the USA\" are actually manufactured here. It stems from its more than century-old mandate to promote competition and penalize those who engage in unfair or deceptive practices. In recent years, though, the FTC has evolved into the U.S. government's primary regulator of the tech industry. While the country may lack a single, federal online privacy law, the agency still has managed to tap its powers to punish tech giants like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Uber for failing to protect the sensitive information they amass about their users. Despite an ever-expanding workload, the FTC's authorities and resources haven't changed much. Its budget this fiscal year is $306 million - or about a third of one percent of the revenue that Google earned in 2017. Those limited funds help the agency maintain a workforce of about 1,140 - roughly 300 fewer than it had almost four decades earlier, according to FTC records, well before it had to police the internet. \"One of the issues is the ability to hire technologists,\" acknowledged Rich, who is now the vice president of consumer policy and mobilization at Consumer Reports. \"The FTC simply can't pay what many technologists make in not even the top echelons of companies.\" During an interview before she departed, McSweeny praised the agency for its track record, citing the fact it's achieved a \"terrific return on taxpayer investment.\" That includes major settlements with companies like Volkswagen for allegedly defrauding drivers. Still, she stressed the FTC faces major structural challenges - issues that she and her predecessors long have highlighted without much success. The FTC is generally hamstrung in its ability to write new rules, for example, and it isn't always able to fine tech companies on their first privacy or security offense. \"It would be helpful to have Congress clarify the FTC's authority around privacy and data security. It would be helpful to have civil penalty authority. I think it would be helpful for the agency to have regulatory authority,\" she said. Those strictures now fall to Simons, who officially assumed the title of FTC chairmanafter serving as an antitrust litigator at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison for clients like Microsoft and Sony. It's not his first tour of duty in the federal government: Simons worked at the agency as its director of the Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003. His office declined to make him available for an interview. He'll be aided by two fellow Republicans: Noah Phillips, a former top aide to Texas Sen. John Cornyn, and Christine Wilson, who was a top executive at Delta. Opposite them will be two new Democratic commissioners: Rohit Chopra, a former regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Rebecca Slaughter, previously a top adviser to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. To start, the agency is under pressure to penalize not only Facebook but other tech companies that mishandle consumers' data. \"The FTC largely failed during the Obama years to address the most pressing challenges,\" said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which brought the complaint that led to the FTC's settlement with Facebook in 2011. \"The evidence of that is made clear every day.\" Others would like to see the FTC under its new leaders take a closer look at companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google for antitrust concerns. Regulators around the world increasingly are fearful that big tech is too big - especially in Europe, which is still probing Google. In the U.S, the FTC hasn't brought such a major case since its own probe of Google - an investigation it closed in 2013 by leaving the company intact.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN56038916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S93-JJF1-DYRV-43C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"960\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The initiative has been undertaken as a public private partnership (PPP) venture with the property developer Howard Holdings, Cork City Council and Enterprise Ireland, which has provided Eur 3.8m towards capital costs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Webworks is a 5,000sq m building divided between common areas and 36 individual units ranging in size from 30 to 200sq m. Speaking at the opening of the centre, Minister Micheal Martin said that the importance of such facilities in the promotion of entrepreneurship, employment and economic growth is widely acknowledged and that the contribution that these hubs can have on the formation of clusters has been demonstrated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IBM plans 300 new Dublin jobs</p><p>IBM is to create 300 new jobs in Dublin within the next three years. The company is investing Eur 46m in expanding its software development operations and will also launch a business incubation centre, as well as invest in its supply chain. IBM's software lab will be expanded to create \"centres of competencies\" in SOA and SAP applications. The firm will also expand its industry models portfolio with new offerings for the healthcare and financial markets. In addition, a new centre of competency in biomedical search will be created to develop a clinical trials portal. Meanwhile, the firm's business incubation centre aims to combine IBM research, technology, services and consulting expertise with skills and knowledge of local industry partners, developers, universities and Government organisations.</p><p>Microsoft may launch iPod rival </p><p>Microsoft is believed to be planning the launch of a new portable digital music and video player that will go head-to-head with Apple's ubiquitous iPod. The as-yet-unnamed device is expected to include a wireless internet connection which will allow users to download music files without having to link the player to a PC. Moreover, the player is said to boast a better-quality picture than Apple's player. </p><p>Microsoft is reported to have met a number of leading television broadcasters and music firms recently in a bid to gain content for an online store which would compete with iTunes. Earlier reports from June suggested that Microsoft had also held talks with consumer electronics manufacturers and mobile communications operators about developing a new portable player based on Windows Media technology.</p><p>Irish playography goes back to 1904 </p><p>The Irish Theatre Institute has announced the launch of phase three of the Irish playography, which will now feature all plays performed in Ireland since 1904. Formerly known as the Theatre Shop, the Irish Theatre Institute has spent the last 18 months working on the third phase of its online, searchable catalogue of Irish plays, dubbed the \"playography\". </p><p>The playography now features all plays professionally produced in Ireland since 1904, when the Abbey Theatre came into being. Research director of the Irish Theatre Institute Caroline Williams explained the further the project went back in time the more difficult it became to discover specific details. </p><p>In the next few months, the institute aims to work with Foras na Gaeilge to compile an Irish language repertoire for the playography.</p><p>Fledgling firms flock together </p><p>With technology clusters everywhere, the next Irish success story could be just around the corner. Maxim Kelly reports.</p><p>Often established due to the nurturing support of educational establishments or public bodies such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, technology clusters are usually specially built enterprise parks or areas of a university campus where entrepreneurs can locate their fledgling firms alongside university spin-offs and more established companies.</p><p>The thinking behind these centres is that having like-minded companies located close together can help to stimulate a crossfertilisation of ideas.</p><p>One such cluster with a novel cross-Border aspect to its identity is the Armagh-Monaghan Digital Corridor. </p><p>Split between the A:tek building in Armagh and M:tek building in Monaghan, the AMDC attracted funding from the EU, the International Fund for Ireland and a variety of other public and private sources.</p><p>Though the AMDC is growing in stature now - at the end of June, Imagine Communications Group set up a subsidiary company called Imagine Telecommunications NI which will operate from the A:tek building in Armagh, and create over 300 new jobs.</p><p>The centre's chief executive Bernard Conlon said things were not so rosy when the second of the two buildings was completed just after the September 11 attacks and the beginning of the dotcom crash.</p><p>\"I remember standing on the top floor of the new building with [a colleague] and the place was like a big empty football field. I turned to him and said 'are we mad to be doing this?' because all tech activity had literally stopped overnight,\" he said.</p><p>Things are considerably different today with a new wave of Irish technology companies starting out from more than 126 incubation centres across the country.Waterford Institute of Technology's (WIT) new Research and Innovation Centre in Carriganore is one of several such success stories in recent times.</p><p>Since its establishment in October 2005, eight technology startup companies have moved to the Eur 5m purpose-built facility, which received funding from Enterprise Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and Allied Irish Banks.</p><p>Business development specialist Kathryn Kiely of WIT's Research and Innovation Centre believes tech clusters offer much more than simply facilitating entrepreneurs and encouraging the commercialisation of research. She suggests they have become regional nodes which push infrastructural improvement higher up the political agenda.</p><p>\"We're part of a big change for the region,\" said Kiely. \"The southeast was underperforming in the area of high-end technology and research but our success shows what can be achieved. Industry and the general public are now saying the region is only being held back by a lack of communications infrastructure, our lack of university-status and a regional airport.\"</p><p>She believes innovation centres have to be seen in this context, as they can drive a change in business attitudes which lifts local economies: \"We can nurture a grassroots change in mindset to stimulate a willingness to invest and to take risks.\"</p><p>Though the link with an academic institution is important for these technology incubation centres, geographical proximity to universities is not vital, according to Conlon. Although enjoying formal relationships with several institutions such as Queens in Belfast and Trinity College in Dublin, Conlon believes he has an advantage in his location away from urban \"big smokes\".</p><p>\"People who work in big tech firms in Belfast, Dublin or London all say they would like to live back home for standard-of-life reasons but there is not the same work here. We're changing this impression though because new jobs are being created. We're also offering facilities such as video-conferencing and high-speed data connections in an office environment which means you can still work for your London emplye but live and work here,\" he said.</p><p>Conlon also believes technology hubs can have an invigorating effect on local non-tech businesses which can see technology in action and, as a result, are more likely to understand the benefits of technology in their own firms.\"There are 1,000 jobs here now that would not have been here if the AMDC had not been created. There is also around Eur 30m extra going into the local economy every year. We are hoping to create a lasting legacy.\"</p><p>Grainne Ni Uid of Enterprise Ireland said the organisation has provided Eur 47m in funding to help in the physical construction of 16 innovation centres across the country. </p><p>\"The next step is to strengthen the technology transfer from research to commercial entity, and Enterprise Ireland is looking at providing more funding for these innovation centres so they can have access to experts who can advise on patents and licences for commercialising research,\" she said.</p><p>The Governments next National Development Plan will also no doubt help invigorate research and development in incubation centres around Ireland.</p><p>With cutting-edge business ideas increasingly originating from within these centres, the promised Eur 3.86n in funding for research and development over the next seven years will surely be put to good use.</p><p>Maxim Kelly [max@enn.ie] is a staff writer with ENN. </p><p>Broadband awareness campaign A new all-island broadband awareness campaign has been launched to promote the benefits of high-speed internet services to home and business users, writes Charlie Taylor. The Eur 533,333 cross-Border TV advertising campaign is set to begin on July 10. A series of adverts will run during peak viewing time until the end of 2006. </p><p>The ads are supported by a new website which gives further information to viewers on how they can sign up for broadband services and how to go about choosing a provider. The campaign has received Eur 133,333 in funding from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, while Eur 400,000 came from the INTERREG III a programme, a European community inative.</p><p>Merriam-Webster verbalises 'google' </p><p>Google has become such a large part of life and modern speech that it has officially been made a verb, writes Ciara O'Brien. The word has made it into the latest edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary, as a transitive verb with a lower case \"g\". The dictionary defines it as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information about (as a person) on the World Wide Web\". </p><p>Other new additions to the dictionary include \"spyware\", \"ringtone\" and \"mouse potato\", a term used to describe someone who spends too much time sitting in front of their computer. The search giant, however, may not be as enthusiastic about the development as you might think. Google has already shown concern that its trademark could be at risk because it is becoming so successful. </p><p>Specifically, it fears that its trademark may slip into the general lexicon - excluding it from legal protection.</p><p>LLU and looping the loop</p><p>More work is needed on local loop unbundling (LLU), ComReg has warned, as delays and performance standards continue to be an issue, writes Ciara O'Brien. </p><p>Despite what ComReg described as \"a considerable level of engagement\" by the telecoms industry over the past five weeks, the regulator has warned there is a need for more work. ComReg said progress had been made in areas such as number portability, the coexistence of line share and wholesale line rental, and the delivery problems associated with the existing LLU product. ComReg said that by August 8 an interim product should be available to customers so they can keep their existing phone number when changing broadband supplier. ComReg's next progress report is due to be published on August 7.</p><p>New directory enquiries service </p><p>A new Irish directory enquiries service has been launched, promising lower call charges to consumers and creating 150 jobs, writes Ciara O'Brien. </p><p>The new 11890 service is the third entrant into the national directory enquiries market, joining Eircom and Conduit. The company intends to create some 150 jobs over the coming 18 months through a planned expansion at its headquarters in Clonshaugh Industrial Estate. </p><p>The new jobs will be spread throughout a number of roles, such as call centre operations, account management and technical staff. The new service does not use automated machines to supply numbers, opting to rely on the personal approach. It promises not to automatically connect customers to a number, but will offer such a facility for those who require it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4KFF-8TH0-TWSK-92M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSFIR-20060713969674</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSFIR2006</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279315</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2006 Business &amp;

There are plenty of small companies that are thinking seriously about this too. </p><p>As policymakers fixate on the daily drumbeat of privacy scandals emanating from Facebook and other top tech platforms, the rest of the industry is increasingly worried that federal privacy legislation will look to punish the major players instead of crafting a framework under which tech companies of all stripes can effectively operate.</p><p> It s really important to think about unintended consequences,  said Angela Hooks, a government-affairs manager at Yelp, during the same event.  It seems like there s a lot of pressure on big tech companies. But obviously it s going to trickle down to everyone. </p><p>Smaller companies say the backlash to big tech s myriad misdeeds was the driving force behind both Europe s General Data Protection Regulation and California s new data-privacy rules. And they re warning Washington against indulging in a similar reaction, arguing it could cause a reduction in both the ability of tech startups to blossom and for smaller, data-driven companies to stay in business.</p><p> We often hear from European officials who say,  No no no, GDPR is not meant for your company,   said Tummarello.   It s not meant for startups, it s meant for the big guys.  ... You try to tell an investor that, and the startup will not be able to get funding off of what some European official might ve said at a press conference a year ago. </p><p>Tech startups are particularly concerned by the enormous cost of navigating a byzantine network of regulations and reporting requirements. Europe s GDPR remains notoriously opaque, with tech companies of all sizes claiming that they ve accrued massive legal bills as they work to comply. They say that s also a problem with California s new rules, and they re urging lawmakers to avoid forcing companies to hire an army of lawyers that they can t afford.</p><p> Compliance cost is the big one,  said Heather West, a top policy executive at Mozilla.  And it s concerning because of the fact that some of these requirements are not well-defined, so you re making guesses. </p><p>To get around crippling compliance costs, some advocates want policymakers to build specific exemptions for startups and smaller tech firms into a new privacy bill. That could include exempting firms with a small market share or few employees, though many argue that would ignore the very real privacy threat from small firms with access to Social Security numbers or other sensitive data. It may also include fewer reporting requirements for startups or smaller firms, which may not have the resources to detail all the data collected on their customers.</p><p>Other issues may be more difficult to resolve, including the trend toward a requirement that customers affirmatively opt-in to most kinds of data collection and the tendency of successful startups to leverage vast amounts of consumer data in innovative and potentially intrusive ways. </p><p> Small companies whether they re startups or not or companies that don t have consumer-facing brands, also have a real challenge with an opt-in approach,  said Neil Chilson, a senior technology researcher at the libertarian Charles Koch Institute. </p><p>When faced with an unknown brand asking for access to their data, Chilson argued that consumers are more likely to refuse the prompt before they know whether they ll enjoy the product.  That has a tendency to strengthen the power of companies that already have brand recognition,  he said.  And it makes it much more difficult for companies that don t have any brand recognition among consumers, including startups. </p><p>The notion that Facebook, Google, and the other major players may benefit from federal privacy regulation through a reduction in competition is a pervasive one in startup circles and throughout the rest of the tech industry. </p><p> Cynically, I am sure that [the big companies] are trying to make sure that these laws are ones that they can comply with,  said West.  And maybe I hope they re not crafting them in anti-competitive ways, in ways that stop the next big thing. Because I want to see the next Facebook, the next Google, the next service that is going to provide value to people but also be very privacy-protective. </p><p>West and others say startups will need access to at least some forms of sensitive consumer data if they ever hope to dethrone Facebook, Google, and the rest.</p><p> It is about the venture capitalists who are funding startups,  West said.  They re not going to be looking at a data-driven concept in the same way that they might have years ago. ... If we overburden the next amazing project with privacy requirements that don t actually make it a better product for users, then we re actually missing out on the point. </p><p>Others, however, think it may be time to permanently close off the avenues for data harvesting that made Facebook, Google, and others so successful.</p><p> I think we re starting to get to a place where there are just certain behaviors that we don t want companies to engage in,  said Gigi Sohn, a fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law &amp; Policy.</p><p> I do have sympathy with the smaller and middle-sized companies for being lumped in with Google and Facebook and Amazon at every turn,  Sohn said, adding that she could support some limited exemptions for smaller tech companies to avoid  very complicated and burdensome reporting requirements. </p><p>But when it comes to paving the way for the continued collection of data for advertising, artificial intelligence, or algorithmic purposes, Sohn suggested that ship has already sailed. Tech startups and their investors, she argued, will need to adjust to the new paradigm.</p><p> I have no problem with companies using data for the purpose for which it s intended,  Sohn said.  But companies who want to build another Facebook or another Google, whose entire business models are based on selling my data in order to sell advertising I don t care if there s no more of those! And I don t think the American people want it either. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-678255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYC-7111-DY4X-T540-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1162\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

France unveiled plans for a tax on big tech revenues on Wednesday, which it said will raise about \u20ac500 million ($565 million) a year. It follows similar plans in the UK, which said last year that is introducing tech tax that could raise up to 400 million ($510 million) a year from 2020. The EU has been working on drafting similar international legislation, although talks stalled late last year. Big tech companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon are going to have start paying billions more in tax in Europe after lawmakers demand they contribute more to the public purse. France has joined the UK in setting out plans to tax internet giants on the revenue they make locally. It says the 3% tax could initially raise about \u20ac500 million ($565 million), but this number could rise quickly. Finance minister Bruno le Maire unveiled the plan on Wednesday[1], which would tax digital companies with global revenues over \u20ac750 million ($848 million) and French revenue of over \u20ac25 million ($28 million). Le Maire said the tax was about \"justice.\" He added: \"These digital giants use our personal data, make huge profits out of these data ... then transfer the money somewhere else without paying their fair amount of taxes.\" When asked whether \u20ac500 million was a small figure in an interview with radio station Europe 1[2], le Maire said it was \"a starting point.\" France will move quickly to introduce the tax, Associated Press reported[3]. It is expected to pass through French parliament, where President Emmanuel Macron's party has a majority, in the coming months.France could become the first European country to put in place such a tax, but Britain could be close behind. In October, UK Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK would tax 2% of British user-generated revenue[4] in a new \"Digital Services tax.\" Read more: Here's how the UK plans to seize $2 billion in tax from firms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google[5] Hammond estimated that this would bring in up to 400 million ($510 million) a year for the Treasury, starting in 2020. The British government has just concluded a consultation on the proposals.[6] Combined, the UK and French tax will raise just under $1.1 billion from mainly US tech firms. The UK said its Digital Services tax is an \"interim measure\"[7] while the EU tries to construct its own international tech giant tax. In late November 2018, a proposed EU digital tax was blocked by Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany[8]. Le Maire has been vocal about pushing through EU legislation, and told French newspaper le Journal de Dimanche in January[9] that a European agreement is now \"within reach.\" He told Europe 1 this week that he is optimistic other countries will follow France's lead. \"This tax we're making at a national level. I hope that next, it will become an international tax, and that all developed countries could adopt the idea,\" he said.NOW WATCH: Why Amazon canceled HQ2 in New York City and what it means for

Now the chickens are coming home to roost.\"</p><p>The surprise election of Donald Trump acted as a catalyst for scrutiny of the platforms that shape so much of our online experience. Even so, it's taken many months for the enormity of their role to sink in.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest wake-up call has been the showdown in Washington. Congress summoned representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify over their role in a multi-pronged Russian operation to influence the 2016 presidential election. All three companies admitted that Russian entities bought ads on their sites in an attempt to skew the vote.</p><p>In Facebook's case, fake accounts pushed divisive messages in swing states; Google found similar activity across its paid search tool and YouTube; and on Twitter, armies of bots and fake users promoted fake news stories that were favourable to Donald Trump. Similar patterns were identified around the Brexit vote. </p><p>\"The election shows the stakes involved here,\" said Noam Cohen, author of The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball. \"In the past, to be a critic of Silicon Valley was to say the smartphone is making us dumb. Now it's incompatible with democracy.\"</p><p>It's not been the only example of technology companies monetising and distributing unpalatable content and acting surprised when it's uncovered. </p><p>In March, The Times of London revealed that YouTube had paid, via an advertising revenue share, Islamic extremists to peddle hate speech, leading to a boycott from many major advertisers. A second boycott started this month after brands discovered that their ads were appearing alongside content being exploited by paedophiles. </p><p>In May, the Guardian's investigation into Facebook's content moderation policies revealed that the social network flouted Holocaust denial laws except where it feared being sued. Four months later, Pro Publica discovered that Facebook's ad tools could be used to target \"Jew haters\". </p><p>Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, later said she was \"disgusted\" and \"disappointed that our systems allowed this\". </p><p>Taplin finds the technology companies' standard response of \"Oops, we'll fix this\" frustrating and disingenuous.</p><p>\"Come on! What were you thinking?\" he said. \"If I can target women who drink bourbon in Tennessee who like trucks, then of course I could use it for dark purposes.\"</p><p>The deepening pockets and growing influence of companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple has raised concerns that they have become Goliaths, threatening the innovation Silicon Valley was once known for.</p><p>You only have to look at Snap to see what happens when you nip at the heels of a tech titan like Facebook: first, it makes an offer to buy you - a strategy that worked with Instagram and WhatsApp - and, if that fails, it eliminates you.</p><p>In Snap's case, this meant watching Facebook clone all of Snapchat's features - awkwardly at first, but relentlessly until Snapchat's potential slice of the advertising market shriveled to a sliver.</p><p>\"[The Snap CEO] Evan Spiegel is having his hat handed to him,\" Taplin said, noting how Snap's stock had plummeted since the company went public in March.</p><p>As power consolidates into the hands of a few, the best a startup can hope for is to be bought by one of the tech giants. This, in turn, leads to further consolidation.</p><p>So the five largest tech companies - desperate to avoid the kind of antitrust regulation that disrupted IBM and Microsoft's dominance - are flooding Washington with lobbyists, to the point where they now outspend Wall Street two to one.</p><p>\"Regulation is coming,\" said Malik. \"We have got to prepare for that. Everybody has figured out that we are the enemy number one now because we are rich and all the politicians smell blood.\"</p><p> Related:  As tech companies get richer, is it 'game over' for startups?</p><p>It doesn't help that there's a rising number of former Silicon Valley engineers and business leaders who have morphed into tech dissenters, complaining about the addictive properties of the platforms and call for people - particularly children - to unplug. </p><p>In November, Facebook's founding president Sean Parker said the social network knew from the outset it was creating something addictive, something that exploited \"a vulnerability in human psychology\" - a damning critique somewhat undermined by the fact that it was being delivered from the top of an enormous money pile generated by that exploitation.</p><p>The vast wealth on display in Silicon Valley - in the private commuter buses, sprawling campuses and luxury condos - does little to endear the companies and their employees to the rest of the world. Like it or not, tech workers have become the shining beacons of prosperity and elitism, shining a bit too brightly at a time of increasing income inequality. </p><p>The fact that $700 internet-connected juicers can raise $120m in funding before folding adds to the sense that Silicon Valley has lost its grip on reality.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley at its core wants to solve problems. I just think we've lost touch with the types of problems that actual people need solving,\" said Ankur Jain, who set up Kairos Society to encourage more entrepreneurs to solve problems where everyday people are being financially squeezed, such as housing, student loans and job retraining in the face of automation.</p><p>\"People are so removed from the rest of the ecosystem in Silicon Valley that these problems feel more like charity issues rather than issues that affect the vast majority of the population,\" Jain said.</p><p>For Malik, many of the problems stem from the fact that Silicon Valley companies have remained \"willfully ignorant\" of the fact that \"at the end of every data point there is a human being\".</p><p>All the problems to have arisen over the last year are particularly jarring given the tech companies' continued insistence that they are doing good for the world.</p><p>\"It's a form of gaslighting to have these companies doing so many harmful things telling you how great they are and how much they are helping you. It's another form of abuse,\" Cohen said. </p><p>Malik agreed. \"Silicon Valley is very good at using words like empathy and social responsibility as marketing buzzwords, but they are terms that we need to internalise as an industry and show through our actions by building the right things,\" he said. \"Otherwise it's all bullshit.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-39709376</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R7N-XKC1-JCJY-G2D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1254\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Regulation may make it harder for emerging disrupters to compete against the cashed-up firms, who can afford an army of lawyers and lobbyists to navigate and influence new laws.</p><p>A political and consumer backlash will likely force data-rich Facebook, Google and Amazon to self-regulate their platforms better, in a headwind for their stellar earnings growth.</p><p>Trump's populist tirade against Amazon was for (allegedly) underpaying state sales taxes, short changing the government-owned US Postal Service for parcel deliveries and destroying bricks and mortar retail jobs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/donald-trump-ramps-up-attack-on-amazons-postal-subsidy-20180331-h0y75z\">His ire at Amazon</url> seems more directed at founder Jeff Bezos and the newspaper he owns, The Washington Post, which has published stories critical of the President's never-ending controversies.</p><p> Improve standards </p><p>The possibility of any Trump Justice Department anti-trust action against Amazon for stifling competition seems remote. Amazon accounts for only 4 per cent of US retail sales.</p><p>If anything, the e-commerce giant is pro-competition, disrupting retailers such as Walmart and forcing stores to improve their standards.</p><p>Meanwhile, the share price valuations of Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet are not especially high for companies making money hand over fist.</p><p>Facebook's profit grew 59 per cent to $US15.9 billion in 2017. Alphabet grew revenue 23 per cent to $US111 billion to post a healthy profit of $US12.6 billion.</p><p>Such rapidly growing firms deserve to trade at a healthy valuation premium to the broader market.</p><p>Facebook's price-to-earnings forward valuation for 2018 has slipped from 35 in February before the Cambridge Analytica crisis to 22.6 on Friday, according to Morningstar. Alphabet trades at a P/E ratio of 25.1.</p><p>The broad S&amp;P 500 has a forward P/E ratio of 17.4, versus 19.1 for the tech sector.</p><p>Tech investors may need to become more discriminatory in their stock selections.</p><p>Electric-vehicle maker Tesla is a case in point.</p><p> Loss-making business model </p><p>In the wake of Uber's automated vehicle killing a pedestrian in Arizona two weeks ago, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/business/transport/automobile/tesla-model-x-fatal-crash-fire-on-california-highway-prompts-probe-20180327-h0y1so\">Tesla separately confirmed a driver died</url> days later when using autopilot mode in one of its semi-autonomous electric vehicles.</p><p>These tragedies are undoubtedly a setback for the automated driving industry, at least in the short term. Chip maker Nvidia opted to suspend self-driving car tests and its shares plunged 8 per cent on a single trading day last week.</p><p>Longer term, \"A terrible accident won't stop self-driving cars,\" Yardeni Research notes.</p><p>Tesla's far larger problem is its cash-guzzling, loss-making, business model. It suffered a credit rating downgrade last week and had its reputation hurt by the recall of 123,000 Model S sedans. After surging past traditional carmakers Ford and General Motors last year, Tesla shares have slumped 30 per cent from their 2017 peak. Elon Musk's unyielding ambition is being sorely tested.</p><p>Nevertheless, more established tech firms with proven money-making models such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft face uncertainty, but are likely to dominate the global economy and markets for the foreseeable future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029521125</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S11-X6T1-JBJ7-N0SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><timeReceived>04:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Alibaba and Facebook have done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.</p><p>The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.</p><p>\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.</p><p>Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.</p><p>\u201cInvestors have been well served by the current global dominance of American tech companies, and yet there is plenty of chatter about changing this winning approach,\u201d Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a recent note.</p><p>In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.</p><p>The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflixis up 6,500 percent.

Metrics ranging from sales, investment as a share of GDP, and positioning all suggest the sector has room to run, they added.Credit Suisse touted gaming and semiconductor stocks as strong picks within the winning sector.Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories[2]. Tech stocks remain a top pick for Credit Suisse[3] analysts, but the bank advised clients on Thursday to invest in the sector with increased caution.Crowding in tech mega-caps and shares' stretched valuations led several analysts to raise concerns of a dot-com-era bubble forming in the market. The group's early September decline relieved some overvaluation fears, but still-lofty prices led Credit Suisse to probe whether investors should steer clear or stay invested.To start, the bank's analysts looked to several metrics to determine the extend of tech-stock indulgence. </p><p>Tech investment as a share of gross domestic product sits near its average levels, as does the share of non-residential investment in tech. The capital expenditures-to-sales ratio in tech is also far from extended levels, and likely boosted by anticipated demand for 5G devices and autonomous driving upgrades.From a valuation standpoint, tech stocks are \"only modestly expensive\" when judging by free cash flow yield compared to the broader market, Credit Suisse said. Demand for tech sends a similar signal, with sales in line with their historical trend as opposed to the dot-com bubble's 12% overshoot.Read more: A Wall Street firm shares its 5 best ideas for investors who need alternatives to expensive tech stocks \u2014 including trades poised to turnaround after getting pummeled by the pandemic[4]Finally, positioning shows speculation high in some corners of the sector but not extreme, according to the team. Credit Suisse determined that, while \"excess in tech is high,\" but not yet at levels of overenthusiasm seen in the late 1990s.Still, the firm recommends taking some money off the table. The analysts trimmed the size of their overweight rating for tech shares, citing elevated market concentration and higher regulatory risks in the event of a Biden administration. The arrival of an effective coronavirus vaccine could also spark a \"short-term reversal in some of the online trends\" that lifted tech through the pandemic, the team added.Investors keeping cash parked in the sector should simply be more selective to keep risk in check, according to the bank. Credit Suisse's analysts maintain overweight ratings on semiconductor stocks including TSMC[5] and ASML[6]. Gaming stocks such as Activision Blizzard[7] and Frontier Developments[8] offer strong opportunities at relatively cheap prices, they said.

Cashing in on its new-found fame.</p><p>BAY: And a \"Playboy\" centerfold locked in a billion-dollar battle over her late husband's estate.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is THE MONEYLINE NEWSHOUR.  Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: Good evening, and welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>It's the month that scares investors the most.</p><p>VARNEY: True, but once again, October proved that its bad reputation is based more on superstition than real performance.  For the second day running, stocks jumped all across the board, with the Dow, Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P all closing out the month solidly in the black.</p><p>In fact, the Nasdaq is going into November at a new record, and the S&amp;P had its best October since way back in 1982.</p><p>Today's rally built on yesterday's huge gains, with inflation fears firmly in check.</p><p>Greg Clarkin has more from Wall Street, the scene of more than one celebration today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Outside the New York Stock Exchange was a jam-packed tribute to the world champion Yankees.  Inside, it was yet another busy day of buying with stocks taking off across the board for the second straight day on big volume.</p><p>The Dow soared as high as 168 points and ended with a 107-point gain.  The Nasdaq surged to a record close, gaining more than three percent.  Helping spark today's rally, more tame economic news, this time from the housing market.  Bonds were sharply higher, sending long-term yields tumbling, all good news for Wall Street.</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, FEDERATED EQUITY INCOME FUND: The last two days have been extremely healthy.  Obviously a big break out to the upside. And thanks in large part to the behavior of the bond market, which I was really fearful we couldn't make an advance without the bond market doing better.  And it is.</p><p>CLARKIN: The bond rally, however, did not help some financial stocks, especially American Express.  After a big run-up, AmEx plunged on several analysts' downgrades.  It was tech stocks that took charge after Intel's bullish comments late yesterday, Intel and Sun Microsystems among the stocks that surged.</p><p>But can it continue?</p><p>ROCKY BARBER, WILLIAM BLAIR GROWTH FUND: There's been some run- ups in major categories like technology, and I think they're warranted in the long run.  But they might be a little ahead of themselves.</p><p>CLARKIN: One brand-new stock got ahead of everybody today, Akamai, which offers ways to speed up Web traffic.  It more than quintupled in its debut.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Now, clearly investors were not haunted by this history of this date.  Seventy years ago today, the Dow plunged 30 points, and that followed a drop of 38 points the day before, for a two-day loss of nearly 25 percent.  October 29, 1929, it became known as Black Tuesday, and the Dow closed at 230.  Today's close on the Dow, 10,729 -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: On a day like this, that's a very distant memory, is it not?</p><p>Greg Clarkin reporting.  Thanks, Greg.</p><p>CLARKIN: Sure.</p><p>BAY: Lockheed Martin is buffeted by a profit warning that brings down one of its top executives.  The aerospace company said earnings and cash flow in 2000 would come out at half that of forecasts.</p><p>And president and COO Peter Teets is paying for the shortfall with his job.</p><p>Behind the coming losses, a slump in its commercial space business and launch delays in its satellite ventures.  Lockheed Martin ended down nearly three.  The stock has lost nearly two-thirds of its value over the past year.</p><p>VARNEY: DaimlerChrysler is overhauling its business to put North American operations under one hood, so to speak.  The streamlining is expected to give executives more autonomy on this side of the Atlantic, and it's part of a bid to recapture the innovative spirit of the old Chrysler.  The auto maker has been trying to regain momentum after the North American president, Thomas Stallkamp, stepped down last month.</p><p>The plan splits operations into three units, Mercedes Benz, Chrysler, and commercial vehicles.</p><p>BAY: Turning now to the latest economic numbers, which showed a sharp slowdown last month in new home sales.  That was more good news for the bond market, fueling hopes that the economy is not overheating.  The 30-year bond rocketed more than a full point, with the yield down to 6.16 percent.</p><p>Patty Davis looks at what's cooling off the housing boom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PATTY DAVIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The red-hot housing market is finally starting to loose some of its sizzle.  Buckling under the weight of higher interest rates, new home sales posted their biggest drop in more than five years in September, plummeting 12.8 percent to the lowest rate in almost two years.</p><p>BETH WHEELER RYAN, PALORMO REALTY: End of August and into September, the market was just dead.  No one was even looking at property.  And when interest rates go up a little bit, people just tend not to make decisions.</p><p>DAVIS: And the lack of decision-making cannot be blamed on Hurricane Floyd.  Sales fell sharply on both coasts, with the steepest drops coming in the Floyd-free Midwest and West.  That leaves mortgage rates.  After starting the year at 6.75 percent, 30-year mortgages this week hit 8 percent.</p><p>STAN SHIPLEY, MERRILL LYNCH: The higher mortgage rates that we've witnessed over the last six months is starting to temper demand for the housing sector.  New home sales and existing home sales are falling here because mortgage rates have risen 125 basis points.</p><p>DAVIS: Still, no one expects the housing market to collapse. Even with September's drop, home sales remain on pace for a fourth straight record-setting year.  With incomes rising and jobs plentiful, real estate agents are already seeing signs of a pickup in business.</p><p>RYAN: October, it's been a great month, because it seems like no one did anything in September.  So now in October they're making their decisions.</p><p>DAVIS: And the first week of November could be busy as well.</p><p>(on camera): Mortgage rates are tied directly to the Treasury bond market, so this week's sharp rise in bond prices and fall in interest rates will lower borrowing costs for home buyers who've waited to lock in their loans.</p><p>Patty Davis, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Home buyers are assessing the dramatic drop in market rates this week, and so too, of course, are investors.</p><p>Joining us now from Pittsburgh, we have with us Tom Madden of Federated Investors.  Tom manages some $23 billion, primarily in stock and bond funds.</p><p>Tom, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>TOM MADDEN, CIO, FEDERATED INVESTORS: Good evening, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, we have a big rally in the bond market this week, and a very strong rally in stocks in the last two days.  Now, do you think that this may be the start of a new leg up for the bull market in stocks?</p><p>MADDEN: Well, I think it's a much more reasonable bet than it was at the beginning of the week, and the litmus test is the long bond.  We've had a very powerful rally at the wrong end of the yield curve, and that tells me that bond rates, which have considerable influence over the level of common stocks, are moving in the right direction.  So I'm encouraged.</p><p>VARNEY: Twelve thousand on the Dow by early in the new year?</p><p>MADDEN: Yes, I actually had that number before this week, so I'm hoping some of my friends on our sales force will give me a little credit.  But that's what we're looking for.</p><p>VARNEY: Good luck on that one, Tom, now.  Which companies are driving this truly dynamic economy?  And which stocks are driving this dynamic bull market?</p><p>MADDEN: Well, I think that if you take a little bit longer look at the stock market, the two big positives that are causing the army of stocks to sort of advance are -- really have been the global recovery and the build-out of the global Internet or World Wide Web.</p><p>And if that army's advance was going to be slowed, it was going to be slowed by the guns of the central bankers.  And I think in a certain sense, what the market has been fretting about is the gun, a sort of a small-bore rifle, or is it a giant cannon which is going to discharge, you know, multiple rounds?</p><p>And I think that after the statistics this week, a lot of people feel more comfortable that any actions that the U.S. Fed takes or the Euro Central Bank takes will be moderate and fewer in number.  And that should allow continued leadership -- this is the key, to me -- by big tech and by major financial stocks.  And you can see much increased enthusiasm in both quarters in the market this week.</p><p>VARNEY: Major high-tech stocks, that's clearly a big part of your portfolio.  But Internet stocks, are you dabbling in there, in that area?</p><p>MADDEN: Well, we have been a little more cautious on the dot- coms, Stuart, and we felt that, you know, at some point in life, you have to have a real business plan and you have to have real positive cash flow from the operating cycle, and you have to have real book profits.</p><p>And I'm following the goings-on with Amazon.com very closely, because it seems to me that this is a sort of a bellwether for some of the difficulties which may continue to engage the dot-coms.</p><p>So we've really underemphasized those in our portfolio, and emphasized much more the EMCs and Ciscos and IBMs, which we think will be around for the duration.</p><p>VARNEY: Fair enough.  Tom Madden from Federated Investors, joining us from Pittsburgh, many thanks for being with us, Tom.</p><p>MADDEN: My pleasure.</p><p>BAY: Let's find out now what MONEYLINE's other reporters are working on for the rest of tonight's show.</p><p>We'll begin with Bill Dorman -- Bill.</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Willow.</p><p>Much more ahead on the troubles of Lockheed Martin.  The company's stock hit a new 52-week low today.  But before you start buying, there's some more news you should know.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Bruce Francis.</p><p>The name of this IPO means \"cool\" in Hawaiian, but demand was red-hot for Akamai in its first day of trading.  I'll tell you why investors were clamoring for shares.</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And I'm Peter Viles.</p><p>You know, Intel, Microsoft, and Home Depot.  But do you know the other new Dow stock?  Tonight, \"The Bottom Line\" on SBC, the Baby Bell that's becoming a blue chip -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thank you, Peter.  Those stories ahead.</p><p>But coming up next, the timing could not be worse.  Hershey, haunted by a high-tech nightmare for Halloween.</p><p>VARNEY: Ah, yes, with the holidays also about treats for one tiny town in Maryland, we'll tell you about the windfall from the Blair Witch virus, when the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR returns.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From CNN's New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Tyco International tops tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" down 3 7/8.  And it was the most active stock on the baseball.  \"The New York Times\" raised new questions about Tyco's accounting practices.  But two analysts tell MONEYLINE there was nothing new revealed in the article, and that they still do not believe that Tyco abused accounting rules.</p><p>Network Solutions up 16 1/4, Lehman Brothers restated its new buy -- its buy rating for the Internet name registrar and raised its price target to $150 a share.</p><p>The Gap up 2 3/8.  Goldman Sachs added the retailer to its recommended list.  Yesterday, Robert Fisher resigned as president of Gap Stores.</p><p>BAY: In other headlines, some big management changes at the world's largest beverage company.  Coca-Cola said senior VP Jack Stahl will take over responsibility for North America, Latin America, and the Minute Maid Company.  Ralph Cooper will leave Minute Maid to become president of the North America group.  He will report to Stall.</p><p>The changes come just over one week after Coca-Cola reported an 11 percent drop in profits.</p><p>And Levi Strauss will unzip its online stores.  Due to high costs, the struggling jeans maker will stop selling merchandise on its Web sites after Christmas.  Levi's clothing and accessories will now be sold on Web sites operated by J.C. Penney and Macy's.</p><p>VARNEY: Technology stocks not the only standout in today's session.  Another strong sector was paper stocks.  The group tore ahead on positive comments from Merrill Lynch.  It restated its long- term buy ratings for International Paper and Champion International. The chief executive of International Paper spoke about his company's future at the Business Council meeting in Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DILLON, CEO, INTERNATIONAL PAPER: My expectations, as we look forward over the next two months and year, is we'll continue to see a very good market condition, and very good opportunities for International Paper.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: And here's how the sector did today.  International Paper up nearly 4 1/4, Champion International gained more than 4 1/4, Merrill Lynch also upgraded and restated its ratings on other paper stocks today.  They went up, Boise Cascade gaining nearly 4 3/4, Weyerhaeuser up more than 4, Georgia Pacific gained more than 3 points.</p><p>BAY: Hershey finds its leading-edge technology fails to deliver the goods.  A supply nightmare just in time for Halloween, all because the country's top candy maker didn't get the gremlins out of its new computer system.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At this candy wholesaler, Halloween will be here before some Hershey's shipments of chocolates and lollipops arrive.</p><p>Antonio Pelaez, Jr.'s Master Wholesaling Company buys more than $6 million worth of Hershey's candy a year.  Despite being a guest of Hershey salesmen at the last World Series game, he's upset with the company.</p><p>ANTONIO PELAEZ, JR., PRESIDENT, ANPESIL DISTRIBUTORS: Now you can see, there's a lot of empty spots that belongs to the Hershey palette, and usually there is (INAUDIBLE) of a truckload is missing here right now, do (ph) because they cannot make the deliveries in time.</p><p>FRANK: Across the country, Hershey's customers are bedeviled by incomplete shipments, mixed-up orders, and sometimes no shipment at all.  That's why Anpesil ordered more Mars and Nestle's products.</p><p>PELAEZ: At the present time, we are ahead with Mars about 10 percent, and Nestle will be almost the same thing.</p><p>FRANK: Hershey's new computerized shipping system, installed last July, is the problem, and it is still not fixed.  The company estimates it will cost more than $100 million in sales for Halloween, the biggest candy day of the year.</p><p>JOHN MCMILLIN, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: I'm sure there's going to be a couple stores in America where a consumer's going to go in and ask for Hershey chocolate bars, and the retailer's going to say, I don't have any.  And the consumer's going to say, Trick or treat.  I mean, it's going to be -- it's going to cause some surprise.  But I would argue that that will be the exception rather than the rule.</p><p>FRANK: Still, some investors have lost their taste for Hershey's stock, melting 18 percent from its share price since the beginning of the year.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>If Hershey's Halloween chill continues. the question is, will retailers switch some shelf space to competitors, or will they still stick with the nation's number one candy maker?</p><p>Willow?</p><p>BAY: Thank you, Allan.  Allan Dodds Frank reporting.</p><p>VARNEY: When MONEYLINE returns, he was gracious in victory and gracious in defeat.  Today, his tear-stained memorial for golf champ Payne Stewart.</p><p>BAY: It was a celebration of an extraordinary life.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: An extraordinary tribute to the life of golfer Payne Stewart today near his home in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SINGER (singing): Hey, God, I just lost a dear old friend.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: Surrounded by friends from both on the links and of, Stewart's wife, Tracey, and their two children heard an outpouring of affection for the tough 42-year-old competitor who had a zest for life.  Pro golfer and close friend Paul Azinger began his eulogy by adopting the golfer's trademark fashion style.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL AZINGER, FRIEND: I always felt intimidated when I was going out with Payne because I knew he was going to assess what I was wearing.  I felt pressure this morning, knowing he'd be watching.</p><p>TRACEY STEWART, PAYNE STEWART'S WIFE: I thank you, Payne, for telling me every single day of our life together that you loved me.  I knew it already, but it sure was good to hear you say it.</p><p>As I look back now, I realize that even after 18 years of marriage Payne was still the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, not because of the way he looked on the outside any more, but because of what was on the inside.</p><p>We love you.  Let the party in Heaven begin.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: Meanwhile, the investigation into the cause of Monday's crash suffered another setback today.  Federal aviation officials recovered the jet's cockpit voice recorder but discovered it was damaged in the crash.  It's been sent to a lab to see if it can still yield any clues.</p><p>BAY: From President Clinton, a new proposal to shield the privacy of medical records.  Under the plan, the release of computerized records would be tightly restricted.  Patient consent would be required before distribution to employers or marketing companies.  The rules would not apply to older paper records.  Those require congressional action to protect.</p><p>VARNEY: A decision tonight which may have far-reaching implications for the First Amendment and the entire financial advice book genre.  The Beardstown Ladies investment club rocketed to fame earlier in the decade with their homespun investment wisdom and Gotham-sized returns.</p><p>The problem, you may recall, is that those returns turned out to be wildly inflated.  A much-touted 23 percent investment gain turned out to be a much more modest 9.1 percent.</p><p>A California appellate court has now ruled that the book jacket blurbs, which claim readers will be able to, quote, \"learn how to outperform professional money managers by 3 to 1,\" it's all false or misleading commercial speech and not protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>The decision could make publishers dramatically tone down the hyperbole common to promotional material.</p><p>BAY: It's said that the only thing certain in life are death and taxes.  Well, come New Year's, add Y2K.  In a letter to Congress, the Internal Revenue Service says it's preparing a backup system to issue tax refunds manually instead of electronically.</p><p>Turns out the IRS is experiencing, quote, \"trouble spots\" at a number of field offices.  The problem, high-risk, antiquated computer systems.  The service does say it is confident it will resolve problems by the new year but is making contingency plans anyway.</p><p>VARNEY: All right.  When MONEYLINE returns, a real-life Halloween story that ends with a treat.</p><p>BAY: A town bewitched by a movie scares up the cash for Blair- crazed fans.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Finally this half hour, the $100,000 movie \"Blair Witch Project\" took America by storm, grossing $140 million since its summer release.  It's also managed to turn the movie's location, the hamlet of Burkittsville, Maryland, into a magnet for the curious.</p><p>Kelli Arena reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Trude Head was initially angry when strangers from all of the world invaded her tiny town.  But her attitude is different now.</p><p>TRUDE HEAD, BURKITTSVILLE RESIDENT: They all were very friendly, and I guess you have to be friendly back.</p><p>ARENA: Especially if you're trying to sell Burkittsville dirt, local herbs, and other witchy items to souvenir-hungry tourists.</p><p>HEAD: It's burning the death of darkness and the birth of light. See?  So actually those stick-figures are a very positive sign.</p><p>ARENA: There are no stores in this sleepy hamlet, population 200.  And on a good day, Mrs. Head pulls in as much as $300.</p><p>(on camera): This graveyard is featured in the opening scenes of the film and is the most-visited site in Burkittsville.  The rest of the movie was not shot here, but that doesn't seem to matter to tourists looking for a \"Blair Witch\" fix.</p><p>(voice-over): They make their way from the cemetery to Margaret Kennedy's art studio, where she's taken to selling T-shirts and witch postcards.</p><p>MARGARET KENNEDY, ARTIST: This has been a short course, crash course in souvenir hunters.</p><p>ARENA: And Burkittsville grandmas are selling sticks and stones on the online auction site eBay.</p><p>While residents are cashing in, the town has actually lost money, $5,000 to date on extra police patrols, brochures, and replacing stolen property.</p><p>MAYOR JOYCE BROWN, BURKITTSVILLE: We are dealing with a very tight budget, and we have less than $100,000 to work with.  And this movie has certainly cost us.</p><p>ARENA: As for this Halloween, the town is bracing for as many as 1,000 visitors.  But the spell could soon be broken.</p><p>HEAD: It will not last, you know.  We are going to be a quiet town again.</p><p>ARENA: Kelli Arena, CNN financial news, Burkittsville, Maryland.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: You're watching THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.</p><p>BAY: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The MONEYLINE news hour continues.</p><p>Here again, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, in one of it's best point gains ever, the Nasdaq powers through yet another all-time high.</p><p>But Lockheed Martin dives to a new low on -- what else? -- a very gloomy profit warning.</p><p>Also tonight, our regular Friday feature, \"The Bottom Line.\" SBC Communications: As it enters the Dow, is it the Baby Bell to buy or sell?</p><p>VARNEY: First, our top story: the rip-roaring rally on Wall Street.  The market ended the week, and the month, on a stellar note, defying the dreaded October stigma.  In fact, it was a dazzling day for technology, and a record-setting day for the Nasdaq composite, which is now more than double -- repeat, more than double -- over the past year.</p><p>Fred Katayama has more on October's pleasant surprise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Euphoria engulfed Wall Street. Spectators cheered the Yankees as investors took the Fed chairman's remarks on inflation as good for the markets.</p><p>Mutual funds and other institutional investors took it as a green light, bolting from the sidelines to go shopping for a broad array of stocks.</p><p>GREGG HYMOWTIZ, MONEY MGR. ENTRUST CAPITAL: A lot of numbers, and a lot of the speech and commentary have all been very tame.  CPI, ECI, durable goods, housing stocks -- really, everything you can point to are -- is showing that you have inflation in check.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Many investors were left with that impression after Alan Greenspan hinted in a speech last night that rising bond yields seem to be keeping the economy from overheating.</p><p>Big name technology stocks led the rally on heavy volume, after Intel said it will meet orders for chips.  That helped propel the NASDAQ composite to a record high of 91 points to 2966.  It gained eight percent for the month.</p><p>The Dow Jones industrials rocketed 107 points for the month.  The Dow rose almost four percent.  An impressive feat, say market watchers, given the perception that October is a spooky month for investors, in part because of the crashes of 1929 and '87.</p><p>In the end, investors weathered earlier scares such as cautious comments from Fed officials, concerns over Y2K, earnings warnings from several high-profile companies including Dell and Union Carbide.</p><p>ROGER DEBARD, HOTCHKIS AND WILEY: We have come through the October period pretty well, but I wouldn't just assign that concern for risk in October.  We still have got November and December to go for 1999.</p><p>So you are going to have a season of tax-loss selling coming up in now in November and December.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA: And other market watchers say for a rally to continue interest rates must come down further, and advancing stocks must thoroughly rout declining stocks?</p><p>Stuart and Willow.</p><p>VARNEY: Haven't seen that just yet, though. There you are, Fred Katayama, thank you -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Investors welcome news that the red-hot housing market is cooling off.  Sales of new homes plunged 12.8 percent last month to their lowest level in nearly two years.  Economists have been predicting climbing mortgage rates would tame the housing boom and keep the economy from overheating.</p><p>The inflation-wary bond market rallied on the news.  The 30-year Treasury shot up more than a full point in price, pushing the yield all the way down to 6.16 percent.  That is it's lowest level in three weeks.</p><p>VARNEY: Now let's take a closer look at how today's stock market ran up so big.  On the big board, for the second straight day, winners beat losers by a better than two-to-one margin.</p><p>And for the first time in weeks -- long, long time -- there were more new highs than lows.</p><p>117 stocks hit new 52-week highs; 93 fell to those lows.</p><p>Today's big boost came from the tech's.  Lucent's up 1 1/4, Motorola up 3 5/8.</p><p>There were some losers.  American Express, for example, down seven after Morgan Stanley said the stock was over-valued.</p><p>And Tycho fell another 3 7/8 after the company admitted to the \"New York Times\" that it did not clearly disclose losses from acquisitions.</p><p>BAY: And one of the day's biggest losers: Lockheed Martin.  It dropped nearly three or 12 percent, with more than 14 million shares changing hands, seven times normal volume.  Its quarterly profits were impressive but its outlook for the future was anything but.  Lockheed warned of an earnings shortfall next year, and announced the resignation of its president.</p><p>Bill Dorman has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Shares of the nation's second leading military contractor are under attack. Lockheed Martin makes everything from missiles and fighter jets, to satellites and rockets.  Only Boeing gets more orders from the Pentagon.</p><p>As recently as last month, Lockheed Martin was expecting earnings-per-share next year of $2.15.  Now, the company expects less than half of that.</p><p>ROBERT FRIEDMAN, S&amp;P EQUITY GROUP: They really don't have a handle on the extent of the problems that they're facing in their core businesses. DORMAN: Aircraft orders are declining.  Satellite launch failures are increasing.  So are investment costs for a reusable launch vehicle to replace the space shuttle.</p><p>The company's president and chief operating officer, Peter Teets, is resigning, taking responsibility for the earning's shocker.  In a written statement he said:</p><p>\"The difficult times we have seen are not indicative of the company's real potential.\"</p><p>Investors have tired of waiting for Lockheed.

Bill Dorman reporting.</p><p>VARNEY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, a former playmate battles for half a billion.  Anna Nicole Smith, fighting a legal battle that could make her one of the richest women in America.</p><p>BAY: But, right after the break, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shatters yet another record.</p><p>What's next?  Well, we'll ask top fund manager David Alger when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Among today's big stock movers: Micron Technology up nearly 3 3/4.  Merrill Lynch made positive comments about the memory- chip maker, saying tight supply in the D-RAM market will continue through the end of next year.</p><p>Electronic Data Systems up 4 1/2.

It added to a sharp rally in late trading yesterday, after it announced a two-for-one stock split.</p><p>BAY: Technology stocks are the subject of tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus.\" The big names in computers and the Internet have fueled a spectacular run for the Nasdaq composite this year.  It's now up more than 35 percent in 1999.  That's more than double the Dow industrials' gains, and three times the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Joining us now, veteran tech investor, David Alger.  He manages more than 12 billion dollars in assets at the company which bears his name.</p><p>David, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>DAVID ALGER, FUND MANAGER: Delighted to be here.</p><p>BAY: Let me just read you something: By the time we get to October, the economy is going to be growing more slowly, the bond market is going to have a rally, and we'll be off to the races.  Sound familiar?</p><p>ALGER: Sounds very familiar to me, yes.</p><p>BAY: You said that to us in the August.  What did you know then that we didn't?</p><p>ALGER: Well, you know, it's really interesting.  I think its only been in the last couple of weeks that the -- it's been become apparent that the economy really is going more slowly.</p><p>I mean, the housing statistics is one thing that, you know, been very important.</p><p>But I think it's really interesting if you are look at the GDP numbers, the deflator was so low.  And I think that has been a big contributor to the bond market rally, also.</p><p>BAY: When you look at the market, are we seeing just a good rally or are we seeing a change in sentiment?</p><p>ALGER: I think what we'll see is going to be a lot of volatility between now and the Fed meeting.  But I think there has been a change in sentiment to the effect that a lot of people now would say that the Fed probably is not going to raise rates in November.  And I think that is a big shift from two weeks ago.</p><p>BAY: What do you think?</p><p>ALGER: I don't think the Fed will raise rates.  I think there's a lot of reasons why they won't.  Number one, the economy is slowing, as we've said.</p><p>Number two, the Y2K problem, you, which is, you know, the Fed wants to create liquidity, and that's not the way to do it certainly. Number three, I think that the signs of inflation are really diminishing.  The deflator is one.  The employment cost index of course is another.</p><p>BAY: You mentioned volatility a second ago.  It has become commonplace to see the Nasdaq go up or down 1 percent a day.  Will we continue to see that kind of volatility?  Should we just get used to it?</p><p>ALGER: I don't know.  This month has been really amazing.  I mean, when you think about, the month started on the Dow at 10200, and, you know, moved up to 10700, dropped to 9880 or something like that, and is now back at 10800, up 600 on the month.  I mean, that's pretty amazing.</p><p>BAY: Do you still think, as you did in August, that we are going to see growth in the tech sector in the 30 percent to 50 percent, and perhaps might even accelerate?</p><p>ALGER: I think so.  I think it's going to be the most exciting sector for the next five years.</p><p>BAY: Some of your top holdings -- Microsoft.  Great earning's report.  I think they used the word \"awesome\" in describing their demand.  But some fund managers are suggested that this is not the momentum play that it once was.  What's your reaction?</p><p>ALGER: Well, I think that they're keying off Steve Ballmer's comments that his stock is grotesquely overvalued or whatever he said. I don't happen to agree with that.  I mean, clearly, if you add back in the deferred revenue, Microsoft is not going quite as quickly as it was.  But I think that's a product-cycle question.  And I think gross is going to reaccelerate.</p><p>BAY: We of course waiting for the findings of fact from Judge Jackson in their trial.  What will a negative finding of fact do to that stock?</p><p>ALGER: I'm not sure it's going to do anything, because I think, you know, what is the remedy?  If they split it up, I think the company grows faster -- or the companies grow faster.  It will be more exciting stock.  You know, if they fine, it, you know, there's not enough money in the world to fine Microsoft.  So what can they really do to it?</p><p>BAY: We have about 20 seconds left.  I'd like your take on Internet stocks.  Are you putting money in them?</p><p>ALGER: Yes.  We like it a lot.  I think the numbers that are going to be reported for the fourth quarter -- not the third quarter, but the fourth quarter -- are just going to be spectacular.  I think Amazon might do $750 million in business in the fourth quarter.</p><p>BAY: So you're not worried about any of these e-commerce stocks?</p><p>ALGER: Not at all. BAY: We hear so much about them plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into marketing costs.  You think their sale are going to skyrocket?</p><p>ALGER: Well, Amazon's going for it.  I mean, it's got its pedal right on the firewall, and it's going to spend until everyone else drops out of the business; that's the objective.  It could grow more slowly and make more money, but they're not doing that.  And I think it's good strategy.</p><p>BAY: David Alger, Alger Funds, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ALGER: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Coming up: one for the record books, a company with a name taken from Hawaii soars on its market debut.</p><p>BAY: Akamai that would be.</p><p>And investors are not the only ones calling this IPO cool.  We'll explain why when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: It helps speed up the Internet.  And today, investors helped push Akamai Technology on the fast track to IPO history.  The stock soared on its market debut, up more than 458 percent, making it the fourth best opening ever for an IPO.  So what makes this company so special?  Well, the name \"Akamai\" is a Hawaiian word for \"cool,\" and as Bruce Francis reports, its ties to the Internet don't hurt either.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The need for speed catapulted Akamai in its first day of trading.  The shares were offered at $26 apiece, and instantly soared to $110 at the open.  By the end of the day, Akamai had an instant market value of over $13 billion -- not bad for a company that lost $28 million last year.</p><p>And what do they do?  Akamai develops software that helps the Web run faster.  Leading Web content firms like Yahoo! use Akamai Technology to speed delivery of information.  Web traffic isn't steady, and when the clicks come fast and furious, it can take seven seconds or more to download a page of information -- an eternity in Internet time.  Akamai says that its products can cut the Worldwide wait down to less than half a second most of the time.  Akamai pulls this off with a combination of software and a network of servers scattered around the Web.</p><p>SUJATA RAMNARAYAN, INDUSTRY ANALYST, DATAQUEST: It's going to come from the server that's closest to you on the network, so that it bypasses a lot of the congestion on the Internet -- the congestion on the network, and you get your content much faster.</p><p>FRANCIS: Akamai has plenty of competition, including Alteon Web Systems, F5 Networks and Sandpiper Networks.  But with the explosion of Web content, analysts say there is plenty of business now to go around.</p><p>RAMNARAYAN: As we all know, the number of Web sites is increasing every day.  There's more and more content going on the Web as well.  So -- and there's also more multimedia which is coming up on the Web.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, file this IPO under \"revenge of the nerds.\" Akamai's co-founder, MIT Professor F. Thomson Leighton, bought more than 11 million shares of Akamai for around $63,000.  Tonight, his stake is worth more than $1.6 billion.</p><p>Aloha to that, Willow.</p><p>BAY: That would be sweet revenge, Bruce, very sweet.  Thank you.</p><p>Bruce Francis reporting.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE: the first blue chip Baby Bell.</p><p>VARNEY: And \"The Bottom Line\" on SBC Communications, about to join a very exclusive club.  Our regular Friday special report is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Wall Street will begin the month of November with a brand new look for the world's most widely watched index.  Starting Monday, IntelMicrosoft, Home Depot and SBC Communications are in. Sears, Union Carbide, Chevron and Goodyear are out.</p><p>MONEYLINE caught up with a co-founder of one of the new blue chips, who downplayed the honor.  But of course he can afford to be blase.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL GATES, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, MICROSOFT: I wouldn't say it's a big deal.  It's not something I was thinking about.  I don't think it affects the stock or the products or any of those things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: \"The Bottom Line\" tonight look at one of Microsoft's Dow colleagues: SBC Communications.  The Texas-based telecom is the nation's biggest Baby Bell, and it's about to become the first ever to join the venerable Dow 30.</p><p>Peter Viles has more on our regular Friday feature, inside one company on the move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): 1984: The Reagan campaign called it \"morning in America.\" It was the dawn also of a new age in the phone business.  A landmark decision broke AT&amp;T into seven Baby Bells.  Fifteen years later, one of them has blossomed into a blue-chip stock.  And it is not the Bell from New York, the nation's business capital, and not the Bell from Washington.  It is the one from Texas, once known as Southwest Bell, now SBC Communications, built into a blue chip by a former engineer named Ed Whitacre.</p><p>DAVID OTTO, EDWARD JONES: SBC didn't have the best territory. They were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984 in the middle of one of the worst oil times in recent memory.  And Oklahoma and Texas were shrinking; they weren't growing.  Ed Whitacre came in the late '80s, early '90s, and really turned the ship around.  He said -- he told investors what they were going to do, and then he went and did it.</p><p>VILES: What Whitacre did was put back together part of the national network the courts had broken up, merging with Pacific Telesis and then Ameritech.</p><p>OTTO: SBC broke the mold.  They were the first one out of the box to buy a former Bell company, so a peer or a sister, if you will, in the Baby Bell divestiture when they went out to California and acquired Pacific Telesis a few years ago.</p><p>VILES: The resulting company owns 60 million local access lines. Only the planned combination of Bell Atlantic and GTE would have more. Whitacre has also built a wireless business with 10 million customers. Again, only Bell AtlanticGTE would have more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The goal in telecommunications today is the one-stop shopping.  It's one bill, one provider, one customer service agent.  So your getting your traditional kitchen telephone service, you're getting your car phone, you're getting your cable TV, your Internet, and anything else that goes along with it, you're getting from one company, and SBC wants to be that one.</p><p>VILES: If the goal is to be all things to all customers.  SBC is still hamstrung by regulators in long distance.  It has less than one percent of that market, now dominated by AT&amp;T and the MCI- Worldcom/Sprint combination.  Still, it is one of the four clear leaders in telecommunications.  Call it the $25 billion cash-flow club, according to PaineWebber estimates, for the year 2001.</p><p>But SBC's stock has had a choppy year, weighed down by conditions of the Ameritech merger and by plans for a huge spending spree.  The company is putting $6 billion on the line to upgrade its local access lines for broadband, or high-speed, Internet delivery.</p><p>DON KIERNAN, CFO, SBC COMMUNICATIONS: It's an incredibly aggressive strategy.  It brings the Internet to the home -- something that's been out there as a promise, but never fulfilled.  It's going to create a lot of value for our shareowners, but it's a major change for us, and we're off and running; we're very excited about it.</p><p>VILES (on camera): SBC aims to win 50 percent of the market for high-speed Internet service, an aggressive goal that, and if they reach it, they give the Dow industrials not just a new telephone company, but a new Internet company.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE: on tonight's docket, the legal battle over a billion dollar estate.  And guess who's coming to court?</p><p>VARNEY: But up next, \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight, before Monday's markets open.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Here's our check on what could move the markets next week: Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot and SBC Communications start trading as Dow components on Monday.  Fed chief Alan Greenspan talks about the economy and mortgage rates to America's community bankers. That takes place on Tuesday.  As far as economic reports, the all- important employment figures due out on Friday.  Also expected, the latest numbers the manufacturing sector, personal income and spending, and chain store sales.  On the earnings front: Cigna, Qualcomm and Oxford Health expected to report.  And do watch Citrix Systems.  The software company will replace Mobil in the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>BAY: After a singular career as a poster girl for \"Playboy\" and Guess jeans, Anna Nicole Smith largely faded from her early 90's spotlight.  Well, she's re-emerged tonight, involved in a bitter courtroom contest over the estate of her late husband.  And if she wins, she instantly becomes one of the richest women in the world.</p><p>With the details, Casey Wian.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1993)</p><p>ANNA NICOLE SMITH, MODEL: It's a big check.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The $100,000 check Anna Nicole Smith received as \"Playboy's\" Playmate of the Year in 1993 may soon seem like not much more than a dollar bill in the ex- stripper's G-string.  The former Guess model and actress is seeking at least $535 million from the estate of her late husband, Texas oil man J. Howard Marshall II.  The two married in 1994, when she was 26 and he was 89.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: I want to tell my husband, J. Howard Marshall, that I love him very much, and I wish he was here, and I miss you and -- all my love to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WIAN: Marshall died 14 months later, leaving a legacy of contested wills, family feuds and scattered assets courts in California and Texas are now trying to sort out.</p><p>SMITH: I can't comment about the case.  I'm sorry.</p><p>WIAN: A lawyer for one of Marshall's sons called the claims by Smith, who in court is going by her real name, Vickie Lynn Marshall, a fantasy.  Another of the billionaire's sons, already disinherited, is testifying in support of the widow Marshall.</p><p>Much of the billion dollar-plus estate consists of stock of Koch Industries, a Wichita, Kansas, oil company that's one of the nation's largest privately held firms.</p><p>PHILIP BOESCH, ANNA NICOLE SMITH ATTORNEY: The products and the extraordinary nature of Koch Industries, when someone says there's no money -- I guess a judge will have to decide.</p><p>WIAN: Smith, who has had drug and weight problems in the past, is now under a doctor's care for a herniated disk.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I'm very nervous.</p><p>WIAN: She lives with her 13-year-old son in a Los Angeles suburb, and wants to restart her career by opening her own film studio.  But for now, she's bankrupt, and her legal battle is expected to last until January.</p><p>Casey Wian, CNN Financial News, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Well, that's MONEYLINE for this Friday.  I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, it is.  And I'm Stuart Varney.  Thanks for joining us.

Shares of technology stocks are far ahead of the rest of the equity sector field this year, based on a set of exchange traded funds. Barring a dramatic reversal in the final weeks of December, it appears that tech will close out 2019 with an outsized gain.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) closed on Tuesday (Dec. </p><p>10) with a red-hot 42.4% total return year to date. The performance leaves the remaining sector funds well behind XLK's blow-out performance in 2019. Based on recent trading, it appears that the fund still enjoys a solid upside bias.The second-best performer this year: Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), up 29.2% so far in 2019. That's a strong gain, although it's no match for XLK's run.Learn To Use R For Portfolio Analysis Quantitative Investment Portfolio Analytics In R:An Introduction To R For Modeling Portfolio Risk and Return[1]By James PicernoMeanwhile, the spread between the strongest and weakest sector performances this year is conspicuously wide. More than 35 percentage points separates XLK's 2019 run over Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), which is up this year by a relatively muted 7.0%.Note, too, that the broad market is having a stellar year, in absolute and relative terms. SPDR S...00 (SPY) ended yesterday's trading session with a 27.2% total return - ahead of seven out of the 11 eleven sector funds in the chart above.Despite the strong rally in tech, there's growing concern that proposed regulations could hinder companies in this corner in the years ahead. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, for example, has outlined a plan[2] to break up the major tech firms. But for now, there's no sign that investors are worried, particularly for the mega-cap tech stocks. As a New York Times article earlier this week observed,[3] 'Big Tech Is Under Attack, and Investors Couldn't Care Less.' One of the reasons for the so-far unshakable optimism that graces the largest tech stocks, says Jeb Breece, principal at New York-based money manager Spears Abacus: 'They are more economically resilient. A dollar of tech earnings seems like more of a sure bet than a dollar of Midwestern steel earnings.'In fact, there's plenty of optimism to spread around these days. Profiling all the sector funds listed above through a momentum lens continues to reflect a bullish bias generally. The analysis is based on two sets of moving averages for the sector ETFs listed above. The first compares the 10-day moving average with its 100-day counterpart \u2014 a proxy for short-term trending behavior (red line in chart below). A second set of moving averages (50 and 200 days) represents an intermediate measure of the trend (blue line). Through yesterday's close, the two indicators continue to reflect a heavy dose of positive momentum overall.Is Recession Risk Rising?

Developments at companies such as Amazon and Tesla have prompted investors to take a hard, fresh look at the firms' growth prospects and the stocks' lofty prices. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook was hit with a data-privacy scandal. Amazon.com Inc.came under attack again by President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>over its sales taxes and U.S. Postal Service contract. Concern mounted about Tesla Inc.'s cash needs. The self-driving vehicle industry was roiled by a pedestrian fatality in Arizona caused by an autonomous Uber car.</p><p>Because the tech giants' stocks - and the stocks' enormous price gains in the last two years - have attracted an increasingly larger following, their abrupt declines helped bring down the overall stock market in March.</p><p>For instance, the NYSE FANG+ index plunged nearly 8 percent this week before finishing nearly unchanged Thursday. The index tracks the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc.and Google parent Alphabet Inc. - and six others, including Tesla and Twitter Inc.</p><p>The broader, tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which soared 28 percent last year and gained an additional 5.4 percent in the first two months of this year, fell 2.9 percent in March, its worst monthly showing since January 2016.</p><p>\"The gains were easy the last few years\" with the big tech shares, said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group. \"Investors haven't been challenged much with these stocks. Now, there's been news that questions their assumptions.</p><p>\"Investors are now saying, 'Maybe the stock isn't worth as much as we thought,'\" he said.</p><p>But as Wall Street heads into a three-day break - the market is closed today for Good Friday - the question is whether investors used the bad news simply to take some of their big profits or whether the developments point to trends that could curb the companies' longer-term business prospects, thus making current stock prices overvalued.</p><p>Consider: Even after  tech's  dreary week, Amazon is still up 66 percent over the last 12 months, compared with a 12 percent gain in the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. Netflixhas doubled in price and Twitter has surged 93 percent in the period. </p><p>The gains mainly reflect investors' expectations that the firms enjoy dominance in their various spheres and will continue their heady growth in the years to come.</p><p>With gains like those, the negative news gave many investors an apt reason to cash out. And some of those investors were momentum players with little interest in the companies' long-term  outlooks, Ware said.</p><p>\"These folks are not fundamentally rooted in their analysis,\" Ware said. \"They're just renting the stock when there's momentum. And when that momentum starts to turn, these folks will flee and take their profits.\"</p><p>For those investors looking at the tech giants for the long term, \"one of the questions we're getting is whether the recent declines in these stocks (are) indicative of something more sinister in the market,\" said Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors in Torrance.</p><p>\"We don't subscribe to that\" thinking and, in fact, see the stocks' recent pullback as \"making them more attractive,\" Phillips said.</p><p>One example for Phillips is Amazon.  Many traders seemed to agree Thursday, as Amazon recovered from early losses - and a 4.4 percent drop the prior day - and finished with a gain of 1 percent.</p><p>Facebook jumped 4.4 percent on Thursday but was still down 17 percent from Feb. 1. Netflixand Alphabet both rose 3 percent. Apple Inc., which is one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, rose nearly 1 percent.</p><p>\"A lot of [the selling] was profit-taking but also an acknowledgment that these stocks, which have trended higher for quite some time, have come under a different scrutiny and are getting the wrong kind of attention,\" Phillips said.</p><p>Facebook provides a good example of the challenge longer-term investors now face.</p><p>Owing to the scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, which gathered data from about 50 million Facebook users without their permission, Facebook is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and could be the focus of regulatory reform by Congress.</p><p>One argument for investors is that \"the Cambridge fiasco represents a seminal negative moment that will change the future business model and growth trajectory of Facebook,\" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a recent note to clients.</p><p>But Ives said \"we ultimately believe Facebook will emerge from this crisis with minimal regulatory changes and limited financial damage to its user base and advertising kingdom,\" even if this represents \"the darkest chapter for Facebook and [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg in its 14-year history.\"</p><p>Peltz writes for the California News Group, publisher of the Union-Tribune and Los Angeles Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0064767768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0C-7RN1-DY37-F2NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0006BO1</classCode><className>UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Year to date, the tech sector is enjoying a solid gain - a conspicuous outlier so far in 2020, based on a set of exchange traded funds.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) is up 6.1% so far this year (through May 28). Although the fund was clobbered with everything else during the dramatic selling wave in March, the fund has rebounded sharply and has recovered nearly all its previous loss. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/xlk.29may2020.png\">http://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/xlk.29may2020.png</url> Even health care, presumably the darling sector in a health care crisis, can't compete on a year-to-date basis. Although Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) has also mounted a robust recovery in recent weeks, at the moment the fund's year-to-date performance is virtually flat with a fractional 0.4% gain.Learn To Use R For Portfolio Analysis Quantitative Investment Portfolio Analytics In R:An Introduction To R For Modeling Portfolio Risk and Return[1]By James PicernoIn fact, most of the US equity market's sectors remain underwater this year, with financials and energy leading the red-ink brigade. Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) is the worst performer in 2020. Although the fund has bounced modestly since late-March, it remains deep in the hole with a 33.6% decline this year. Stocks generally continue to suffer on a year-to-date basis. The market benchmark remains down 5.3% through yesterday's closed, based on SPDR S&amp;#38;P 500 (SPY).       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sectors.etfs_.ytd_.barplot.2020-05-29-1.png\">http://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sectors.etfs_.ytd_.barplot.2020-05-29-1.png</url> A key driver of tech's rally is linked to expectations of rising fortunes for the largest companies in the sector. In a sign of the times, the leading names in this corner are reportedly ramping up searches to exploit opportunities. The FT notes[2] that the largest tech firms are on a 'pandemic mergers-and-acquisitions spree,' courtesy of high cash balances in the hundreds of billions of dollars. 'This crisis threatens to further entrench the power of Big Tech,' notes[3] Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank. 'These companies are already extraordinarily powerful, but they're well positioned to emerge as the biggest winners of COVID-19 unless some legislative action is taken.' The question is whether there's a political backlash is brewing? The topic appears to be heating up after President Donald Trump yesterday signed an executive order[4] that reduces legal protections for social media companies. It's unclear what awaits the tech sector from a regulatory perspective.

The S&amp;;P 500 index closed down 7.62 points at 2,605.00 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 59.58 points to 6,949.23.</p><p>The declines included losses from major U.S. tech stocks, with Amazon falling on reports U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is looking to go after the company and Tesla declining on a downgraded credit rating and more concerns over the self-driving vehicles, following recent declines at Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Shares of Amazon plunged after a report that Trump is \"obsessed\" with the e-commerce giant and wants to \"go after\" the company.</p><p>News site Axios reported that Trump brings up Amazon when discussing tax policy and antitrust cases. The president reportedly hears from real estate friends that the Seattle-based online giant is destroying shopping malls, mom-and-pop stores and brick-and-mortar retailers - and he believes them.</p><p>According to an unidentified source that spoke to Trump, the president has \"wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law,\" Axios reported.</p><p>Amazon stock was down 6.4 percent Wednesday morning.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly posted on Twitter about Amazon over the past year. In August, he wrote that the company was \"doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!\" Trump's ire has also extended to the</p><p>Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The president has frequently referred to the Post as the \"Amazon Washington Post.\" \"The big story here is the big tech stocks trading at multiples that make no sense, but they were going up purely on momentum, the wind is coming out of the sail here, and they're looking vulnerable and bringing down the rest of the market with them,\" said Levine.</p><p>The decline in stocks was felt in Canada as well, where BlackBerry Ltd. beat analyst expectations with $233 million US of revenue for the last quarter, but slipped 1.38 per cent to $15.76 on the TSX.</p><p>The stock losses from particular issues at larger technology companies are, however, likely distorting the view of the overall health of market because they have so much sway over some of the indexes, said Levine. \"Indexes are going to show, especially in the U.S., more negative than what's going on with the average stock.\"</p><p>The Canadian dollar closed at 77.51, down 0.2 of a US cent.</p><p>The May crude contract ended down 87 cents at US$64.38 per barrel and the May natural gas contract was down two cents at US$2.69 per mmBTU.

Google's shares have gained 5%.</p><p>What makes Facebook's performance even more astonishing is that it has come despite criticism about fake news proliferating on Facebook, concerns about some of its metrics being wrong and speculation that CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>may seek public office.</p><p>But investors are looking past that and focusing on the fact that Facebookis expected to keep posting impressive levels of growth. </p><p>Analysts are predicting that Facebookwill report a year-over-year revenue increase of 45% for the fourth quarter and 65% surge in earnings per share. Facebookwill report its results on February 1.</p><p>Wall Street is bullish about the earnings prospects for the other FANG stocks too. <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>which will kick off tech earnings season when it reports its results Wednesday, is expected to post sales and earnings increases of more than 30% from a year ago. </p><p>Analysts are forecasting a 25% jump in sales for Amazon and more than 35% increase in profits. And Googleis expected to report earnings growth of 11% and a revenue increase of nearly 20%.</p><p>It seems that these strong fundamentals are trumping Trump fears. Tech investors were worried in the immediate aftermath of Trump's win over <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>for several reasons. </p><p>Concerns about a crackdown on immigration, most notably on H1-B visas that allow many foreign workers to come to Silicon Valley, hurt the stocks of big tech companies. </p><p>Trump's protectionist rhetoric wasn't helping either since most large tech companies do big business overseas. </p><p>But sentiment has shifted in the past few weeks. Investors are focusing more on some of the potential positives of a <person><nameText>Trump administration.</nameText></person></p><p>The meeting that Trump held with leaders of several big tech companies in New York last month seemed to help allay some of the concerns investors had about Trump.</p><p>Investors also seem to recognize that corporate tax reform, particularly changes that could allow companies to bring back cash being held overseas at lower rates, could be good for the tech sector. </p><p>Googlesaid in its most recent earnings report in October that it had $50 billion in cash and investments, 60% of its overall cash hoard, outside of the U.S. Apple and Microsoft hold an even bigger percentage of their cash overseas.</p><p>Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares, an investment firm that runs several ETFs focused on dividends, said Monday that assuming Trump follows through on his tax reform promise, more tech companies may consider paying dividends. </p><p>Ervin highlighted Google, Amazon and Facebookas three that have enough cash to easily afford a dividend. </p><p>\"It's reasonable to assume most of those companies will want to put that cash to work,\" he said. </p><p>Tech stocks are also rallying on the hopes of broader economic stimulus from Trump and the Republican Congress. </p><p>It stands to reason that if $1 trillion is spent on the nation's roads, bridges and other physical infrastructure, that could boost overall economic growth. That would be good for tech companies too, especially if stimulus lifts consumer spending.</p><p>But are investors too optimistic?</p><p>Terri Spath, chief investment officer of Sierra Investment Management, wrote in a recent report to clients that she's worried that the market rally is about to stall.</p><p>\"Stimulative policy should turbocharge growth and boost corporate profits, but stocks are ahead of themselves,\" she wrote.</p><p>\"The anticipation of changes in tax and regulatory policy are ahead of the reality right now. We like the improved optimism in corporations and consumers,\" she added. \"Proceed with caution. The sugar high is wearing off.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

So did CNNMoney's Tech 30 index. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 also ended lower, but not nearly as much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the sell-off, stocks regained some lost ground late in the trading session. The Nasdaq was down 2% earlier in the day.</p><p>Netflix was under the most pressure. The stock fell almost 7% and was the biggest loser in the Tech 30.</p><p>It appears that Netflix investors are worried about the possibility of competition from Apple after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company is exploring a partnership with Comcast for an Apple-branded TV service. Shares of Apple were actually one of the few big tech stocks moving higher.</p><p>\"$AAPL the one day apple goes up the nasdaq tanks...no luck with this stock,\" said BarryBye on StockTwits.</p><p/><p>But Netflix wasn't the only momentum tech taking a beating. Some other well-known Internet stocks, including Yahoo!, Linkedin, Twitter, Priceline and Facebook, also suffered.</p><p>StockTwits trader StrayTrader wasn't surprised by the tech sector's decline.</p><p>\"$LNKD $NFLX never had any rational basis for valuations at their peak levels ... both could plunge from here and still be overvalued,\" he said.</p><p>StockTwits user OptionsHero echoed that sentiment.</p><p>\"The old stairs up, elevator down saying is in full effect. $PCLN, $NFLX,\" he said.</p><p>Biotech stocks, which had been on a tear this year, also pulled back. The iShares NasdaqBiotechnology ETF dropped almost 3%. The sector is considered speculative because investors are in many cases betting on drugs that have yet to be approved. The leaders in the industry, while profitable, also tend to trade at very high valuations.</p><p>Shares of Nu Skin surged over 18% after the company said it was fined around $700,000 for its business practices in China. The beauty products marketer had previously disclosed that it was being investigated by Chinese regulators, but the relatively small penalty seems to be a relief to investors who had feared a more major regulatory blow.</p><p>\"$NUS Wow you gotta be kidding me ... fine is like glass of water in an ocean for NUS, this stock has buy written all over it! Very bullish,\" said Championinvestor.</p><p>Herbalife, the nutritional supplements distributor that uses a similar multi-level marketing sales model as Nu Skin, also rallied on the news. Herbalife revealed earlier this month that it is being probed by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The company has been in the crosshairs of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has publicly called it a pyramid scheme and unveiled a large bet that its stock price would fall. He also recently disclosed what he says are more shady tactics by the company in China.</p><p/><p>Lions Gate shares rose almost 4% after the studio's film \"Divergent\" had a strong opening at the box office. Many analysts expected a weaker showing for the movie.</p><p>StockTwits trader Chase03670 felt that the film could have staying power.</p><p>\"Friendly reminder that HS spring breaks begin this week and extend into April. A+ CinemaScore among under 18 yr olds bodes well. $LGF,\" he noted.</p><p>Investors were also gearing up for some high profile initial public offerings in the days ahead.</p><p>King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the popular Candy Crush Saga online game is one of 14 companies currently scheduled to go public this week.</p><p>The IPO mania is part of a global trend, as more and more companies seek to go public in order to take advantage of increased demand for stocks.</p><p/><p>European stock markets closed mostly lower as the Russian takeover of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula continues to dominate sentiment.</p><p>Asian markets ended with some significant gains though, despite HSBC data that showed Chinese manufacturing activity fell to an eight-month low in March. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shot up by 1.9% and the Shanghai Composite rose by 0.9%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20140324stocks-markets1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BTR-5JW1-JBPX-W011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><timeReceived>4:14 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 24, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002BFF</classCode><className>NU SKIN ENTERPRISES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS532230 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

So did CNNMoney's Tech 30 index. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 also ended lower, but not nearly as much. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the sell-off, stocks regained some lost ground late in the trading session. The Nasdaq was down 2% earlier in the day. </p><p>Netflix was under the most pressure. The stock fell almost 7% and was the biggest loser in the Tech 30. </p><p>It appears that Netflix investors are worried about the possibility of competition from Apple after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company is exploring a partnership with Comcast for an Apple-branded TV service. Shares of Apple were actually one of the few big tech stocks moving higher. </p><p>\"$AAPL the one day apple goes up the nasdaq tanks...no luck with this stock,\" said BarryBye on Stocktwits. </p><p>But Netflix wasn't the only momentum tech taking a beating. Some other well-known Internet stocks, including Yahoo!, Linkedin, Twitter, Priceline and Facebook, also suffered. </p><p>StockTwits trader StrayTrader wasn't surprised by the tech sector's decline.</p><p>\"$LNKD $NFLX never had any rational basis for valuations at their peak levels ... both could plunge from here and still be overvalued,\" he said.</p><p>StockTwits user OptionsHero echoed that sentiment.</p><p>\"The old stairs up, elevator down saying is in full effect. $PCLN, $NFLX,\" he said. </p><p>Biotech stocks, which had been on a tear this year, also pulled back. The iShares NasdaqBiotechnology ETF dropped almost 3%. The sector is considered speculative because investors are in many cases betting on drugs that have yet to be approved. The leaders in the industry, while profitable, also tend to trade at very high valuations.</p><p>Shares of Nu Skin surged over 18% after the company said it was fined around $700,000 for its business practices in China. The beauty products marketer had previously disclosed that it was being investigated by Chinese regulators, but the relatively small penalty seems to be a relief to investors who had feared a more major regulatory blow. </p><p>\"$NUS Wow you gotta be kidding me ... fine is like glass of water in an ocean for NUS, this stock has buy written all over it! Very bullish,\" said Championinvestor. </p><p>Herbalife, the nutritional supplements distributor that uses a similar multi-level marketing sales model as Nu Skin, also rallied on the news. Herbalife revealed earlier this month that it is being probed by the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>The company has been in the crosshairs of hedge fund manager <person><nameText>Bill Ackman, </nameText></person>who has publicly called it a pyramid scheme and unveiled a large bet that its stock price would fall. He also recently disclosed what he says are more shady tactics by the company in China.</p><p>Lions Gate shares rose almost 4% after the studio's film \"Divergent\" had a strong opening at the box office. Many analysts expected a weaker showing for the movie. </p><p>StockTwits trader Chase03670 felt that the film could have staying power. </p><p>\"Friendly reminder that HS spring breaks begin this week and extend into April. A+ CinemaScore among under 18 yr olds bodes well. $LGF,\" he noted. </p><p>Investors were also gearing up for some high profile initial public offerings in the days ahead. </p><p>King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the popular Candy Crush Saga online game is one of 14 companies currently scheduled to go public this week. </p><p>The IPO mania is part of a global trend, as more and more companies seek to go public in order to take advantage of increased demand for stocks. </p><p>European stock markets closed mostly lower as the Russian takeover of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula continues to dominate sentiment.</p><p>Asian markets ended with some significant gains though, despite HSBC data that showed Chinese manufacturing activity fell to an eight-month low in March. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shot up by 1.9% and the Shanghai Composite rose by 0.9%.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

View original post here[2]. Just one week after the tech world's most visible conservative and entrepreneur to back President Donald Trump, Peter Thiel, slammed \"treasonous\" Google [3]for agreeing to work closely withChina, trying to get its search engine back into the Chinese market, while deciding to let a US defense departmentcontract that gave the military access to its artificial intelligence tools lapse, Thiel's lament has made its way to the very top, and moments ago the WSJ reported that the DOJ was opening a broad antitrust review into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition, adding a new Washington threat for the FANGs According to WSJ sources, the review is geared toward examining the practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services; the report notes that the new antitrust inquiry is \"the strongest signal yet of Attorney General William Barr's deep interest in the tech sector, and it could ratchet up the already considerable regulatory pressures facing the top U.S. tech firms.\" To be sure, the review, which is designed to go above and beyond recent plans for scrutinizing the tech sector that were crafted by the department and the Federal Trade Commission, has certainly spooked investors and the US mega tech names have promptly tumbled after hours, dragging the Nasdaq lower. </p><p> As the Journal adds, \"the two agencies, which share antitrust enforcement authority, in recent months worked out which one of them would take the lead on exploring different issues involving the big-four tech giants. Those turf agreements caused a stir in the tech industry and rattled investors. Now, the new Justice Department review could amplify the risk, because some of those companies could face antitrust claims from both the Justice Department and the FTC.\" As we reported at the time, the FTC in February launched its own task force to monitor competition in the tech sector; that team's work is ongoing. Meanwhile, the DOJ will examine issues including how the most dominant tech firms have grown in size and might\u2014and expanded their reach into additional businesses. The Justice Department also is interested in how Big Tech has leveraged the powers that come with having very large networks of users, government sources told the WSJ. Moments after the WSJ report, the DOJ published a press release confirming, that \"the Department of Justice announced today that the Department's Antitrust Division is reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\" The Department's review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online. The Department's Antitrust Division is conferring with and seeking information from the public, including industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms, as well as others. \"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" said Assistant Attorney General Mahan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\"  There a silver lining: according to the WSJ, unlike other government task forces which are, well, \"tasked\" in advance with a specific goal, there is no defined end-goal yet for the Big Tech review other than to understand whether there are antitrust problems that need addressing, but a broad range of options are on the table, and the \"department's inquiry could eventually lead to more focused investigations of specific company conduct,\" officials said. Meanwhile, in its own press release, the DOJ said that the goal of the Department's review \"is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.\" Such as demanding break-ups. In their defense, the Big Tech companies have said they are highly innovative firms that create jobs and provide products and services that consumers love. They have said they have rightly won their places at the top of the tech pyramid and have to compete fiercely to stay there. But while the top tech firms were once the darlings of the public, attitudes have shifted as some consumers, and politicians on both the left and the right, have grown uncomfortable with how much power and influence they wield in the economy and society. As the WSJ notes, \"some Democratic presidential candidates have called for the breakup of companies like Google and Facebook, while lawmakers of both parties have sounded alarm bells, though at times for different reasons. Some Republicans have voiced concerns about whether tech companies disfavor conservative voices, claims that industry leaders have denied.\" President Trump has escalated his criticisms of Big Tech recently, openly suggesting the U.S. ought to sue Google and Facebook, comments that could hang over the Justice Department's new efforts. Aside from Justice Department and FTC scrutiny, a House antitrust subcommittee also is taking a broad look at potential anticompetitive conduct in the tech sector. Executives from Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon all testified before the panel last week. The seeds for the new Justice Department review were planted in January at Barr's confirmation hearing, when he said that he believed antitrust issues in the tech sector were important. 'I don't think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers,' Mr. Barr told senators. 'You can win that place in the marketplace without violating the antitrust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic.' Justice Department officials said they would use the new antitrust review to seek extensive input and information from industry participants, and eventually from the dominant tech firms themselves. It isn't yet known whether much of the information-gathering will be done on a voluntary basis or if companies eventually could be compelled by the government to turn over materials.

View original post here[2]. Just one week after the tech world's most visible conservative and entrepreneur to back President Donald Trump, Peter Thiel, slammed \"treasonous\" Google [3]for agreeing to work closely withChina, trying to get its search engine back into the Chinese market, while deciding to let a US defense departmentcontract that gave the military access to its artificial intelligence tools lapse, Thiel's lament has made its way to the very top, and moments ago the WSJ reported that the DOJ was opening a broad antitrust review into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition, adding a new Washington threat for the FANGs According to WSJ sources, the review is geared toward examining the practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services; the report notes that the new antitrust inquiry is \"the strongest signal yet of Attorney General William Barr's deep interest in the tech sector, and it could ratchet up the already considerable regulatory pressures facing the top U.S. tech firms.\" To be sure, the review, which is designed to go above and beyond recent plans for scrutinizing the tech sector that were crafted by the department and the Federal Trade Commission, has certainly spooked investors and the US mega tech names have promptly tumbled after hours, dragging the Nasdaq lower. </p><p> As the Journal adds, \"the two agencies, which share antitrust enforcement authority, in recent months worked out which one of them would take the lead on exploring different issues involving the big-four tech giants. Those turf agreements caused a stir in the tech industry and rattled investors. Now, the new Justice Department review could amplify the risk, because some of those companies could face antitrust claims from both the Justice Department and the FTC.\" As we reported at the time, the FTC in February launched its own task force to monitor competition in the tech sector; that team's work is ongoing. Meanwhile, the DOJ will examine issues including how the most dominant tech firms have grown in size and might\u2014and expanded their reach into additional businesses. The Justice Department also is interested in how Big Tech has leveraged the powers that come with having very large networks of users, government sources told the WSJ. Moments after the WSJ report, the DOJ published a press release confirming, that \"the Department of Justice announced today that the Department's Antitrust Division is reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\" The Department's review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online. The Department's Antitrust Division is conferring with and seeking information from the public, including industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms, as well as others. \"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" said Assistant Attorney General Mahan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\"  There a silver lining: according to the WSJ, unlike other government task forces which are, well, \"tasked\" in advance with a specific goal, there is no defined end-goal yet for the Big Tech review other than to understand whether there are antitrust problems that need addressing, but a broad range of options are on the table, and the \"department's inquiry could eventually lead to more focused investigations of specific company conduct,\" officials said. Meanwhile, in its own press release, the DOJ said that the goal of the Department's review \"is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.\" Such as demanding break-ups. In their defense, the Big Tech companies have said they are highly innovative firms that create jobs and provide products and services that consumers love. They have said they have rightly won their places at the top of the tech pyramid and have to compete fiercely to stay there. But while the top tech firms were once the darlings of the public, attitudes have shifted as some consumers, and politicians on both the left and the right, have grown uncomfortable with how much power and influence they wield in the economy and society. As the WSJ notes, \"some Democratic presidential candidates have called for the breakup of companies like Google and Facebook, while lawmakers of both parties have sounded alarm bells, though at times for different reasons. Some Republicans have voiced concerns about whether tech companies disfavor conservative voices, claims that industry leaders have denied.\" President Trump has escalated his criticisms of Big Tech recently, openly suggesting the U.S. ought to sue Google and Facebook, comments that could hang over the Justice Department's new efforts. Aside from Justice Department and FTC scrutiny, a House antitrust subcommittee also is taking a broad look at potential anticompetitive conduct in the tech sector. Executives from Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon all testified before the panel last week. The seeds for the new Justice Department review were planted in January at Barr's confirmation hearing, when he said that he believed antitrust issues in the tech sector were important. 'I don't think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers,' Mr. Barr told senators. 'You can win that place in the marketplace without violating the antitrust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic.' Justice Department officials said they would use the new antitrust review to seek extensive input and information from industry participants, and eventually from the dominant tech firms themselves. It isn't yet known whether much of the information-gathering will be done on a voluntary basis or if companies eventually could be compelled by the government to turn over materials.

With Bezos taking the Post under his wing, tech is now a big-time player in a city where it's often been viewed as a nerdy smartypants still striving to be cool.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Obviously, The Washington Post has a big voice, so it's a bold move from a business perspective, but from a tech influencer perspective, it's even bolder because you're buying one of the biggest, most important voices in Washington,\" said Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and tech consultant. \"The Chinese walls that they're going to have to build between reporters and editors and the business side will be fascinating to watch.\"</p><p>(PHOTOS: <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos's </nameText></person>life and career)</p><p>She said the move could represent a watershed moment: \"I think <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos </nameText></person>has embraced content. But also, many in the tech industry have decided that to have influence, they have to be involved in the media world.\"</p><p>And the Bezos purchase could be a good sign for a struggling newspaper. He has a track record of taking chances and playing the long game.</p><p>\"Jeff has reinvented every industry he has touched,\" said Ellen Siminoff, a founding Yahoo executive and now chief executive at the educational website Shmoop. She previously worked at the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>(Also on POLITICO: Amazon's <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos </nameText></person>known for bold, big moves)</p><p>\"The Post also gets someone who is not focused on the bottom line and where that is today. Even with his own public company, he is a long-term thinker. This is the paper that broke Watergate. It's an institution. I think Jeff will be great for it. He has never been afraid of taking really big business models and turning them on their ears.\"</p><p>Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton, said Bezos now \"owns one of the most influential political newspapers in history, and when it makes a statement, it resonates nationally.\"</p><p>\"It's important that the firewall is strong between what he does at Amazon and the Post,\" he said. \"All eyes are on this relationship.\"</p><p>(Also on POLITICO: WaPo staffers tweet concerns, praise)</p><p>Tech has played a bigger role of late in Washington, especially in its recent push for immigration reform. Groups such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's advocacy group, FWD.us, have been out front in the debate. Other pressing tech issues in Washington include cybersecurity, patent reform, corporate and online sales taxes and privacy regulation.</p><p>\"Tech has just become increasingly important,\" said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. \"If you look at the immigration debate that's going on, the tech industry has been very, very involved and influential in a way that more senators and members of Congress are paying attention.\"</p><p>Trippi also noted that technology is simply starting to penetrate all aspects of society.</p><p>\"As technology starts to be one of the really big industries in the United States, they're becoming much more influential and impactful in D.C.,\" he said. \"Buying the Post is more a sign of the arrival of technology at the top than anything else.\"</p><p>(Also on POLITICO: Washington Post sold to Bezos for $250 million)</p><p>Media buys from big investors have become more common of late. Warren Buffett has invested in many dailies, and even Bezos led an investment group that put $5 billion into Business Insider.</p><p>\"Part of that is how amazingly fast the prices have dropped,\" Trippi said. \"Newspapers are so cheap, if you have a strategy for another platform, an idea how to turn that tide, there's going to be big investments -- the brand may be worth more than they're paying for them.\"</p><p>Zelizer said one key is that Bezos \"comes from an industry where interconnectedness is how it works.\"</p><p>\"It's not simply a wealthy person,\" he added. \"It's a person who has mastered the art of putting together the different shipping and consumer purchases that people experience.\"</p><p>But if anything, tech now has everybody's attention -- especially in Washington.</p><p>\"The high-tech industry has become much more cognizant that Washington matters,\" Zelizer said. \"It started with people in garages making computers and became a huge industry, and now they're turning their eyes to Washington.\"</p><p>Eric Engleman, Michelle Quinn and Eric Nelson contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-95241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:592P-1W11-F118-9011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><timeReceived>1:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2013  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>August 6, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009SVI</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES TIMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLPN</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009VUU</classCode><className>JEFFREY P BEZOS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS124</classCode><className>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Morgan Sr. </p><p>Other huge battles between the United States and an industry range from President Kennedy's attempt to regulate prices of big steel in 1962 to the 1982 break-up of AT#38;T. Now, because of its size and influence across much of the economy, big tech has begun to take its turn as the government's primary sector that faces investigation and possible laws restricting its power. In just the past several days, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) have suffered an onslaught of questions from Congress. These investigations run a range from the role tech has in free speech to the extent to which social media were used by Russia to influence the most recent presidential election. The investigations are far from over as some legislators want social media regulated because of their hundreds of millions of members, some of whom are 'bad actors.' At the same time, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has set a meeting with several state attorneys general. Among other things, the Department of Justice wants to see if large tech 'may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.' Furthermore, Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced a bill that is aimed at the compensation of Amazon.com Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) low-level workers. The senator is worried that many of these workers rely on federal programs to make ends meet. He is angered by the fact that Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $150 billion, which matches the net worth of a larger percentage of the U.S. population.The management of large tech companies say they are being unfairly targeted because of the size and growth rates of their businesses. Because of this perception, the Washington battle against these companies could go on for years. As has been true with industries pressed by Washington in the past, the anxiety among legislators is that, for example, Amazon has ruined much of the retail sector and now rules it. The theory is that this radical change has cost the traditional industry hundreds of thousands of jobs. Also, Facebook and Twitter have taken the place of traditional media as conduits of information to most Americans. Google's search results are bent to the advantage of liberal interests, some legislators say. One thing that is beyond argument is that big tech has become America's largest business sector. Traditionally, this has cost industries dearly as regulation rises out of investigations. This trend has only begun.

If they don't deliver on their commitments, we will move to legislate and do so quickly,\" Mr Morrison said in a statement on Sunday.</p><p>\"Social media companies need to step up and recognise their responsibilities to ensure their platforms are not being weaponised by violent terrorists and extremists.</p><p>\"We're doing everything we can with new laws and tighter controls at home and with our international partners to stop social media platforms being abused.\"</p><p>The big tech platforms, particularly Facebook and Google, are already in the legislative crosshairs in Australia because of their effect on competition in the media and advertising sectors.</p><p>The competition regulator handed its final report for the Digital Platforms Inquiry to the government over the weekend, which will be publicly released once it has been assessed.</p><p>They responded to the glare of being called out at the G20 with responses that both indicated respect and agreement with the gravity of needing to better police terrorist content, while noting there was essentially nothing new in the weekend's proclamations.</p><p>The tech companies had previously pledged to address the same concerns in May when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron led a \"Christchurch Call\", an international accord to demand the better policing of terrorism content.</p><p>The main difference with this weekend's G20 statement was that US President Donald Trump signed it, having snubbed the Christchurch Call.</p><p>\"We have zero tolerance for terrorist content on our platforms. Over the last few years we have invested heavily in human review teams and smart technology that helps us quickly detect, review, and remove this type of content,\" a Google spokesman said.</p><p>\"We are committed to leading the way in developing new technologies and standards for identifying and removing terrorist content. We are working with government agencies, law enforcement and across industry, including as a founding member of the Global Internet Forum To Counter Terrorism, to keep this type of content off our platforms.\"</p><p>A spokesman for Facebook Australia, meanwhile, said it welcomed the government's announcement of the taskforce report as its implementation of the Christchurch Call.</p><p>\"Since the horrific terrorist attacks in New Zealand, we've been reviewing what more we can do to limit our services from being used to cause harm or spread hate,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>\"In May, we announced restrictions to who can use Facebook Live and met with world leaders in Paris to sign the New Zealand Government's Christchurch Call to Action.</p><p>\"We also co-developed a nine-point industry plan in partnership with Microsoft, Twitter, Google and Amazon, which outlines the concrete steps we're taking to address the abuse of technology to spread terrorist content.\"</p><p>The taskforce report on Sunday pledged technical responses, such as greater sharing of intelligence between rival platforms, introducing algorithms to steer users away from unsavoury content and clear appeals mechanisms to enable users to challenge the moderation of content deemed to flout the rules.</p><p>It also said account validation for users allowed to live-stream content would be strengthened and that all platforms should have the same level of accelerated review of content flagged as terrorist or violent as YouTube.</p><p>Less clear from the report is the eventual operation of a new \"content blocking framework\", which would see ISPs blocking content during an \"online crisis event\".</p><p>Key pointsThe Prime Minister claimed kudos for corralling leaders into signing the statement.</p><p>The communique suggested legislative action if another massacre were streamed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc760k8smvi3qykodt8j9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFW-WSD1-F0J6-J22B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Any idea who to call when your car gets towed while you were busy shopping at the mall? No? Probably most of us don't either. There should be a better way than Googling and trying out random numbers, right? Well, that's exactly the pitch of Team Siren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Siren app is an all-in-one emergency portal that wants to be there for you when you are in a crisis. From instantly calling an ambulance to finding the helpline for your district's police station, it hopes to do it all. How does it work? Download the app and sign up using details like name, phone number, city etc. You can also add another person's contacts as In Case of Emergency (ICE).</p><p>The home page shows a blinking button which if slid, will take you to a screen showing your location and nine emergency contacts. Plus, there is a directory of relevant numbers - such as Edhi ambulance, Cyber Rescue or railway enquiry among others - which you can call there and then. The app is bilingual and also shows your history of emergencies.</p><p>The app is actually a product of Hysab Kytab - a fintech that lets you manage your income and savings among other things - which in turn is owned by Jaffer Business Systems, an IT solutions and data company under the banner of Jaffer Group. It's headed by Yasir Ilyas - a US return with experience in IT advisory and business process automation in organisations like KPMG and IKEA - and Javeria Haseeb as co-founder and marketing lead. .</p><p>'I grew up in the US where 911 is the first point of reference in an emergency, but here there was no such product. We could either copy their way or build something better from scratch using the technology at our disposal,' the country head recalls.</p><p>'At the very least, we wanted to build a directory that showed you all relevant numbers you can directly call, based on your location. So the contact list available to you in Karachi would be different from the one to a user in Lahore,' he further explains.</p><p>Let's talk money now, which becomes tricky since an emergency portal should be a public service. What's the income stream? 'The product is free for everyone to use and we want to keep it that way,' says Ilyas.</p><p>Is that just the new way of doing business or am I being too conservative? 'From our end, it's still more of a corporate social responsibility project but if we take Siren beyond our borders, to other developing countries where again the same gap exists, there obviously it will be a paid service,' he adds.</p><p>Moreover, Ilyas hopes to garner some monetary (or otherwise) support from the corporate sector, where Siren could be a potential channel for other entities' investments.</p><p>The director is also looking for any sort of collaboration with government agencies but thanks to bureaucratic red tape, things have been a bit slow on that front. 'We met former interior minister Shahryar Afridi and connected with the Safe City Project and are trying to get things moving there,' says Ilyas.</p><p>'In the meantime, we also approached the commissioner of Karachi and showed him the app, who loved this idea and told us about the call centre they run (1299) for all kinds of crises. Since there was no automation at their end, he wanted to partner with us and cover that end for the city,' he adds.</p><p>'We have already done the deployment and integrations at the backend and it just has to be operationalised from their side,' says Haseeb.</p><p>The app is still quite new without much user traction, which raises the question over its utility as a public platform. 'At the moment, we are trying to sort out the operational aspects and cover the supply side by bringing in relevant authorities. Once that is covered, we will move towards customer acquisition, hopefully by first quarter of next year,' she adds.</p><p>They are also venturing into an area where it will have access to extremely sensitive data so what's their policy about that? 'We obviously have end-to-end encryption and are General Data Protection Regulation-compliant (a comprehensive set of binding standards put in place by the European Union last year to be followed by companies operating on the continent),' Ilyas explains. Furthermore, he claims that they are willing to locally store data on-premises when working with state agencies, such as 1299.</p><p>But what's more important than any financial metric or future source of revenue is whether privatisation of a public good even desirable in the first place? After all, doing so gives empowers a commercial entity to decide on the provision of a necessity.</p><p>Even otherwise, the influence big tech has gained in developed countries has troubled policymakers (maybe except for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), which they have been largely unable to address. Perhaps too early to get into that debate when we barely have a technology sector, or maybe we should be smarter from the very beginning?

Big corporate names, including <person><nameText>Apple CEO </nameText></person>Tim Cook and his counterpart at Tesla, <person><nameText>Elon Musk, </nameText></person>have lashed out at the Menlo Park, California-headquartered company, with Musk tweeting, Just don't like Facebook.

But as citizens, governments and regulators get tougher on them, the best they can hope for is that it's a temporary blip and the worst a protracted siege, with their revenue model coming under serious threat.</p><p>In India, a key market for social media and consumer tech giants, these companies will hope their existing business models can hold up to far greater regulatory scrutiny. Already Union Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has signalled the government's hardened stance on unauthorised use of Indians' private data and many of these behemoths will want to fall in line, rather than risk a bruising fight with regulators  remember Facebook's futile campaign against net neutrality in 2015-16.</p><p>Sceptics, however, point out that Indian consumers, millions of whom are first-time internet users and social media novices may be easily gulled into parting with their data. Demanding greater caution from them may be difficult, and until now, social media companies, led by Facebook, have shied away from more probity around their affairs.</p><p>Questions sent by ET Magazine to Facebook, Google and Microsoftwent unanswered.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson told ET Magazine: Customer trust is one of our top priorities. We never sell</p><p>our customers' personal information. We only share our customers' personal information as described in our privacy policy.</p><p>Commercial Surveillance Network</p><p>On May 24, new regulations from the EU may pose the most serious challenge yet to the dominance of internet companies. It's not social media but really all of digital media, says Jeffery Chester, executive director, Center for Digital Democracy, a non-governmental outfit in Washington, DC, which has battled tech companies over how they use and manage consumer data.</p><p>The new EU data protection law creates an unprecedented opportunity to restore the balance between the giants that are gathering data, like Google and Facebook, and the individual. He believes companies will increasingly be held accountable and forced to change how they do data-driven digital marketing. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal is emblematic of what goes on all over the world when people go online. They become part of a seamless commercial surveillance network. Facebookhas said it was doing away with a product that enabled data providers help advertisers target Facebookusers.</p><p>Other critics of Facebookand tech companies' intrusive collection of personal information are quick to latch onto these worsening problems for the industry. This (harvesting of user data) is not a necessary evil and is not acceptable. Facebookhas gone too far in capturing our data and marketing these data to unscrupulous players. Facebookhas weaponised social media, says Vivek Wadhwa, distinguished fellow, Carnegie Mellon University Engineering. It has been the Wild Wild West, with no rules and regulations. It is time to fix this. They need to be urgently regulated. They are damaging the fabric of society.</p><p>Alessandro Acquisti, professor of information technology and public policy at the Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, thinks this kind of intrusiveness is starting to have an adverse effect on consumers and to the detriment of social media and technology giants. There seems to be, at least in the US, at the moment, a change in the collective stance over privacy, he says. The recent scandals seem to have provided a definite answer to the question: does privacy matter?</p><p>It may, however, be too early to judge if the current stance towards privacy will be lasting or fleeting  whether our privacy behaviours will change, or whether we will be back to droning on about the latest app.</p><p>While there is a growing clamour over the direction internet companies are headed in, few people see a viable, alternative business model emerging. If you are not interested in an advertising-supported social network or search engine, the most obvious alternative is paying a one-time or periodic fee to have an ad-free experience. The implication is that since you are paying, the company does not have to share your data with advertisers.</p><p>Vidya Narayanan, research director for Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project, believes that after a buccaneering ride for the past decade, these companies may need to take a more introspective route now. Led by Facebook's reassessing its privacy policies and procedures, these behemoths may be in for a long slog. Facebookhas vowed to make privacy settings easier to access. There's also a need to raise awareness among people about the ways in which data can be accessed by third-party apps using FacebookAPIs and how the data collected by the tech biggies is being shared with advertisers and campaign managers who use that for micro-targeting, she says. (API or application program interface is the software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.) As these companies evolve, stricter regulation is inevitable. These companies need to be regulated(they) have evolved from being simply search engines or platforms for social interaction, to becoming arbiters of our world view, adds Narayanan. If EU's data protection law is a step in that direction  the US and India are, among others, mulling tougher legislation  consumers could benefit in several ways.</p><p>These include not getting manipulated, gaining some understanding of how individual news feed is determined and how search results are sorted and recommendations generated. Users then need not view the world through a prism that's designed by big tech companies based solely on user preferences. Regulators could also prevent hate speech and misinformation campaigns influencing elections.</p><p>While this may be one way to look at things, some new social media ventures like Vero are toying with alternative business models like subscription. However, subscription-based social media platforms have not worked or remain very niche. Vero is also trying out another way to monetise its user network, by letting merchants sell their wares to users and charging them a transaction fee. But this means users could be shown products based on their posts.</p><p>Vero has been around since 2015 but saw its iOS user base quadruple to 2,00,000 after the Facebookscandal. (Vero is also available on Android). Vero is not charging its first million users  it had yet to decide a fee for the rest. The company is led by billionaire Ayman Hariri, son of slain former Lebanese PM Rafic Hariri. Minds, a privacy-focused open-source and crowdfunded social networking service, is not very popular. There are bound to be more attempts to create more responsible competitors to Facebook a few days back, industrialist Anand Mahindra tweeted that he would financially back Indian startups in the social media space, if there were any.</p><p>Some industry watchers, however, think these initiatives may be half-baked. Balaji Venkateshwar, a cybersecurity expert, says subscription is not a viable business model for social media and messaging platforms. He refers to WhatsApp's decision to withdraw its token $1 a year subscription fee in 2016, citing difficulty in making online payments in many countries. (WhatsApp is owned by Facebook.) These companies can't scale up with subscription, and users will have to realise there is no free lunch. They get to use social media for free because their data is being sold to advertisers, he says. More important than subscription is localisation of data. For instance, Indians' data should be stored in India. Otherwise, the Indian government cannot do much in case of a breach.</p><p>Social media maven Karthik Srinivasan believes these giants are too big to fail, even if they are compelled to tweak their tech backbone and privacy policies to better protect their users. He says the current angst is isolated and if there were to be a serious wave of disenchantment, large number of users would log out. (Platforms like) Facebookand Google are too big to fail, and people have gotten thoroughly used to their networks and conveniences on these platforms, he adds. So, forgetting them will not be easy like what happened to Myspace or Orkut, which had lost their utility value long before they shut shop.</p><p>Social media, then, may be here to stay, even if an agreeable business model is a work in progress. Social media has become an essential part of our lives and in its best form enables public engagement with socio-political causes and supports freedom of speech, says Narayanan of Oxford University. As many Indians</p><p>come online for the first time, social media can be a powerful force for empowerment and freedom from traditional hierarchies.</p><p>Nailing down this business model may be harder than it appears. Just paying to access a website or an app does not necessarily mean the company is not going to use your data. Take, for instance, video-streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hotstar. They charge a subscription fee to allow access to their whole library, but they accumulate data on what you watch, based on which they recommend films and series.</p><p>It is accentuated in the case of a platform like Google-owned YouTube, which has a wildly popular free version with ads before and in the middle of videos, but also has an ad-free subscription option. YouTube has millions of usergenerated videos and if you have searched for clips skewed towards a particular ideology, chances are you will be shown a lot of similar videos.</p><p>In several cases, not revealing details like your ISP address and location  by not logging in or by using a virtual private network  means you are giving up on convenience. For instance, you may not be able to auto-complete web addresses and searches.</p><p>Narayanan says the business models of most of these companies may be rooted in access to public information and their long-term success may be dependent on educating consumers about protecting their privacy and ensuring that they read the fine print in all data consent forms. Meanwhile the onus is on policymakers and researchers to apply suitable pressure on big tech companies to follow an ethical data gathering, harvesting and sharing policy, she adds. There's also an urgent need for these companies to be transparent about the external companies and political parties that they might be sharing their data with.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_21_01042018004001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0S-GDG1-DXJR-H2FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1904\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Big technology companies, long investor favourites, suffered heavy losses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deepening worries over newly protectionist U.S. trade policies combined with blowback toward technology companies, including Facebook Inc.'s ever-widening privacy scandal, have prompted investors to pull money out of the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That has meant steep declines for former big winners including Netflix Inc., Microsoft Corp.and Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company.</p><p>Among other recent winners, Intel Corp.dove 6.1 per cent following a report in Bloomberg News that Apple Inc.plans to start using its own chips in Mac computers, and Amazon.com Inc.sank 5.2 per cent following more Twitter broadsides from U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 758 points, although major indexes regained some of their losses later in the afternoon. The Dow lost 458.92 points, or 1.9 per cent, to 23,644.19. The S&amp;;P 500 index gave up 58.99 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 2,581.88.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite slumped 193.33 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 6,870.12. Toronto's main stock index joined U.S. markets in a downward swing Monday. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&amp;;P/TSX composite closed down 153.84 points at 15,213.45, led by declines in energy and health care.</p><p>Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the step by China is small but significant.</p><p>\"The fact that a country has actually raised tariffs in retaliation is an important step in the wrong direction,\" she said. \"The tariffs imposed by China today lead to greater worries that we will see escalating tariffs and the possibility of a much bigger impact than investors were anticipating last week. And that could be true for Mexico as well as for China.\"</p><p>Food maker Tyson Foods Inc. dropped 6.2 per cent after China raised import duties on a US$3 billion list of U.S. goods in response to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that Trump ordered last month.</p><p>Amazon fell another 5.2 per cent. The online retailer has slumped with the market recently, although it's still up about 17 per cent in 2018. Trump has repeatedly criticized Amazon over issues including taxes and Amazon's shipping deals with the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors, said Amazon is just the latest company to falter after it drew scrutiny from the government, as Facebookand Alphabet have slumped recently on data privacy concerns.</p><p>\"It seems like the long arm of the government is interfering with investors'expectations,\" he said. \"Investors are pricing in an escalating trade war and regulation of tech companies.\"</p><p>Microsoft dropped 3.0 per cent and Alphabet, Google's parent company, shed 2.4 per cent.</p><p>After a month of public negotiations between the U.S. and several other countries, Monday marked the first time another country has placed tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the Trump administration's recent trade sanctions.</p><p>The price of gold climbed 1.2 per cent to US$1,343.60 an ounce and silver jumped 2.0 per cent to US$16.60 an ounce as some investors took money out of stocks and looked for safer investments.</p><p>Health insurer Humana was one of the market's few winners following more reports Walmart could buy the company or create a new partnership with it. Humana is a major provider of Medicare Advantage coverage for people 65 and older. Humana gained 4.4 per cent while Walmart slid 3.8 per cent.</p><p>Bond prices finished little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury stayed at 2.74 per cent after a sharp decline last week.</p><p>Energy companies skidded as benchmark U.S. crude lost US$1.93, or three per cent, to US$63.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid US$1.70, or 2.5 per cent, to US$67.64 a barrel in London.</p><p>Wholesale gasoline dropped five cents to US$1.97 a gallon. Heating oil fell four cents to US$1.98 a gallon. Natural gas slid five cents to US$2.68 per 1,000 cubic feet. Copper rose two per cent to US$3.05 a pound.</p><p>The dollar declined to 105.85 yen from 106.50 yen. The euro edged up to US$1.23 from US$1.2306.</p><p>Trading in France, Germany and Britain was closed for Easter.

Big technology companies, long investor favourites, suffered heavy losses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deepening worries over newly protectionist U.S. trade policies combined with blowback toward technology companies, including Facebook Inc.'s ever-widening privacy scandal, have prompted investors to pull money out of the market.</p><p>That has meant steep declines for former big winners including Netflix Inc., Microsoft Corp.and Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company.</p><p>Among other recent winners, Intel Corp.dove 6.1 per cent following a report in Bloomberg News that Apple Inc.plans to start using its own chips in Mac computers, and Amazon.com Inc.sank 5.2 per cent following more Twitter broadsides from U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 758 points, although major indexes regained some of their losses later in the afternoon. The Dow lost 458.92 points, or 1.9 per cent, to 23,644.19. The S&amp;;P 500 index gave up 58.99 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 2,581.88.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite slumped 193.33 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 6,870.12. Toronto's main stock index joined U.S. markets in a downward swing Monday. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&amp;;P/TSX composite closed down 153.84 points at 15,213.45, led by declines in energy and health care.</p><p>Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the step by China is small but significant.</p><p>\"The fact that a country has actually raised tariffs in retaliation is an important step in the wrong direction,\" she said. \"The tariffs imposed by China today lead to greater worries that we will see escalating tariffs and the possibility of a much bigger impact than investors were anticipating last week. And that could be true for Mexico as well as for China.\"</p><p>Food maker Tyson Foods Inc. dropped 6.2 per cent after China raised import duties on a US$3 billion list of U.S. goods in response to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that Trump ordered last month.</p><p>Amazon fell another 5.2 per cent. The online retailer has slumped with the market recently, although it's still up about 17 per cent in 2018. Trump has repeatedly criticized Amazon over issues including taxes and Amazon's shipping deals with the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors, said Amazon is just the latest company to falter after it drew scrutiny from the government, as Facebookand Alphabet have slumped recently on data privacy concerns.</p><p>\"It seems like the long arm of the government is interfering with investors'expectations,\" he said. \"Investors are pricing in an escalating trade war and regulation of tech companies.\"</p><p>Microsoft dropped 3.0 per cent and Alphabet, Google's parent company, shed 2.4 per cent.</p><p>After a month of public negotiations between the U.S. and several other countries, Monday marked the first time another country has placed tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the Trump administration's recent trade sanctions.</p><p>The price of gold climbed 1.2 per cent to US$1,343.60 an ounce and silver jumped 2.0 per cent to US$16.60 an ounce as some investors took money out of stocks and looked for safer investments.</p><p>Health insurer Humana was one of the market's few winners following more reports Walmart could buy the company or create a new partnership with it. Humana is a major provider of Medicare Advantage coverage for people 65 and older. Humana gained 4.4 per cent while Walmart slid 3.8 per cent.</p><p>Bond prices finished little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury stayed at 2.74 per cent after a sharp decline last week.</p><p>Energy companies skidded as benchmark U.S. crude lost US$1.93, or three per cent, to US$63.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid US$1.70, or 2.5 per cent, to US$67.64 a barrel in London.</p><p>Wholesale gasoline dropped five cents to US$1.97 a gallon. Heating oil fell four cents to US$1.98 a gallon. Natural gas slid five cents to US$2.68 per 1,000 cubic feet. Copper rose two per cent to US$3.05 a pound.</p><p>The dollar declined to 105.85 yen from 106.50 yen. The euro edged up to US$1.23 from US$1.2306.</p><p>Trading in France, Germany and Britain was closed for Easter. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.3 per cent and South Korea's Kospi fell almost 0.1 per cent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was closed as well. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The petition has no legal basis, the agency doesn't have jurisdiction, and President Donald Trump is attempting to use the commission for political gain, they said. AT&amp;T called for uniform liability protections.</p><p>If the FCC rewrites Section 230, it would exceed the agency's \"proper role\" and have \"disastrous consequences\" for the internet, CTA commented: Reject the petition to protect the agency's independence and the First Amendment. If the FCC weakens Section 230, the \"biggest winner would be China, which is spending billions in an all-out campaign to catch and surpass U.S. tech leaders,\" said Senior Vice President-Government and Regulatory Affairs Michael Petricone.</p><p>Trump is unlawfully attempting to direct the FCC to assert jurisdiction over and rewrite 230, Public Knowledge commented. The portion is of bipartisan concern, but NTIA's petition \"has no legal basis and its policy recommendations are unsound.\" So \"resist this call\" to expand jurisdiction into \"regulating the content moderation and editorial choices\" of platforms and recognize that NTIA's arguments are \"no better than the petition's specious and trivial mischaracterizations of the statute itself,\" said Legal Director John Bergmayer.</p><p>Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order in an effort to use the FCC as a \"partisan weapon,\" the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology commented. The agency has no authority to clarify 230, and the law's text doesn't require agency implementation, it said: Nothing in the CDA allows the FCC to \"reimagine\" the meaning of the statute.</p><p>The proposed rules are \"inconsistent with the text and intent of Section 230\" and the First Amendment, the Internet Association commented. The petition would \"throw out two decades of settled\" Section 230 case law that empowers removal of content like \"fraud, manipulated media, and promotion of suicide without facing a flood of litigation,\" said IA Deputy General Counsel Elizabeth Banker (see 2009010041).</p><p>Immunity should be amended to reduce \"gross disparities in legal treatment between\" online platforms and \"similarly situated companies in the traditional economy,\" AT&amp;T commented: Platforms \"routinely amplify\" certain content, often for \"financially driven reasons that have nothing to do with the original content-filtering goal of section 230.\" Legislators should adopt uniform liability rules, the ISP said.</p><p>Congress didn't intend for 230 to allow FCC regulation of the internet, NetChoice commented with former Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif. NTIA's proposed reinterpretations would violate the \"plain language of the statute,\" and it's questionable that the desired jurisdiction would hold up in court, NetChoice said.</p><p>The petition is an opportunity to \"shed transparency on how Big Tech companies operate,\" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. \"The public's comments can also help build a record to guide Congress in future reform.\"</p><p>NTIA's draft regulation language seeks \"content-based regulation that poses grave threats to First Amendment protections,\" New America's Open Technology Institute and Ranking Digital Rights commented. The FCC has never had the role of implementing the section, and it would be wrong to read that into the statute now, OTI said: \"By disincentivizing social media platforms from removing harmful content that threatens or negatively impacts marginalized communities, NTIA's proposal would chill the speech of those who are members of a protected class.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T0-MVV1-DYRJ-0002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 03, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The new measures aim to compel tech firms to pay more taxes and take more responsibility for illegal content on their platforms.</p><p>The renewed focus on holding tech accountable for material on their sites builds upon the EU's recently proposed Terrorist Content Regulation, which generated significant opposition from tech companies. As the Counter Extremism Project (CEP) has previously noted, the measure would allow EU member states to impose fines on tech firms of up to four percent of their revenue for failure to consistently remove extremist content from their platforms. It would also require a takedown of said extremist content within one hour of receiving notice from public authorities--a reasonable standard, given that the longer terrorist propaganda and recruiting materials remain online, the more its viewership will increase and the higher the likelihood that it will be viewed, copied, and uploaded elsewhere.</p><p>\"The EU's proposed regulations and continued focus on extremist content online are a welcomed tough line on big tech, that will contribute to the establishment of responsible content moderation policies worldwide,\" said CEP Executive Director David Ibsen. \"The EU's efforts together with the U.S. Justice Department's proposal to roll back tech companies' broad legal protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) illustrate a growing international consensus to reform outdated and ineffective policies concerning the tech industry. These developments are clearly a result of increasing frustration with tech's ongoing failure to keep extremist and terrorist content off their platforms.\"</p><p>The proposals are the latest in a movement by policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic to rein in the power and influence of big tech companies by rolling back legal protections that have long shielded them from liability. In June, the U.S. Department of Justice outlined recommendations to modify Section 230 of the CDA to remove blanket immunity for harmful content posted by third parties, including terrorist content that appears on online platforms. As CEP previously addressed, reform to Section 230 would be a necessary step to updating the legal framework of an aged and ineffective policy that shields big tech from liability for content that proliferates on its sites.</p><p>[Category: International]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7172121 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7172121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B7-KNS1-JC11-14H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"450\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 11, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It felt like every week, Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and friends were apologizing for some major privacy blunder or platform manipulation. Self-driving cars proved they weren't ready to hit the road and <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>nearly self-destructed on Twitter. Electric scooters swarmed cities only to be vandalized in droves. Tech-stock peaks gave way to market tumbles.The coming year brings the cleanup and a return to the optimism that technology is really good for the world. </p><p>By that of course we mean finally playing the much hyped, much delayed Harry Potter augmented-reality game. Also eagerly awaited: 5G arriving in cities, Apple's iOS getting a facelift and Disney launching its own streaming service. We're predicting a year of fulfilled promises-including a possibly forced change in companies' data-collection practices.Here's our annual roundup of the tech that will affect us in the year ahead. Our track record is pretty good, so you'll want to pay attention.Apple tiptoed ahead in 2018 with a more \"affordable\" iPhone, an oversize one and some under-the-hood iOS improvements. In 2019, we're expecting Apple to take a more daring leap. (In fact, stockholder enthusiasm may depend on it.)In all 12 generations of iOS, the homescreen has remained a simple grid of app icons. The next version could change that. With iOS 12, Apple reportedly put a dramatic makeover on hold to address the performance and quality issues of iOS 11. This is also the year that Apple will begin allowing developers to bring iOS apps to MacOS.After years of hype (\"Download a feature film in seconds!\"), 5G is finally making its U.S. debut. The service providers-AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint-all plan to have mobile 5G live in select cities by the first half of 2019. (In December, AT&amp;amp;T flipped the switch in a few cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.) Phonemakers Samsung and LG have promised new 5G-compatible handsets this year as well. Apple, however, will likely hold off another year or so.The new networking standard isn't just about faster phones, though. Reduced lag between devices and cell towers will enable better augmented and virtual reality, smart-home experiences and even self-driving cars. But just like the rollout of past network technologies, you may not want to buy 5G gear just yet-it will take time for the kinks to be worked out.It became abundantly clear in 2018 that Facebook has spent the past decade downing our data and getting drunk on power. In 2019, it shall suffer the hangover. Beyond the continuing backlash against Facebook-a sinking stock price and declining use of its services-we'll see more legal battles and legislation. The attorney general of the District of Columbia just filed a lawsuit against the company for its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission has opened a probe into the incident as well as other suspected privacy issues. Even more likely? Bigger suits out of the European Union and its strict General Data Protection Regulation, like this potential $1.63 billion fine.Google won't be immune, either. It faces continued scrutiny from lawmakers around its access to user emails and its privacy lapses. In the wake of the recent high-profile congressional hearings, it's hardly a stretch to anticipate U.S. privacy legislation in the year ahead.The first time you're in an Amazon Go store feels strange. You scan an app as you walk through the turnstile, then grab whatever you want and just ... leave. No cashiers, no human interaction, nothing but an emailed receipt itemizing exactly what's in your bag.This type of super-convenience store will likely turn up near you soon, either from Amazon or a competitor powered by tech from the likes of Zippin or Standard Cognition. The future of retail involves fewer cashiers-and more cameras tracking your every move. And here's a side perk/annoyance: ads featuring items you picked up then put back on the shelf. Are you sure you don't want that bottle of Bain de Soleil?Thought Pok\u00e9mon Go was big? Wait until Niantic, the company behind the augmented-reality gaming phenomenon, releases its next project, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. After more than a year of tech development, and with a huge and thrilling magical world to play inside, it's likely to be unmissable. Seriously, when people can no longer separate the real world from the J.K. Rowling's imaginary one, it could get nuts.In 2019, we'll see lots of other AR experiences that help turn the nifty tech-which can layer digital objects and experiences over the real world-into something you use every day. You'll come out of the subway, point your camera at the street and let Google Maps' digital arrow tell you which way to go. In the business world, AR will be used for training, simulation and more. It likely won't be the year you get a set of AR glasses, but companies like North and Vuzix could make 2019 the first time you see someone else wearing them.While there will be excitement in 2019 around the IPOs of Uber and Lyft, neither will be overselling its future self-driving taxi services. Nor will you be likely to receive your first drone-delivered pizza. But you could start seeing more autonomy in the wild, in the form of small delivery bots. Think coolers on wheels, but with a mind of their own.As demonstrated by Starship and Nuro-with dozens more expected to debut at the CES 2019 tech show in Las Vegas in early January-the advantage of these machines is that they can take their sweet time getting from point A to point B. They'll pose little threat of physical danger, though you might have to dodge them on the sidewalks.The cable bundle will face its stiffest competition when 2019 brings more reasons than ever to cut the cord. Look for Netflix to make noise in the movie biz and for more channels and companies to launch their own apps.One of the biggest stories will be Disney's streaming service, Disney+, which will offer everything from Marvel to Star Wars to Pixar in a single service. Disney's already pulling that content from other services in preparation. Plus, what will happen to Hulu, which will be majority owned by the Mouse House?Meanwhile, AT&amp;amp;T's forthcoming service will try to compete by potentially combining HBO, Harry Potter and the DC superhero franchise, not to mention the library of Warner Bros. TV series. Apple's long-awaited streaming service will launch as well, and promises to have content far more compelling than Carpool Karaoke-just nothing too risque. Good thing you're canceling cable, because you'll need a lot of money to get everything you'll want to watch next year.Every time you ask Siri, Alexa or Google something, your voice is recorded and sent into the cloud-aka computers owned by big tech companies-before you hear a response. AI's reliance on that connection is problematic for everything from your battery life to your privacy.Soon, Intel and other mobile-chip designers will unveil processors specifically designed to do more locally. These chips enable what's called \"edge computing.\" More AI and machine-learning processes can happen on the device itself (that is, at the \"edge\" of the network). In time, you'd be able to do more without surrendering your privacy. You could get health alerts from your watch or use Siri on your phone when you're in airplane mode.It's more than just the most popular videogame in the world (though it's definitely that). Fortnite spent 2018 cementing Twitch as a streaming giant, making bonafide celebrities and e-sports athletes out of its best players, and earning its creator Epic Games a $15 billion valuation. It even made \"Fortnite coach\" a real job.Fortnite's success came in part because the game lets players compete-and communicate-across many platforms, and because Epic skipped some app stores and walled gardens in favor of its own approach. (And yes, it was free.)In 2019, the Fortnite Effect will be felt across the gaming industry, and beyond, as developers grapple with the concept of video-game-as-social-network-with implications good and bad. Look for studios to try giving their games the ever-changing, massively multiplayer spin that makes Fortnite so enticing.Whether or not you wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker, there's a good chance of your health and fitness data being touched by big tech companies in 2019. In the past few months, Amazon has started selling software that mines patient medical records for doctor information, ostensibly to help cut costs. The retail giant also bought an online pharmacy.Apple is in talks with the Department of Veterans Affairs about software to allow veterans to transfer their health records to iPhones. The Apple Watch's new electrocardiogram features allow you to easily share heart health information with your doctor. On top of that, insurance companies, like John Hancock, have begun to encourage policy holders to share their fitness tracking data, and more workplace wellness programs, such as Richard Branson's Virgin Pulse, provide rewards in exchange for tracking.1) Phones are too big for normal humans to hold and use. 2) Phones would probably be better if they were bigger. Yes, for years these two truisms have been in conflict. In 2019, we might get the best of both.Samsung is one of several companies that have revealed plans to build a foldable phone, with a phone-sized device opening into a tablet-sized screen. There's a lot of tech left to work out, as flexible displays aren't yet easy to build and the devices we've seen are large and awkward.In 2019, these devices will likely be expensive niche products for people wanting to live out their sci-fi dreams, but if foldable phones take off, it would be the biggest thing-literally and figuratively-to happen to smartphones in years. Plus, these flexible displays could eventually show up in your home or your car. Who wouldn't want a foldaway big-screen TV?

It felt like every week, Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and friends were apologizing for some major privacy blunder or platform manipulation. Self-driving cars proved they weren't ready to hit the road and <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>nearly self-destructed on Twitter. Electric scooters swarmed cities only to be vandalized in droves. </p><p>Tech-stock peaks gave way to market tumbles.The coming year brings the cleanup and a return to the optimism that technology is really good for the world. By that of course we mean finally playing the much hyped, much delayed Harry Potter augmented-reality game. Also eagerly awaited: 5G arriving in cities, Apple's iOS getting a facelift and Disney launching its own streaming service. We're predicting a year of fulfilled promises-including a possibly forced change in companies' data-collection practices.Here's our annual roundup of the tech that will affect us in the year ahead. Our track record is pretty good, so you'll want to pay attention.Apple tiptoed ahead in 2018 with a more \"affordable\" iPhone, an oversize one and some under-the-hood iOS improvements. In 2019, we're expecting Apple to take a more daring leap. (In fact, stockholder enthusiasm may depend on it.)In all 12 generations of iOS, the homescreen has remained a simple grid of app icons. The next version could change that. With iOS 12, Apple reportedly put a dramatic makeover on hold to address the performance and quality issues of iOS 11. This is also the year that Apple will begin allowing developers to bring iOS apps to MacOS.After years of hype (\"Download a feature film in seconds!\"), 5G is finally making its U.S. debut. The service providers-AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint-all plan to have mobile 5G live in select cities by the first half of 2019. (In December, AT&amp;amp;T flipped the switch in a few cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.) Phonemakers Samsung and LG have promised new 5G-compatible handsets this year as well. Apple, however, will likely hold off another year or so.The new networking standard isn't just about faster phones, though. Reduced lag between devices and cell towers will enable better augmented and virtual reality, smart-home experiences and even self-driving cars. But just like the rollout of past network technologies, you may not want to buy 5G gear just yet-it will take time for the kinks to be worked out.It became abundantly clear in 2018 that Facebook has spent the past decade downing our data and getting drunk on power. In 2019, it shall suffer the hangover. Beyond the continuing backlash against Facebook-a sinking stock price and declining use of its services-we'll see more legal battles and legislation. The attorney general of the District of Columbia just filed a lawsuit against the company for its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission has opened a probe into the incident as well as other suspected privacy issues. Even more likely? Bigger suits out of the European Union and its strict General Data Protection Regulation, like this potential $1.63 billion fine.Google won't be immune, either. It faces continued scrutiny from lawmakers around its access to user emails and its privacy lapses. In the wake of the recent high-profile congressional hearings, it's hardly a stretch to anticipate U.S. privacy legislation in the year ahead.The first time you're in an Amazon Go store feels strange. You scan an app as you walk through the turnstile, then grab whatever you want and just ... leave. No cashiers, no human interaction, nothing but an emailed receipt itemizing exactly what's in your bag.This type of super-convenience store will likely turn up near you soon, either from Amazon or a competitor powered by tech from the likes of Zippin or Standard Cognition. The future of retail involves fewer cashiers-and more cameras tracking your every move. And here's a side perk/annoyance: ads featuring items you picked up then put back on the shelf. Are you sure you don't want that bottle of Bain de Soleil?Thought Pok\u00e9mon Go was big? Wait until Niantic, the company behind the augmented-reality gaming phenomenon, releases its next project, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. After more than a year of tech development, and with a huge and thrilling magical world to play inside, it's likely to be unmissable. Seriously, when people can no longer separate the real world from the J.K. Rowling's imaginary one, it could get nuts.In 2019, we'll see lots of other AR experiences that help turn the nifty tech-which can layer digital objects and experiences over the real world-into something you use every day. You'll come out of the subway, point your camera at the street and let Google Maps' digital arrow tell you which way to go. In the business world, AR will be used for training, simulation and more. It likely won't be the year you get a set of AR glasses, but companies like North and Vuzix could make 2019 the first time you see someone else wearing them.While there will be excitement in 2019 around the IPOs of Uber and Lyft, neither will be overselling its future self-driving taxi services. Nor will you be likely to receive your first drone-delivered pizza. But you could start seeing more autonomy in the wild, in the form of small delivery bots. Think coolers on wheels, but with a mind of their own.As demonstrated by Starship and Nuro-with dozens more expected to debut at the CES 2019 tech show in Las Vegas in early January-the advantage of these machines is that they can take their sweet time getting from point A to point B. They'll pose little threat of physical danger, though you might have to dodge them on the sidewalks.The cable bundle will face its stiffest competition when 2019 brings more reasons than ever to cut the cord. Look for Netflix to make noise in the movie biz and for more channels and companies to launch their own apps.One of the biggest stories will be Disney's streaming service, Disney+, which will offer everything from Marvel to Star Wars to Pixar in a single service. Disney's already pulling that content from other services in preparation. Plus, what will happen to Hulu, which will be majority owned by the Mouse House?Meanwhile, AT&amp;amp;T's forthcoming service will try to compete by potentially combining HBO, Harry Potter and the DC superhero franchise, not to mention the library of Warner Bros. TV series. Apple's long-awaited streaming service will launch as well, and promises to have content far more compelling than Carpool Karaoke-just nothing too risque. Good thing you're canceling cable, because you'll need a lot of money to get everything you'll want to watch next year.Every time you ask Siri, Alexa or Google something, your voice is recorded and sent into the cloud-aka computers owned by big tech companies-before you hear a response. AI's reliance on that connection is problematic for everything from your battery life to your privacy.Soon, Intel and other mobile-chip designers will unveil processors specifically designed to do more locally. These chips enable what's called \"edge computing.\" More AI and machine-learning processes can happen on the device itself (that is, at the \"edge\" of the network). In time, you'd be able to do more without surrendering your privacy. You could get health alerts from your watch or use Siri on your phone when you're in airplane mode.It's more than just the most popular videogame in the world (though it's definitely that). Fortnite spent 2018 cementing Twitch as a streaming giant, making bonafide celebrities and e-sports athletes out of its best players, and earning its creator Epic Games a $15 billion valuation. It even made \"Fortnite coach\" a real job.Fortnite's success came in part because the game lets players compete-and communicate-across many platforms, and because Epic skipped some app stores and walled gardens in favor of its own approach. (And yes, it was free.)In 2019, the Fortnite Effect will be felt across the gaming industry, and beyond, as developers grapple with the concept of video-game-as-social-network-with implications good and bad. Look for studios to try giving their games the ever-changing, massively multiplayer spin that makes Fortnite so enticing.Whether or not you wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker, there's a good chance of your health and fitness data being touched by big tech companies in 2019. In the past few months, Amazon has started selling software that mines patient medical records for doctor information, ostensibly to help cut costs. The retail giant also bought an online pharmacy.Apple is in talks with the Department of Veterans Affairs about software to allow veterans to transfer their health records to iPhones. The Apple Watch's new electrocardiogram features allow you to easily share heart health information with your doctor. On top of that, insurance companies, like John Hancock, have begun to encourage policy holders to share their fitness tracking data, and more workplace wellness programs, such as Richard Branson's Virgin Pulse, provide rewards in exchange for tracking.1) Phones are too big for normal humans to hold and use. 2) Phones would probably be better if they were bigger. Yes, for years these two truisms have been in conflict. In 2019, we might get the best of both.Samsung is one of several companies that have revealed plans to build a foldable phone, with a phone-sized device opening into a tablet-sized screen. There's a lot of tech left to work out, as flexible displays aren't yet easy to build and the devices we've seen are large and awkward.In 2019, these devices will likely be expensive niche products for people wanting to live out their sci-fi dreams, but if foldable phones take off, it would be the biggest thing-literally and figuratively-to happen to smartphones in years. Plus, these flexible displays could eventually show up in your home or your car. Who wouldn't want a foldaway big-screen TV?

It felt like every week, Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and friends were apologizing for some major privacy blunder or platform manipulation. Self-driving cars proved they weren't ready to hit the road and <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>nearly self-destructed on Twitter. Electric scooters swarmed cities only to be vandalized in droves. </p><p>Tech-stock peaks gave way to market tumbles.The coming year brings the cleanup and a return to the optimism that technology is really good for the world. By that of course we mean finally playing the much hyped, much delayed Harry Potter augmented-reality game. Also eagerly awaited: 5G arriving in cities, Apple's iOS getting a facelift and Disney launching its own streaming service. We're predicting a year of fulfilled promises-including a possibly forced change in companies' data-collection practices.Here's our annual roundup of the tech that will affect us in the year ahead. Our track record is pretty good, so you'll want to pay attention.Apple tiptoed ahead in 2018 with a more \"affordable\" iPhone, an oversize one and some under-the-hood iOS improvements. In 2019, we're expecting Apple to take a more daring leap. (In fact, stockholder enthusiasm may depend on it.)In all 12 generations of iOS, the homescreen has remained a simple grid of app icons. The next version could change that. With iOS 12, Apple reportedly put a dramatic makeover on hold to address the performance and quality issues of iOS 11. This is also the year that Apple will begin allowing developers to bring iOS apps to MacOS.After years of hype (\"Download a feature film in seconds!\"), 5G is finally making its U.S. debut. The service providers-AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint-all plan to have mobile 5G live in select cities by the first half of 2019. (In December, AT&amp;amp;T flipped the switch in a few cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.) Phonemakers Samsung and LG have promised new 5G-compatible handsets this year as well. Apple, however, will likely hold off another year or so.The new networking standard isn't just about faster phones, though. Reduced lag between devices and cell towers will enable better augmented and virtual reality, smart-home experiences and even self-driving cars. But just like the rollout of past network technologies, you may not want to buy 5G gear just yet-it will take time for the kinks to be worked out.It became abundantly clear in 2018 that Facebook has spent the past decade downing our data and getting drunk on power. In 2019, it shall suffer the hangover. Beyond the continuing backlash against Facebook-a sinking stock price and declining use of its services-we'll see more legal battles and legislation. The attorney general of the District of Columbia just filed a lawsuit against the company for its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission has opened a probe into the incident as well as other suspected privacy issues. Even more likely? Bigger suits out of the European Union and its strict General Data Protection Regulation, like this potential $1.63 billion fine.Google won't be immune, either. It faces continued scrutiny from lawmakers around its access to user emails and its privacy lapses. In the wake of the recent high-profile congressional hearings, it's hardly a stretch to anticipate U.S. privacy legislation in the year ahead.The first time you're in an Amazon Go store feels strange. You scan an app as you walk through the turnstile, then grab whatever you want and just ... leave. No cashiers, no human interaction, nothing but an emailed receipt itemizing exactly what's in your bag.This type of super-convenience store will likely turn up near you soon, either from Amazon or a competitor powered by tech from the likes of Zippin or Standard Cognition. The future of retail involves fewer cashiers-and more cameras tracking your every move. And here's a side perk/annoyance: ads featuring items you picked up then put back on the shelf. Are you sure you don't want that bottle of Bain de Soleil?Thought Pok\u00e9mon Go was big? Wait until Niantic, the company behind the augmented-reality gaming phenomenon, releases its next project, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. After more than a year of tech development, and with a huge and thrilling magical world to play inside, it's likely to be unmissable. Seriously, when people can no longer separate the real world from the J.K. Rowling's imaginary one, it could get nuts.In 2019, we'll see lots of other AR experiences that help turn the nifty tech-which can layer digital objects and experiences over the real world-into something you use every day. You'll come out of the subway, point your camera at the street and let Google Maps' digital arrow tell you which way to go. In the business world, AR will be used for training, simulation and more. It likely won't be the year you get a set of AR glasses, but companies like North and Vuzix could make 2019 the first time you see someone else wearing them.While there will be excitement in 2019 around the IPOs of Uber and Lyft, neither will be overselling its future self-driving taxi services. Nor will you be likely to receive your first drone-delivered pizza. But you could start seeing more autonomy in the wild, in the form of small delivery bots. Think coolers on wheels, but with a mind of their own.As demonstrated by Starship and Nuro-with dozens more expected to debut at the CES 2019 tech show in Las Vegas in early January-the advantage of these machines is that they can take their sweet time getting from point A to point B. They'll pose little threat of physical danger, though you might have to dodge them on the sidewalks.The cable bundle will face its stiffest competition when 2019 brings more reasons than ever to cut the cord. Look for Netflix to make noise in the movie biz and for more channels and companies to launch their own apps.One of the biggest stories will be Disney's streaming service, Disney+, which will offer everything from Marvel to Star Wars to Pixar in a single service. Disney's already pulling that content from other services in preparation. Plus, what will happen to Hulu, which will be majority owned by the Mouse House?Meanwhile, AT&amp;amp;T's forthcoming service will try to compete by potentially combining HBO, Harry Potter and the DC superhero franchise, not to mention the library of Warner Bros. TV series. Apple's long-awaited streaming service will launch as well, and promises to have content far more compelling than Carpool Karaoke-just nothing too risque. Good thing you're canceling cable, because you'll need a lot of money to get everything you'll want to watch next year.Every time you ask Siri, Alexa or Google something, your voice is recorded and sent into the cloud-aka computers owned by big tech companies-before you hear a response. AI's reliance on that connection is problematic for everything from your battery life to your privacy.Soon, Intel and other mobile-chip designers will unveil processors specifically designed to do more locally. These chips enable what's called \"edge computing.\" More AI and machine-learning processes can happen on the device itself (that is, at the \"edge\" of the network). In time, you'd be able to do more without surrendering your privacy. You could get health alerts from your watch or use Siri on your phone when you're in airplane mode.It's more than just the most popular videogame in the world (though it's definitely that). Fortnite spent 2018 cementing Twitch as a streaming giant, making bonafide celebrities and e-sports athletes out of its best players, and earning its creator Epic Games a $15 billion valuation. It even made \"Fortnite coach\" a real job.Fortnite's success came in part because the game lets players compete-and communicate-across many platforms, and because Epic skipped some app stores and walled gardens in favor of its own approach. (And yes, it was free.)In 2019, the Fortnite Effect will be felt across the gaming industry, and beyond, as developers grapple with the concept of video-game-as-social-network-with implications good and bad. Look for studios to try giving their games the ever-changing, massively multiplayer spin that makes Fortnite so enticing.Whether or not you wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker, there's a good chance of your health and fitness data being touched by big tech companies in 2019. In the past few months, Amazon has started selling software that mines patient medical records for doctor information, ostensibly to help cut costs. The retail giant also bought an online pharmacy.Apple is in talks with the Department of Veterans Affairs about software to allow veterans to transfer their health records to iPhones. The Apple Watch's new electrocardiogram features allow you to easily share heart health information with your doctor. On top of that, insurance companies, like John Hancock, have begun to encourage policy holders to share their fitness tracking data, and more workplace wellness programs, such as Richard Branson's Virgin Pulse, provide rewards in exchange for tracking.1) Phones are too big for normal humans to hold and use. 2) Phones would probably be better if they were bigger. Yes, for years these two truisms have been in conflict. In 2019, we might get the best of both.Samsung is one of several companies that have revealed plans to build a foldable phone, with a phone-sized device opening into a tablet-sized screen. There's a lot of tech left to work out, as flexible displays aren't yet easy to build and the devices we've seen are large and awkward.In 2019, these devices will likely be expensive niche products for people wanting to live out their sci-fi dreams, but if foldable phones take off, it would be the biggest thing-literally and figuratively-to happen to smartphones in years. Plus, these flexible displays could eventually show up in your home or your car. Who wouldn't want a foldaway big-screen TV?

This week gave us one of the most significant developments in antitrust that we have had in a long time. The CEOs of Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook publicly sat down for an antitrust inquiry. As a general principle, I try to stick to developments that can have the most significant impact in India. However, the issue with technology, and with events such as this, is that they can have ripple effects in how these companies operate around the world (including India).    Before the hearing began, two major points struck me. Firstly, it seemed a bit unfair that all four CEOs had to be questioned at the same time. Given how different the nature of each company is, it did not seem fair to address them all in six hours. Secondly, I predicted that going by an Apple commissioned report, the hearing might be an exercise in cross-talking.     To some extent, I was wrong on both fronts. To their credit, Congress covered a lot of ground in six hours. Yes, some points annoyed me. Specifically, when a number of congressmen/women did not seem to register that this was an antitrust hearing. They thought it okay to ask questions regarding conservative bias on platforms. This does not come under the ambit of antitrust. It not only wasted  very valuable  time but also accomplished absolutely nothing. At one point, someone raised the question to Mark Zuckerberg on why one of Donald Trump Jr\u2019s  Tweets  was censored. I get that Twitter commands a considerable space in the political domain, but this was just not the platform to have any of this line of questioning.      However, all that aside, the subcommittee had over a million documents to process and got in a lot of substantive questions. It is a testament to that research that the antitrust law in the US might be changed to account for big tech. The most telling sign for me was the conclusion of the hearing itself. Chairman David Cicilline concluded by saying that, \u201c\u2026These companies, as it exists today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all of them need to be properly regulated\u201d.      Also there was not a lot of cross-talking at the event, contrary to my prediction. Instead, there was some amount of deflection where the CEOs promised to not know about a particular incident or promised to get back on the matter once they knew more.     It is a long road to actual change in this area. The Congress in the United States has many powers but breaking up companies is not one of them. Instead, Congress will aim to change the law around this issue, updating it for the current era. If and when this will happen is anyone\u2019s guess. For all of these companies, the future might be determined by who wins the upcoming presidential election.     One commonality that hit me during the hearings was how much the questions cantered around abuse of dominance. The argument was that being big in itself is not a crime; instead, the abuse of size is. And this manifested itself in the lack of platform neutrality everywhere, except for Facebook.     (Tim Cook) Apple was questioned on the App Store and whether the platform gave preference to Apple products over the competition. Amazon was questioned on whether they used data on their competition to decide on what products to make and whether their products were given preferential treatment. Google faced questions on whether its search functionality (including YouTube and the Play Store) gave preference to its products over others.     This tells me that there is a general consensus around the power these companies hold and concern on how this dominance is exercised. To some extent, this does not apply to Facebook as much. As Casey Newton pointed out in the  Vergecast,  Facebook\u2019s antitrust problems mostly exist in the past. Such as, should they have been allowed to acquire Instagram (and unjustifiably to a lesser extent) WhatsApp. But since the deals were approved according to the standard of that time, it does not make sense to shift the goalposts and punish them for it now.     My broad takeaway from the hearing is that the Congress is learning more about big tech, and regulating platforms is becoming a bipartisan issue. It is a marked improvement from the previous hearing with Mark Zuckerberg. As a reminder, Congressmen at the time had asked how Facebook was able to sustain a business model where users did not have to pay for the product. To which Zuckerberg responded \u2018Senator, we run ads\u2019. The moment was so iconic that Facebook employees put that on a t-shirt. But this hearing is the most definite sign that regulation is beginning to catch up with developments in technology. Let us not take that for granted. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42737485195</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GR-C121-F07F-829M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Asian Age</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The CEOs of Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook publicly sat down for an antitrust inquiry. As a general principle, I try to stick to developments that can have the most significant impact in India. However, the issue with technology, and with events such as this, is that they can have ripple effects in how these companies operate around the world (including India).    Before the hearing began, two major points struck me. Firstly, it seemed a bit unfair that all four CEOs had to be questioned at the same time. Given how different the nature of each company is, it did not seem fair to address them all in six hours. Secondly, I predicted that going by an Apple commissioned report, the hearing might be an exercise in cross-talking.     To some extent, I was wrong on both fronts. To their credit, Congress covered a lot of ground in six hours. Yes, some points annoyed me. Specifically, when a number of congressmen/women did not seem to register that this was an antitrust hearing. They thought it okay to ask questions regarding conservative bias on platforms. This does not come under the ambit of antitrust. It not only wasted  very valuable  time but also accomplished absolutely nothing. At one point, someone raised the question to Mark Zuckerberg on why one of Donald Trump Jr\u2019s  Tweets  was censored. I get that Twitter commands a considerable space in the political domain, but this was just not the platform to have any of this line of questioning.      However, all that aside, the subcommittee had over a million documents to process and got in a lot of substantive questions. It is a testament to that research that the antitrust law in the US might be changed to account for big tech. The most telling sign for me was the conclusion of the hearing itself. Chairman David Cicilline concluded by saying that, \u201c\u2026These companies, as it exists today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all of them need to be properly regulated\u201d.      Also there was not a lot of cross-talking at the event, contrary to my prediction. Instead, there was some amount of deflection where the CEOs promised to not know about a particular incident or promised to get back on the matter once they knew more.     It is a long road to actual change in this area. The Congress in the United States has many powers but breaking up companies is not one of them. Instead, Congress will aim to change the law around this issue, updating it for the current era. If and when this will happen is anyone\u2019s guess. For all of these companies, the future might be determined by who wins the upcoming presidential election.     One commonality that hit me during the hearings was how much the questions cantered around abuse of dominance. The argument was that being big in itself is not a crime; instead, the abuse of size is. And this manifested itself in the lack of platform neutrality everywhere, except for Facebook.     (Tim Cook) Apple was questioned on the App Store and whether the platform gave preference to Apple products over the competition. Amazon was questioned on whether they used data on their competition to decide on what products to make and whether their products were given preferential treatment.

De keizers van techland, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai en Mark Zuckerberg, komen zich in de antitrustcommissie van het Huis van Afgevaardigden verdedigen tegen de aanvallen van politici.

The appointment of Genachowski, a veteran of     the DC venture-capital world, was a signal to techies that the <person><nameText>Obama     administration </nameText></person>was going to elevate and engage with technology     policy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bob Goodlatte,</emphasis>US congressman from Virginia.     The ten-term Roanoke Republican is cochair of the Congressional Internet     Caucus and a leader on high-tech issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Todd Park,</emphasis> chief technology officer,     Department of Health and Human Services. The cofounder of Athenahealth,     Park is at the forefront of the nation's discussion about moving     health-care information online.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Macon Phillips,</emphasis>White House director of new     media. Since day one of the <person><nameText>Obama administration, </nameText></person>Phillips has been     building an impressive team to bypass the White House press corps and     speak directly to citizens.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alec Ross,</emphasis>senior adviser for innovation,     Department of State. The driving force behind much of State's     digital-communication initiative and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>\"Net freedom\"     agenda, Ross cofounded the nonprofit One Economy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Ruffini</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mindy Finn,</emphasis>cofounders, Engage. The two GOP operatives scored big in the fall     elections, helping several tea-party candidates to victory. They'll likely     be at the center of the Republican 2012 presidential race.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Schaper,</emphasis> digital strategist, US Chamber     of Commerce. House speaker John Boehner's former top digital strategist is     starting a new job boosting business's use of new media.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Warner,</emphasis> US senator from Virginia. The     former governor and venture capitalist has made technology a centerpiece     of his agenda since the beginning of his career, when he made buckets of     money helping to launch the cell-phone industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phil Weiser,</emphasis> senior adviser to the director     for technology and innovation, National Economic Council, the White House.     The President's point person on \"winning the future,\" Weiser is a key     liaison to the tech community.</p><h>Dealmakers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Errol Arkilic,</emphasis> industrial-innovation program     director, National Science Foundation. The grantmaker, who focuses on     small businesses, has been a consistent presence on the local scene,     including participating in DC Lean Startup Circle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Barris,</emphasis> managing general partner, New     Enterprise Associates. Through a score of companies, including Vonage,     Barris has an eye for worthwhile investments, but his firm's investment in     the Chicago-based company that spawned Groupon might make his backers the     richest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Philip Bronner,</emphasis> Novak Biddle Venture Partners.     Since Jack Biddle and Roger Novak founded it in 1997, NBVP has established     itself as the area's top venture-capital firm, and Bronner is the go-to     for local start-ups, including Approva, Clearspring, and Webs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Burton,</emphasis> managing general partner, Updata     Partners. The cofounder of the Reston growth-stage venture-capital firm is     head of the Mid-Atlantic Venture Association.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brooke B. Coburn,</emphasis>managing director, the     Carlyle Group. David Rubenstein's Carlyle Group, a private-equity firm,     remains one of the region's biggest pocketbooks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carol Thompson Cole,</emphasis>CEO, Venture Philanthropy     Partners. The onetime DC mayoral aide now heads the prestigious     philanthropy group founded by Mario Morino.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Darby,</emphasis>CEO, In-Q-Tel. Not many government     agencies have their own venture-capital firm, but the CIA does-and if     Darby spots promising technology, he has deep pockets to play     with.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Miles Gilburne,</emphasis>managing member, ZG Ventures.     A key ally of Steve Case, Gilburne-a former AOL vice president-has a     particular interest in biotech and life sciences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Lincoln,</emphasis> partner, Cooley Godward Kronish.     Working with his colleague Adam Ruttenberg, Lincoln is the key     mergers-and-acquisitions and venture-capital lawyer for Northern     Virginia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Art Marks,</emphasis>general partner, Valhalla Partners.     Marks, who now works at Valhalla with cofounder Gene Riechers, has spent     more than 25 years in local venture-capital circles and is still active in     many deals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John May,</emphasis> managing partner, New Vantage Group.     One of the only local \"angels\" who provide key early-stage funding to     start-ups, May is a must-meet for any budding entrepreneur.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nigel Morris,</emphasis>former president and COO,     Capital One. The cofounder of the credit-card powerhouse has moved on to     being one of the region's most prolific dealmakers and     negotiators.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don Rainey,</emphasis> general partner, Grotech Ventures.     A longtime Washington investor, Rainey has his fingers in many pots, from     military projects to LivingSocial, a move that will make his partners at     Grotech a lot of money.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kim Shanahan,</emphasis> Korn/Ferry. The leading     headhunter for the Northern Virginia tech industry, Shanahan has many top     executives on speed dial.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ralph Terkowitz,</emphasis>general partner, ABS Capital.     The former CTO/CIO of the Washington Post Company hosts regular dinners     that bring together a who's who of the local tech scene.</p><h>Entrepreneurs</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sid Banerjee,</emphasis> cofounder and CEO, Clarabridge.     The customer-feedback-mining start-up led by Banerjee-one of the first     employees of MicroStrategy-is a big hit, as was his previous venture,     Claraview.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Bankoff,</emphasis>CEO, SB Nation. Bankoff is a     former AOL executive and senior adviser at the private-equity powerhouse     Providence Equity Partners. SB Nation has a network of more than 300 blogs     that dominates the online sports conversation-and he hopes it'll be global     as he moves into European soccer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Batalion,</emphasis> cofounder and CTO,     LivingSocial. The head technologist for this rapidly growing company is a     big local presence and is helping to push the start-up scene     forward.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Case,</emphasis>CEO, Revolution. With his fingers     in lots of deals and boards (including LivingSocial), Case and his right     hand, Tige Savage, are key drivers and funders of many     projects.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Crupi,</emphasis> CTO, JackBe. The rest of the     company's motto, \"nimble and quick,\" underscores what it sees as the key     to Presto-real-time business intelligence on the company's custom     dashboards-which has helped the government's own stimulus Web site,     Recovery.gov.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Davidson,</emphasis> CEO, EverFi. Fresh off $11     million in Series A funding from New Enterprise Associates and others,     Davidson is set for a big expansion of his financial-literacy     programs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark D. Ein,</emphasis> founder and CEO, Venturehouse     Group. The tech entrepreneur has a variety of projects, from the Kastle     Systems security company to the pro tennis team he has named after it-the     Washington Kastles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raul Fernandez,</emphasis>CEO, ObjectVideo. After taking     his company Proxicom public and selling it for nearly $450 million,     Fernandez is busy with his video-analytics company and his co-ownership of     the Wizards, Capitals, and Mystics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter LaMotte,</emphasis> president, GeniusRocket. Under     CEO Mark Walsh, LaMotte, a veteran of the Corporate Executive Board, is     the power behind the \"curated crowdsourcing\" site, which helps connect     creatives and businesses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ted Leonsis,</emphasis> entrepreneur/investor. Now owner     of the Verizon Center and its teams, Leonsis is a fan favorite for his     stewardship of the Capitals and perhaps the biggest player in the local     tech community-from his SnagFilms start-up to fast-rising Groupon, in     which he invests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robert S. Marshall,</emphasis>CEO, Earth Networks. Best     known for his Germantown-based company's WeatherBug, the University of     Maryland grad operates the world's largest weather and lightning     observation system.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim O'Shaughnessy,</emphasis> CEO, LivingSocial. The     Georgetown grad is on top of the hottest thing to hit the local tech world     since AOL, with an ever-growing valuation-helped recently by a     $400-million venture-funding round-and a staff that's been expanding by     six a day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hooman Radfar,</emphasis>cofounder and CEO, Clearspring.     After some growing pains, the McLean-based firm has seen its     social-sharing widget, AddThis, make it one of the largest Web sites in     the world-and one that possesses an enormous amount of valuable data on     user behavior and preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael J. Saylor,</emphasis> founder and CEO,     MicroStrategy. The long ride of MicroStrategy hasn't been steady for     Saylor-who lost billions when the tech bubble burst-but it's going     gangbusters now and looking the best it has in years, thanks in part to     the hard work of COO Sanju K. Bansal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Schroeder,</emphasis> CEO, HealthCentral. The     Washington Post Company has helped launch many a career locally, and the     former Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive CEO's is one. His health-care     information provider has an A-list team of backers, from Barry Diller to     Sequoia Capital to the Carlyle Group.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pete Snyder,</emphasis> founder and CEO, New Media     Strategies. The Rosslyn-based communications firm has been singled out for     its success by Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and continues its recent     hiring spree.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Yates,</emphasis> founder and CEO, Opower. His     Arlington-based energy-efficiency start-up, perhaps more than any other     outside of LivingSocial, seems poised for a big IPO down the     road.</p><h>Entrepreneurial Couples</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jen Consalvo</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Frank Gruber,</emphasis> founders, Tech Cocktail. Their start-up, which began as a     local networking group, has be-come a national gathering point for budding     entrepreneurs, attracting thousands at the South by Southwest Interactive     conference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phillip and Caren Merrick.</emphasis> The cofounders of     webMethods, which was the most successful software IPO of its time, have     their own projects now-with Phillip overseeing the online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 site     VisualCV and Caren running for the Virginia state Senate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley and Sheryl Schwartz.</emphasis> The     husband-and-wife team that runs Blue Canopy-a government-tech contractor     founded in 2001 that has twice made Inc. magazine's list of the 500     fastest-growing private US companies-both came to the start-up with     extensive corporate backgrounds.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amy Senger</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steven Mandzik.</emphasis> Founders of the consulting firm 1X57, they've become     influential in Gov 2.0 circles-and have helped usher the CIA into the age     of social media.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keith Shepherd</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalia Luckyanova,</emphasis> founders, Imangi Studios. Their small-game     development company has churned out a number of popular iPad and iPhone     apps, including the game Harbor Master.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Thomas</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leslie Bradshaw,</emphasis> cofounders, Jess3. The creative geniuses behind one of     the region's hottest agencies, they helped an astronaut check into     Foursquare from space and helped C-SPAN establish itself as a digital     innovator.</p><h>Industry Leaders</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reggie Aggarwal,</emphasis> founder and CEO, Cvent. A     leader in the Indian high-tech world, he heads an 800-plus-person     event-management software company that has helped put together more than     275,000 events worldwide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deborah H. Alderson,</emphasis>president, SAIC's Defense     Solutions Group. While she oversees a workforce of 12,500, Alderson has     made mentoring women a focus of her energies and developed SAIC's Women's     Network.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anne Altman,</emphasis>general manager, Global Public     Sector, IBM. The experienced IBM leader continues to rise, most recently     taking over all of the giant's public-sector work.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Becker,</emphasis> CEO, Approva. The company has     embraced a lighthearted marketing campaign targeting \"control freaks\" with     its access-control software, which has become the industry standard for     most of the large audit firms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wes Bush,</emphasis>CEO, Northrop Grumman. The decision     by the new head of Northrop to move the company's headquarters to the     Washington area-creating a bidding war among Virginia, Maryland, and the     District, eventually won by Falls Church-was a coup. It was also a     recognition of the importance of the government IT sector, where Linda     Mills heads Northrop's $8.4-billion-a-year information-systems     business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Teresa Carlson,</emphasis> vice president, global public     sector, Amazon Web Services. The move of the influential vice president of     Microsoft Federal Services to Amazon in December showed how seriously the     retailer took cloud computing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edward J. Casey Jr.,</emphasis>CEO, Serco (North     America). A former energy executive, Casey has led Serco through two     successful acquisitions since 2006 and has grown the company into more     than a billion dollars in revenue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael L. Chasen,</emphasis>CEO, Blackboard. The     education-services provider continues to grow, allowing Chasen increasing     flexibility to involve himself in other local start-ups and     deals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pablo Chavez,</emphasis> managing policy counsel, and     <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Bradshaw,</emphasis> director of Google Federal, Google.     Google's presence is expanding yearly in Washington-its $5.2 million in     lobbying expenses last year was up by nearly a third from 2009. Chavez, a     former John McCain aide, is one of the leading Silicon Valley voices on     Capitol Hill, and Bradshaw is the face of Google in the federal     sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lynda Clarizio,</emphasis>CEO, Invision. The former head     of Advertising.com for AOL and a onetime Arnold &amp; Porter lawyer,     Clarizio is among the foremost experts on digital advertising.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James F. Coakley,</emphasis>CEO, Power Loft. The Prince     William County data center is one of the area's largest storage facilities     and a green model for similar projects.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew J. Desch,</emphasis> CEO, Iridium. As head of one     of the world's largest mobile-satellite companies-relied upon by mariners,     explorers, and even the Defense Department-Desch helped take the company     public in 2009.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amr ElSawy,</emphasis>CEO, Noblis. The nonprofit     consulting firm-which traces its history to MIT's World War II efforts to     help the government solve complex problems-remains a force in federal     circles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nelson M. Ford,</emphasis>CEO, LMI. The health-care     executive turned undersecretary of the Army now heads the nonprofit     management consultancy born of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's     frustration with the Pentagon's business practices 50 years     ago.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Linda Gooden,</emphasis>executive vice president,     Lockheed Martin Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions. With more than     $10 billion in annual sales, Gooden oversees a business roughly the size     of Cambodia's GDP.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald E. Graham,</emphasis>CEO, Washington Post Company.     As a regular Facebook user, a board member of the social-media powerhouse,     and overseer of the print newspaper business's transition to a     multi-platform media experience, Graham is at the forefront of     technological change. Products such as Trove, built by his team and led by     CDO Vijay Ravindran, are causing excitement in media circles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walter P. Havenstein,</emphasis>CEO, SAIC. The newish     leader of the region's biggest government-technology contractor, with     17,500 local employees, is seen as a breath of fresh air, raising employee     morale.

But as those     companies split apart or morphed into something other than the juggernauts     they once were, they gave way to firms with names like Cofense, EverFi,     EdgeConneX-hopeful, hip, made-up words that suggest something fresh and     new on the scene. Look closer, though, and you'll see that the old titans     are very much there in this new landscape: Sid Banerjee at Clarabridge.     Andrew Rosen at Interfolio. Sanju Bansal at Hunch Analytics. Timothy Chi     at WeddingWire. Susan Tynan at Framebridge. All are alumni of those Big     Three.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's also new is that none of the aforementioned companies     are dependent on Washington's best-known buyer of tech, the federal     government. As the DC technology industry has expanded, it has     diversified. Today it's increasingly common for local start-ups not to     depend on the government at all, instead getting into the kind of business     that would be equally at home in Silicon Valley-things such as     SocialCode's \"audience intelligence software,\" which helps big brands     better leverage social media, or Alarm.com's connected, smart-home     devices.</p><p>The region's entrepreneurial class has long fantasized about     being seen as more than a cadre of glorified federal contractors, which is     one reason firms like these get so much hype. In reality, Uncle Sam's bony     fingers are still all over our list-and that's good news, even if that     story isn't as sexy as the Silicon Valley version. The government being     the government, some of what it buys from local contractors is relatively     mundane, if important, work such as data processing and enterprise     software. Yet some of the local companies that do those things for     government agencies now rank among the fastest-growing small businesses in     the country. Meanwhile, some government tech contractors here have become     multibillion-dollar IT concerns: Leidos, General Dynamics Information     Technology, and DXC Technology are all billion-dollar businesses, and all     have expanded exponentially through recent mergers.</p><p>The feds are also helping drive what may be the fastest-growing     subcategory of tech here-cybersecurity. Companies such as Endgame are     earning their keep protecting federal databases, while firms including     Altamira are getting paid to manage geospatial-intelligence info. Others,     such as LookingGlass Cyber Solutions and Dragos, are also establishing     reputations for being the best in the business for addressing     cybersecurity.</p><p>A lot of venture-capital money is betting on those cyberfirms-K     Street's Paladin Capital, for one, has made more investments in such     companies than any other VC fund in the US. Steve Case's Revolution Growth     is putting its money into cybersecurity, too, as well as funding local     companies such as Optoro, which finds innovative ways to resell products     that have been returned by customers, and Cava, the Greek fast-casual     chain that has leveraged high-tech tools to fuel its nationwide     expansion.</p><p>Plenty of others are moving money into tech here, including     local NextGen Venture Partners and QED Investors, as well as the local     branches of Silicon Valley Bank and the vast New Enterprise Associates.     What's more, Washington firms have drawn the attention of national funds     not based here. The Rise Fund (singer Bono is an investor) has poured cash     into EverFi, a hot start-up in education technology-another growing     sector, along with cybersecurity and data centers (70 percent of all     internet data traffic now flows through Northern Virginia).</p><p>On and on it goes. Cushman &amp; Wakefield ranks ours as the     third-best metropolitan area for tech, behind only San Francisco and     Silicon Valley. Were Washington to land Amazon's HQ2, that position would     likely be solidified.</p><p>The ranking reflects what we found in compiling our 2018 list     of Tech Titans, a group that covers small start-ups with big potential and     ever-expanding tech mega-firms. Backed by local financiers, boosted by     potentially billions in federal funding, and supported by a plethora of     local universities, the tech industry is growing at a blazing clip. That     may make this year's group of Tech Titans the most innovative, most     important, and most influential we've ever assembled.</p><h>The Entrepreneurs</h><h>Reggie Aggarwal / Founder and CEO, Cvent</h><p>Aggarwal started this event-management software company with     his own money and a staff of two back in 1999. It's now a 3,400-person     firm and was sold two years ago to Vista Equity Partners for $1.65     billion, but Aggarwal remains at the helm.</p><h>Michael Avon / CEO, chairman, and founder, ICX Media</h><p>A former principal at Columbia Capital, Avon now runs ICX,     which offers a platform that can be used by digital video creators,     including big consumer brands and social-media stars, to more closely     monitor and understand their audience. In April, actor/writer/filmmaker     Edward Burns joined the three-year-old company's board, which includes     former Time Inc. CEO Laura Lang. The company has been backed by $9.6     million in funding.</p><h>Brian Ballard, Jeff Jenkins, and Chris Hoyt / Founders,     Upskill</h><p>The company makes a software platform called Skylight that runs     on smart glasses and other wearable devices, giving workers instant access     to data that can boost their productivity. The platform is in use by     Boeing, and GE Ventures has invested in Upskill. The latest in\u00adfusion, of     $17.2 million, came this past spring.</p><h>Zvi Band and Tony Cappaert / Cofounders, Contactually</h><p>Maker of a customer-relationship-management platform that has     been optimized for real-estate agents, Contactually was launched seven     years ago, and both of its founders have tried to help other executives     enjoy the same kind of success they've had. Band helped found the DC Tech     Meetup group, and Cappaert holds a regular dinner-party series in which he     meets with other local business founders.</p><h>Sid Banerjee / Founder, executive vice chairman, and chief     strategy officer, Clarabridge</h><p>Banerjee was one of the founding employees at MicroStrategy. At     Clara\u00adbridge, he has created a firm offering     artificial-intelligence-driven software systems that analyze customer     interactions to help boost customer service at major companies including     Walmart, United, and eBay.</p><h>Sanju Bansal, Aneesh Chopra, and Dan Ross / CEO (Bansal) and     founders (Chopra and Ross), Hunch Analytics</h><p>In 2014, Bansal, a former executive vice president at     MicroStrategy, joined this firm founded by Ross and Chopra, who in 2009     became the first federal-level chief technology officer. Hunch Analytics     mines public and private databases for information that can help     health-care firms and other companies make more informed strategic     decisions.</p><h>Randy Brouckman / CEO, EdgeConneX</h><p>This Herndon company is the only global provider of \"edge\" data     centers-facilities that either fill in gaps in internet connectivity or     boost signal service in high-traffic areas. It's expanding rapidly, having     announced new centers this year in Miami, Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland,     Denver, Toronto, and Buenos Aires.</p><h>Richard D. Calder Jr. / CEO and president, GTT     Communications</h><p>This McLean company, which offers cloud networking services to     multinational firms, has been growing through acquisitions, including the     $2.3-billion cash buyout of the European cloud networker Interoute, which     closed this year. GTT Communications appears to be on track to top $1     billion in revenue in 2018.</p><h>Matt Calkins / Founder and CEO, Appian</h><p>Appian was one of a few Washington-area firms to issue an IPO     in 2017, and shares have nearly tripled since the company made its Nasdaq     debut. In his spare time, Calkins competes in the World Boardgaming     Championships, which is a real thing.</p><h>Timothy Chi / Cofounder and CEO, WeddingWire</h><p>In 2007, Chi-a cofounder of Blackboard-launched WeddingWire, an     online marketplace that pairs grooms- and brides-to-be with wedding     vend-ors. It has grown steadily, and in May it sold a majority stake to     the private-equity firm Permira for $350 million.</p><h>Zia Chishti / CEO, founder, and chairman of the board,     Afiniti</h><p>Born in the US and raised in Pakistan, Chishti now has led a     second company to a billion-dollar valuation. (His first was Align     Technology.) The DC firm makes artificial-intelligence products that more     efficiently pair agents with customers who dial into a company's call     center. It expects to go public in 2019.</p><h>Zack Christenson / CEO, Crowdskout</h><p>The company makes a customer-relationship-management soft-ware     platform for political-advocacy groups. The platform has been used by the     Republican National Committee, nonprofits, and trade groups. Under     Christenson, Crowdskout has added nearly two dozen people in recent     months, tripling the staff before the 2018 midterm elections.</p><h>Tom Davidson / Cofounder and CEO, EverFi</h><p>Last year the \u00fcber-exclusive Rise Fund-which includes U2's Bono     and LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman among its investors-put $150 million of a     total $190 million in financing into EverFi, which offers online-education     courses. That cemented its place as one of the hottest education-tech     start-ups in the country.</p><h>Ted Davies / CEO and chairman, Altamira Technologies     Corporation</h><p>Davies came to Altamira after being president of Unisys Federal     Systems as well as a partner specializing in tech and government at Booz     Allen Hamilton. Today the company he leads is a major contractor helping     the Defense Department and US intelligence agencies find ways to move data     to the cloud securely.</p><h>Brandon Torres Declet / Cofounder and CEO, Measure</h><p>Declet had worked for the Department of Defense, the NYPD, and     the House Homeland Security Committee before cofounding Measure, a drone     operator headquartered, ironically, in one of the least drone-friendly     cities in the US. The company's drone services-which include pilots who do     the flying-can help firms inspect things such as construction or cell     towers as well as respond to emergencies. Measure received $15 million in     Series B financing last year.</p><h>Donald Graham / Chairman, Graham Holdings Company</h><p>Born with ink in his veins, Graham knew his way around digital     even before his family sold the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Post.</emphasis>He was a     longtime member of Facebook's board of directors, and his $2.6-billion     Graham Holdings owns several techy companies, including the cybersecurity     education outfit CyberVista. It can only help that Timothy O'Shaughnessy,     former head of LivingSocial-who is married to Graham's daughter, Laura-is     CEO of Graham Holdings.</p><h>Blake Hall / Founder and CEO, ID.me</h><p>Late last year, this company, which offers a digital-identity     service-sort of a driver's license for online transactions-brought on a     CFO and CTO as it surpassed 5 million total users. That came just months     after Hall, an Army veteran who served in a combat unit in Iraq, secured     $19 million in Series B funding for his growing company.</p><h>Tim Hwang / Founder and CEO, FiscalNote</h><p>Investment heavyweights New Enterprise Associates, Mark Cuban,     Revolution, and Jerry Yang have all backed 26-year-old Hwang's FiscalNote,     now the top player in legal analytics, offering data that helps customers     track and predict the potential impact of new regulations and legislation.     This July, FiscalNote expanded into media by acquiring CQ Roll Call from     the Economist Group.</p><h>E. Wayne Jackson III / CEO, Sonatype</h><p>Jackson, head of Sonatype since 2010, once led the     network-security firm Sourcefire from start-up to IPO to a $2.7-billion     acquisition by Cisco. Sonatype, which helps distribute secure open-source     software to developers, saw sales double in the first quarter of this     year.</p><h>Reid Jackson / CEO and president, Compusearch</h><p>Late last year, Jackson led the buyout of Route 7 neighbor and     reverse-auction marketplace maker FedBid. The combined companies today     work with every Cabinet-level agency in the federal government, for     example, providing modern procurement services and supply-chain     analytics.</p><h>Kay Kapoor / Founder and CEO, Arya Technologies</h><p>A former CEO of Accenture Federal Services, Kapoor left her     lead position at AT&amp;T's $15-billion Global Public Sector division last     year to found her own firm. Though still in the early start-up phase, Arya     Technologies is worth watching because at AT&amp;T Kapoor helped land a     25-year federal contract worth an estimated $100 billion.</p><h>Ajay Kori and Jeff Sheely / Cofounders, UrbanStems</h><p>This flower-delivery business now has six operations centers     and is delivering same-day to custom-ers in Washington and New York City,     as well as next-day to customers nationally through a new partnership with     FedEx.</p><h>Mike Lawrie / Chairman and CEO, DXC Technology</h><p>DXC is still in its infancy but is already a leader in IT     services-a mega-firm with 6,000 clients from a variety of industries. The     $21-billion Tysons company was formed in April 2017 by the merger of CSC     and the enterprise-services division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.     Lawrie, who had been CEO of CSC before the merger, oversees a worldwide     workforce of 134,000 people.</p><h>Robert M. Lee, Justin Cavinee, and Jon Lavender / CEO (Lee),     chief data scientist (Cavinee), and CTO (Lavender), Dragos</h><p>This trio of former cybersecurity experts working within the US     intelligence community raised $10 million in 2017 for Dragos. The mission     of their Han-over, Maryland, firm is to help protect private companies     from cyberattacks, especially those whose businesses involve     infrastructure used by the public-a wind-farm operator, for instance. Or,     as Lee has grandly put it: \"Dragos exists to safeguard     civilization.\"</p><h>John Mazur\u00a0 / CEO, Homesnap</h><p>Deloitte ranks this Rockville company as one of the 500     fastest-growing tech firms in the US. Its app, launched in 2012, connects     real-estate brokers and homebuyers and offers instantly updated home     listings. Homesnap, which Mazur took over in 2017, has raised more than     $30 million.</p><h>Tobin Moore and Adam Vitarello / Cofounders, Optoro</h><p>Several of Washington's biggest investors have backed Optoro,     which runs a software platform offering retailers a way to make money off     of the millions of things retail customers either didn't buy or did buy     but later returned. QED, Grotech, and Revolution Growth have all chipped     in to what's now a $129-million investment pool that Optoro's founders-a     couple of thirtysomething St. Albans grads-hope will help them create a     billion-dollar business.</p><h>Laura Graham O'Shaughnessy / CEO, SocialCode</h><p>The company markets \"audience-intelligence software\" to major     brands-everything from Heine\u00adken to GEICO-helping them better identify,     understand, and target their customers on social media.</p><h>Bill Pardue and Jim Shelhamer / CEO and cofounder (Pardue) and     executive vice president (Shelhamer), Athenium Analytics</h><p>The forecast for Pardue's start-up, formerly called Weather     Analytics, proved to be sunny. The six-year-old DC firm-provider of     weather and predictive-risk software to insurance companies-took in $17     million in financing last year and completed a merger with the     insurance-software maker Athenium this summer.</p><h>Carolyn Parent / CEO, LiveSafe</h><p>Parent's Arlington firm demonstrated its technology in front of     industry leaders this year, outfitting almost 5,000 SXSW conference staff     and volunteers in Austin with mobile technology that can instantly connect     people and share their locations in the event of an emergency.</p><h>Chip Paucek / CEO, 2U</h><p>Northwestern, USC, SMU, Georgetown, and other universities use     2U's platform to provide online classes. Revenues are growing-fast. In     June, the Lanham company raised $331 million through a public offering of     its common stock to fund more growth through acquisitions.</p><h>Andrew Rosen / CEO, Interfolio</h><p>Rosen is an alumnus of two of Washington's best-known tech     firms, Blackboard and Micro\u00adStrategy. He took over as Interfolio CEO in     2015 from founder and now president Steve Goldenberg. The company's     software steers applicants and faculty committees through the     higher-education hiring process. Since joining the company, he has driven     growth by helping secure a $12-million financing round, inking a     partnership with the University of California at San Diego, and acquiring     a Kentucky faculty-data-evaluation firm.</p><h>Brett Schulman / CEO, Cava</h><p>Tech and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tzatziki</emphasis>? For the burgeoning fast-casual     restaurant chain Cava-with more than 60 locations nationwide and     counting-that's been a delicious combination. Schulman has invested     heavily in data tools. Among them: sensors at some locations that track     employee and customer movements. The resulting data is analyzed to improve     efficiency and better understand how customers use Cava's     spaces.</p><h>Steve Trundle / CEO, Alarm.com</h><p>This publicly traded firm was a small division within     MicroStrategy until it spun off in 2000. Since then, it has broken into     the \"smart security\" industry in a big way: Among the 8 million homes and     businesses with smart-security systems in this country, some 5 million     areAlarm.com subscribers.</p><h>Susan Tynan / Founder, Framebridge</h><p>Tynan's business-which offers quick custom framing at cut-rate     prices-has taken off with investors, including New Enterprise Associates     and Revolution. They've placed $67 million into the four-year-old     business, including a $30-million funding round this summer.</p><h>The Government</h><h>Matt Cutts / Acting administrator, US Digital Service</h><p>USDS focuses on, among other things, making the websites of     federal agencies more functional. Cutts, a former Google executive, began     running it early last year. Since then, he has prioritized hiring tech     talent and working to retain workers amid rap-id turnover. (See profile,     page 72.)</p><h>Andrei Iancu / Director, US Patent and Trademark     Office</h><p>Iancu was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on February 5. No     doubt that same day, tech execs all over the country began Googling for     old syllabi from the advanced patent class he taught at UCLA.</p><h>Christopher C. Krebs / Undersecretary, National Protection and     Programs Directorate, Department of Homeland Security\u00a0</h><p>Krebs headed cybersecurity policy for Micro\u00adsoft before joining     the Trump administration in March 2017. Today he oversees a key division     at DHS involved with protecting US infrastructure (e.g., the power grid)     as well as cybersecurity and communications net-work security-all of which     are thought to be under potential threat from foreign powers and terrorist     groups.</p><h>Barney Krucoff / Interim chief technology officer, District of     Columbia</h><p>When he was chief data officer for the District, the city     described Krucoff as \"the man behind all of DC's data.\" Now, after taking     over as CTO, he'll be the man in front of all DC's data, which is     increasingly being made available online for public perusal.</p><h>Jason Matheny / Director, Intelligence Advanced Research     Projects Activity</h><p>Matheny's agency, part of the Office of the Director of     National Intelligence, is looking to invest in \"high-risk, high-payoff     research programs that have the potential to provide our nation with an     overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries.\" A few     examples: IARPA is seeking technology that could detect and prevent the     use of biological weapons as well as new technology that will improve the     accuracy of polygraph machines.</p><h>Dawn Meyerriecks / Deputy director for science and technology,     CIA</h><p>Spy vs. Spy is increasingly becoming Machine vs. Machine. Under     the direction of former AOL executive Meyerriecks, the CIA is transforming     the way it monitors other countries, employing artificial intelligence to     watch the machines that are watching American agents. As of last year,     Meyerriecks's division has been engaged in almost 140 AI     projects.</p><h>Jerrold Nadler, Doug Collins, Steve Chabot, and Tom Marino /     Congressional representatives, House Judiciary Committee</h><p>Top contenders to re\u00adplace longtime Virginia congressman Bob     Goodlatte, who isn't seeking reelection, as Judiciary Committee chair,     these four will all help decide the fate of net-neutrality rules repealed     by the FCC in June, because their committee would need to sign off on     countering the FCC action. Republicans Collins, Chabot, and Marino are all     against net neutrality. Democrat Nadler, who's likely to take over the     committee if a blue wave swamps the House, is in favor of congressional     action to restore the rules.</p><h>General Paul Nakasone / Director, National Security Agency;     Commander, US Cyber Command</h><p>The Minnesota native who commanded troops while deployed in     Iraq and Afghanistan headed the Army's Cyber Command for two years before     taking on the Department of Defense's top cybersecurity post this past     spring. USCYBERCOM, as it's known, is expanding quickly in response to     perceived cyber threats against military targets.</p><h>Buddy Rizer / Economic-development director, Loudoun     County</h><p>Loudoun is called \"Data Center Alley\" in part be\u00adcause Rizer     has worked hard to make his suburban county a hotbed for data centers.     Some 70 percent of all global internet traffic now flows through the area,     and data centers across Virginia create an estimated $10.2 billion in     annual economic output.</p><h>Steven H. Walker / Director, Defense Advanced Research Projects     Agency</h><p>Few agencies have done more to influence the development of     cutting-edge technologies. For example, DARPA robotics initiatives led to     the technology that makes driver\u00adless cars possible. That means Walker-who     officially took over DARPA last November-is one of the most important     people in all of tech.</p><h>Mark Warner and Tim Kaine / US senators from Virginia</h><p>Warner, who founded the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, and Kaine     introduced legislation to overrule the FCC's elimination of net-neutrality     regulations last February. It passed with bipartisan support, but the     House hasn't fol\u00ad-lowed suit and likely won't if Republicans retain     control after November. In that case, Warner and Kaine may reach into the     bag of parliamentary tricks to find another way to block the FCC's removal     of those Obama-era rules.</p><h>The Lobbyists</h><h>Danielle Burr / Head of federal affairs, Uber</h><p>Uber's spending on lobbying has, ahem, surged-to a record     $540,000 in the first quarter of this year-since this former aide to House     majority leader Kevin McCarthy took over the company's top federal-liaison     spot in January. The firm, which has tested its own self-driving vehicles,     could be affected by a bill called the SELF-DRIVE Act, which would allow     it to test-drive autonomous cars. After passing the House overwhelmingly     last fall, the legislation has languished in the Senate.</p><h>Teresa Carlson / Vice president, worldwide public sector, Amazon     Web Services</h><p>Amazon Web Services-Amazon's cloud-services arm-is projected to     do $2.8 billion in business with the federal government this year and $4.6     billion in 2019. It's also reportedly a lead contender for a $10-billion     Defense Department IT contract.</p><h>Colin Crowell and Carlos Monje / Vice president of global public     policy (Crowell) and director of public policy (Monje), Twitter</h><p>Twitter has a fight on its hands with the powers that be in the     House GOP. In August, majority leader Kevin McCarthy called for Twitter     CEO Jack Dorsey to testify on the Hill about the company's filtering of     certain accounts. Some have alleged that Twitter is \"shadow-banning\"     conservatives. Crowell, who was senior counsel at the Obama-era FCC, and     Monje will lead the effort to calm those concerns.</p><h>Matthew Eggers / Vice president for cybersecurity policy, US     Chamber of Commerce</h><p>Anything that the Chamber, an enormous lobbying group, has to     say on cybersecurity policy is likely to be heard at the White     House.</p><h>Jeff Greene / Vice president, global government affairs and     policy, Symantec</h><p>Lawmakers on the Hill often rely on Greene, a top DC     representative for the California security-software firm Symantec, to     share industry insights as well as offer official testimony. He recently     addressed a hearing titled \"Empty Threat or Serious Danger: Assessing     North Korea's Risk to the Homeland.\"</p><h>Brian Huseman / Vice president of public policy,     Amazon</h><p>Amazon has built the biggest tech-business lobbying shop in     Washington over the past year, doubling the number of employees to, at     last count, 28. That's twice the size of Google's DC operations. All those     new faces fall under Huseman's purview. Whether they're about to be joined     by 50,000 new Amazonians working at a Washington HQ2 remains to be     seen.</p><h>Joel Kaplan and Erin Egan / Vice president of global public     policy (Kaplan) and chief privacy officer (Egan), Facebook</h><p>Even if you get most of your news from Russian online trolls,     you probably know that the world's leading social network has had a rough     year. But bad news for Facebook's stock price is good news for its DC     office, which reportedly spent a record $3.67 million on lobbying during     the quarter when Mark Zuckerberg appeared on the Hill to answer questions     on privacy issues related to Cambridge Analytica. Look for them to add     more muscle as law\u00admakers and regulators circle.</p><h>Angela McKay and Fred Humphries / Senior director of     cybersecurity policy and strategy (McKay) and corporate vice president of     US government affairs (Humphries), Microsoft</h><p>A Booz Allen Hamilton alum, McKay heads cybersecurity and     cloud-security policy for Microsoft. That's an important position     considering the federal government's current emphasis on cyber issues.     Humphries helms government affairs overall. Last year, the company spent     $8.5 million on lobbying. One of its big pushes is to get the Trump     administration to reverse its decision to place tariffs on imported solar     panels and solar cells. In March, Microsoft made the largest corporate     purchase of solar power in history, buying millions of megawatts from     solar farms in Virginia.</p><h>Coleman Mehta / Senior director, US policy, Palo Alto     Networks</h><p>The $2.24-billion Palo Alto Networks, which sells     network-and-enterprise-security products from Santa Clara, California,     brought on Mehta last year to lead its federal interactions. He was     director of legislative affairs for the National Security Council during     the Obama administration. The company provides cybersecurity services for     government clients and issues watch reports on hacker activities that     federal agencies could use.</p><h>Susan Molinari / Vice president of public policy and government     relations for the Americas, Google</h><p>President Trump leaped to Google's defense when the European     Union sanctioned the company for antitrust violations this past summer.     Molinari's connections may have played a role in that. She's a former     Republican representative from New York who, the Center for Public     Integrity reported, personally donated money to Trump's transition. Even     though her company hasn't taken the public shaming that, say, Facebook     has, it still spent $18 million on lobbying in 2017-second only to     AT&amp;T among individual companies.</p><h>Nuala O'Connor / President and CEO, Center for Democracy &amp;     Technology</h><p>The nonprofit CDT, whose mission is to \"advance our digital     rights,\" has been urging lawmakers to roll back the FCC's elimination of     net-neutrality rules installed during the Obama administration. So far, it     has won Senate support, and in July it picked up the backing of its first     House Republican.</p><h>Jeff Ratner / Senior policy counsel, Apple</h><p>Ratner was director for legislative affairs and cybersecurity     policy in the Obama administration before leaving to join Apple in 2016.     As a conduit between the company and the federal government, he's been     especially busy this year thanks to Apple CEO Tim Cook's public stance     against the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p><h>Gary Shapiro / President and CEO, Consumer Technology     Association</h><p>This Arlington trade group lobbies for the industry and puts on     a wacky, well-known annual event in Las Vegas, the Consumer Electronics     Show.</p><h>The Financiers</h><h>Jenny Abramson / Founder and managing partner, Rethink     Impact</h><p>Rethink Impact is a rare venture-capital firm that focuses its     investments on companies led by women.</p><h>Frank Adams / Founder and managing general partner,     Grotech</h><p>Adams's firm, which has more than $1.5 billion under     management, has financed fellow tech titans ICX Media, Op-toro, and     Contactually. He also cofounded Mid-Atlantic Venture Association, a     nonprofit that promotes investment in tech start-ups in the Mid-Atlantic     region.</p><h>Edward Albrigo / CEO, the Center for Innovative     Technology</h><p>CIT is a nonprofit technology accelerator backed by the state     of Virginia. Its funds have put money into more than 200 companies since     2004- investments that helped attract $600 million in additional private     equity. Albrigo has been with CIT only since 2015, but in his first year     he shored up its finances, wiping out nearly all of an $800,000 deficit     that had been covered by the state and returning $710,000 to the     Commonwealth.</p><h>Peter Barris / Chairman and general partner, New Enterprise     Associates</h><p>Barris took a step up from his managing-partner role to become     chairman in 2017. Now, in response to a sluggish market for IPOs, the     venture-capital mega-firm (which had about $20 billion in assets last     year) plans to sell its investments in some 20 start-ups for about $1     billion-opening them up for private investment.</p><h>Jason Booma, Jim Fleming, Patrick Hendy, Monish Kundra, and John     Siegel / Partners, Columbia Capital</h><p>The VC fund founded in 1989 by Virginia senator Mark Warner     made winning bets on Nextel Communications early on and has since put some     of its money into local start-ups including Broadsoft, Millennial Media,     and Digital Signal Corp.</p><h>Steve Case / Chairman and CEO, Revolution</h><p>Billionaire Steve Case is using campaign tactics to tout his     Rise of the Rest fund, a $150-million investment vehicle that backs     seed-stage companies that aren't in Silicon Valley, New York City, or     Boston. He's taken seven bus tours through 26 states and 38 cities in     recent years to meet start-ups that might get some of that     money.</p><h>Chris Darby / CEO, In-Q-Tel</h><p>In-Q-Tel is a nonprofit investment firm, found-ed by the CIA,     that puts money into start-up companies developing technologies to serve     the nation's intelligence agencies. It has funded multiple start-ups that     went on to fetch big acquisition prices-Google bought one firm backed by     In-Q-Tel for $625 million; IBM acquired another for $1.3     billion.</p><h>Mark Ein / Founder, Capitol Acquisition Corp. IV</h><p>After serial investor Ein-who has been involved in the founding     or early stages of six companies that have grown to be valued at more than     $1 billion, including XM Satellite Radio-closed the $2.4-billion merger     between his Capitol Acquisition Corp. III and Cision in July 2017, he     started all over, incorporating Capitol Acquisition Corp. IV and taking     that firm public only months later through a $350-million IPO.</p><h>Scott Frederick / Business- development and federal head, New     Enterprise Associates</h><p>Frederick specializes in introducing his VC-backed firms to     those in government who have needs to fill and money to spend.</p><h>Jeff Ganek, Robert Poulin, and Mark Foster / Cofounders, Blazar     Ventures</h><p>The original employees at Neustar back when it was still a     division within Lockheed Mar-tin, these three took Neustar public in 2005     and have since moved on to form their own VC firm in     Alexandria.</p><h>Carter Griffin / General partner, Updata</h><p>DC's Updata Partners has put more than $750 million of     investments into 40-plus companies, most of them growth firms in the     software-development business. That includes, earlier this year, part of a     $14-million investment Griffin helped put together in Homesnap, a Bethesda     firm that makes a real-estate database and app.</p><h>Ted Leonsis / Founder and partner, Revolution Growth</h><p>This year, his Washington sports teams won the Stanley Cup and     the Arena Bowl. So if the cofounder of the Revolution Growth fund contacts     your tech firm looking to invest, definitely take his call.</p><h>Dan Mindus and Brett Gibson / Founders, NextGen Venture     Partners</h><p>Gibson is one of many LivingSocial alums still working in     Washington, while Mindus has been in investing most of his career. Their     portfolio has a distinctively local flavor, having backed Avizia,     Interfolio, Upskill, and UrbanStems.</p><h>Nigel Morris / Cofounder and managing partner, QED     Investors</h><p>Morris's Alexandria firm filed with the SEC this past June to     raise $150 million for a new investment fund. That will pave the way for     new investments such as those QED has made in Credit Karma.</p><h>Steve Pann / Founding partner, Razor's Edge</h><p>In 1997, Pann cofound-ed Blackbird Technologies, an     engineering, research, and technology company, then sold it to Raytheon in     2014.

Its investments include Altamira, a data-analytics firm in     McLean that's a government contractor with the Pentagon.</p><h>Tige Savage / Managing partner, Revolution Ventures</h><p>Savage helps oversee Revolution Ventures, a portfolio with     investments in local companies such as Optoro and Cava, as well as     Sweetgreen, which moved from Georgetown to Los Angeles in     2016.</p><h>Fredrick Schaufeld and Anthony Nader / Cofounders and managing     directors, SWaN &amp; Legend Venture Partners</h><p>Their firm has backed Cava, Optoro, Frame\u00adbridge, and     Urban\u00adStems-whose CEOs are all fellow Tech Titans-as well as the     nutrition-bar maker Kind.</p><h>Michael Steed / Founder and managing partner, Paladin Capital     Group</h><p>Paladin has made 19 total investments in cybersecurity firms in     the past three years-more than any other venture-capital firm in the     country.

Maybe     not. Stone's bank, which is headquartered in California but has an outpost     in Arling\u00adton, has helped fund Ever-Fi, among other local firms, and he's     constantly meeting with top tech and government leaders as well as newer     start-ups around town.</p><h>J.D. Vance / Managing partner, Rise of the Rest</h><p>Venture capitalist isn't exactly an on-brand title for the     bestselling author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hillbilly Elegy,</emphasis> who's known for sorrowful     ruminations about troubled small towns and the state of conservatism.     However, Vance-who lives in Ohio but spends much of his time in Washington     (his wife is a clerk for Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts)-is     involved in the tech sector, where he oversees Revolution's $150-million     Rise of the Rest fund, which is investing in early-stage companies     headquartered outside of the nation's big tech hubs.</p><h>The Biggest Players</h><h>Ted Colbert / Chief information officer and senior vice     president, Information Technology and Data Analytics, Boeing</h><p>Colbert is part of the small team of executives who work in     Boeing's Arlington office, but his job is a big one.

It's a giant     organization that's likely to be one of the most competitive bidders for     government IT contracts.</p><h>Charles E. Gottdiener / President and CEO, Neustar</h><p>Neustar, in Sterling, has been called \"the most powerful,     well-connected company you've never heard of.\" The 1,800-person firm grew     out of being the initial \"Local Number Portability Administrator\" in     1996-meaning it helped telcos help customers switch numbers between     carriers. But it lost that business, worth about $500 million, after a     2015 FCC ruling granting the LNPA title to Iconectiv, which is partly     owned by Ericsson. That didn't derail a private-equity group from taking     Neustar private last summer in a $2.9-billion deal. Gottdiener took over     this summer after that deal closed.</p><h>Marillyn Hewson / CEO, Lockheed Martin</h><p>This former industrial engineer who has been with Lockheed     Martin for 35 years has built the company into a powerhouse defense     contractor that also runs a burgeoning tech investment fund called     Lock-heed Martin Ventures. That San Francisco-based division looks to back     companies developing \"disruptive, cutting-edge technologies\" that could be     important to Lockheed Martin. Ear\u00adlier this year, Hewson announced that     the company would increase the fund's size, doubling it from $100 million     to $200 million.</p><h>Gus Hunt / Cyberstrategy lead and managing director, Accenture     Federal Services</h><p>Hunt, a former chief technology officer for the CIA, oversees     cybersecurity for government clients for Accenture, which is in the midst     of a rapid expansion of its local cyber workforce.</p><h>Roger A.

A month earlier, as Northrop     Grumman's chief operating officer, she oversaw the $9.2-billion purchase     of Dulles's Orbital ATK, a top defense and aerospace contractor. That led     to the creation of a fourth division of the company, called Northrop     Grumman Innovation Systems. With the purchase, total 2018 sales for     Northrop Grumman are expected to be $30 billion.</p><h>The Lawyers</h><h>Eric Grossman / Partner, DLA Piper</h><p>Grossman came to DLA Piper's Northern Virginia offices from a     firm based in Palo Alto, so you know he knows tech.

The writing may be on the wall.     CAMBRIDGE \u2013 Big Tech is back in the spotlight \u2013 and not in a good way. On July 29, the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook spent more than five hours fielding tough questions about their overwhelming market power from a bipartisan antitrust panel in the US House of Representatives. Is the end of an era approaching?     In many ways, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a boon for tech companies. As Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg all noted in their opening statements at the antitrust hearing, people appreciate the services their companies provide. Recent research indicates that the COVID-19 crisis has deepened this appreciation .    This is not surprising. Digital technologies have enabled workers to do their jobs from home, students to continue their classes while schools are closed, and people to stay in touch with loved ones and entertain themselves while sheltering in place.    Tech companies have been reaping enormous benefits from this shift. In the first half of 2020, while the global economy confronted an unprecedented recession, Amazon\u2019s share price rose by about 40% , fueled by rising online purchases and increased used of cloud services. Zoom\u2019s market value has more than tripled since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, as it became a hub for remote meetings and online socializing.    As for Google and Facebook, they suffered temporary losses from reduced advertising revenues. But they still account for an overwhelming share of the digital-advertising market \u2013 four-fifths in the United Kingdom , to cite one example. Moreover, while Google and Facebook are free to use, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that consumers are effectively paying for their services indirectly through advertising revenues, at a rate of \u00a3500 ($656) per household annually \u2013 a testament to their market power.    It is too early to say how much of people\u2019s lives will move online, or for how long. People may fear COVID-19, but they also suffer from Zoom fatigue . Nonetheless, it seems likely that work and social patterns will undergo some sustained changes, which will have far-reaching policy implications.    For starters, closing the digital divide will become more urgent than ever. Of the many forms of inequality the pandemic is exposing and exacerbating, unequal access to the Internet and digital technologies is among the most prominent.    All the services that have made lives so much better under social-distancing rules \u2013 from remote working to online shopping to streaming services \u2013 are available only to those with access to a reasonably fast and reliable Internet connection and suitable hardware. Many are also receiving health care and accessing government support online, further highlighting the critical importance of universal access.    In recent years, governments have increasingly recognized this imperative. For example, in 2018, the US Federal Communications Commission made closing the digital divide a high priority. And yet about one in 20 people in the United States still have no high-speed Internet connection . In rural areas, about one-third of households are not connected. The figures are similarly bleak in the UK.    Closing the gap will require large-scale investment in digital infrastructure, including broadband connectivity and 5G for mobile services. In both the US and the UK , governments are working to deliver on the first imperative, by making the low-return rural investments that cannot attract private capital. Progress on the second imperative may be more difficult, owing to political opposition to the Chinese telecoms giant and 5G leader Huawei.    But Huawei may be turn out to be the tip of an iceberg, because the current shift online will lead to greater political and regulatory scrutiny of tech giants. For one thing, regulators are likely to pressure telecommunications companies to increase investment, spurring debates about license obligations and pricing (how much companies must invest, and how they will fund it). Past disputes about where along the value chain costs should fall \u2013 from physical network operators to streaming services \u2013 may re-emerge.    But, as the recent US antitrust hearing suggests, the most contentious issue will probably be the market power of digital companies. Even in today\u2019s highly polarized political environment, growing concern about Big Tech \u2013 including the viability of small producers and the economy\u2019s dependence on digital market access \u2013 is broadly shared. And US regulators had already signaled their concern, with inquiries by both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice .    The European Union is far ahead of the US when it comes to regulating, taxing, and constraining Big Tech. The European Commission has pursued multiple antitrust cases against the tech giants, as well as broader initiatives such as the proposed Digital Services Act . Margrethe Vestager \u2013 previously the European commissioner for competition, and currently Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age \u2013 has led the way on this front.    In the UK, the CMA is working to implement the Furman Review , a government-commissioned report on digital-market competition published in March 2019. The panel recommended subjecting strategically important companies to targeted regulation, including a code of conduct that will likely cover issues such as favoring one\u2019s own services, changes in terms and conditions, and pre-notification of all mergers.    It remains to be seen how such efforts will play out, especially in a US headed toward a highly contentious presidential election. But one thing is clear: Though the tech monopolists may capture significant short-term gains from the accelerating shift online, they can no longer avoid the harsh glare of the political spotlight. The writing may be on the wall.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42730070028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GH-DW61-F07F-804D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1083\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Project Syndicate</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That puts them on a par with long-established lobbying powerhouses like the defense, automobile and banking industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  As they have tracked increasing public and political discontent with their size, power, handling of user data and role in elections, the four companies have intensified their efforts to lure lobbyists with strong connections to the White House, the regulatory agencies, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress.</p><p>  Of the 238 people registered to lobby for the four companies in the first three months of this year -- both in-house employees and those on contract from lobbying and law firms -- about 75 percent formerly served in the government or on political campaigns, according to an analysis of lobbying and employment records. Many worked in offices or for officials who could have a hand in deciding the course of the new governmental scrutiny.</p><p>  The influence campaigns encompass a broad range of activities, including calls on members of Congress, advertising, funding of think-tank research and efforts to get the attention of <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>whose on-again, off-again streak of economic populism is of particular concern to the big companies.</p><p>  Last month, the industry lobbying group, the Internet Association, which represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, awarded its Internet Freedom Award to <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump, </nameText></person>the president's daughter and White House senior adviser.</p><p>  ''They are no longer upstarts dipping a toe in lobbying,'' said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. ''They have both feet in.''</p><p>Facebook and Googleare dogged by concerns over their handling of consumer data, harmful content and misinformation. Amazon's rapid expansion has been met with unease over labor conditions and the company's effect on small businesses. Apple's control over its app store makes it hard for new apps to get discovered, some rivals say.</p><p>  Earlier this week, the threat of government action became more real, driving down their stock prices. The House Judiciary Committee announced a broad antitrust investigation into big tech. And the two top federal antitrust agencies agreed to divide oversight over Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Googleas they explore whether the companies have abused their market power to harm competition and consumers.</p><p>  ''Unwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy -- especially when digital platforms control content,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted after the Judiciary Committee announced its investigation. ''The era of self-regulation is over.''</p><p>  The industry's troubles mean big paydays for the lawyers, political operatives and public relations experts hired to ward off regulations, investigations and lawsuits that could curtail the companies' huge profits. The companies all had earlier ties to Democrats but have also worked to develop closer relationships with Republicans.</p><p>Facebook is paying two lobbyists who worked for Ms. Pelosi, including her former chief of staff Catlin O'Neill, who now serves as a director of United States public policy for the social media company.</p><p>  Ms. Pelosi received nearly $43,000 in total donations for her 2018 re-election campaign from employees and political action committees of Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet, Google's corporate parent -- each of which ranked among her top half-dozen sources of campaign cash. She had been a champion of tech companies, which have a robust presence in her district in California.</p><p>  But her support for the industry appeared more tenuous last month, when she said Facebook's refusal to take down a doctored video of her that made her appear drunk demonstrated how the social network contributed to misinformation and enabled Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Googleis paying two contract lobbyists who worked as lawyers on the Republican staff of the House Judiciary Committee. One of the lawyers, Sean McLaughlin, also served as a deputy assistant attorney general under President George W. Bush.</p><p>  ''Having conducted congressional investigations from the inside, Sean is able to counsel clients on how to respond to them from the outside,'' reads Mr. McLaughlin's biography on the website of his firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, which was paid $50,000 by Googleto lobby Congress during the first three months of the year, according to lobbying records.</p><p>  The Washington office of Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has drawn regular criticism from Mr. Trump, is led by a former Federal Trade Commission official, Brian Huseman. And its roster of outside lobbyists includes three Democratic former members of Congress -- Norm Dicks of Washington, Vic Fazio of California and Kendrick B. Meek of Florida -- as well as two former Justice Department lawyers.</p><p>  One of them, Seth Bloom, was a trial lawyer in the department's antitrust division in the late 1990s before going on to work on antitrust issues for the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff. He went on to lobby for Amazon, including in connection with its purchase in 2017 of the grocery chain Whole Foods, which required a review of competition concerns by the Federal Trade Commission. Amazon paid $30,000 to Mr. Bloom's firm to lobby Congress on issues ''related to competition in technology industries'' during the first three months of the year.</p><p>  In that span, Amazon also paid $70,000 to the lobbying firm of a top Trump fund-raiser, Brian Ballard, to lobby Congress and the administration. Top-tier lobbyists in Washington can make millions of dollars a year.</p><p>  One of the lobbyists on the account for Mr. Ballard's firm, Daniel F. McFaul, worked on Mr. Trump's presidential transition team and then briefly as chief of staff for Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida. Mr. Gaetz is a member of a House Judiciary subcommittee that is planning a set of hearings, testimony from executives of top companies and subpoenas for internal corporate documents.</p><p>  Even before Senator <person><nameText>Josh Hawley, </nameText></person>Republican of Missouri, was sworn in at the beginning of the year, the tech companies reached out to him. Mr. Hawley had investigated Googleas his state's attorney general, and the industry saw him as a threat.</p><p>Facebook called, as did Twitter and Google. This winter, in Mr. Hawley's windowless temporary office, the lobbyists for the companies came to meet with Mr. Hawley's aides, arguing that their companies contributed to Missouri's economy and were innovative businesses that did more good than harm for consumers, according to a person familiar with the meetings.</p><p>  ''There is a burgeoning awareness that there is a big problem with the dominance of big tech,'' Mr. Hawley said in a recent interview. ''Big tech may be more socially powerful than the trusts of the Roosevelt era, and yet they still operate like a black box.''</p><p>  The internet giants have learned from the hard lessons of Microsoft, which was caught flat-footed with a sparse lobbying presence in the 1990s when federal antitrust officials called for a breakup of the software giant. Googlehas especially been forced to deal with regulatory issues, both in Europe, where it has been hit with three multibillion-dollar penalties, and in the United States, where it escaped an Obama administration-era Federal Trade Commission investigation without any action being taken.</p><p>  The companies have separately argued that they have not violated antitrust laws. Googleand Facebook say that their services are free and do not harm competitors and that consumers can turn to alternative search and social networking apps. Amazon has said it has a large share of online commerce but only a small fraction of the overall retail market. And Apple argues that the majority of apps in its store are free and that the company rejects only apps that violate its policies on hate speech and pornography, for instance, or try to take too much data from users.</p><p>  ''We have seen these tech companies escape accountability for years,'' said Lisa Gilbert, the vice president of legislative affairs for the government watchdog group Public Citizen. The group, which has called for more user data protections and for breaking up Facebook, published a study last month showing that in the last two decades, 59 percent of top Federal Trade Commission officials who left the agency entered financial relationships with technology interests regulated by it.</p><p>  The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, was paid as a contract lobbyist by Googlein 2007 to win approval for its acquisition of DoubleClick, which had drawn antitrust concerns. He is now facing pressure to recuse himself if the Justice Department pursues an investigation of the company.</p><p>  Federal employees are barred from working on specific issues that affect their former private sector employers or interests, and generally face ''cooling off'' periods of one to two years after leaving government, during which they cannot lobby their former colleagues. But there are all manner of loopholes.</p><p>  Ms. Gilbert's group has called for stricter conflict-of-interest provisions. She said that ''in this moment of enhanced scrutiny, the tech companies are going to be looking for those who have the Rolodexes that matter to try to stop regulation and legislation of the type that's required to protect consumers.''</p><p>  It is hard to avoid the increasing prominence of the companies in Washington.</p><p>  They finance some of the most influential think tanks from across the political spectrum, sometimes making it difficult for critical voices to win funding.</p><p>Googleand Facebook have provided funding to hundreds of influential trade groups and think tanks across the ideological spectrum, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Conservative Union, the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress.</p><p>  In the spring of 2018, Facebook moved into a new office with room for as many as 200 lobbyists, policy experts and engineers for its Washington-based security team. With a full cafeteria, soaring ceilings, wall-size abstract art and concrete floors, the office copies its look from Facebook's Frank Gehry-designed headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.</p><p>Apple is preparing to move into a bigger office, and Googlerecently opened one of the city's biggest corporate lobbying offices.</p><p>Amazon also opened a new office near Capitol Hill, where it regularly hosts policy events with members of Congress. And Amazon recently announced that it would place a second corporate headquarters across the Potomac River from downtown Washington, in Arlington, Va.</p><p>  Last December, in the evening after Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, testified for the first time at a House hearing, the company hosted a holiday party with hundreds of government officials at the trendy Wharf along the Potomac.</p><p>  Scores of lawmakers, including Representatives Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, and Darrell Issa, Republican of California, gathered under neon displays of YouTube and Google. Mr. Issa, who had questioned Mr. Pichai earlier in the day and was within weeks of leaving office, was waiting near one of several open bars for a cocktail.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Lobbyists like Facebook's Catlin O'Neill, above right during Mark Zuckerberg's April 2018 testimony, and Amazon's Brian Huseman, left, are former government employees.

However, these slow-moving processes are still in the discovery phase. I don't expect any of these companies to be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bigger threat is a regulatory knee-capping that is much more likely to take shape in the coming year.</p><p>The internet as we know it was built on one passage of one bill signed by Bill Clinton in 1996. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gave tech companies blanket immunity from liability for anything posted on their sites by third parties.</p><p>Its authors, including senator Ron Wyden, had no idea what forces they were about to unleash.</p><p>The immunity shield they enshrined was the bedrock upon which \"user-generated\" empires such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok were built. They could grow at unprecedented speed, unfettered by fears that fake news and abuse on their sites would come back to bite them legally.</p><p>Wyden, believe it or not, is still in Congress. He is expected to lead an effort to (at least partially) dismantle the bill he wrote almost a quarter of a century ago, when less than 10% of the population was online.</p><p>Hany Farid, a digital forensics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says reforming Section 230 has become one of those rare issues that has gained bipartisan support. He expects a new regulatory regime to open an avenue for product-liability lawsuits such as those faced by, say, a food company that sells toxic products. In Europe and Australia, a similar concept - that social media companies have a \"duty of care\" for what appears on their sites - is at the core of proposed laws.</p><p>\"Nothing else matters until you fix 230, but there is real momentum now,\" Farid said. \"Until these people [tech executives] can get dragged into court and sued to the tune of billions of dollars by any Tom, Dick or Harry, they're gonna keep doing what they're doing, which is stick their heads in the sand.\"</p><p>Below is a selection, in no particular order, of other predictions for 2020.</p><p>\u25cf Netflix will take a dive. After the recent launches of Disney Plus, a wild success, and Apple TV+, a dud, Netflix finds itself in a new kind of fight. Hollywood has, finally, started to catch up with the Silicon Valley streaming giant with offers that are technically savvy (the apps work) but also provide compelling content (in Disney's case, everything from Mickey Mouse to The Simpsons and Star Wars). Others are coming, including HBO Max and Peacock.</p><p>Netflix is spending wildly on new content and is trading at an absurd 106 times earnings. If we start to give up our Netflix deals for alternatives, the stock will suffer. Ditto if a recession takes hold that requires belt-tightening. I'm going to bet that 2020 is the year we hit \"peak subscription\".</p><p>\u25cf Augmented reality has its day. The roll-out of ultra-fast 5G networks, patchy so far, is set to gather pace in 2020. Not only does 5G mean video downloads measured in seconds, not minutes, it also unlocks the potential of augmented reality - the data-hungry technology that places digital objects in the real world. Early applications are expected to be commercial, such as industrial design and healthcare, but I'll bet that some nonsensical bit of fun (\u00e0 la Pok\u00e9mon Go) will wake people up to a technology that is suddenly feasible.</p><p>\u25cf Uber bottoms out. The ride-hailing company, and world's biggest unicorn, had an eventful year, finally floating - then flopping.</p><p>The shares plunged by a third and, as the year ended, founder Travis Kalanick stepped down from the board and sold the last of his $2.8bn in Uber stock. A page has been turned, but Uber has farther to fall. Told that its licence will not be renewed in one of its most lucrative markets (London) and under assault by regulators from California to Germany, it is fighting to survive. It is also unclear if, as it currently operates, the service can ever make a profit.</p><p>The company has said it will break into the black (on an adjusted basis) in 2021, but a lot has to go right. Boss Dara Khosrowshahi has hinted at raising ride rates to balance the books, which will surely lose it some customers, while Uber Eats, once held up as a bright spot, is now a drag, as it dukes it out with rivals in food delivery. Uber started a revolution, but it is heading towards a different future as a far less interesting company in a highly regulated and expensive industry with razor-thin, if any, margins.</p><p>\u25cf Branson blasts off - maybe. The age of space tourism is upon us, with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic targeting 2020 as the year when it will - at last - shoot paying customers into low-Earth orbit. There have been so many delays in the journey to this moment that readers may look askance at such a prediction. However, the company has pulled off two successful test flights of its redesigned \"space plane\", moved operations to a new spaceport in New Mexico, and floated in the US. And if it falls short, Jeff Bezos's rival space company, Blue Origin, has also said it plans to launch commercial flights next year. It's a brave new world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-59004942</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVK-B7S1-F021-6375-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

However, these slowmoving processes are still in the discovery phase. I don't expect any of these companies to be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bigger threat is a regulatory knee-capping that is much more likely to take shape in the coming year.</p><p>The internet as we know it was built on one passage of one bill signed by Bill Clinton in 1996. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gave tech companies blanket immunity from liability for anything posted on their sites by third parties.</p><p>Its authors, including senator Ron Wyden, had no idea what forces they were about to unleash.</p><p>The immunity shield they enshrined was the bedrock upon which \"user-generated\" empires such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok were built. They could grow at unprecedented speed, unfettered by fears that fake news and abuse on their sites would come back to bite them legally.</p><p>Wyden, believe it or not, is still in Congress. He is expected to lead an effort to (at least partially) dismantle the bill he wrote almost a quarter of a century ago, when less than 10% of the population was online.</p><p>Hany Farid, a digital forensics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says reforming Section 230 has become one of those rare issues that has gained bipartisan support. He expects a new regulatory regime to open an avenue for product-liability lawsuits such as those faced by, say, a food company that sells toxic products. In Europe and Australia, a similar concept - that social media companies have a \"duty of care\" for what appears on their sites - is at the core of proposed laws.</p><p>\"Nothing else matters until you fix 230, but there is real momentum now,\" Farid said. \"Until these people [tech executives] can get dragged into court and sued to the tune of billions of dollars by any Tom, Dick or Harry, they're gonna keep doing what they're doing, which is stick their heads in the sand.\"</p><p>Below is a selection, in no particular order, of other predictions for 2020. l Netflix will take a dive. After the recent launches of Disney Plus, a wild success, and Apple TV+, a dud, Netflix finds itself in a new kind of fight. Hollywood has, finally, started to catch up with the Silicon Valley streaming giant with offers that are technically savvy (the apps work) but also provide compelling content (in Disney's case, everything from Mickey Mouse to The Simpsons and Star Wars). Others are coming, including HBO Max and Peacock.</p><p>Netflix is spending wildly on new content and is trading at an absurd 106 times earnings. If we start to give up our Netflix deals for alternatives, the stock will suffer. Ditto if a recession takes hold that requires belttightening. I'm going to bet that 2020 is the year we hit \"peak subscription\". l Augmented reality has its day. The roll-out of ultra-fast 5G networks, patchy so far, is set to gather pace in 2020. Not only does 5G mean video downloads measured in seconds, not minutes, it also unlocks the potential of augmented reality - the datahungry technology that places digital objects in the real world. Early applications are expected to be commercial, such as industrial design and healthcare, but I'll bet that some nonsensical bit of fun (\u00e0 la Pok\u00e9mon Go) will wake people up to a technology that is suddenly feasible. l Uber bottoms out. The ride-hailing company, and world's biggest unicorn, had an eventful year, finally floating - then flopping.</p><p>The shares plunged by a third and, as the year ended, founder Travis Kalanick stepped down from the board and sold the last of his $2.8bn in Uber stock. A page has been turned, but Uber has farther to fall. Told that its licence will not be renewed in one of its most lucrative markets (London) and under assault by regulators from California to Germany, it is fighting to survive. It is also unclear if, as it currently operates, the service can ever make a profit.</p><p>The company has said it will break into the black (on an adjusted basis) in 2021, but a lot has to go right. Boss Dara Khosrowshahi has hinted at raising ride rates to balance the books, which will surely lose it some customers, while Uber Eats, once held up as a bright spot, is now a drag, as it dukes it out with rivals in food delivery. Uber started a revolution, but it is heading towards a different future as a far less interesting company in a highly regulated and expensive industry with razor-thin, if any, margins. l Branson blasts off - maybe. The age of space tourism is upon us, with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic targeting 2020 as the year when it will - at last - shoot paying customers into low-Earth orbit. There have been so many delays in the journey to this moment that readers may look askance at such a prediction. However, the company has pulled off two successful test flights of its redesigned \"space plane\", moved operations to a new spaceport in New Mexico, and floated in the US. And if it falls short, Jeff Bezos's rival space company, Blue Origin, has also said it plans to launch commercial flights next year. It's a brave new world.</p><p>They're gonna keep their heads in the sand</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-156057788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVN-97F1-JCBW-N2TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the leader of the Houses top competition panel, is expected to be far reaching and comes at a moment when Democrats and Republicans find themselves in rare alignment on the idea that the tech industry has been too unregulated for too long. The sentiment spurred a sharp sell-off in tech stocks to start the week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline said the investigation wont target one specific tech company, but rather focus on the broad belief that the internet is broken, he told reporters. In doing so, he pointed out problematic practices at tech giants such as Google, which has faced sanctions in Europe for prioritizing its services in search over rivals, and Facebook, which Cicilline criticized for cloning and acquiring competitors to ensure its continued dominance in social networking.</p><p>Amazon and Apple also could figure into the committees early plans, he said, cautioning the goal is a broader look at the industry.</p><p>In a lot of ways, there was a reluctance in the early days of the Internet to interfere, the Democratic lawmaker said. It was creating so much value in the lives of people that [some felt] you should get out of the way and allow it to flourish.</p><p>Over time, Cicilline continued, people have recognized there are some real dangers here.</p><p>Cicilline said Democrats would hold hearings, seek documents  even by subpoena, if necessary  and depose witnesses that could include the leaders of Silicon Valleys largest companies, who might also be asked to testify publicly. His office said that tech companies, for all their innovations, had created escalating crises, from eroding Americans privacy rights to depriving ad revenue from cash-strapped local news outlets.</p><p>In recent days, the Trump administration has signaled that it, too, has set its sights on Silicon Valley, taking early steps to divvy up future competition oversight of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The efforts by the U.S. governments two antitrust enforcement agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, could pave the way for more formal probes of each companys practices, though the agencies exact interests arent known.</p><p>Still, the early efforts won support even among Democratic presidential candidates, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who long has called for breaking up big tech. Over the weekend, congressional Republicans also praised the Trump administration for turning its attention to the industry. This is very big news, and overdue, tweeted Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.</p><p>Amazon, Apple and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment, and Google declined comment. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The broad, bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley presents the whole of the tech industry with what could be its greatest political test after years of enjoying relatively smooth sailing in the nations capital. Even when world regulators had sought to challenge these companies business practices  Europe has fined Google $9 billion in just the last three years, for example  Washington had remained a staunch ally of Facebook, Google and their peers.</p><p>The 2016 election, however, began to erode that political goodwill, as members of Congress began to realize the extent to which malicious actors could capitalize on social networks with vast, perhaps unchallenged reach to spread falsehoods in real time. A flood of privacy violations, particularly at Facebook, further reinforced for some lawmakers the feeling that big tech giants had enriched themselves on their users personal information  and left people with little option for alternative services to use.</p><p>For a while, tech could do no wrong. They were the font of all innovation, and good things, and progress and democracy, said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that counts Apple and Microsoft on its board of directors. And now the bloom is off the rose.</p><p>Atkinson, however, stressed the industry had produced some of consumers most well-liked services, from Facebooks messaging apps to Amazons lightning fast delivery of goods that previously had taken weeks to order. This is one of the reasons why this is such a hard sell, he said. Most consumers just dont see a problem.</p><p>On Monday, Cicilline called it a monopoly moment for the tech industry, likening his committees investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and their tech peers to past congressional probes of airlines and phone providers, each of which resulted in a fine-tuning of the nations antitrust laws. Over the next 18 months, he said, the House Judiciary Committee and its top antitrust panel would focus their review on crafting their own recommendations.</p><p>The open Internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee. But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications.</p><p>New antitrust scrutiny helped drive down tech stocks Monday. Facebook stock was down more than 7%, Google fell by 6%, Amazon dropped 4% and Apple 1%, a small loss that came on the same day the iPhone giant unveiled a slew of new software updates at its annual developer conference.</p><p>In recent months, a growing chorus of politicians, academics and business leaders have argued that tech giants have accumulated too much power and that they should be regulated  or even broken up. In May, Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, argued in a commentary that it was time to break up the company.</p><p>Critics of Amazon have pointed to the companys dominance of retail e-commerce sales  estimated to be nearly 40 percent of the market, according to eMarketer data from May 2019. Meanwhile, Amazon has expanded into new lines of business, such as groceries, and amassed a massive cloud-computing footprint. Amazon argues, however, that it controls a smaller portion of all retail sales in an industry dominated by players such as Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer.</p><p>For Apple, the concern consistently is its App Store  a portal for games and other software that Apple controls. The iPhone maker long has tangled with companies such as Spotify, a music-streaming app that rivals Apples own offering, over charges that Apple makes it harder for competitors to operate. Apple has denied it, but the European Union is reportedly probing the matter.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/11/biden-trump-travel-to-iowa-trade-insults/\">        Biden, Trump travel to Iowa, trade insults     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/11/biden-trump-travel-to-iowa-trade-insults-2/\">        Biden, Trump travel to Iowa, trade insults     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/11/gop-leaders-admit-tax-cuts-may-not-pay-for-themselves/\">        GOP leaders admit tax cuts may not pay for themselves     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/11/trump-jr-to-appear-in-front-of-senate-committee-again/\">        Trump Jr. to appear in front of Senate committee again     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/06/11/house-votes-to-enforce-mcgahn-barr-subpoenas/\">        House votes to enforce McGahn, Barr subpoenas     </url></p><p>Google long has struggled to battle back EU regulators who feel its search, advertising and smartphone offerings put its competitors at a disadvantage. U.S. regulators previously probed the company but opted against bringing major penalties when they closed the investigation in 2013.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the leader of the Houses top competition panel, is expected to be far reaching and comes at a moment when Democrats and Republicans find themselves in rare alignment on the idea that the tech industry has been too unregulated for too long. The sentiment spurred a sharp sell-off in tech stocks to start the week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline said the investigation wont target one specific tech company, but rather focus on the broad belief that the internet is broken, he told reporters. In doing so, he pointed out problematic practices at tech giants such as Google, which has faced sanctions in Europe for prioritizing its services in search over rivals, and Facebook, which Cicilline criticized for cloning and acquiring competitors to ensure its continued dominance in social networking.</p><p>Amazon and Apple also could figure into the committees early plans, he said, cautioning the goal is a broader look at the industry.</p><p>In a lot of ways, there was a reluctance in the early days of the Internet to interfere, the Democratic lawmaker said. It was creating so much value in the lives of people that [some felt] you should get out of the way and allow it to flourish.</p><p>Over time, Cicilline continued, people have recognized there are some real dangers here.</p><p>Cicilline said Democrats would hold hearings, seek documents  even by subpoena, if necessary  and depose witnesses that could include the leaders of Silicon Valleys largest companies, who might also be asked to testify publicly. His office said that tech companies, for all their innovations, had created escalating crises, from eroding Americans privacy rights to depriving ad revenue from cash-strapped local news outlets.</p><p>In recent days, the Trump administration has signaled that it, too, has set its sights on Silicon Valley, taking early steps to divvy up future competition oversight of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The efforts by the U.S. governments two antitrust enforcement agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, could pave the way for more formal probes of each companys practices, though the agencies exact interests arent known.</p><p>Still, the early efforts won support even among Democratic presidential candidates, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who long has called for breaking up big tech. Over the weekend, congressional Republicans also praised the Trump administration for turning its attention to the industry. This is very big news, and overdue, tweeted Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.</p><p>Amazon, Apple and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment, and Google declined comment. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The broad, bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley presents the whole of the tech industry with what could be its greatest political test after years of enjoying relatively smooth sailing in the nations capital. Even when world regulators had sought to challenge these companies business practices  Europe has fined Google $9 billion in just the last three years, for example  Washington had remained a staunch ally of Facebook, Google and their peers.</p><p>The 2016 election, however, began to erode that political goodwill, as members of Congress began to realize the extent to which malicious actors could capitalize on social networks with vast, perhaps unchallenged reach to spread falsehoods in real time. A flood of privacy violations, particularly at Facebook, further reinforced for some lawmakers the feeling that big tech giants had enriched themselves on their users personal information  and left people with little option for alternative services to use.</p><p>For a while, tech could do no wrong. They were the font of all innovation, and good things, and progress and democracy, said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that counts Apple and Microsoft on its board of directors. And now the bloom is off the rose.</p><p>Atkinson, however, stressed the industry had produced some of consumers most well-liked services, from Facebooks messaging apps to Amazons lightning fast delivery of goods that previously had taken weeks to order. This is one of the reasons why this is such a hard sell, he said. Most consumers just dont see a problem.</p><p>On Monday, Cicilline called it a monopoly moment for the tech industry, likening his committees investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and their tech peers to past congressional probes of airlines and phone providers, each of which resulted in a fine-tuning of the nations antitrust laws. Over the next 18 months, he said, the House Judiciary Committee and its top antitrust panel would focus their review on crafting their own recommendations.</p><p>The open Internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee. But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications.</p><p>New antitrust scrutiny helped drive down tech stocks Monday. Facebook stock was down more than 7%, Google fell by 6%, Amazon dropped 4% and Apple 1%, a small loss that came on the same day the iPhone giant unveiled a slew of new software updates at its annual developer conference.</p><p>In recent months, a growing chorus of politicians, academics and business leaders have argued that tech giants have accumulated too much power and that they should be regulated  or even broken up. In May, Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, argued in a commentary that it was time to break up the company.</p><p>Critics of Amazon have pointed to the companys dominance of retail e-commerce sales  estimated to be nearly 40 percent of the market, according to eMarketer data from May 2019. Meanwhile, Amazon has expanded into new lines of business, such as groceries, and amassed a massive cloud-computing footprint. Amazon argues, however, that it controls a smaller portion of all retail sales in an industry dominated by players such as Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer.</p><p>For Apple, the concern consistently is its App Store  a portal for games and other software that Apple controls. The iPhone maker long has tangled with companies such as Spotify, a music-streaming app that rivals Apples own offering, over charges that Apple makes it harder for competitors to operate. Apple has denied it, but the European Union is reportedly probing the matter.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/11/h-1b-visa-government-unlawfully-delaying-h-4-applications-lawsuit-claims/\">        H-1B visa: Government unlawfully delaying H-4 applications, lawsuit claims     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/11/biden-trump-travel-to-iowa-trade-insults/\">        Biden, Trump travel to Iowa, trade insults     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/11/gop-leaders-admit-tax-cuts-may-not-pay-for-themselves/\">        GOP leaders admit tax cuts may not pay for themselves     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/11/trump-jr-to-appear-in-front-of-senate-committee-again/\">        Trump Jr. to appear in front of Senate committee again     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/11/house-votes-to-enforce-mcgahn-barr-subpoenas/\">        House votes to enforce McGahn, Barr subpoenas     </url></p><p>Google long has struggled to battle back EU regulators who feel its search, advertising and smartphone offerings put its competitors at a disadvantage. U.S. regulators previously probed the company but opted against bringing major penalties when they closed the investigation in 2013. With Facebook, its struggles with disinformation and privacy have fueled calls from a wide array of critics  including Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook  who say it is time to break up the company.</p><p>The Internet platforms have operated with impunity since their founding, producing horrific outcomes for democracy, public health, privacy, and competition, said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Apple, Facebook, and Google and a former adviser to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg who has since become a critic of the companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6101799</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W87-DBN1-F0C5-X013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

David Cicilline, D-R.I.ALAIN JOCARD AFP/Getty Images Dreamstime TNS</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Democrats plan a sweeping review of Facebook, Google and other technology giants to determine whether they've become so large and powerful that they stifle competition and harm consumers, marking a new, unprecedented antitrust threat for an industry that's increasingly under siege by Congress, the White House and 2020 presidential candidates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The probe, announced Monday by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the leader of the House's top competition panel, is expected to be far-reaching and comes at a moment when Democrats and Republicans find themselves in rare alignment on the idea that the tech industry has been too unregulated for too long. The sentiment spurred a sharp sell-off in tech stocks to start the week.</p><p>Cicilline said the investigation won't target one specific tech company, but rather focus on the broad belief that the \"Internet is broken,\" he told reporters. In doing so, he pointed out problematic practices at tech giants such as Google, which has faced sanctions in Europe for prioritizing its services in search over rivals, and Facebook, which Cicilline criticized for cloning and acquiring competitors to ensure its continued dominance in social networking.</p><p>Amazon and Apple also could figure into the committee's early plans, he said, cautioning the goal is a broader look at the industry.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways, there was a reluctance in the early days of the Internet to interfere,\" Cicilline said. \"It was creating so much value in the lives of people that (some felt) you should get out of the way and allow it to flourish.\"</p><p>\"Over time,\" the Democratic lawmaker continued, \"people have recognized there are some real dangers here.\"</p><p>Cicilline said Democrats would hold hearings, seek documents - even by subpoena, if necessary - and depose witnesses that could include the leaders of Silicon Valley's largest companies, who might also be asked to testify publicly. His office said that tech companies, for all their innovations, had created \"escalating crises,\" from eroding Americans' privacy rights to depriving ad revenue from cash-strapped local news outlets.</p><p>In recent days, the Trump administration has signaled that it, too, has set its sights on Silicon Valley, taking early steps to divvy up future competition oversight of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The efforts by the U.S. government's two antitrust enforcement agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, could pave the way for more formal probes of each company's practices, though the agencies' exact interests  aren't known.</p><p>Still, the early efforts won support even among Democratic presidential candidates, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who long has called for breaking up big tech. Over the weekend, congressional Republicans also praised the Trump administration for turning its attention to the industry. \"This is very big news, and overdue,\" tweeted Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.</p><p>The broad, bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley presents the whole of the tech industry with what could be its greatest political test after years of enjoying relatively smooth sailing in the nation's capital. Even when world regulators had sought to challenge these companies' business practices - Europe has fined Google  $9 billion in just the last three years, for example - Washington had remained a staunch ally of Facebook, Google and their peers.</p><p>The 2016 election, however, began to erode that political goodwill, as members of Congress began to realize the extent to which malicious actors could capitalize on social networks with vast, perhaps unchallenged reach to spread falsehoods in real time. A flood of privacy violations, particularly at Facebook, further reinforced for some lawmakers the feeling that big tech giants had enriched themselves on their users' personal information - and left people with little option for alternative services to use.</p><p>\"For a while, tech could do no wrong. They were the font of all innovation, and good things, and progress and democracy,\" said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that counts Apple and Microsoft on its board of directors. \"And now the bloom is off the rose.\"</p><p>Atkinson, however,  stressed the industry had produced some of consumers' most well-liked services, from Facebook's messaging apps to Amazon's lightning-fast delivery of goods that previously had taken weeks to order. </p><p>\"This is one of the reasons why this is such a hard sell,\" he said. \"Most consumers just don't see a problem.\"</p><p>On Monday, Cicilline called it a \"monopoly moment\" for the tech industry, likening his committee's investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and their tech peers to past congressional probes of airlines and phone providers, each of which resulted in a fine-tuning of the nation's antitrust laws. Over the next 18 months, he said, the House Judiciary Committee and its top antitrust panel would focus their review on crafting their own recommendations.</p><p>Romm and Dwoskin write</p><p>for The Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0095926241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-5RK1-JBM5-R3C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Regulators are divvying up antitrust oversight of the Silicon Valley giants and lawmakers are investigating whether they have stifled competition and hurt consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a spate of unusual negotiations, the Justice Department has agreed to handle potential antitrust investigations related to Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will take on Facebook and Amazon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Lawmakers in the House said on Monday that they were looking into the tech giants' possible anti-competitive behavior. That could lead to the first overhaul of antitrust rules in many decades, an effort to keep up with an industry that didn't exist when antitrust laws were written.</p><p>  The question of whether tech companies violate antitrust laws has long been the subject of academic debates and industry griping. But now the industry is in the sights of <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>Democrats running for president, Congress and consumers. Silicon Valley has faced fierce criticism over disinformation, privacy breaches and political bias.</p><p>  Investors pummeled technology stocks on Monday. Shares of Facebook fell more than 7 percent. Google and Amazonshares were also sharply lower, and Apple's stock fell about 1 percent.</p><p>  It does not appear that the agencies have opened official investigations. But the scrutiny from Washington could lead to years of headaches for the companies, raising the prospect of lawsuits to break up companies, hefty fines or new laws limiting their reach.</p><p>  ''This is about how do we get competition back in this space,'' <person><nameText>Representative David Cicilline, </nameText></person>Democrat of Rhode Island, said Monday at a news conference. Mr. Cicilline is the chairman of the House Judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust, which during the next 18 months plans a set of hearings, testimony from executives from top companies, as well as subpoenas for internal corporate documents.</p><p>  Mr. Cicilline said the investigation would focus on major digital platforms. The House committee on Monday informed four tech companies, Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, of the plans. If the House investigation finds wrongdoing, lawmakers will pressure the Justice Department or the F.T.C. to investigate, he said.</p><p>  ''This is long overdue,'' he said.</p><p>  The F.T.C. and Justice Department declined to publicly comment Monday. All four companies also declined to comment, though they have rebutted accusations of anticompetitive behavior in the past.</p><p>  A few weeks ago, the Justice Department and the F.T.C. began negotiations over dividing up the responsibilities for overseeing competition in the tech sector, according to several people close to the discussions.</p><p>  The two agencies often split responsibilities for reviewing mergers. But the recent negotiations show that both agencies were keen on looking into the companies, and that they had probably received complaints from rivals and others.</p><p>  Two people close to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said White House officials were supportive of the agencies' steps toward greater antitrust oversight over tech companies.</p><p>  But the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, insisted there was no direct pressure on the agencies or involvement from Mr. Trump or any top West Wing officials. The officials attributed the moves to Mr. Trump's appointees at the agencies.</p><p>  One of the officials said antitrust issues had not recently been a focus of the president, and had not come up in Oval Office meetings with his economic advisers.</p><p>  Mr. Trump's lack of involvement could be good news for the potential investigations: After he publicly opposed the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, AT&amp;T tried to use his comments in the case as a defense, saying the Justice Department was carrying out a political agenda.</p><p>  ''Big tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,'' <person><nameText>Representative </nameText></person>Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement about the House investigation. ''As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive.''</p><p>  It could be years before regulators take action or Congress passes new antitrust laws. Some consumer groups have called for regulators to break up the companies, and Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, has said the company must be broken up in order to solve its problems. But most lawmakers and global regulators have stopped short of supporting the breakup of any tech company.</p><p>  Talk of antitrust is suddenly fashionable, but efforts by the government to break up companies have been rare, time-consuming and not always successful.</p><p>  The government's case against IBM went on for 13 years before being dropped. The pursuit of AT&amp;T lasted a decade until the company was broken into the seven Baby Bells. The government chased Microsoft for 12 years, from the first F.T.C. investigation until a settlement was approved by an appeals court.</p><p>  One reason for the slow pace: If you're big enough to be drawing antitrust heat, you're big enough to have a lot of lobbyists, lawyers and employees in congressional districts all around the country.</p><p>  In recent decades, a reinterpretation of traditional antitrust theory created a major barrier to regulatory action.</p><p>  Robert Bork, a former federal judge and conservative legal theorist, argued in his 1978 book, ''The Antitrust Paradox,'' that if the government protected weaker competitors, it would make businesses less efficient, raising prices for consumers.</p><p>  His consumer welfare standard -- all that counts is what happens in the consumer's wallet -- has been widely used by courts, including the Supreme Court.</p><p>  This interpretation of antitrust helps big tech companies. It is difficult to argue that consumers are being robbed -- the argument made by the Senate for passing the original antitrust laws more than a century ago -- when companies like Googleand Facebook do not charge users. Amazon prides itself on charging low prices.</p><p>  ''Federal enforcers have a lot of catching up to do,'' said Sarah Miller, the deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a nonprofit that is critical of the giant tech companies.</p><p>  The antitrust law in Europe is more receptive to the recent complaints about large tech companies, and critics of the businesses have pursued actions there.</p><p>  European regulators fined Google1.5 billion euros this year for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. It was the third antitrust move against the company by European officials in three years.</p><p>  European regulators have expressed concerns about Apple's dominance in music. In March, Spotify, the music streaming service, filed a competition complaint with European regulators about how Apple controlled its app store. Spotify accused Apple of unfairly charging fees to its competitors and imposing burdensome rules about marketing.</p><p>Apple has argued that the fees are reasonable given that it operates the App Store. It argues that the App Store also gives Spotify and other companies access to millions of potential customers.</p><p>  Ms. Miller said she wasn't holding her breath that the new government steps would change the American approach.</p><p>  ''Time will tell if this announcement leads to meaningful action,'' she said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-375942190604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-C7N1-JBG3-635C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1228\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html</url><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;
