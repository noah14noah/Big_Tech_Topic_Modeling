Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,[3] Technology can't fix what's broken, because what's broken is our entire system..  The ultimate heresy in today's world isn't religious or political: it's refusing to believe that technology can not only solve all our problems, it will do so painlessly and without any sacrifice.Anyone who dares to question this orthodoxy is instantly declared an anti-progress (gasp!) Luddite, i.e. a heretic in league with the Devil.  Even worse, if that's possible, is declaring that technology is making our lives worse rather than better.There's an entire industry devoted to cherry-picking data to support the One True Faith of Technology: a new miracle drug (never mind the side-effects or the fact that the drug only works on a relative handful of patients), a new energy source that will generate nearly free energy in near-infinite quantities (thorium reactors, though there is not yet a single one that's operational), and the marketing of convenience: this new marketing gimmick will change your life--you can try on clothing in virtual reality, no need to go to the mall!</p><p> Wow! Borrow more, buy more, throw more into the landfill--isn't technology wonderful?  Meanwhile, back in reality, the previous \"miracle drug,\" statins, turn out to be useless in reducing heart disease and actively reduce health via a vast array of negative side effects:Do statins really work? Who benefits? Who has the power to cover up the side effects?[4](europeanscientist.com)  Heavily promoted \"miracle drugs\" make billions of dollars for the corporate owners, whether they actually improve health in the long-term or not. But the tech-will-fix-everything cheerleaders never get around to examining the spectacular failures of Big Pharma, or the catastrophic consequences of smartphone addiction (see chart below), or the impossibility of scaling technology without consuming vast amounts of resources which are already scarce.  This excerpt from my new book explains the absurdity of the tech faithful's belief system:(The book isWill You Be Richer or Poorer? Profit, Power and A.I. in a Traumatized World[5].)  The belief in the ultimate goodness and inevitability of technological advances is often presented as a binary choice: one either believes that technology will eventually solve every human problem, or one is anti-technology and anti-progress.  Suggesting there are limits on technology is thus heretical: for believers, there are no limits.  Let's set aside the false binary choice and ask: are there intrinsic limits to technology, and if so, are we approaching any of these limits?  Technology cannot change the priorities and incentives of those who own it.Technology is only a tool, and people will use the tool to maximize their gain and optimize whatever incentives are embedded in the system. If chopping down irreplaceable tropical hardwood forests is optimized by the incentives to maximize profits, then that's how technology will be applied.  Technology cannot repeal the laws of thermodynamics.Taking a pencil and extending the declining cost of solar panels to zero doesn't negate the physical costs of mining and smelting the ore, shipping the metal to a factory, fabricating the photovoltaic cells, assembling and testing the panels, transporting them to the installation site on vehicles that are expensive to manufacture and maintain, installing the panels, wiring them to inverters and other equipment, testing the system onsite, and returning to perform maintenance and possibly repairs. Since the expected life of the installed panels is 20 to 25 years, the entire expense must be repeated, plus the additional expense of removing and recycling the worn out panels.  The cost of manufacturing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing the panels will never be close to zero due to the intrinsic costs in mining, smelting, refining, milling, transporting, assembling, testing, installing, maintaining and repairing the panels--not to mention getting rid of the toxic components when the panels must be replaced.  Even if robots perform all the work, robots are themselves resource- and energy-intensive.Robots are less like a computer chip (with declining marginal costs), and more like a car, an immensely complex and costly assembly of intrinsically resource-intensive components, electronics, computer chips and millions of lines of software coding.  Autos cost more than they did a generation ago for all these reasons. As cheap-to-access resources such as metals and minerals are depleted, the remaining ores are more costly to extract; regulations require additional safety features, and extremely complex software is increasingly prone to unanticipated errors.  All of these realities apply to autos, robots and every other complex, resource-intensive machinery.  To become more capable, machines become more complex and therefore more expensive to manufacture, test, maintain and repair.In a very telling edit of reality, those extolling the idea that robots will perform all of humanity's work in the near future overlook these intrinsic costs, and overlook the expensive realities of fixing even simple machines when they fail or break down.  Consider the following example: a clothes dryer.  A clothes dryer is basically a metal box containing a heating element and a drum that spins. An electronic board with a digital display operates the machine''s cycles and controls. A dryer is thus far less complex than a robot, especially a robot that is capable of navigating the real world.  The dryer control board is relatively simple:a handful of low-cost commodity computer chips and a few circuit boards. Despite the relative simplicity, these boards fail with alarming regularity. This is also true of the electronics in ranges, washing machines and other appliances. The replacement board for the dryer is one-third the cost of a new dryer. Labor adds another third,so replacing the board is two-thirds the cost of a new dryer.  This reliance on cheap commodity electronic components results in the lifespan of modern appliances being measured in years rather than the decadesof use formerly expected of purely mechanical appliances.  The ultimate cost of adding features (the functional value of which is often very much in question) is far higher than the sticker price of the new dryer. In the real world, technology has increased costs and consumed more resources for extremely marginal improvements (for example, ten choices of drying cycles rather than five).  Since advocates of robots claim robots will soon do all the work of humanity,consider the vast difference in costbetween a robot that operates on a flat factory floor, repetitively attaching one part on a dryer assembly line, versus a robot that arrives onsite in the messy real world and is able to diagnose and repair a broken dryer.  The factory model operates on a flat floor; the repair robot has to navigate an irregular driveway and multiple changes in floor level. It also has to be powerful enough to lift the dryer off the washer (in a stacked configuration), move it to open ground, remove the top, perform the diagnostics, remove the defective board, retrieve the new board, install it correctly, re-assemble the case, test the repaired machine, then lift it back onto the washer.  To repair a dryer onsite, the robot will have to have the strength of a small forklift and a very high level of dexterity and precision motor control. The cost of adding each of these capabilities to a robot is extremely non-trivial, and it won't ever drop to near-zero. Rather, it will only increase in cost even if commodity sensors and chips decline in price. The points of potential failure will proliferate with each new capability and each new level of complexity.  Finally, note that the robot itself is prone to the same kinds of failures that it is designed to repair,but due to its much greater complexity, repairing the repair robot could cost an order of magnitude more than just having a knowledgeable human repair the dryer.  I've performed this exact repair on my own dryer (only a few years old), and other similar repairs on other appliances: a name-brand range that turned on the oven at random times due to a failed low-cost commodity electronic sensor (less than two years old), and an expensive name-brand heavy-duty washing machine, less than a year old, that also failed due to a low-cost electronic sensor.  Complex devices are only as reliable and durable as their lowest-quality component.This is as true of robots as it is for any other device.  Yet even with me performing the labor, the parts for all these appliance repairs were expensive.Many less-handy people would have paid multiples of this already-high cost just for labor, while others would have bought a new appliance and had the (still-functional other than the one failed component) appliance hauled to the landfill--a perfect example of our wasteful and expensiveLandfill Economy.  Consider the hundreds of components in a so-calledsmart homedesigned to save energy and offer more convenienceby networking sensors, cameras, appliances, locksets, servers, controllers, Wi-Fi chips and software.  The projected advances in security and convenience, many of which are questionable (e.g. just how much value is really added by a refrigerator that can order a quart of milk delivered once it detects a low level in the carton?) come at a very high cost in components, installation, service and repairs, because each of the hundreds of sensors, controllers, Wi-Fi chips are points of potential failure--not to mention the risk of unauthorized remote access.  How long will these components last? How long before they must be replaced to function with a new software system? How functional will the system be if even one controller fails?  Given the extraordinary expense of installing and maintain this complex system and the marginal returns in convenience and security,how is this not another system destined for the landfill?  I have yet to find a true believer inrobots will do all the work of humanitywho has ever performed even a single repair of a complex system or device caused by a failed board, chip, sensor or software bug - and done so not on a clean factory floor but in the unpredictable real world.  I've also never yet met an avid believer inrobots will do all the work of humanitywho has designed, prototyped, tested, manufactured, sold, maintained and repaired robots capable of climbing (or landing) on a roof, diagnosing the cause of a failed solar array, replacing the failed part and cleaning the panels, all for a total system cost that's less than the relatively modest cost of a human repair person.  Technology can't fix what's broken, because what's broken is our entire system.For more on this heresy,please check out the first section of my new book (free PDF)[6]    If you have an appetite for more heresy:read at your own risk.  Vaclav Smil: 'Growth must end. Our economist friends don't seem to realise that[7]': \"The economists will tell you we can decouple growth from material consumption, but that is total nonsense. The options are quite clear from the historical evidence. If you don't manage decline, then you succumb to it and you are gone.\"  Ronald Wright: Can We Still Dodge the Progress Trap?[8]: Societies that failed were seduced and undone by what I called a progress trap: a chain of successes which, upon reaching a certain scale, leads to disaster. The dangers are seldom seen before it's too late. The jaws of a trap open slowly and invitingly, then snap closed fast.  Technocracy, Luddism, and the Environmental Crisis[9]: The green movement needs to think about social power just as much as about technology.I believe the roots of the environmental crisis lie as much in the technocratic attitude towards nature expressed in Western cultures and technologies as in the capitalist drive for profit, growth, and accumulation. The power of industrial-capitalism is that its technological, social, and economic values mutually reinforce one another.  The Net Energy Pincer[10]: Prior investment and psychological attachment prevent us from starting again from scratch. Instead, we employ ever more complex (and expensive) work-arounds in an attempt to make systems, institutions and infrastructure achieve things that they were not designed to do (such as keeping people alive into their 90s or providing 24/7 electricity using solar panels).  Climate Change and Technology (via LaserLefty)[11]: The question that isn't being asked: what will the adverse consequences of these (alternative energy) technologies be? Climate change and mass extinction weren't even imagined as consequences of the technologies that produced them. And again, a central drawback of the technologies being developed to address climate change is that they will adversely impact species loss and mass extinction. If the 'solution' to climate change means a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, what is to be gained by implementing it?  To decarbonize we must decomputerize: why we need a Luddite revolution[12]: Big tech claims AI and digitization will bring a better future. But putting computers everywhere is bad for people and the planet. We are often sold a similar bill of goods: big tech companies talk incessantly about how AI and digitization will bring a better future. In the present tense, however, putting computers everywhere is bad for most people. It enables advertisers, employers and cops to exercise more control over us \u20ac' in addition to helping heat the planet.  * * *  Will You Be Richer or Poorer?

The Covid-19 pandemic has seen tens of millions of Americans engage in a gigantic experiment in working from home \u2014 one that looks to be more permanent than anyone might have imagined. Corporation after corporation has announced that they won\u2019t be reopening their offices until mid-2021, at least.  Some commentators are even predicting the death of the office and the end of cities.    But let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Now, more than ever, the issue of where we work \u2014 of place and location \u2014 remains a fundamental question.    Pandemics and other crises can disrupt or change the status quo, but history shows they can also accelerate trends already underway. The question of where to locate corporate facilities has been increasing in strategic importance for a long time. Corporations were facing a rising backlash to their perceived effects on housing prices and gentrification in superstar cities and tech hubs, and from attempts to hoard taxpayer-financed incentives \u2014 a backlash that is only likely grow in the wake of the growing movement for racial and economic justice that has swept American cities since the brutal police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.    Further Reading    In today\u2019s increasingly fraught economic, political, and social environment, decisions about where to locate are becoming more, not less, important. Figuring out who will work from home and who will require actual office space, which offices to prune and which to keep, how they will be configured and shared, and precisely where they should be sited \u2014 in talent-laden superstar cities, in more cost-effective second- or third-tier metros, in downtown urban centers, suburbs or rural regions \u2014 requires more strategic thought, analysis, and planning than ever.    Location today is a central component of corporate strategy. It is not just a cost that can be cut, but a key factor in attracting and retaining talent. What I call \u201clocational strategy\u201d is essential to the ability of corporations to gain competitive advantage. My insights on locational strategy are drawn from both my academic research in economic geography and business location, my personal involvement with numerous high-profile location decisions, and work with high-tech companies and cities over the past several decades.   The New Imperatives of Corporate Location   For the past several years, I have been undertaking research on changing locations and determinants of corporate headquarters. This research , conducted with my colleague Patrick Adler, charts the locations of the headquarters\u2019 units of Fortune 500 companies from the heyday of the old industrial economy in the 1950s to the rise of the knowledge economy today. It identifies a huge shift in the locations of those headquarters and zeros in on the factors that underlie such changing locational imperatives.    Back in 1955, when Fortune magazine compiled its first 500 list, America was still a largely industrial economy, dominated by industrial corporations like General Motors, Mobil Oil, General Electric, and U.S. Steel. Today\u2019s more knowledge- and technology-driven economy is dominated by technology-intensive companies like Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet. Indeed, just 60 of the companies on that original list remain today.    In the old industrial economy, location decisions were oriented to minimizing the costs of three key factors: gaining access to raw materials and transporting them to factories, transporting finished goods to their markets, and labor. Though early industries were based in and around cities like Detroit and Pittsburgh, over time this model came to be biased against these higher-cost locations. As industrial corporations grew into highly diversified, industry-straddling enterprises, they were able to shift their factories \u2014 or what came to be tellingly called \u201cbranch plants\u201d \u2014 from more expensive cities to lower-cost greenfield locations, first in suburbs, then in the Sunbelt, and eventually overseas. To capture those factories, mayors and other local leaders and boosters of aspiring cities used tax credits and other financial incentives. The new profession of economic development emerged to position communities to better compete for and attract corporate investments and of corporate site selection to manage the process and extract maximum incentives for businesses. Over time, incentives packages grew and grew into modern day multimillion-dollar mega-deals.    But the location decisions of high-tech, knowledge-based firms turn on a different set of factors. The driving factor is access to highly educated and skilled people. This new location model is shaped by the simple fact that such talent is heavily clustered and concentrated in certain places. This is particularly true of young talent which is central to knowledge-based industries like finance, media, entertainment and high-technology and which is drawn to places which offer a combination of abundant job opportunities, deep professional networks, and lots of other young people to make friends with (and date). As such, it is skewed toward superstar cities like New York and Los Angeles, and leading tech hubs like San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Washington D.C., and Austin, which serve as talent magnets. Under this model, the ability to attract and retain talent has become the central factor in corporate location.    Our statistical models, which track hundreds of Fortune 500 headquarters\u2019 locations over six decades, confirm the role of talent as the key factor in the geography of corporate headquarters today. Seventy percent of Fortune 500 headquarters are located in metros that rank in the top quartile (25 percent) for talent, measured as the share of the population which holds a bachelor\u2019s degree or more. Another key factor is the size of metro areas. This reflects the fact that larger metros have larger talent pools and more the amenities that attract top talent. Ninety percent of Fortune 500 headquarters are located in metro regions with populations of 1.3 million people or more. The third factor is the presence of international airports. Almost 90 percent of corporate headquarters are located in metros with international airports. Such airports offer global connectivity between talent hubs across the world.    Our research also charts the shift in the cities and metros where corporate headquarters are located. Not surprisingly, the biggest loser since 1955 has been the industrial Midwest, while the biggest gainer by far is the San Francisco Bay Area, the veritable center of America\u2019s high-tech knowledge economy. New York, of course, remained the center for corporate headquarters over the entire period, home to 16% of corporate headquarters from the mid-\u201950s to today. Back in 1955, Chicago was the nation\u2019s second-leading headquarters city, and Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee all ranked high up the list.      Today, the Bay Area, which spans the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas, ranks second with 52 headquarters, quadruple its number back in the 1950s and adding up to more than 10% of today\u2019s total. This tremendous growth vaulted  the Bay Area ahead of Los Angeles and Chicago, America\u2019s second and third largest metro areas. LA\u2019s corporate headquarters declined by nearly 20% over this period. And Chicago, a huge center of corporate HQs in the industrial age, saw an even larger decline of almost 30%. Other Rustbelt cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Milwaukee saw even steeper declines.    San Francisco was not the only metro to add headquarters. The tech hubs of Seattle and Denver also quadrupled their numbers. And, greater Washington, D.C. added 13 new headquarters for a growth rate of more than 300%.  A number of Sunbelt cities also saw significant growth. Dallas and Houston, with roughly 60% headquarters growth each, are now the nation\u2019s third and fourth biggest headquarters centers respectively. Atlanta and Nashville both experienced 50% headquarters growth. And Miami, which has solidified its position as the economic and financial center of Latin America, saw 200% growth in its headquarters. All in all, the top 10 metros account for more than half of all corporate headquarters, the top five for nearly 40%, and just two metro regions, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area, account for more than 25%.   Urban Corporate Headquarters Aren\u2019t Going Away   The new geographic pattern of corporate headquarters reflects the rise of a spiky , winner-take-all geography that is dominated by giant superstar cities and metro areas. While Covid-19 may result in some additional dispersal, it unlikely to dramatically overturn this now well-established corporate locational pattern.    Hubs and Spokes    What is more likely is that Covid-19 crisis will alter the distribution of business functions and locations within leading corporate clusters.  With the rise of remote work, many families and older and more vulnerable people may opt to move to less-crowded suburbs, exurbs, and even smaller cities. A likely outcome is a more distributed hub-and spoke system of corporate location, with major headquarters facilities in urban centers, surrounded by satellite complexes to service remote workers. The changes will ultimately register less in the macro-geography of the country than the micro-geography of its metro and mega-regions.  The depth and extent of this shift will ultimately turn on how long the current crisis lasts. If a vaccine becomes available in early 2021 and things revert back to something approaching the old normal, the changes will be relatively small. But if a vaccine proves elusive and the virus remains an active threat, the changes will be longer-lasting and in some cases permanent.    In either case, the shift to remote work is no temporary blip. Before the crisis hit, about 10 or 12% of the American workforce worked remotely part of the time, with just 2% working from home on a full-time basis. That figure shot up to between 50 and as much as 75% of the workforce as the virus took hold last spring. Roughly 20% of the workforce is likely to continue working remotely on a full-time basis after the crisis, with another third doing so part-time, according to a recent survey .  The ability to work remotely gives people much more flexibility in their choices of where to live. The need for social distancing has made families more inclined to place a premium on space \u2014 both outdoors and indoors, so as to accommodate a home office and a space for online learning for their kids. So some people will be pulled out of cities.    But there are also factors that will push other groups back to cities. Younger workers at the earlier stages of their careers will continue to be drawn to cities because they offer higher pay, extensive professional networks, and deeper and thicker pools of potential friends and mates.  Young, educated people between the ages of 25 and 34 have accounted for roughly half of the population growth in close-in urban neighborhoods (within three miles of the city center) since 2010, and their share is likely to grow. Because they are crammed into small apartments with multiple roommates, they want and need to develop more personal and professional ties, and they feel less threatened by the virus, office space \u2014 whether in a corporate center or a company-underwritten co-working space \u2014 will remain a key amenity or perk to recruit them.    This trend is not lost on major tech companies, a number of which have doubled down on urban locations. Facebook shocked many this August when it  signed on to lease  a whopping 730,000 square feet of office space in the landmark post office building across from New York\u2019s Penn Station. Amazon continues to plan to locate thousands of workers in New York\u2019s iconic Lord and Taylor building which it purchased before the pandemic.    These push-and-pull trends are not so much major disruptions as they are accelerations of changes that were already underway. Net them out while adding in the need to reconfigure for social and physical distancing and it is hard to say just how much the need for office space in central locations will decline. Companies will need to allocate more square footage to their non-remote workers, at least in the short run, and it\u2019s likely that at least half and more likely three-quarters of today\u2019s remote workers will ultimately return to offices full time.    A recent CBRE report predicts that urban hub facilities will be needed to house top corporate functions, as a mechanism to recruit and retain young talent, and to function as \u201cbrand statements,\u201d much as a Fifth Avenue flagship store does for a retail chain. The spokes will house full-time office workers or part-time remote workers who live in the suburbs or second and third-tier cities. The study thoroughly debunks the idea that major companies will abandon or substantially reduce their footprints in superstar cities like New York or San Francisco. As the report puts it, such dense markets \u201chouse deep, diverse and sought-after skills which continually attract employers.\u201d A strategy that accommodates both younger and older workers, whether they are density friendly or density averse, \u201cwould pair well with increased work-from-home formats, and offer optimal flexibility and safety to workers that still want in-office workplace options. By creating thoughtful and engaging satellite offices proximate to concentrations of workers, these offices serve as magnets, attracting employees and promoting culture, collaboration and innovation.\u201d    While such a shift may negatively affect the economies and fiscal capacities of some expensive cities, it will have the side benefit of bolstering suburban and regional economies, reducing commutes and the emissions that flow from them, and creating the possibility for establishing integrated 15 minute neighborhoods in which people can work, live, and raise their families in cities and suburbs alike \u2014 a goal that urbanists have only dreamed about until now.   Location as Corporate Strategy   Deciding where to locate a major corporate facility \u2014 especially a headquarters or a significant branch office in a knowledge or innovation hub \u2014 is among the most consequential and expensive decisions a company can make. Such decisions involve far more than calculations about the costs of real estate and the levels of local wages. They have powerful and lasting effects on a company\u2019s ability to attract, recruit, and retain talent and gain access to vital business networks and markets. When location decisions are taken lightly or done badly, they can be extremely costly and very hard to undo. The potential negative impact to the reputation or \u201cbrand\u201d of a company like Amazon that can come from demanding and accepting excessive incentives can far outweigh its dollar value. Those risks, which have always been substantial, have increased significantly as the nation\u2019s political mood has become more fractious.    Amazon\u2019s much ballyhooed search for a second headquarters, or HQ2, provides a textbook case of the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d of the new corporate location. Announced in September 2017, Amazon\u2019s original Request for Proposal (RFP ) neatly encapsulated the key factors that drive business location today: a large metro with more than a million people, with large pool of skilled tech and management talent, served by interstate highways and transit, and in close proximity to a major international airport. Amazon took the process very seriously, undertaking what is perhaps the most detailed, comprehensive and data-driven site selection process anyone had ever seen, driven by a top-level team of real estate, economic development, and site selection professionals.    Yet, to urban economic development experts like me, it seemed like something of a circus, if not an outright ruse. Corporations almost always know more or less where they want to locate key facilities in advance. More to the point, only a handful of cities fit it Amazon\u2019s own stated criteria. From the git-go, I predicted they would choose Washington, D.C., where Jeff Bezos had recently purchased a $20 million-plus mansion. Not only is D.C. a major metro on the East Coast power corridor, CEOs\u2019 living choices have long been recognized as key factors in where corporations site their headquarters. (I was a member of the board of the organization that submitted Toronto\u2019s proposal \u2014 a position I later resigned when it became clear to me that the process had devolved into a fishing expedition for financial incentives ).    Nonetheless, the \u201c Amazon Idol\u201d competition followed its script to the end: 236 cities sent in proposals, providing detailed data on their economies, talent bases, and available building sites. Amazon whittled it down to 20 finalists, taking an even deeper dive into these cities, sending teams to undertake multiple site visits at each location.  The resulting dataset is a treasure trove that Amazon can draw on as sites for operations, research, warehousing, and distribution facilities in the future.    Despite all that careful planning and data analysis, Amazon\u2019s ultimately called a do-over on its final selection. It pulled out of its Long Island City site in the wake of a firestorm of outrage from local politicians and community activists over incentives and the prospect of further gentrification and displacement. A few months later, Amazon proved my own and other critics\u2019 point when it quietly leased a large amount of space in Manhattan\u2019s Hudson Yards without receiving a nickel of subsidies in return.    Amazon is far from the only high-tech company to engender such community backlash. Protests erupted over the buses that shuttle techies between their urban apartments in San Francisco and Oakland and their workplaces in Silicon Valley. In March of this year, San Francisco considered a measure that would limit the construction of new office space if the city failed to deliver affordable housing. In April, Alphabet\u2019s smart-city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, a company I have worked closely with, pulled out of Toronto , in part because of the pandemic, but also because of the controversy over privacy and what was perceived as its privileged access to public land on Toronto\u2019s lakefront. This occurred even though Sidewalk Labs did not seek or accept any taxpayer sponsored incentives, committed to affordable housing and environmental development, and engaged in extensive community engagement. In July, Seattle passed a payroll or \u201chead tax,\u201d to increase revenues from the city\u2019s biggest businesses and highest earners which are widely perceived as not paying their fair share \u2014 an ongoing issue that was partly responsible for Amazon\u2019s search for a second headquarters to begin with.   How Companies Should Rethink Their Approach   It is time for corporations to rethink and revise their approach to corporate location. They must approach site selection and community engagement in a far less transactional way. They must think of places not as abstract points on a map made of bundles of measurable characteristics that meet certain corporate criteria, but as actual communities where people live, raise their families, and form deep emotional attachments. And they must put their money where their proverbial mouth is, investing in those communities and in the full complement of capacities they need to build and sustain more fruitful relations with the places in which they choose to locate. The backlash will only grow given the deepening anti-corporate, anti-Big Tech sentiment on both the left and the populist right; community concerns over gentrification, inequality, and unaffordable housing; and the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement for racial and economic justice.    In today\u2019s environment, locational strategy is an ever more important of competitive advantage. Based on my research and conversations with leading corporations, consultants, mayors, city leaders, and urban development experts, as well as a decade-plus of teaching about these issues in a leading business school, here are the five key dimensions that underpin a more effective approach to locational strategy.    Say No to Taxpayer-Financed Incentives    Tax-payer-funded incentives amount to a whopping $50 billion or so every year. And individual mega-deals have risen to multiple billions. That\u2019s a lot of taxpayer money that could be spent on education, infrastructure, affordable housing, and other public goods.    Corporate incentives are wasteful and useless. Detailed research shows that they have little to no effect on siting decisions. Companies (or their site-selection consultants) create a fictitious competition to extract maximum incentives and locate where they would have anyway. America is an extreme outlier on this matter. The European Union, for example, strictly limits the tax incentives that jurisdictions can offer. But efforts to develop similar federal, state, and local policies in the U.S. have gone nowhere. In the absence of public regulation, corporations should recognize that it is in their own interest to regulate themselves.    Embrace the Rise of the Rest    Companies need to think more expansively about where they locate. It makes sense for them to develop spokes, not just in the suburbs of superstar cities, but in second- and third-tier cities as well. For all their massive concentrations of talent, superstar cities are increasingly expensive and come with the host of problems borne of inequality \u2014 exorbitant rents, rampant gentrification, extreme inequality, traffic congestion, homelessness, and more \u2014 that I have dubbed the \u201cnew urban crisis.\u201d When it comes to location, too many companies have a herd mentality, following each other into the same locations. It\u2019s time for bold leaders to break ranks and establish new beachheads, spreading their investments wider and helping to build new innovation ecosystems, accelerating what Steve Case dubbed \u201cthe rise of the rest.\u201d    We seem to be reaching an inflection point in the geography of talent where smaller, less expensive cities have a new allure, something that is reflected in the inclusion of cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Indianapolis, Newark, Miami, and Nashville on the list of Amazon\u2019s HQ2 finalists. Those cities and many others are much more welcoming than coastal superstar cities, both because they need jobs and because they are more affordable. As a business leader in one of those cities put it to me, \u201cTell those tech companies to come to the \u2018grateful cities,\u2019 where they will be more welcome.\u201d    Be a Serious and Invested Community Partner    Companies should resist the temptation to play communities against one another, or to treat them as mere points on a map. Locational strategy is not just about choosing places, it is about managing them and investing in them in ways that are a win-win for communities and their residents. They can learn from anchor institutions , like universities and medical centers, which typically work hand-in-glove with local leaders to create housing and amenities and jobs.    A growing number of companies are already using this approach of partnering and investing in their communities, some which I have observed and been involved with:    Prudential Insurance has stuck with its hometown of Newark, New Jersey through thick and thin. Instead of following other businesses to Manhattan or residents to the suburbs, the company stayed in Newark after the devastating riots of the late 1960s, upping its investments in the city.  Right around the time that Amazon launched its HQ2 search, Walmart announced its decision to build a new campus in its original hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Walmart could have easily moved to Dallas, Atlanta, New York, or another superstar location. But instead, it doubled down on its hometown. With support from Walmart, local leaders, and some of the Walton family heirs, Bentonville invested in a host of leading edge projects and amenities aimed at turning the region into an attractive location for world-class talent \u2014 among them the art museum Crystal Bridges and its sister institution The Momentary, a new contemporary art space; an art hotel; a culinary school; a new private school with scholarships for less advantaged students; numerous restaurants and coffee shops; a network of new bike trails; and various projects, centers and schools at the University of Arkansas.  In Tulsa, the George Kaiser Family Foundation have worked to make the city a center of remote work, invested in its award-winning arts district, the Guthrie Museum, and more.  Quicken Loans\u2019 Dan Gilbert has made massive investments in downtown Detroit.    Create a Chief Location Officer    Location decisions can no longer be offloaded to real estate units or outsourced to site selection consultants. Large, rapidly growing firms must proactively manage portfolios of locations that serve different purposes. To ensure they are making their decisions both sensitively and strategically, corporations should appoint a Chief Location Officer at the C-suite level, providing them with a staff that is well-versed in the new economic geography, its data analytic underpinnings, and in the actual management of communities \u2014 not just MBAs with real estate or operations backgrounds, but professionals who have worked in cities and local economic development. Such staff capacity should be, supplemented with advisory groups of former mayors, economic developers, and others who can help companies better understand and manage communities and partner with them on addressing pressing issues.    The building of such capacity should extend to the boardroom. Large companies would do well to recruit former mayors, city leaders, and community developers as directors and to create special committees to oversee location and community management functions.    Locational Strategy as a Centerpiece of Business Education    Business schools have to step up too, establishing courses and curricula which teach MBA candidates the disciplines of location and community management. Locational strategy needs to be taught as a core element of corporate strategy. Here business schools can draw from existing faculty experts in strategic management and real estate, who have developed new insights into geographic clusters and ecosystems.    My course at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management now asks students to consider three key sets of issues. I begin by making location personal, inviting students to consider their own location decisions strategically and in a data-driven way. I then have them work through each of the factors involved in locating and selecting a new site for a startup or major corporation. After that, I engage them in simulated negotiations with a city government or economic development organization, helping them understand the dimensions of conflict and contestation on all sides. In this way, I help them better understanding of multiple sides of location decisions and community development.    It may well be time for an MBA concentration in location and urban development, melding knowledge firm management, corporate strategy, and real estate concentrations. More extensive executive education is also needed, particularly value-added practitioner-oriented programs for senior managers and members of corporate boards of directors.    Given the unprecedented stress, change, and uncertainty of our current moment, location and community engagement must become a central focus of business education and business practice alike.    SM: Is there a conclusion? It feels like this just sort of ends. How about:    America\u2019s economic geography has shifted dramatically over the past several decades, shifts that are both accelerating and changing as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. It\u2019s too early to tell how the landscape will settle. But these changes are and will continue to shape a new corporate landscape. Forward-looking corporations take location more seriously than ever, making site selection and community engagement a centerpiece of their overall corporate strategy. Location, after all, is everything.     If our content helps you to contend with coronavirus and other challenges, please consider subscribing to HBR .

Around Moscow, Yandex is testing a fleet of over 100 driverless cars, work that even the coronavirus was unable to pause. Yandex Lavka (\u201cYandex Shop\u201d), a grocery delivery app that launched in June last year, guarantees deliveries within 15 minutes, faster than anything Amazon offers. One of the brains behind the project, Ilya Krasilshchik, 33, remembers how, during Russia\u2019s turbulent transition to a market economy in the early 1990s, his mother returned from a trip with a bucket of cocoa powder just in case the family wouldn\u2019t be able to get it at home. Now, decades later, Muscovites have excess at their fingertips: Lavka\u2019s most popular item in the summer of 2019 was quartered watermelon\u2014delivered cold, of course.  Yandex\u2019s food delivery cyclists remained ubiquitous on Moscow\u2019s streets even during the covid-19 lockdown.  ANATOLY ZHDANOV/KOMMERSANT/SIPA USA     On a snowy afternoon in late February, just before the pandemic gripped Russia, I turned off of a busy Moscow street into a quiet courtyard. I was meeting Rostislav Meshchersky, the 28-year-old manager of one of Lavka\u2019s so-called \u201cdark stores,\u201d the places where the products ordered online are discreetly warehoused for distribution. Meshchersky led me to an open garage door at the back of the courtyard, which led down into a basement lined with shelves filled with everything from pasta to fruit juice to toilet paper. \u201cI joke with my friends that I know immediately where to go in Moscow in the event of the apocalypse,\u201d he said.     Just weeks later, it wasn\u2019t such a joke. In April, Lavka received some 900,000 orders from Russians stuck at home under quarantine, while customers of Yandex\u2019s overall food services\u2014restaurant delivery included\u2014more than doubled. Although the company took a hit in businesses like ride-sharing when its entire fleet was taken off the streets during Russia\u2019s lockdown, the people stuck at home boosted traffic on the company\u2019s search and streaming video platforms.    But Yandex\u2019s success has come at a price. The Kremlin has long viewed the internet as a battlefield in its escalating tensions with the West and has become increasingly concerned that a company like Yandex, with the heaps of data it has on Russian citizens, could one day fall into foreign hands.     This means running a tech giant in Russia is a delicate dance. On the one hand is the Kremlin; on the other is New York, with investors\u2019 demands that the company maintain its independence. But in a pandemic-\u00adstricken world increasingly concerned with protecting borders and regulating the tech industry, Yandex\u2019s dilemma may not be just a Russian story.   A golden arrangement   Yandex\u2014short for \u201cyet another indexer\u201d\u2014didn\u2019t always have its fingers in everything. After getting its start in 1997, the company for years vied for local search-engine supremacy with Rambler, another Russian company.     In the end, Rambler became the Yahoo to Yandex\u2019s Google. But Google itself soon entered the market, and while Yandex had an edge by rooting its search algorithm in the particulars of the Russian language, its California rival began to catch up. \u201cAbout half a year before Google went public, it made an offer to buy Yandex, and I have to say that we were looking at that offer very seriously,\u201d Leonid Boguslavsky, one of the company\u2019s first investors, told me.     The offer was made in 2003. But one of Yandex\u2019s cofounders, Ilya Segalovich, said, \u201cLet\u2019s fight,\u201d Boguslavsky recalled. Though Segalovich died in 2013 after a bout with stomach cancer, the fight continues to this day: while Google has periodically overtaken Yandex, the Russian firm currently has about 59% of Russian search traffic to Google\u2019s 39%.     The same year Segalovich died, Yandex hired Greg Abovsky, a Ukraine-born, Harvard Business School\u2013educated hedge fund analyst who got his start with Morgan Stanley in New York. \u201cWe had a realization right around the time I got here that search is going to slow down at some point,\u201d says Abovsky, who now serves as both CFO and COO. When he joined, advertising from search accounted for around 99% of the company\u2019s revenue. Today it\u2019s about 64%, and total revenue grew from $1.2 billion in 2013 to $2.8 billion in 2019.    But as Yandex developed into the dominant player in the Russian tech market, it also inevitably came under the watchful eye of the authorities.     One of the first moments was in August 2008, when Russia fought a five-day war with neighboring Georgia. As the conflict played out, Yandex News featured Russian-language articles covering both sides of the divide. The next month, according to journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan in their book The Red Web , two Kremlin officials visited Yandex\u2019s headquarters. One was Vladislav Surkov, the deputy chief of Russia\u2019s presidential administration\u2014the man who coined the Orwellian term \u201csovereign democracy\u201d to describe a Russian system of governance that brooks no foreign meddling in its affairs.     In 2008, when Russia fought a five-day war with Georgia, Yandex News featured Russian-language articles covering both sides of the divide. The next month, two Kremlin officials visited Yandex\u2019s headquarters.    Lev Gershenzon, the director of Yandex News at the time, was given the task of explaining to the official visitors how the service worked. According to the book, he recalled showing screenshots of articles that the aggregator\u2019s algorithm had selected as top stories. Surkov interrupted. \u201cThis is our enemy,\u201d he said, pointing to a liberal outlet. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do not need!\u201d    The company promised from then on to maintain an open line to the Kremlin, though Gershenzon said he would always reiterate that an algorithm, not a person, chose the top news. Still, he didn\u2019t always agree with how the line of communication was maintained.    \u201cVolozh and I went to the presidential administration building several times and I said to him, \u2018Listen, you have such a powerful business\u2014why do you go to them? If it\u2019s really needed, let them come to you,\u2019\u201d Gershenzon recalled in Holy War , a documentary miniseries about the Russian-language internet. \u201cEven a geek like me knew that if you bend over for them they\u2019ll never let you bend back upright again.\u201d    That same year, Yandex fought off a potential takeover by Kremlin-linked oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who lobbied for President Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s support on national security grounds. In 2009, to satisfy government interests, Yandex handed Russia\u2019s largest lender, the state-owned Sberbank, a so-called golden share, which allowed the bank to veto transactions involving more than a quarter of Yandex\u2019s stock. For a decade that arrangement appeased the Russian authorities\u2014until it no longer did.   The tightrope walk   Last May, Russia passed a law to create a so-called \u201csovereign internet,\u201d a state-owned communications infrastructure that would allow the country to cut itself off from the global internet while remaining online in a bubble of Russian-owned services. The law requires internet service providers to install equipment provided by the government for counteracting broadly defined \u201cthreats\u201d to the internet\u2019s stability and integrity, and gives the authorities sweeping powers to take control of the network if such threats appear. Over tea at his offices one afternoon last winter, Igor Ashmanov, who was the director of Yandex\u2019s rival Rambler for a time in the early aughts and now is a proponent of the sovereign internet on state television and in government hearings, laid out its purpose.    \u201cImagine you live in a small village near a city that provides your electricity, and the mayor of the city has said that you are his enemies and that if he can harm you, he will,\u201d Ashmanov told me. \u201cYou might decide to buy a generator to make sure your electricity keeps running in case this crazy mayor turns off the switch. This is what the sovereign internet is about.\u201d    Perhaps more important to the Kremlin, the sovereign internet would also give Russia more control over what its own citizens can see online. In 2011 the Arab Spring, buoyed by social media, swept across the Middle East. That December, after Vladimir Putin announced he would run for president once again following an interim stint as prime minister, mass protests\u2014planned on Facebook\u2014rocked Russia. In the wake of the demonstrations, the Kremlin began to see foreign tech companies as tools used by other governments to meddle in its affairs. Putin himself vocalized those concerns at a press conference in 2014, when he described the internet as a \u201cCIA project\u201d and implied that Yandex itself had been \u201cpressured\u201d to include foreigners in its management and was registered overseas \u201cnot only for tax purposes but for other reasons.\u201d (The parent company is incorporated in the Netherlands, and six of the 12 current board members are non-Russians, including John Boynton, the chairman, who is based in Massachusetts.)    That fear of foreign interference has only intensified over the years. During a government hearing on national security in 2018, Ashmanov described Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter as American weapons trained against Russia. \u201cWhat the Americans could do with a company like Yandex in their hands is something I don\u2019t even want to think about,\u201d Ashmanov told me.    As the ground shifted under its feet, Yandex struggled to keep its balance, according to Boynton, the board chairman. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can to steer clear of politics,\u201d he said in a phone interview. And yet, he added, the company found that it was increasingly getting \u201cdragged into areas where we don\u2019t necessarily want to be.\u201d    Things came to a head on a Thursday morning in October 2018, when rumors leaked that Sberbank was in talks to buy up to a 30% stake in Yandex to protect the company from \u201cpotential trouble.\u201d When trading opened up in New York, its shares plummeted 9.4%, losing over $1 billion in market value, over fears that the state lender could take control of the company. \u201cThat was the moment when we realized that there was something bigger afoot,\u201d Boynton recalled.     The next day the company lost another $1 billion. At an emergency meeting that went into the early hours of Saturday, the Financial Times reported, Volozh decided not to pursue the Sberbank deal.     Yandex began talks with Putin\u2019s administration over a new governance structure, but the pressure on it continued to intensify. In June 2019, a little-known lawmaker, Anton Gorelkin, introduced a bill to limit foreign ownership in companies that the Russian government deemed \u201csignificant information resources.\u201d Outside investors would be allowed to own only 20% of such companies\u2014a severe blow to Yandex, which had 85% of its shares trading on US markets. When the Kremlin came out in support of Gorelkin\u2019s law a few months later, fears in New York wiped another $1.5 billion off Yandex\u2019s valuation in a single day.     In November last year, after 13 months of grueling negotiations, Yandex announced a solution. It would hand over Sberbank\u2019s golden share\u2014that veto power over major transactions\u2014to a newly formed \u201cpublic interest foundation\u201d with close government ties. The veto would also be beefed up to include deals and transactions relating to intellectual property or the transfer of Russian users\u2019 data. Although the new foundation would have 11 seats on its board, only three would belong to Yandex; the rest would be divided up among influential business groups and state-affiliated universities. Perhaps most important from the Kremlin\u2019s perspective, the new foundation would be able to block Yandex from entering into agreements with any foreign government.    That seemed to take the heat off. Gorelkin said he would take his law back to the drawing board. Days later, the Russian parliament passed a law requiring Russian tech to be automatically preloaded onto devices sold in Russia, a move that analysts calculated would boost Yandex\u2019s valuation by $1.4 billion. A few weeks after that, Putin, who had criticized Yandex\u2019s foreign ties a few years earlier, praised its projects with foreign partners and spoke positively of a closed-door meeting with its senior management.     Yet even if the Kremlin seems to have been appeased, not everyone is. Power in Russia\u2019s government is split between rival groups, with Putin mediating between them. For the constituency known as the siloviki \u2014officials with ties to law enforcement\u2014the Yandex foundation was seen as a half-victory, says Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of a political analysis site, R.Politik. \u201cOn the one hand, they see that Yandex is indirectly beholden to the government,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s purely technical. Yandex won\u2019t just fulfill any and all demands. And if the confrontation with the West keeps escalating, [the authorities] may rethink this arrangement.\u201d    When I spoke with Boynton last winter after the dust had settled, he was in a buoyant mood. But he also noted that things could quickly change again. \u201cIn Russia,\u201d he said, \u201cnothing is guaranteed.\u201d   A template for Big Tech?   If the siloviki see Yandex as an unreliable collaborator, liberal critics see increasing signs that it is in the pocket of the authorities. In late February, for example, a policeman accused of planting drugs on an investigative reporter said he had found the journalist\u2019s address by asking Yandex Taxi to provide it. Yandex responded that it always yields to requests by security services to \u201chelp save lives,\u201d though Roskomsvoboda, an anti-\u00adcensorship group, pointed out that it is not always legally required to do so.     As the pandemic grew, questions about the company\u2019s independence became only more pointed. In early April, news surfaced that Moscow authorities were considering surveilling foreign tourists via their cell-phone data once borders opened back up again\u2014and that Yandex might develop the tool. The company denied the claim.   Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh (left) with President Vladimir Putin, who was visiting Yandex\u2019s offices in 2017 to mark its 20th anniversary.  ITARTASS NEWS AGENCY/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO     Then, when critical comments from opposition activists began popping up next to government buildings in Yandex Navigator, as a sort of digital alternative to street protests, Yandex deleted the messages, saying they were off-topic. Finally, one evening in late April, some internet users noticed that searches on Yandex for opposition leader Alexei Navalny were returning mostly negative content. Yandex apologized, saying that it was an \u201cexperiment\u201d shown only to a small number of users. One Russian commentator, Alexander Plushev, noted that such testing is common on all tech platforms, but he added: \u201cAny incident with Yandex is now interpreted through the prism of its control by the authorities.\u201d    If Yandex capitulates too much to state control, it risks losing its most prized asset: its talent. \u201cI always say that my main competitors are [Moscow airports] Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo,\u201d says Misha Bilenko, who heads Yandex\u2019s Machine Intelligence and Research division.    In February, a policeman accused of planting drugs on an investigative reporter said he had found the journalist\u2019s address by asking Yandex Taxi to provide it.    Bilenko himself spent 23 years in the United States, including a decade at Microsoft, before returning to Russia several years ago. What drew him back, he says, was the access to so many different resources within Yandex and the opportunity to help improve the lives of Russians en masse. But as one employee who asked to speak anonymously told me, Yandex would lose that type of draw and power if the government tried too hard to tame it. \u201cWe have a lot of progressive people here,\u201d the person said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t like what we see, we\u2019ll leave.\u201d     Today Yandex, at least publicly, is claiming that all is well. Its concessions to the Kremlin could have been much bigger. They\u2019re also ones that others may soon consider. \u201cWhat Yandex has done isn\u2019t only relevant within the context of Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d Bloomberg columnist Leonid Bershidsky argued last year. \u201cIt could be seen as a template for Big Tech.\u201d     Like Yandex, Bershidsky continued, companies such as Google or Facebook could set up quasi-\u00adautonomous governance structures with the right to veto certain decisions. \u201cIf such a structure can win approval even from an authoritarian regime such as the Russian one \u2026 it could probably satisfy most Big Tech critics in democracies, too,\u201d he wrote.     Indeed, in May of this year Facebook named the first members of  its \u201coversight board\u201d as a response to anger over its opaque content moderation process. The body is stacked with legal and human rights luminaries who can review and overturn some of the platform\u2019s decisions. Though the board has nothing like the power of Yandex\u2019s public interest foundation, it was a big concession from a company that has always fiercely defended its control over what goes on its platform.     With politicians on both ends of the US political spectrum calling for increasing regulation of Big Tech, such moves are likely to keep happening. The kind of flexibility Yandex has had to learn may prove essential for companies that want to not only survive but flourish.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42873868974</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-WB11-F07F-82JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Technology Review</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CZKS</classCode><className>YANDEX NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The comic geeks, nerds, and hero aficionados are beaming with enthusiasm and glee that all their favorite characters are finally in one house.</p><p>However, there are far more less-benign mergers.</p><p>In 2018, the Tribune Media Company and Sinclair Broadcasting Company's merger dead in the water. If the merger had passed, Sinclair Broadcasting would own 73 percent of the market.</p><p>The merger was prevented this time around, and there are no safeguards or provisions, or regulations that can stop one company from owning a significant portion of the media. This is a problem that will have fewer and fewer voices heard as the years progress.</p><p>If this merger had been allowed to move forward, it would have created an echo chamber of anti-science. The broadcasting company has an anti-science agenda as it limits the angles on scientific news segments.</p><p>In 2015, reporter Suri Crowe put together a segment of the warnings of climate change. The executives were not too keen on Crowe's scientific approach. Len Stevens, the former news director, stated, \"clearly laid out the argument that human activities cause global warming, but had nothing from the side that questions the science behind such claims and points to more natural causes for such warming.\"</p><p>This a clear bias, as 99 percent of scientists of the world all agree with climate change being man-made. To say otherwise is to be dishonest and politically motivated.</p><p>Another Sinclair bias rose in the wake of the impeachment proceedings. Boris Epshteyn hosts \"must-air\" segments for the broadcasting corporation, which are usually segments of propaganda and misinformation campaigns.</p><p>Epshteyn segments are usually filled with unsubstantiated political talking points passed as truth. Epshteyn is trying to describe the impeachment proceedings as weak and trying to get his audience members to view the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky more damming for Vice President Joe Biden than for Trump.</p><p>Propaganda is commonplace in the United States. However, there should be an effort to limit the amount of propaganda being aired. Sinclair did not garner 73 percent yet nothing is stopping them from trying again with another merger.</p><p>Cross-media-ownership is a problem that needs to be addressed as the problem it truly is. The reason this the United States seems divided is that there are too many homes with Sinclair stations broadcasting misinformation. This is a problem that Americans are going to have to face soon.</p><p>The decision will be whether the truth or a political-talking-point will be the standard of public discourse. Politics is not equal to the truth in any way and having political-talking-points as the standard has led us to a world that is burning, and people who continue to pretend everything is going to be fine. The night is near.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4266619</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5D-XDB1-JBSN-302Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Rebel Yell: University of Nevada - Las Vegas</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00023Y1</classCode><className>TRIBUNE MEDIA CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515112 RADIO STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>TRCO (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Las Vegas</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NV</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In 2015, Britain\u2019s deputy prime minister led his Liberal Democrats to a spectacular electoral wipeout, going from 57 members of Parliament to eight. Two years later, he lost his own Sheffield constituency and disappeared \u2014 or so we thought \u2014 from public life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he was back last week as the vice president of Facebook, explaining why the company had \u201cremoved a number of ads from Donald Trump.\u201d</p><p>I am all in favor of people doing well for themselves, and who can blame Cleggie, once my colleague in the European Parliament, for swapping the gray skies of Sheffield for a $9 million mansion in Silicon Valley? Still, it is worth asking why Facebook and other tech giants are prepared to offer multimillion-dollar salaries to ex-pols as part of their colossal lobbying efforts.</p><p>The answer, of course, is that Big Tech is now very much in the politics business. Last week, for example, it emerged that Google had threatened to demonetize the Federalist, a tiny, online conservative magazine, because NBC had objected to some of the remarks posted in its comment section. (Hilariously, Google insists that it cannot be held liable for its own content since it does not curate it, but it is unwilling to apply the same logic to the Federalist's comments section.)</p><p>Ten years ago, perhaps even five years ago, a news item like that would have been shocking. Now, it is just the latest in a series of political stories involving social media companies and other online behemoths. The days when Google was a laid-back, laissez-faire, \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d outfit are long gone. Facebook and YouTube, similarly, have started weeding out content they dislike on political grounds \u2014 including, for example, content criticizing the coronavirus lockdowns.</p><p>You can\u2019t entirely blame Google, Facebook, or YouTube. As they grew larger, politicians started wanting to tax and regulate them. It is an act of self-defense to hire lobbyists \u2014 including politicians who, like Clegg, brought their contacts with current rule-setters.</p><p>Once it starts, though, corporatism almost always turns into a racket. I remember from my days in the European Parliament how active these companies were in Brussels, where a combination of control-freakery and anti-Americanism had created a hostile regulatory environment. Almost every U.S. tech colossus had at one time or another found itself on the receiving end of hostile regulations from the European Union, including Microsoft, Google, and Apple. </p><p>They did not respond, as you might have expected, by lobbying against all such regulations. On the contrary, they would sometimes push for more stringent rules, knowing that they would find it easier than their smaller rivals to meet the compliance costs. An initially adversarial relationship between governments and big business thus became symbiotic, as both worked to keep out new competitors. That, in a nutshell, is what we mean by crony capitalism.</p><p>It works both ways. Politicians can use laws to reward or threaten particular corporations. But some of these corporations are now powerful enough to level equivalent threats against politicians.</p><p>Consider, as a hypothetical illustration, the following scenario. Google knows a great deal about you. Your search history, even if you are uninterested in politics, will indicate, with perhaps an 80% accuracy rate, how likely you are to vote in November and for whom. You don\u2019t need to have looked at any political websites. A good algorithm will be able to infer your opinions from apparently unrelated traits, such as what you order from Amazon, where you book your vacations, and whether you own a pet. </p><p>Suppose that on Election Day, Google changed its doodle, the image on its homepage, to \u201cGO VOTE.\u201d But suppose that it did so only for the 2 million voters whom it knew to be likely to vote for a particular party and to be most in need of a prompt. </p><p>No wonder politicians handle it gently.</p><p>Whose fault is all this? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s yours. You allowed the Big Tech companies to get their hands on your data in the first place. You say you don\u2019t like it, but in practice, you don\u2019t really care.</p><p>How do I know you don\u2019t care? Well, if you\u2019re reading these words online, there is a good chance that you have recently been asked to click \u201cI agree\u201d in order to access something or other. Did you read the blurb, or did you just scroll straight down and click? I thought so. </p><p>If you resent the tie-up between Big Tech and big government, I sympathize. Cartels are never good news. But it is you \u2014 we, all of us \u2014 who enabled this cartel in the first place.</p><p>Photo Caption:Big Tech, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2437554148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-FV71-DY0W-43NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

While the ability to do anything, from anywhere has its benefits, including convenience and constant connectivity, there&amp;#x2019;s also a dark side: criminals waiting to exploit your most personal, sensitive information. In fact, the total number of personal records exposed in data breaches more than doubled over 2018, compared to 2017.&amp;#xA0;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The value of data has led to new legislation intended to protect information shared and stored online. Europe&amp;#x2019;s GDPR became binding in May 2018, and a variant in California is slated to become effective in 2020, complicating matters for companies that limited their European data presence in hopes of avoiding GDPR. In addition, the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), intended to democratize access to data and simultaneously protect it through Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), will come into effect in Europe in September 2019.</p><p>Why it&amp;#x2019;s high time we regulated Big Tech<br/>The GDPR paradox: how data regulation creates revenue streams<br/>Google fined &amp;#x20AC;50m by French data regulator<br/>A closer look at the unintended consequences</p><p>Perversely, both GDPR and PSD2, which were created to protect customers and their data, actually introduce new risks and complications for businesses operating online. Both sets of regulations were born to protect data (or in the case of PSD2, increase data security as a result of open banking) and consumers&amp;#x2019; rights over their own data. But today&amp;#x2019;s payments ecosystem is intricate and complex, and it is hard for legislation to predict and guard against the moves criminals will take in reaction to it.</p><p>With GDPR, consumers can request deletion of their data at any time. But for fraudsters, this means they can disguise themselves as legitimate actors and demand all data on their personas be removed, then present themselves to online businesses as blank slates every time. Being able to identify fraudsters as returning bad actors is vital to all fraud fighting efforts, and not having previous visits to draw on would be a serious handicap to proper prevention.</p><p>In the case of PSD2, an unintended consequence is similar to the unfortunate side effect of EMV introduction. In that case, fraudsters were successfully deterred from carrying out card present fraud, and shifted online to card not present fraud instead. With PSD2, making fraud more difficult at the point of transaction within EU transactions is likely to shift fraud to other geographies and attack points. Most online businesses are global, and those that sell outside of the EU, as well as within it, will have to be particularly careful of non-EU transactions once PSD2 kicks in. Criminals who stop using European data won&amp;#x2019;t stop stealing; they&amp;#x2019;ll just start using data from elsewhere.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Know your ecosystem</p><p>To combat the unintended risks that GDPR and PSD2 bring in their wake, companies need to develop a deep understanding of their own ecosystem and the users who are part of it. Only a full comprehension of good and bad actors, and the connections both hidden and overt between them, can provide the necessary framework for protecting an online business.</p><p>A rich understanding of your ecosystem mitigates the GDPR risk because the legislation does not require you to delete the information of known criminals. If your system is accurate enough to detect fraudsters reliably, and to make the right connections to recognize them when they return in different guises, then you won&amp;#x2019;t need to delete their data &amp;#x2014; even on request. In fact, such a request would simply become additional, valuable information.</p><p>It isn&amp;#x2019;t enough to be able to match obvious data points such as addresses, names or even IP addresses. Your system needs to be able to match behavioral data and patterns and use cyber intelligence to piece together obfuscated elements. Only then can you identify malicious actors continuously, even when they have changed everything they can in their digital appearance.</p><p>A similar level of sophistication and sensitivity is necessary for dealing with the &amp;#x201C;attack shift&amp;#x201D; that will likely follow PSD2. In order to guard against the risk of geographical fraud changes, your system must be sensitive to the genuine behaviors of different geographical areas, and be able to flag when a user does not match the expected norms for their location. Different industries and businesses have different behaviors, and so it is vital that your system be attuned to your own ecosystem.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Make sure your customers and accounts are protected by a system that knows your customer base just as well as you do. It requires flexibility and continuous innovation, and an ongoing effort to stay ahead of criminals, and abreast of the evolution in customer behaviors and expectations. However, with constant, accurate, informed protection, you can maintain compliance, security, and customer trust.</p><p>Iftah Gideoni, CTO of Forter</p><p>This is everything you need to know about GDPR<br/>Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/41/155774417937.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/232/814/41/155774417937.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-144316040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3M-0GB1-F11P-X1JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.</p><p>Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.</p><p>Now he began to think about tech companies a lot. He started reading about online tracking and data mining. He discovered that the United States, unlike some countries, has no single, comprehensive law regulating the collection and use of personal data. The rules that did exist were largely established by the very companies that most relied on your data, in privacy policies and end-user agreements most people never actually read. Mactaggart began to scrutinize these policies closely, the way he read loan contracts and pored over offering plans. He learned that there was no real limit on the information companies could collect or buy about him \u2014 and that just about everything they could collect or buy, they did. They knew things like his shoe size, of course, and where he lived, but also roughly how much money he made, and whether he was in the market for a new car. With the spread of smartphones and health apps, they could also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb/AP-Exclusive:-Google-tracks-your-movements,-like-it-or-not\">track his movements</url>or whether he had gotten a good night\u2019s sleep. Once facial-recognition technology was widely adopted, they would be able to track him even if he never turned on a smartphone.</p><p>All of this, he learned, was designed to help the real customers \u2014 advertisers \u2014 sell him things. Advertisers and their partners in Silicon Valley were collecting, selling or trading every quantum of Mactaggart\u2019s self that could be conveyed through the click of a mouse or the contents of his online shopping carts. They knew if he had driven past that Nike billboard before finally buying those Air Force 1s. A website might quote him a higher price for a hair dryer <url normalizedValue=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323777204578189391813881534.html#articleTabs%3Darticle\">if he lived in a particular neighborhood</url>, or less if he lived near a competitor\u2019s store. Advertisers could buy thousands of data points on virtually every adult in America. With Silicon Valley\u2019s help, they could make increasingly precise guesses about what you wanted, what you feared and what you might do next: Quit your job, for example, or have an affair, or get a divorce.</p><p>And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.</p><p>Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201d</p><p>Over evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201d</p><p>Almost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.</p><p>For most of its relatively brief existence, Silicon Valley has been more lightly regulated than almost any other major industry. The technology that drove the business was complex, and few lawmakers wanted to be seen as standing in the way of a new kind of wealth creation, one that seemed to carry no messy downsides like pollution or global economic collapse. Most of the biggest tech companies could simply ignore Washington \u2014 until they grew too big for Washington to ignore. When regulators finally threatened to intervene, the companies did what they were best at: They scaled up, this time not with software and servers but with phalanxes of lobbyists and lawyers.</p><p>Microsoft had virtually no Washington presence before the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in the 1990s. As recently as 2003, Google retained just two outside lobbyists in Washington; over the next decade or so, as it became the world\u2019s dominant search engine, the company became a Beltway heavyweight, hiring lobbyists, wooing regulators and funding the research behind hundreds of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.googletransparencyproject.org/articles/google-academics-inc\">Google-friendly studies</url> on competition, copyright law and other topics. By last year, Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, was spending more money on lobbyists than any other corporation in America.</p><p>Facebook, a decade younger than Google, built its political apparatus twice as fast, as if observing a kind of Moore\u2019s Law of influence-peddling. When it went public in 2012, the company had 900 million users \u2014 less than half its current size \u2014 and earned a relatively modest profit of $53 million. Over the next several years, Facebook simultaneously became one of the world\u2019s biggest collectors of personal data and a powerful presence in Washington and beyond. It acquired Instagram, a rival social media platform, and the messaging service WhatsApp, bringing Facebook access to billions of photos and other user data, much of it from smartphones; formed partnerships with country\u2019s leading third-party data brokers, such as Acxiom, to ingest huge quantities of commercial data; and began tracking what its users did on other websites. Smart exploitation of all that data allowed Facebook to target advertising better than almost anyone, and by 2015, the company was earning $4 billion a year from mobile advertising. Starting in 2011, Facebook doubled the amount of money it spent on lobbying in Washington, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000033563\">then doubled it again</url>. The company employed just 10 lobbyists in state capitals around the country in 2012, according to my analysis of data collected by the National Institute on Money in Politics. By the time Mactaggart and Arney began work on their privacy initiative, it had 67. The tech industry was particularly powerful in California, its home base, where it doled out millions in campaign contributions to state candidates and parties.</p><p>But until recently, companies like Facebook and Google also had something that Wall Street and Big Oil and the cable companies didn\u2019t. To many people in Washington, they were the good guys. Through the Obama years, the tech industry enjoyed extraordinary cachet in Washington, not only among Republicans but also among Democrats. Partnering with Silicon Valley allowed Democrats to position themselves as pro-business and forward-thinking. The tech industry was both an American economic success story and a political ally to Democrats on issues like immigration. Google enjoyed particularly close ties to the Obama administration: Dozens of Google alumni would serve in the White House or elsewhere in the administration, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/04/22/googles-remarkably-close-relationship-with-the-obama-white-house-in-two-charts/\">by one estimate</url> Google representatives visited the White House an average of about once a week. But the Obama world had relationships with other firms too. Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, served on a high-level Obama advisory council on jobs and held a fund-raiser for Obama\u2019s re-election campaign at her home in Atherton, Calif. The founders of Twitter, LinkedIn and the app developer Zynga together contributed more than $2 million to a pro-Obama super PAC.</p><p>And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.</p><p>In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.</p><p>Last fall, Hoofnagle introduced Mactaggart to a former graduate student of his named Ashkan Soltani, a highly regarded privacy researcher and consultant. The two men quickly struck up an intense email correspondence. Soltani had devoted most of his adult life to understanding digital surveillance and privacy, and he closely observed how the tech industry exerted its will in Washington. Soltani told Mactaggart that his privacy initiative would need a lot of work if he wanted it to survive. Mactaggart decided to hire him.</p><p>Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201d</p><p>White House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.</p><p>The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.</p><p>In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.</p><p>When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.</p><p>But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.</p><p>The White House did little to advance the draft. Obama aides were focused on a different legislative battle: That June, with backing from tech companies, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, a major reform of N.S.A. surveillance that also positioned Silicon Valley as a champion of civil liberties. Less attention was paid when, a few days later, a working group that the administration had convened to address concerns about facial recognition collapsed. Industry representatives had refused to endorse <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/06/facial_recognition_privacy_talks_why_i_walked_out.html\">the principle that companies would need to secure people\u2019s consent</url> before scanning their faces on a public street. Any notion that Washington would produce wide-ranging privacy reform was dead. Silicon Valley had won.</p><p>Soltani and Mactaggart first met in person last fall, at the offices of Mactaggart\u2019s lawyer in Oakland. Soltani had been on a kind of sabbatical, touring the country in a van and visiting national parks: A stint at the Obama White House was cut short when Soltani was denied his security clearance. (In privacy circles, the decision was widely viewed as retribution for his work on the Snowden series.) Soltani, who is 43, wondered whether Mactaggart would turn out to be a dilettante. Yet as the two men worked to revise the proposal, Soltani found himself increasingly impressed. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with people who have an ax to grind, who have an agenda,\u201d he told me. \u201cAlastair\u2019s agenda was: First, just do some good. And then it was: Do something about privacy. And then it was: Do something about data privacy.\u201d</p><p>The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.</p><p>Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.</p><p>The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201d</p><p>Still, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.</p><p>But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.</p><p>Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.</p><p>Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.</p><p>Elsewhere, the tech industry has had more success fending off efforts to regulate facial recognition. Last year, at least five other states considered passing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicintegrity.org/2017/07/31/21027/saving-face-facebook-wants-access-without-limits\">legislation regulating the commercial use of biometrics</url>. Only one, Washington, actually passed a law \u2014 and it includes precisely the loophole that tech interests sought to carve out in Illinois, excluding \u201ca physical or digital photograph, video or audio recording or data generated therefrom.\u201d The exception covers facial scans and even voiceprints \u2014 the kind of technology that Amazon, based in Washington, uses to power Alexa, the virtual assistant that has a microphone in millions of American homes.</p><p>Almost immediately after Mactaggart and his friend Rick Arney submitted their final ballot language to the state in November, officials at Facebook and Google sent identical requests: Could they meet in person to discuss the proposal? It was the first time Mactaggart and Arney had heard from either company, and the alacrity of the response was a little intimidating. They decided to talk.</p><p>Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.</p><p>Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201d</p><p>Castleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201d</p><p>Mactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.</p><p>But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.</p><p>Mactaggart and his team didn\u2019t find out what was happening until March, when the Committee to Protect California Jobs was required to disclose its donors and spending. He and Arney believed the opposition had made a blunder: They had shown their hand before Mactaggart\u2019s initiative had even qualified for the fall ballot. But the battle ahead looked to be ugly. \u201c\u2009\u2018Full employment for trial lawyers\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of this poorly-written-by-a-multi-millionaire\u2019s measure,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/stevenmaviglio/status/969626083061481472\">Maviglio tweeted</url>. Within a few weeks, the committee was circulating talking points to California sheriffs and prosecutors, claiming that Mactaggart\u2019s proposal would make it harder for cops to foil kidnappings or quickly track down criminals like the San Bernardino shooter. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Welcome to the N.F.L.,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mactaggart recalls. \u201cIt was a reminder of how small we were. These were the biggest corporations in the world.\u201d</p><p>Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.</p><p>In March, as Mactaggart\u2019s canvassers were gathering signatures to qualify for the November ballot, Facebook made a surprise announcement \u2014 one that would change everything. In a statement posted on its website late one Friday evening, the company said it was suspending a political analytics firm called Cambridge Analytica from its platform after it had \u201creceived reports\u201d that Cambridge had improperly obtained and held data about Facebook users. The source of those reports became clear the following day, when reporters at The Times and The Observer of London <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">revealed that a contractor for Cambridge had harvested private information</url> from more than 50 million Facebook users, exploiting the social-media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate and potentially violating United States election laws. Within weeks, Facebook acknowledged that as many as 87 million users might have been affected, marking one of the biggest known data leaks in the company\u2019s history.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.</p><p>The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.</p><p>Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.</p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, the storied advocacy group based in San Francisco, did not endorse Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. Neither did the American Civil Liberties Union or Common Sense Kids Action, an influential group also headquartered in San Francisco, that has pressed for restrictions on the collection of children\u2019s data. Samantha Corbin, a lobbyist in Sacramento for both Common Sense Kids Action and the E.F.F., <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SamanthaCorbin/status/976682017675886593\">tweeted in late March</url> that she couldn\u2019t support Mactaggart\u2019s proposal because it did not require that companies get people\u2019s permission to use their data. \u201cInformed consent to use personal data is critical to privacy &amp; democracy,\u201d Corbin tweeted.</p><p>Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201d</p><p>Facebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.</p><p>Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.</p><p>But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201d</p><p>[Read Nicholas Confessore on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/insider/online-privacy-facebook-data-google.html?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\">what drew him to the story of Alastair Mactaggart,</url> the activist who forced California lawmakers to pass a landmark consumer privacy law.]</p><p>A few weeks later, I had lunch with Mactaggart and Arney at a sushi place near the Capitol. We were joined by Robin Swanson, Mactaggart\u2019s campaign consultant, herself a former senior aide in the Legislature. Everyone was in a good mood. They had recently submitted more than 629,000 signatures to qualify Mactaggart\u2019s initiative for the ballot, nearly twice the required minimum, and a Republican candidate for governor had endorsed his proposal during a public debate, surprising even Mactaggart. \u201cZuckerberg testifying helped us,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the name, he has the face. He ripped off 87 million people.\u201d</p><p>Nevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.</p><p>Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.</p><p>But Chau\u2019s bill had quickly run into a series of roadblocks. The Senate leader at the time was Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a prominent and ambitious Democrat from Los Angeles. Because Chau had replaced his original bill with a totally new one, the rules committee that de Le\u00f3n leads initially required the legislation to be \u201ctriple-referred,\u201d a rare legislative maneuver under which three different committees are entitled to inspect and approve the bill. (Ultimately, it was required to clear only two committees.) When the bill survived referral, Democratic leaders took over the legislation and began revising it, largely freezing Chau and the privacy groups out of the process. In the waning days of last year\u2019s legislative session, a huge coalition of industry groups, data brokers and tech companies signed <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/broadband-privacy-rules-would-help-terrorists-lobbyists-told-lawmakers/\">a joint letter</url> opposing the privacy legislation.</p><p>Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&amp;T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&amp;T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.</p><p>But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.</p><p>Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.</p><p>We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.</p><p>For much of May, Chau and his counterpart in the California Senate, a lawmaker named Robert Hertzberg, quietly tried to negotiate a compromise. Industry lobbyists flatly threatened to kill any bill with a private right of action. They also objected to forcing companies to disclose the names and contact information of every third party they shared data with, claiming it would be an impossible burden. (\u201cThe private right of action was something that many stakeholders did not like,\u201d Chau told me later. \u201cThat is a true statement.\u201d) In June, the two lawmakers sent their first draft to Mactaggart. He was not pleased. \u201cThey sent me a draft with no enforcement,\u201d Mactaggart said. \u201cThere was zero creativity about how to solve the problem.\u201d He told them no.</p><p>It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.</p><p>Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.</p><p>But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.</p><p>The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.</p><p>Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.</p><p>That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.</p><p>That Thursday, California lawmakers began voting on the bill. Mactaggart, who wore a blazer and khakis, watched from the Senate gallery with his wife. As the vote was called, Mactaggart kept his eyes on the electronic billboard where votes were recorded: One by one, almost every light flipped to green. They walked over to the Assembly, where much the same scene unfolded. In the end, not a single lawmaker in either chamber voted against the compromise.</p><p>Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.</p><p>I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas Confessore is a political investigative reporter for The Times and a writer at large for the magazine.

Donald Trump\u2019s tariff spree against Brazil, Argentina and France was followed by his announcement yesterday that he might wait until after the 2020 US presidential election to pause his trade war with China. So much for that \u201cphase one\u201d deal.</p><p>In today\u2019s column, I wanted to take a step back and look at the reasons why Trump is putting so much energy into defending Silicon Valley \u2014 not his most natural constituency \u2014 through US trade policy. Special thanks to Rana Foroohar, the FT columnist and author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Don\u2019t Be Evil</emphasis>, a new book about Big Tech, and Susan Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University, for talking me through some of the issues at play. Our chart of the day looks at declining trade in Mexico, while our person in the news is Brazilian economy minister Paulo Guedes.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget to click <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ft.com/tradesecrets\"> here</url> if you\u2019d like to receive Trade Secrets every Monday to Thursday. And we want to hear from you. Send any thoughts to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:trade.secrets@ft.com\">trade.secrets@ft.com</email>, or email me at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:james.politi@ft.com\">james.politi@ft.com</email></p><p>\u2018Tech companies are not my favourite people\u2019</p><p>\u201cThe tech companies you\u2019re talking about are not my favourite people because they aren\u2019t exactly for me but that\u2019s OK. They\u2019re American companies.\u201d So said Donald Trump as he sat beside Emmanuel Macron, his French counterpart, explaining why he was punishing Paris\u2019s move to impose a tax on digital services \u2014 affecting companies including Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon \u2014 with tariffs on $2.4bn of additional French goods.</p><p>The aggressive move against Macron was fairly predictable by Trump\u2019s standards: relations with the EU are in exceptionally frosty territory and US trade officials had grown impatient that Paris had failed to roll back a policy opposed by Washington. What made it striking was that Trump was not going to bat for the farmers from the Great Plains or the beleaguered steelworkers of the rust belt, whom he usually champions in trade negotiations.</p><p>Instead, his actions were intended to shield Silicon Valley\u2019s titans \u2014 which he has accused of being monopolies full of Democrats that collude against him \u2014 from overly strong taxation abroad. Trump\u2019s retaliation against France on the digital tax is not the only example of his Big Tech-friendly stance on trade: his administration made sure a digital chapter was added to USMCA, the deal with Canada and Mexico to replace Nafta, and was also included in a small trade deal reached with Japan in September.</p><p>In the heat of negotiations between the US and China to reach a broader trade agreement in March and April this year, Washington pushed hard, though in vain, for Beijing to open up to foreign cloud-computing companies, and ease restrictions on data transfers out of China. </p><p>There are certainly aspects of Trump\u2019s trade policies that US technology companies object to: they are worried about the escalating tariffs and uneasy about the imposition of sweeping export controls by the US commerce department.</p><p>But they also know that they have a mostly sympathetic hearing from Trump administration officials, who see them as national treasures that will help maintain America\u2019s edge over China and others in cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>The technology companies have helped their case by cosying up to the US president \u2014 on occasion. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, had dinner with Trump at the White House in October, and Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, hosted the president at a laptop manufacturing plant in Texas last month. </p><p>Yet Trump is treading a politically delicate path as he tries to help Big Tech improve its access to foreign markets at a time when the sector is increasingly becoming a punching bag in Washington. In a hypothetical 2020 contest against Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate who has called for a break-up of the US tech giants, Mr Trump could be vulnerable to attacks that he has been excessively friendly towards the companies. </p><p>Criticism could mount from the right as well. Many conservatives mistrust Big Tech for allegedly censoring their views, and Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=4743\"> said last month</url> that \u201cBig Tech\u201d should not be granted \u201cspecial protections\u201d in trade deals.</p><p>With regards to digital taxation, Silicon Valley\u2019s preference would clearly be that an agreement is reached on a multilateral basis at the OECD that would remove both individual country taxes and US retaliation. It fears that Trump\u2019s bullying might backfire, and exacerbate the fragmentation of the internet into separate digital spheres of influence with their own regulatory regimes and sovereignty. </p><p>But it knows that if no agreement is reached, and countries such as France, the UK and Italy plough ahead, the Trump administration has its back to a certain extent. It is a reality that could not be taken for granted at the start of his presidency. </p><p>Charted waters</p><p>News that the Trump administration is preparing to make concessions to Democrats on pharmaceutical companies in order to pass the USMCA \u2014 the US trade deal with Mexico and Canada \u2014 is likely to be welcomed in Mexico, where a boost to trade would be welcome in light of falling exports and imports. </p><p>Person in the news</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who is it?</emphasis></p><p>Paulo Guedes, Brazil\u2019s economy minister</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why is he in the news?</emphasis></p><p>Just a week ago, Guedes, the 70-year old economy minister under Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, was in Washington touting the potential for improved economic ties with the US. But on Monday, Mr Trump took everyone by surprise, slapping tariffs on Brazilian steel and aluminium on national security grounds. This has put Guedes, an alumnus of the University of Chicago and a free marketeer, in an especially tough spot. </p><p>Don\u2019t miss</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Boris Johnson has risked escalating a European trade war with Trump by vowing to push ahead with a UK digital sales tax, hours after the US administration threatened to punish France for imposing a similar measure.Read more</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Trump administration is prepared to scrap provisions in the new USMCA trade pact that would benefit US pharmaceutical and biotech companies selling medicine in Canada and Mexico. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-03/mexico-weighs-u-s-plan-to-strip-biologic-drugs-from-trade-pact\"> Read more</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>View from the FT editorial board: hopes that Trump was lowering trade tensions ahead of his re-election effort appear to have been misplaced.

But Jeff Bezos is ready to use his power to fight back.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2017, a few months after Forbes named Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, the world's richest man, a rumor spread among the company's executives: Bill Gates, the former wealthiest person on earth, had called Bezos's assistant to schedule a lunch, asking if Tuesday or Wednesday was available. The assistant informed Bezos of the invitation, and told him that both days were open. Bezos, who had built an empire exhorting employees to be \"vocally self-critical,\" and to never \"believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume,\" issued a command: Make it Thursday.</p><p>Bezos's power play was so mild that it likely wasn't noticed by Gates, but within Amazon the story sparked a small panic (and, later, an official denial). Such a willful act of vanity felt like a bad omen. At Amazon's headquarters, in Seattle, the company's fourteen Leadership Principles-painted on walls, posted in bathrooms, printed on laminated cards in executives' wallets-urge employees to \"never say 'that's not my job,'\u00a0\" to \"examine their strongest convictions with humility,\" to \"not compromise for the sake of social cohesion,\" and to commit to excellence even if \"people may think these standards are unreasonably high.\" (When I recently asked various employees to recite the precepts, they did so with alarming gusto: \"\u00a0'Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention!'\u00a0\") A former executive said, \"That's how we earn our success-we're willing to be frugal and egoless, and obsessed with delighting our customers.\"</p><p>Amazon is now America's second-largest private employer. (Walmart is the largest.) It traffics more than a third of all retail products bought or sold online in the U.S.; it owns Whole Foods and helps arrange the shipment of items purchased across the Web, including on eBay and Etsy. Amazon's Web-services division powers vast portions of the Internet, from Netflix to the C.I.A. You probably contribute to Amazon's profits whether you intend to or not. Critics say that Amazon, much like Google and Facebook, has grown too large and powerful to be trusted. Everyone from Senator Elizabeth Warren to President Donald Trump has depicted Amazon as dangerously unconstrained. This past summer, at a debate among the Democratic Presidential candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders said, \"Five hundred thousand Americans are sleeping out on the street, and yet companies like Amazon, that made billions in profits, did not pay one nickel in federal income tax.\" And Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, declared that Amazon has \"destroyed the retail industry across the United States.\" The Federal Trade Commission and the European Union, meanwhile, are independently pursuing investigations of Amazon for potential antitrust violations. In recent months, inquiries by news organizations have documented Amazon's sale of illegal or deadly products, and have exposed how the company's fast-delivery policies have resulted in drivers speeding down streets and through intersections, killing people. Company insiders were accustomed to complaints from rivals at book publishers or executives at big-box stores. Those attacks rarely felt personal. Now, a recently retired Amazon executive told me, \"people are worried-we're suddenly on the firing line.\"</p><p>Amazon executives were also concerned about dramatic changes within the company. In 2015, Amazon had roughly two hundred thousand employees. Since then, its workforce had nearly tripled. Bezos, now fifty-five, had transformed as well, from a pudgy bookseller with an elephant-seal laugh to a sleek, muscled mogul whose empire included a television-and-movie studio. (Bezos declined to be interviewed for this article.) Amazon executives comforted themselves with the thought that, even if the story about the Bill Gates lunch was true, at least their boss wasn't reckless, like, say, Elon Musk or Travis Kalanick or Adam Neumann. Many admired Bezos's dedication to his wife and children, and saw it as an embodiment of the company's integrity. Still, they whispered, what if his flywheel has gone off track?</p><p>The notion of the flywheel-the heavy disk within a machine that, once spinning, pushes gears and production relentlessly forward-is venerated within Amazon, as Ian Freed learned on his first day of work, in 2004. Freed had initially glimpsed the power of the Internet as a Harvard student, when he guessed an e-mail address in Indonesia that led him to strike up a correspondence with the country's minister of telecommunications. After graduating, Freed built computer networks in Russia and drafted policy papers for the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development. He felt that every organization he advised failed to take advantage of all the opportunities created by the Internet. He moved to the West Coast, where he became an expert in streaming networks. Then he joined Amazon, as a director of its fledgling mobile-services team. During an orientation that included a warehouse stint unloading boxes of shampoo and stocking shelves with toothpaste, he realized that people at the company saw things in a fundamentally different way.</p><p>Most firms have a mission statement that even the C.E.O. has trouble remembering. Amazon employees, Freed discovered, studied the Leadership Principles like Talmudic texts. During his first few years, he occasionally pulled colleagues, and even Bezos, aside to ask questions. What, for example, does \"leaders are right a lot\" really mean? Bezos explained, \"If you have a really good idea, stick to it, but be flexible on how you get there. Be stubborn on your vision but flexible on the details.\" Executives at other companies tended to lay out definitive plans. But Bezos urged his people to be adaptable. \"People who are right a lot change their mind,\" he once said. \"They have the same data set that they had at the beginning, but they wake up, and they re-analyze things all the time, and they come to a new conclusion, and then they change their mind.\" Freed often felt an impulse to answer his subordinates' questions, but at Amazon leaders are encouraged to let team members puzzle out problems on their own.</p><p>About a year after joining the company, Freed became Bezos's technical assistant, which gave him entr\u00e9e to almost any meeting and provided a deep education in the company's culture. Amazon's internal processes were \"mechanisms,\" Freed learned, as in \"What's the mechanism for talking to the press?\" Executives were expected to reduce \"complexifiers,\" and someone who failed to suggest ways to simplify a process might be interrupted by Bezos asking, \"Are you lazy or just incompetent?\"</p><p>The Leadership Principles were never paraphrased; when a question over wording arose, the laminated cards were often whipped out. PowerPoint was discouraged. Product proposals had to be written out as six-page narratives-Bezos believed that storytelling forced critical thinking-accompanied by a mock press release. Meetings started with a period of silent reading, and each proposal concluded with a list of F.A.Q.s, such as \"What will most disappoint the customer on the first day of release?\"</p><p>Tech companies are often profligate, but Amazon had an ethic of thrift. Freed learned to anticipate the eye rolls that greeted new employees who printed on just one side of paper, or the admonishment coming to anyone who wanted to book a business-class seat. Whenever Amazon moved to new offices, Bezos had them furnished with cheap desks made from wooden doors. Whereas other tech companies supplied employees with an array of free meals and snacks, Amazon offered only coffee and bananas. (In a statement, Amazon said that it is \"frugal on behalf of our customers.\")</p><p>Freed and other Amazonians were delighted by the company's quirks. Bezos amused his colleagues when he humble-bragged about being such a sci-fi nerd that he owned a Jean-Luc Picard uniform from \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\" And staffers loved it when Amazon offered a promotion, known as Share the Pi, in which customers were given a discount of 1.57 per cent (3.14 divided by two). When Amazon leaders joined the low-carb craze, they ended meetings debating the finer points of ketosis, and raced one another up the stairs. It wasn't fair to call Amazon a cult, but it wasn't entirely unfair, either. \"We never claim that our approach is the right one,\" Bezos wrote, in a 2016 letter to shareholders. \"Just that it's ours.\"</p><p>Above all, Freed loved Amazon's focus on spinning its flywheels faster, and finding new markets where they could whirl. \"Amazon's culture is designed to prevent bureaucracies,\" he told me. \"Everything Jeff does is to stop a big-company mentality from taking hold, so that Amazon can continue behaving like a group of startups.\" Among the worst sins was doing anything that slowed the company down. (As the Leadership Principles put it, \"Speed matters.\") Freed was soon assigned to help oversee the creation of a new e-reader, the Kindle. His team expanded quickly (\"Hire and Develop the Best\"), came up with dozens of concepts and prototypes (\"Invent and Simplify\"), and, in just a few years, delivered a device of startling simplicity and elegance. When the Kindle was launched, in 2007, it sold out in less than six hours, and soon became one of the most popular gadgets of the past quarter century.</p><p>As Freed learned, it was also fine to stumble at Amazon, as long as the experience yielded strategic insight. After overseeing the Kindle, Freed was asked to help lead a team developing the company's first smartphone. Bezos had become enamored of a sophisticated display that approximated 3-D. For four years, Freed oversaw a group that grew to a thousand employees, and spent more than a hundred million dollars. But when the Amazon Fire Phone was released, in 2014, it was a flop. No matter: when Freed had presented an early prototype of the phone's software to Bezos, he'd shown him how it included voice recognition that could hear, and then play, any popular song whose title a user said aloud. \"I can ask for any song?\" Bezos asked. \"What about 'Hotel California'?\" The tune began playing. \"This is fantastic,\" he said.</p><p>A few days after that presentation, Bezos asked Freed to help build a cloud-based computer that responded to voice commands, like the one in \"Star Trek.\" Freed started amassing a team that eventually reached two hundred people, and was given a fifty-million-dollar budget. The Fire Phone's voice-recognition technology had been licensed from another firm, and wasn't an exact fit for what Amazon was seeking. So Freed and his team hired speech scientists and artificial-intelligence experts, and created new software that could comprehend someone from Louisiana as well as someone from Liverpool-and distinguish the babble of a toddler from parents talking with food in their mouths. The team chose a name (and a \"wakeup\" word) for the device by considering hundreds of possibilities, before landing on Alexa-a name that was sufficiently familiar yet unusual enough to avoid too many accidental commands. Just four months after releasing the disastrous Fire Phone, Freed revealed the Echo, a voice-activated speaker that can tell you the weather, compile a grocery list, remind you to take a pie out of the oven, and play \"Hotel California.\" The initial price was a hundred and ninety-nine dollars. Today, you can buy one for half that, and fifty million homes have them.</p><p>Around the time of the Echo's launch, Amazon wrote off more than a hundred and seventy million dollars in costs associated with the Fire Phone. Bezos told Freed, \"You can't, for one minute, feel bad about the Fire Phone. Promise me you won't lose a minute of sleep.\" By 2015, Freed was a vice-president and Amazon was the most valuable retailer in the world.</p><p>Identifying and building flywheels became second nature to Freed. When a junior executive came by his desk with an idea-\"What if we made a streaming device that you could plug into a television?\"-Freed invited him to lunch, coached him through writing a mock press release, and took him to pitch the idea to Bezos. They reminded Bezos that, with existing streaming devices, searching for content was difficult. \"It's really hard to type 'Gene Hackman movies from the nineteen-seventies' when you're using a remote control,\" Freed explained. Amazon's product, he said, would allow customers to simply say what they wanted to watch. The flywheel began spinning. If Amazon sold a streaming device, it could collect more data on popular shows; if Amazon had that data, it could begin profitably producing its own premium movies and television series; if Amazon made that content free for Prime members-customers who already paid ninety-nine dollars per year for two-day delivery-then more people would sign up for Prime; if more people signed up for Prime, the company would have greater leverage in negotiating with UPS and FedEx; lower shipping costs would mean bigger profits every time Amazon sold anything on its site. The Amazon Fire TV, as the device was named, soon became one of the most popular streaming devices on the planet. Amazon Studios began producing premium shows, and before long it had won two Oscars for \"Manchester by the Sea\" and eight Emmys for \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\" In 2017, the number of AmazonPrime subscribers surpassed a hundred million.</p><p>Although Freed was thriving at Amazon, he could see that there was something dizzying about its flywheel mentality. \"It was hard,\" he said. \"That's the culture-do whatever it takes, even if it seems impossible.\" Amazon's obsession with expansion made it the corporate equivalent of a colonizer, ruthlessly invading new industries and subjugating many smaller companies along the way. In 2006, the company had launched Fulfillment by Amazon, an initiative in which outside sellers-everyone from mom-and-pop venders to major Chinese manufacturers-housed inventory inside Amazon's giant warehouses and paid a fee for Amazon to handle logistics, such as packing and shipping products and fielding customer-service calls. Companies enrolled in Fulfillment by Amazon often appeared in the Buy Box, the top search listing on Amazon.com. To participate, many venders had to pay about two dollars per item. They also had to let Bezos collect valuable data on which products were becoming popular and which companies were having trouble satisfying demand. Soon, some venders felt as though they had to participate in Fulfillment by Amazon; they couldn't otherwise attract much attention on Amazon.com, or ship products inexpensively enough to compete with rivals.</p><p>Today, Amazon.com lists more than three hundred and thirty million products sold by other companies. Scott Needham, whose company, BuyBoxer, sells about seventy thousand products on Amazon, ranging from toys to sporting goods, paid the company roughly twenty million dollars in fees last year. \"There's really no other choice,\" Needham said. \"There's a lot of things I don't like about Amazon, but that's where all the customers are.\" Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives and the European Union began scrutinizing Fulfillment by Amazon and similar programs, out of concern that they impede competition. \"Amazon is the gatekeeper,\" Needham said. \"It makes all the rules.\"</p><p>Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia, said, \"Amazon is a microeconomist's wet dream. If you're a consumer, it's perfect for maximizing the efficiency of finding what you want and getting it as cheap and fast as possible. But, the thing is, most of us aren't just consumers. We're also producers, or manufacturers, or employees, or we live in cities where retailers have gone out of business because they can't compete with Amazon, and so Amazon kind of pits us against ourselves.\"</p><p>Freed loved how things whizzed along at Amazon headquarters, but he understood that the \"Speed matters\" credo meant something different at the warehouses. \"Is it the role of a company to only do what's best for shareholders?\" he asked me. \"Yes, shareholders are critical, but it's also important to understand the impact on employees.\" More than a hundred thousand people work at Amazon's fulfillment centers, and nearly everything they do is digitally tracked and evaluated, meaning that if someone falls behind-even for just a few minutes-it can be grounds for reprimand. Many employees carry handheld scanners that deliver a constant stream of instructions, such as a countdown clock detailing how many seconds remain until the next item must be plucked from a shelf. Workers can walk more than fifteen miles a day, and their breaks, including trips to the bathroom, are brief and closely measured. A company document explains, \"Amazon's system tracks the rates of each individual associate's productivity and automatically generates any warnings or terminations regarding quality of productivity without input from supervisors.\" A former warehouse employee told me that she knew of people who got fired largely \"because they were too old, or their knees started acting up, or they just had a bad week.\" She added, \"Managers are always vague about what will get you fired, which creates this paranoia.\" Employees, she said, sometimes ask questions about \"what exactly will get them fired, and the responses are so vague that you basically know that if you're not constantly moving, you're probably gone.\" Employees line up at vending machines that dispense free over-the-counter painkillers. For years, some Amazon warehouses lacked sufficient air-conditioning; this changed only after reports emerged, in 2011, of workers passing out and requiring emergency medical treatment for heat-related problems.</p><p>William Stolz, who has worked for two years at an Amazon warehouse in Shakopee, Minnesota, told me that he's expected to grab an item every eight seconds, and has seen co-workers injure their wrists, knees, shoulders, and backs by repeatedly kneeling, or by rushing up and down ladders. \"There's a constant pressure to hit your numbers,\" he said. If you get four writeups within ninety days for falling below the expected productivity rate, you will be fired. Stolz said, \"I've seen people who aren't even thirty years old get injuries they're going to have for the rest of their lives, but whenever we ask for the speed of work or the repetitive motions to be changed we're told that's not going to happen.\"</p><p>When Safiyo Mohamed moved from Somalia to Minnesota, in 2016, at the age of twenty-two, she found work at the Shakopee warehouse, sorting products and moving boxes on and off conveyors. The job was taxing and the pressure relentless, she said. One day, when she picked up a heavy box, she tore an intervertebral disk in her back. The pain was excruciating, but Amazon didn't offer her time off; her managers seemed not to care. \"If you can't work all the time, you are nothing to them,\" she said. A doctor told her that the injury was pinching a nerve, and that the discomfort might never abate. She quit Amazon, and got an office job that allows her to pause, or stretch, when her back hurts. \"How am I going to have a baby when I can't pick him up, when I'm worried about being pregnant?\" Mohamed said. \"I'm so angry. Amazon doesn't want humans, they want robots. I will have this forever because of them. They don't care at all.\"</p><p>At Amazon's corporate headquarters, many executives' performances are similarly quantified and ranked. \"It can be a hard place for women,\" a former executive told me. \"If you have a kid, it's a disadvantage to your career, unless your husband is the primary parent.\" (Amazon said, in a statement, that it \"disagrees strongly with this perspective,\" and noted that it offers twenty weeks of paid parental leave.) A former senior female executive told me she counselled younger colleagues that \"it's not the company's job to create a work-life balance-it's your job,\" adding, \"The idea of a company as a caretaker is not our culture.\" There is only one woman on Amazon's S-Team, the group of eighteen executives who largely run the firm. The lack of female representation is a sensitive topic at the company. A current high-ranking executive told me, \"I'm not sure it would be any different for a woman at an investment bank or a big law firm. The pace is fast, yes, and it's not for everyone or every stage of life, but these are highly compensated people who know they can easily get other jobs. No one works at Amazon-at least, in corporate-unless they want to.\"</p><p>Amazon argues that criticisms of working conditions in its warehouses are unfair. Dave Clark, the senior vice-president for worldwide operations, told me that work expectations at its facilities \"are very achievable for folks.\" He said that the company has increasingly automated its warehouses, to ease physical tasks. \"We make mistakes,\" Clark said. \"And, when we do hear about it, we learn from it, and we go out and fix it.\" Amazon pays all U.S.-based employees at least fifteen dollars an hour-more than the minimum wage in many places-and full-time warehouse workers have access to the same health and retirement plans as executives. A company statement noted that workers at Amazon begin and end every shift with a short meeting and a group stretching session; it also said that employee performance is evaluated over extended periods, noting, \"We would never dismiss an employee without first ensuring that they had received our fullest support, including dedicated coaching.\"</p><p>Many Amazon executives have become defensive about the fact that even centrist politicians like Joe Biden see the company as a symbol of capitalism gone awry. (On Twitter, Biden recently said of Amazon, \"No company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.\") Jeff Wilke, one of Bezos's top lieutenants, told me that Amazon \"tries to be a good corporate citizen,\" and added, \"We've built a for-profit enterprise that is improving the lives of customers and taking great care of employees. There's a lot to be proud of.\" The company, he said, has committed to spending seven hundred million dollars to train its workers in such subjects as coding and robotics. One senior Amazon executive said of its warehouses, \"It's a hard economy for people without college degrees right now. We can't run a philanthropy, but we're trying to be the best of those bad kinds of jobs.\" Another top executive suggested that Amazon was merely a cog in the American economic machine-and inevitably reflected how contemporary inequality had created winners and losers. \"We're doing what we can,\" he said. \"But ultimately this is a problem only the government can really solve-by changing how the economy works.\"</p><p>Amazon has always been unabashed about being a cutthroat competitor. When the company started, in 1995, with fewer than a dozen employees, Bezos considered naming it Relentless. (The company still owns the URL for relentless.com-it redirects you to Amazon.com.) Amazonians know that outsiders want them to change, but listening to outsiders is not one of the Leadership Principles. One executive told me, with barely suppressed resentment, \"What has made us great for so long is suddenly being seen as something we ought to be ashamed of!\"</p><p>In 1913, an employee of the Ford Motor Company went to the Swift &amp; Co. meatpacking plant, in Chicago, to study how hogs moved through the facility on conveyor belts while butchers stayed in place, making the same cut again and again. Someone prepared the carcass; another person cut the left haunch; another was responsible for incisions along the shoulder. The knives never stopped moving as the animals sped through the plant. When the Ford employee returned to headquarters, he told his colleagues, \"If they can kill pigs and cows that way, we can build cars that way.\" The man's boss, Henry Ford, a lifelong tinkerer, had developed a radical new product: an automobile, with an inexpensive internal-combustion engine, that could be manufactured in a couple of days and sold for less than a thousand dollars. When Ford managers heard about the meatpacking plant, they began work on another major innovation: the mechanized assembly line. Within four years, Ford's plants could manufacture a car in less than two hours and sell it for about four hundred dollars.</p><p>In 1918, a man named Alfred\u00a0P. Sloan began working as an executive at a much smaller company, General Motors. Sloan wasn't especially interested in automobiles. He loved making money-and figuring out how to manage people in order to make profits grow faster. Once installed at G.M., Sloan staged a coup by way of a memo, \"Organization Study,\" which eventually reoriented the firm around himself and a set of foundational credos that included five \"objectives.\" A chart of eighty-nine boxes connected by a blizzard of lines mapped out each executive's place in the hierarchy. It was the first org chart of its kind. Sloan's theory was that G.M. could codify the processes that delivered information up to headquarters and guidance down to managers. \"If the whole General Motors central organization should be hit by an atomic bomb, Pontiac could go on just exactly the same,\" Sloan boasted to a reporter. Soon, the company had standard procedures for budgeting, hiring, firing, prototyping, promoting, and resolving disputes. Within this rigid framework, executives were given the freedom to be creative; G.M. essentially became the first company to segment the automobile market, selling Chevrolets to the middle class and Cadillacs to the wealthy.</p><p>When Sloan joined the company, G.M. was on the verge of bankruptcy. Within a decade, it had outpaced Ford, becoming the nation's largest carmaker, and for the next eighty years it dominated the auto business and, eventually, a wide variety of other industries. Sloan's systems made G.M. one of the country's biggest loan financiers and a powerful real-estate investor, and placed it among the largest manufacturers of refrigerators, industrial magnets, home appliances, aeronautic equipment, military gear, and medical equipment. In 1952, G.M. made the first mechanical heart. Sloan launched a sophisticated corporate polling division-another first-that uncovered customer tastes that other companies had overlooked; the R.\u00a0&amp;\u00a0D. department used this information to create new products. The same playbook that dreamed up Cadillac's space-age tail fins was soon designing sleek Frigidaire iceboxes. G.M., in other words, was adept at creating flywheels. It sold plenty of cars, but, unlike Ford, it wasn't a product company-it was a process company.</p><p>Silicon Valley is filled with product companies. Google invented two products-a spectacular search engine and a set of algorithms for matching people's online behavior to ads-that today deliver eighty-five per cent of its revenue. Facebook invented (and acquired) addictive social-media products and then basically imitated Google's ad-matching algorithms, and gets ninety-eight per cent of its revenue from those products.</p><p>Amazon is a process company. Last year, it collected a hundred and twenty-two billion dollars from online retail sales, and another forty-two billion by helping other firms sell and ship their own goods. The company collected twenty-six billion dollars from its Web-services division, which has little to do with selling things to consumers, and fourteen billion more from people who sign up for such subscription services as AmazonPrime or Kindle Unlimited. Amazon is estimated to have taken in hundreds of millions of dollars from selling the Echo. Seventeen billion came from sales at such brick-and-mortar stores as Whole Foods. And then there's ten billion from ad sales and other activities too numerous to list in financial filings. No other tech company does as many unrelated things, on such a scale, as Amazon.</p><p>Amazon is special not because of any asset or technology but because of its culture-its Leadership Principles and internal habits. Bezos refers to the company's management style as Day One Thinking: a willingness to treat every morning as if it were the first day of business, to constantly re\u00ebxamine even the most closely held beliefs. \"Day Two is stasis,\" Bezos wrote, in a 2017 letter to shareholders. \"Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day One.\"</p><p>For many entrepreneurs, Amazon has been a godsend. David Ashley, who sells handcrafted address signs from Jackson, Mississippi, told me, \"We probably wouldn't be in business without Amazon.\" The 2008 recession almost killed Ashley's small company. Then he began selling his signs on Amazon and discovered that-for forty dollars a month and fifteen per cent of each sale-Amazon would handle such tasks as processing credit-card transactions, identifying potential customers, and helping to insure that products were delivered on time. \"But the biggest thing is that people trust Amazon,\" Ashley said. \"And so they trust us.\" More than 1.9 million small businesses in the United States take advantage of Amazon's services. Last year, nearly two hundred thousand sellers earned at least a hundred thousand dollars each on the site.</p><p>Other retailers, however, don't share Ashley's enthusiasm. When David Kahan became the chief executive of Birkenstock Americas, in 2013, he began to discover how thoroughly Amazon had changed his industry. Kahan had started his career as a shoe salesman at Macy's; he went on to become a sales manager at Nike and, eventually, a top executive at Reebok. Birkenstocks have been made by hand, in Germany, for two hundred and forty-five years-thirty-two workers touch every pair. When Kahan became C.E.O., Amazon was among the company's top three shoe sellers. \"They sold millions of dollars' worth of our shoes,\" Kahan told me. \"But during my first year I was sitting in my office, where I can hear the customer-service department, and we were getting a flood of people saying their shoes were falling apart, or they were defective, or they were clearly counterfeits, and, every time the rep asked where they had been purchased, the customer said Amazon.\"</p><p>Kahan investigated, and found that numerous companies were selling counterfeit or unauthorized Birkenstocks on Amazon; many were using Fulfillment by Amazon to ship their products, which caused them to appear prominently in search results. \"We would ask Amazon to take sellers down-or, at least, tell us who is counterfeiting-but they said they couldn't divulge private information,\" Kahan told me.</p><p>Kahan also discovered that Amazon had started buying enormous numbers of Birkenstocks to resell on the site. The company had amassed more than a year's worth of inventory. \"That was terrifying, because it meant we could totally lose control of our brand,\" he said. \"What if Amazon decides to start selling the shoes for ninety-nine cents, or to give them away with Prime membership, or do a buy-one-get-one-free campaign? It would completely destroy how people see our shoes, and our only power to prevent something like that is to cut off a retailer's supply. But Amazon had a year's worth of inventory. We were powerless.\"</p><p>Kahan spent months trying to negotiate with Amazon executives in Seattle. At the Birkenstock Americas office, in Marin County, California, he and his deputies would spend hours preparing arguments about why stopping unauthorized sellers would help Amazon's customers, and then they'd crowd around Kahan's desk and turn on the speakerphone. Sometimes the Amazon executives would let them go on; other times, they'd cut them off midsentence. It wasn't Amazon's place to decide who could and couldn't sell on the site, the executives explained, as long as simple guidelines were met. \"They basically didn't care,\" Kahan said. \"We're just one company, and there's millions of companies they deal with every day. But this is the biggest thing on earth for us. Amazon is the shopping mall now, and, normally, if you open a store in a shopping mall, you can expect certain things-like the mall operator will clean the hallways, and they'll make sure Foot Locker isn't right next door to Payless, and if someone sets up a kiosk in front of your store and starts selling fake Air Jordans, they'll kick them off the property.\" He continued, \"But Amazon is the Wild West. There's hardly any rules, except everyone has to pay Amazon a percentage, and you have to swallow what they give you and you can't complain.\"</p><p>Hundreds of other companies have told Amazon about counterfeiting or what they see as unfair competition-some of it generated by Amazon itself. In the early two-thousands, a San Francisco firm named Rain Design began selling an aluminum laptop stand that had a graceful curve, and it became an unexpected best-seller on Amazon. Amazon then released its own stand, with a nearly identical design, under the brand AmazonBasics, at half the price. Rain Design's sales fell. In 2016, Williams-Sonoma had started selling a low-backed mid-century-modern chair called the Orb. A year later, Amazon released an almost identical chair, which they also called the Orb. Last December, Williams-Sonoma filed a lawsuit claiming that \"Amazon has unfairly and deceptively engaged in a widespread campaign of copying.\" Earlier this year, a judge denied Amazon's motion to dismiss the case, ruling that the company might be \"cultivating the incorrect impression\" that ersatz products were authorized by Williams-Sonoma.</p><p>Critics say that Amazon uses the torrent of data it collects each day-how long a customer's cursor hovers over various products, how much of a price drop triggers a purchase-to divine which products are poised to become blockbusters, and then copies them. In July, the E.U. announced an investigation into whether Amazon uses \"sensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace\" to unfairly promote its own goods, or to create imitation products. Europe's top competition regulator, Margrethe Vestager, told me that Amazon is \"hosting thousands and thousands of smaller businesses, but at the same time it is a competitor to them.\" She added, \"This deserves much more scrutiny.\"</p><p>In a statement, Amazon said that many other retailers also produce their own versions of best-selling items, that such goods make up only one per cent of Amazon's sales, and that Rain Design's stands continue to sell well, despite competition from Amazon's stand-which, it insists, isn't a replica. The company added that it does not use \"data about individual sellers to decide which products to launch.\" (Company insiders, however, told me that Amazon does use aggregate data from multiple sellers to make such decisions.)</p><p>Kahan, of Birkenstock, eventually decided to take extreme measures. He announced that his firm would no longer sell shoes on Amazon, and he sent a letter to retailers declaring that if they listed Birkenstock products on Amazon they would be \"severing\" their \"relationship with our company.\" According to Kahan, Amazon began contacting authorized retailers, inviting them to sell their supply of Birkenstocks to the site. Kahan wrote to his retailers, \"To me, the solicitation is quite frankly a 'wolf in sheep's clothing.'\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I take their desperate act as a personal affront and as an assault on decency.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Amazon can't get Birkenstock by legitimate means so why not dangle a carrot in front of retailers who can make a quick buck.\"</p><p>Kahan's outrage hardly mattered. Today, despite Birkenstock's refusal to do business with Amazon, there are numerous resellers-some overseas, others with names that obscure their true identities-offering Birkenstocks on Amazon. Kahan has no idea who these resellers are, and Amazon won't tell him. Birkenstock requires authorized retailers to charge roughly a hundred and thirty-five dollars for its classic Arizona sandal. On October 8th, Arizonas were going on Amazon for as little as fifty dollars-which is great for customers looking for cheap shoes but potentially disastrous for Birkenstock, which relies on those higher prices to pay for marketing, product design, and the salaries of customer-service employees (who replace defective shoes for free).</p><p>Amazon says that it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on anti-counterfeiting efforts, including machine-learning technology that identifies suspicious items. Nevertheless, the site remains full of dubious products. A recent investigation by the Wall Street Journal identified thousands of products for sale on Amazon that \"have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulators,\" including children's toys containing dangerous levels of lead. Many of these products were shipped from Amazon warehouses, some through the Fulfillment by Amazon program. And Birkenstock's customer-service department still gets calls from customers who bought fake sandals on Amazon and expect Birkenstock to provide a refund.</p><p>Amazon says that it cannot accommodate the demands of Birkenstock and other companies that wish to \"limit availability of competitively priced products.\" In a statement, Amazon said that it is not its role to decide who is, and is not, authorized to sell various items. Amazon isn't a mall, a current executive told me. He described it as a Web site that offers unlimited shelf space for an almost unlimited number of products and sellers. Some might call this a platform. Other tech giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, describe themselves as platforms, partly as a way of justifying spotty oversight of their sites.</p><p>Kahan told me that, with the rise of Amazon, the give-and-take that has long undergirded the retail economy has become lopsided in a titan's favor. \"Capitalism is supposed to be a system of checks and balances,\" he said. \"It's a marketplace where everyone haggles until we're all basically satisfied, and it works because you can always threaten to walk away if you don't get a fair deal. But when there's only one marketplace, and it's impossible to walk away, everything is out of balance. Amazon owns the marketplace. They can do whatever they want. That's not capitalism. That's piracy.\"</p><p>On January 7, 2019, as public criticism of Amazon's excesses grew louder, Jeff Bezos received an e-mail from Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media, the parent company of the National Enquirer. \"I write to request an interview with you about your love affair,\" the message began. Howard then asked dozens of questions about Bezos's involvement with Lauren Sanchez, a helicopter pilot who had founded a company, Black Ops Aviation, that filmed promotional videos for Bezos's rocket company, Blue Origin. Reporters for the Enquirer had been trailing Bezos and Sanchez for months, the e-mail indicated, photographing them in hotels and at airports, and compiling a dossier of trysts. Bezos and Sanchez were both married, and the Enquirer was prepared to expose it all.</p><p>Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, a novelist, had been together for twenty-seven years. When executives went to their house for weekend meetings, it wasn't unusual to see them reading the newspaper together or helping their kids with homework. \"They seemed to have the perfect marriage,\" a former Amazon executive told me. \"I once saw them get out of the car at our holiday party, when they thought no one was looking, and hold each other's hand. It was that kind of relationship, real inspirational. Like, if they could stay together and keep their family sane, with all the work and money and stress, then the rest of us could, too.\"</p><p>Around the time that Bezos became the world's richest man, his life style changed. He appeared on television at the Academy Awards. He bought a mansion in Beverly Hills, and he threw a party co-hosted by Matt Damon. He was following an intense weight-training and diet regimen. He was in Seattle less frequently, employees noticed, and he often attended events without MacKenzie. Now the Enquirer was accusing Bezos and Sanchez of hiding their assignations from MacKenzie and from Sanchez's husband, Patrick Whitesell, a powerful talent agent whom Bezos had socialized with as Amazon expanded into Hollywood. A former American Media executive said of the Enquirer investigation, \"It was a kind of weird story for us. Enquirer readers don't really care about C.E.O.s. But everyone was all worked up and excited about it-cackling about blackmail and dick pics. It was like the unpopular kids had finally found something embarrassing about the quarterback.\"</p><p>Two days after Bezos received Howard's e-mail, he posted a message on Twitter. \"We want to make people aware of a development in our lives,\" he wrote, in a note co-signed by MacKenzie. \"After a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.\" Hours later, the Enquirer started publishing articles about the affair, making reference to \"sleazy photos\" and \"X-rated selfies\" exchanged by Bezos and Sanchez. The tabloid quoted some texts that he had sent her-\"I want to smell you\"-which suggested that his or her phone had been compromised. But the tabloid did not end up publishing racy photographs; it ran mundane images of Bezos and Sanchez, some of which had already appeared online. According to the former American Media executive, the publication might not actually have had explicit images. \"If we had pics of Jeff Bezos's dick, I would have seen them,\" the former executive told me. \"That's standard operating procedure-you pass them around. But whenever I asked I was told, 'Well, we don't actually have them here right now.' I was, like, 'You're bluffing the richest man in the world?'\u00a0\" (A representative of the Enquirer said that the publication had \"acted lawfully and stands by the accuracy of its reporting.\")</p><p>Marriages break up all the time, yet many of Bezos's colleagues felt disoriented by the fact that he had been so undisciplined as to let his personal life become tabloid fodder. \"The basis of Jeff's stature was a lot of things, but integrity was No. 1,\" a former colleague told me. \"The way he dealt with his family, and customers, and the people around him-that was at the core of why we respected him so much. And then this thing happened, and it was so hard to make that fit into the picture of the person we knew.\" Even Bezos's friends were concerned. \"It was like Jeff had been abducted by aliens and replaced,\" one told me. \"It'd been going on for about a year-the bodybuilding stuff, and Hollywood, and just a big change in how he was-and then this came out, and I still don't know how to process it.\"</p><p>Once Bezos's affair became public, more mainstream publications began digging around. When the Wall Street Journal prepared a story about how Bezos's divorce might affect his company, Amazon's P.R. department, which had been known for using mild language, responded acidly. The company's communications and policy chief, Jay Carney, told the paper, \"I didn't realize the Wall Street Journal trafficked in warmed-over drivel from supermarket tabloids.\" Meanwhile, Bezos launched an internal audit of his cell-phone data. If someone had gained access to his private texts, what else had been collected? E-mails? Business plans? Bezos ordered his personal head of security, the consultant Gavin de Becker, to scrutinize electronic records and to conduct interviews. Was the breach part of a sophisticated attack whose purpose was larger than simply to embarrass Bezos?</p><p>Bezos had plenty of enemies, and not just aggrieved companies like Birkenstock. For years, he had been battling various groups, from pro-union organizers to activists critical of Amazon's tax practices, and some of the clashes had been nasty. Labor organizers had been a particular source of conflict. In 2000, when the Communication Workers of America tried to unionize four hundred of Amazon's customer-service representatives in Seattle, the company closed down the call center where those employees worked, as part of what it said was a broader reorganization. In 2014, when a group of technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to allow them to vote on whether to unionize, Amazon hired a law firm that specialized in fighting organized labor, and held meetings warning that unionization could be bad for workers' jobs. Employees voted against joining the union. According to the Times, when other workers in Delaware tried to unionize, their manager gave an emotional speech about his youth: after his father had died, steps from his front door, the union had offered no support. The speech apparently worked-employees did not authorize a union vote. After the speech, outside organizers found an obituary of the man's father: he had been a partner at an insurance agency, not a union member, and had died while jogging, on vacation in South Carolina. After Amazon bought Whole Foods, in 2017, and workers began exploring unionization, store managers reportedly received a video explaining that \"you might need to talk about how having a union could hurt innovation, which could hurt customer obsession, which could ultimately threaten the building's continued existence.\" The union push stalled.</p><p>Dave Clark, the senior vice-president for worldwide operations, told me that Amazon already provides many of the benefits that a union would demand, and so \"there's really no reason to put an interstitial layer between employees' ability to directly come tell their manager that something is broken.\" Amazon, in a statement, said that it complies with the National Labor Relations Act, and that any member of the public can sign up for a free tour of its warehouses. \"Our direct connection with our people is the most valuable way to run the business,\" Clark said. \"It's the fastest way to run the business. It's the most innovative way to run the business.\" He added, \"I can't see how unions add any value to our current operations.\"</p><p>Groups unrelated to organized labor also had an incentive to embarrass Bezos. In 2018, when Seattle's city council, facing a homelessness crisis, unanimously passed a measure that would have required the city's largest companies to pay a tax of two hundred and seventy-five dollars per local worker to build homeless shelters and affordable housing, Amazon balked. The law would have initially cost Amazon less than twenty million dollars per year, at a time when its annual revenue exceeded two hundred and thirty billion dollars. Before it passed, Amazon announced that it had halted construction on a new tower in Seattle and was reconsidering an expansion into seven hundred thousand square feet that it had leased. A company spokesperson implicitly blamed the tax for these shifts, telling local reporters that Amazon was \"apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses.\" Amazon donated twenty-five thousand dollars to No Tax on Jobs, a group opposing the initiative. The tax's supporters pushed back, accusing Bezos and others of being \"O.K. with the city having shantytowns and favelas,\" but within a month the city council surrendered, and repealed the tax measure. \"This is not a winnable battle at this time,\" one councillor explained. \"The opposition has unlimited resources.\" Seattle's homeless population rose four per cent that year. The city has the third-largest population of homeless residents in the nation.</p><p>Activists have also noted that Bezos is much less philanthropic than many of his peers. Among America's top five billionaires, he is the only one who has not signed the Giving Pledge-a program, created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, that encourages the world's wealthiest citizens to give away at least half their wealth.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, has drawn particular criticism for its approach to federal taxes. Financial filings show that Amazon likely paid no U.S. federal income tax in 2018. The company reported a negative federal-tax charge on $11.2 billion in profits, in part because it received tax benefits by paying employees in stock rather than in wages, giving it a $1.1-billion deduction, and because of research-and-development credits that yielded a four-hundred-and-nineteen-million-dollar tax break. Most large tech firms avail themselves of similar opportunities-and Amazon, unlike Apple or Google, doesn't transfer profits to foreign countries, thus avoiding U.S. taxes. However, the company's low reported tax bill has infuriated its detractors on the left. In one of several criticisms levelled at Amazon in a recent Democratic debate, Andrew Yang said that Amazon was closing \"America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it.\" (Amazon says that last year it paid $1.2 billion in income taxes globally, but declines to disclose how much it has paid in the U.S.)</p><p>Some of Bezos's close friends and colleagues say that Amazon's tightfistedness reflects his political leanings. \"Jeff is a libertarian,\" a close acquaintance, who has known Bezos for decades, told me. \"He's donated money to support gay marriage and donated to defeat taxes because that's his basic outlook-the government shouldn't be in our bedrooms or our pocketbooks.\" One of Bezos's earliest public donations was to the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank and publisher. In 2013, he bought the Washington Post and invested heavily in its editorial operations, which remain independent; the effort has helped restore the paper's journalistic lustre (and expanded its readership). Yet he also froze the company's pension plan-a move that offered no real financial benefit to Bezos, given that the plan was already significantly overfunded-leaving some Post employees with the prospect of fewer benefits when they retired. Fredrick Kunkle, a reporter who is part of the newsroom's union leadership, said of Bezos, \"He doesn't think companies have obligations to employees beyond paying wages while they work.\" Bezos's close acquaintance agrees: \"There's an empathy gap there, something that makes it hard for him to see his obligations to other people. Seattle is filled with businesspeople-Gates and the Costco founders and the Boeing leadership-who have invested in this city. But the one time Amazon could have pitched in, on the homelessness tax, instead of taking the lead Jeff threatened to leave. It's how he sees the world.\"</p><p>Every billionaire has critics and enemies, but, when the Enquirer published Bezos's secrets, people close to him wondered if the disclosure might be part of a gambit to embarrass him and weaken him at, say, the union bargaining table, or to force him to change his philanthropic habits. Such tactics have a surprising history of success. When Alfred Sloan and G.M. were fighting labor unions and tax foes, in the nineteen-thirties, the company's critics began providing tabloids with photographs of G.M. executives enjoying their luxury sailboats and cavorting with showgirls. In 1936, the United Auto Workers staged a weeks-long sitdown strike in Flint, Michigan, and labor activists smuggled gossip about Sloan to reporters. Walter Lippman soon declared that Sloan was a \"bungling\" menace. When Sloan refused to meet with union representatives, the Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, took him to task publicly, yelling at him, \"You are a scoundrel and a skunk, Mr. Sloan! You don't deserve to be counted among decent men.\" Soon afterward, G.M. agreed to recognize the union.</p><p>In 1937, the Treasury Secretary accused Sloan of \"moral fraud\"-\"the defeat of taxes through doubtful legal devices.\" Sloan insisted that he'd actually paid sixty per cent of his income from the previous year in taxes, and given half of what remained to charity, but the attack further blighted his reputation. Eventually, Sloan caved. He donated fifteen per cent of his wealth-the modern equivalent of a hundred and eighty million dollars-to fund the Alfred\u00a0P. Sloan Foundation, and he eventually gave hundreds of millions of dollars more to universities and other organizations.</p><p>Bezos, who is reportedly worth a hundred and fourteen billion dollars, has so far donated less than three per cent of his wealth to charity. Three months after the homelessness-tax incident, he pulled a Sloan-like move: he announced the launch of a two-billion-dollar foundation named the Bezos Day One Fund. Since then, it has given grants to advocates for the homeless, and it is creating a network of Montessori-inspired preschools in low-income communities.</p><p>Fortunately for Bezos, the labor movement does not have as much power as it did in Sloan's day. When, earlier this year, Amazon cancelled its plans to open a second headquarters, in New York City, in part because of disputes with local unions, some politicians, rather than attacking Amazon, blamed the unions for scuttling the deal. In an open letter, Governor Andrew Cuomo's budget director wrote, \"Some labor unions attempted to exploit Amazon's New York entry.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The union that opposed the project gained nothing and cost other union members 11,000 good, high-paying jobs.\" Amazon currently has more than a hundred and fifty warehouses, and many of them are in economically depressed areas, where employment is scarce and politicians and workers are less likely to complain. Emily Guendelsberger, a journalist who briefly worked in an Amazon warehouse in 2015, said, \"People really want those jobs. It's gruelling, miserable work-I was taking Advil like candy. But one woman told me she drove an hour each way because Amazon paid more than the pizza place in her home town.\"</p><p>Some economists say that focussing on Amazon's miserliness or on the conditions inside its warehouses obscures larger, more positive truths. Michael Mandel, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute, told me, \"These are hard jobs, no one disputes that. They are definitely harder than office jobs, and they are harder than working in a clothing store or at a movie theatre. But wages in clothing stores have been declining for forty years, and wages have also gone down in manufacturing, and what I see is Amazon creating tens of thousands of jobs that pay thirty per cent more than competitors, that offer real benefits, that help high-school graduates get skills they need. Eventually, workers will demand that Amazon's pie gets divided more evenly. But the only reason we're even having this conversation is because Amazon has been expanding the pie for the people left behind.\"</p><p>Gavin de Becker concluded that the National Enquirer's publication of Bezos's personal data was indeed intended to serve political ends-but he didn't blame Amazon's critics on the left. De Becker began speaking with reporters, claiming that he had evidence that the Enquirer's reporting was \"politically motivated.\" He eventually claimed that the expos\u00e9 was related to Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post.</p><p>In March, de Becker laid out his accusations in the Daily Beast. \"Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos's phone, and gained private information,\" de Becker wrote, alleging that there were links between the hacking and a conspiracy related to the 2018 murder of the Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey. \"The Saudi government has been intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the Post began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi's murder,\" de Becker wrote. Now the Saudi government, with help from the Enquirer, was \"trying to strong-arm an American citizen.\" Precisely why the Saudis wanted Bezos's selfies, and what they hoped to accomplish by passing them to a tabloid, de Becker did not say. (Nobody connected to the internal investigation would discuss in detail any of its findings.)</p><p>De Becker, in his article, pointed out that in recent years the Enquirer had become overtly political. It was so closely aligned with Donald Trump that, during the 2016 Presidential race, its publisher paid hush money to silence one of the candidate's alleged mistresses. When the Enquirer's stories on Bezos appeared, President Trump-who has accused Bezos of buying the Post to wield political influence and keep Amazon's taxes low-tweeted, \"So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.\"</p><p>Reporters at mainstream publications found little evidence to substantiate de Becker's claims. The Enquirer, which was having financial difficulties, was wary of getting drawn into a possibly expensive political fight. (It was easy to imagine subpoenas coming from Capitol Hill.) The publication strenuously denied de Becker's accusations. The former American Media executive said, \"We were hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, our hedge-fund owner was getting freaked out, and it was, like, what's the endgame here? This had been a bad idea from the beginning. They wanted out.\"</p><p>A representative of American Media sent a private communication to Bezos: if he would release a statement saying that he had \"no knowledge or basis for the suggestion\" that American Media's \"coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces,\" American Media would agree \"not to publish, distribute, share or describe unpublished texts and photos.\" In a separate letter, Dylan Howard, the American Media chief content officer, described images that he claimed to have, among them a \"below the belt selfie-otherwise colloquially known as a 'd*ck pick.'\u00a0\" The company provided no evidence of having such photographs. (Their existence has never been verified.) \"It would give no editor pleasure to send this email,\" Howard wrote to Bezos's representatives. \"I hope common sense can prevail.\"</p><p>Howard's strategy backfired. Bezos posted the tabloid's correspondence on the Web site Medium, alongside an open letter. \"Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten,\" he explained. (The letter was written by Bezos and edited by his lawyers.) \"It's unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\"</p><p>It was a brilliant act of jujitsu. For the first time in years, Bezos was widely hailed in the mainstream media. (A typical tweet was \"Just in: Jeff Bezos' dick pic reveals he has balls of steel.\") Meanwhile, reporting by the Wall Street Journal and other outlets offered a simpler explanation for the hacking: the purloined messages had come from Lauren Sanchez's brother, Michael, a reality-television talent agent. The Enquirer had paid him two hundred thousand dollars for the texts. Michael Sanchez was a Trump supporter, and it was possible that the Enquirer had learned of the affair and had urged him to peek at his sister's phone. De Becker, however, still believed that his boss was the victim of a plot, and said that he was forwarding his intelligence to federal officials. For most Americans, though, the mystery seemed solved: a tabloid, not for the first time, had paid for gossip.</p><p>Within six weeks, the owners of the Enquirer had announced its sale. Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos finalized their divorce in July, and she received a thirty-eight-billion-dollar settlement. Shortly afterward, she announced that she was signing the Giving Pledge.</p><p>Bezos's personal tumult distracted Amazon's leaders at a particularly fraught time. The company's headlong growth has led to a series of scandals, and executives have been unsure how to contain the damage. Like other process companies, Amazon is learning that a flywheel, once spinning, is very hard to stop.</p><p>Several years ago, Amazon built a vast network of independent couriers to provide what's known as \"last-mile delivery\": the final leg of a package's journey to a customer's door. For years, Amazon had relied upon UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service to deliver packages. But in 2013 that system broke down; at Christmastime, tens of thousands of orders were stranded in warehouses. Amazon began constructing a delivery network of its own. Rather than build internally, however, the company signed contracts with hundreds of local drivers and courier firms, in cities across the country.</p><p>The benefit of outsourcing was that Amazon could build a delivery network quickly. Brittain Ladd, a former Amazon senior manager who specialized in logistics and operations, told me earlier this year that \"it was really easy to scale up-there's thousands of courier services out there, and so once you figure out the model you can expand it almost overnight.\"</p><p>Still, some people within Amazon, including Ladd, thought that these partnerships were a bad idea: it would be impossible for Amazon to insure that delivery companies were hiring responsible drivers and using rigorous safety protocols. \"Frankly, you have very little control over these individuals,\" Ladd told me. He said that he had hand-delivered to multiple colleagues a memo, marked \"PRIORITY: HIGH,\" in which he expressed \"grave reservations\" about relying on contractors, warning, \"I believe it is highly probable that accidents will occur resulting in serious injuries and deaths.\" He recommended instead that the company carefully build its own last-mile-delivery network, one with a \"zero-tolerance policy\" for safety violations. Ladd said to me, \"I attended meetings, and I told them that the last thing you want is a newspaper article reading 'Amazon driver high on drugs hits and kills family.' But we were growing so fast, and there was so much pressure, and if we tried to build this internally it would have taken at least a year. And so a decision was made that the risk was worth it.\"</p><p>Amazon tried to work solely with courier services that met basic safety requirements, according to a current executive who helped establish the program. But Amazon pushed only so far, deciding that it wasn't practical to compel firms to give drivers regular drug tests or to require extensive training. Local courier services are often run by inexperienced businesspeople. Meanwhile, the pressure to expand remained intense. \"We were moving very, very fast,\" a former manager who helped build the network recalled. \"We were learning as we went.\"</p><p>In 2015, Amazon contracted with a courier company called Inpax Shipping Solutions, and it began delivering packages for the company in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Miami, Dallas, and Chicago. Amazon executives apparently failed to note that Inpax's chief executive had once pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and had declared bankruptcy after defaulting on debts. After Amazon signed the deal, its executives seemed not to notice that the Department of Labor was investigating Inpax, or, later, that federal regulators had found that the company had committed numerous labor violations. Amazon also overlooked a lawsuit filed by an Inpax employee against his boss, which was documented in public records.</p><p>On December 17, 2016, a dispatcher working with Inpax received an e-mail from Amazon declaring that \"we are officially into 'no package left behind' territory.\" Five days later, an Inpax driver, Valdimar Gray, was rushing to deliver Christmas packages in Chicago when he flew through a crosswalk, hitting Telesfora Escamilla, an eighty-four-year-old woman walking home from a hair salon. Escamilla, who was dragged under the van, died. Escamilla's grandson Anthony Bijarro, who was at the scene, told me, \"Amazon killed my grandmother because they wanted packages delivered a little faster. Amazon doesn't care who's driving, they don't care if they're reckless.\" Escamilla's family has sued Inpax and Amazon. Amazon, in a statement, said that it regularly audits its delivery partners to insure that they are in compliance with the law and with Amazon's policies, and takes action \"when they aren't meeting our high bar for safety and customer experience.\" The company has terminated its relationship with Inpax. (Inpax and Gray declined to respond to questions.)</p><p>ProPublica has identified more than sixty accidents involving Amazon, all since 2015, that resulted in serious injuries or deaths. Reporters at BuzzFeed have found records naming Amazon in at least a hundred lawsuits related to accidents involving package deliveries, which have included at least six deaths. Those are likely just a fraction of such collisions, because in many cases delivery vehicles were unmarked, and victims weren't aware of Amazon's role. Ladd, the former senior manager, said, \"Amazon could have built this network in-house, or they could have acquired a logistics company to really teach them last-mile delivery, or they could have chosen partners more slowly, to make sure the right safety procedures were in place. But this was not a well-oiled machine-this was a bunch of people thrown together. They asked me for advice, and I was saying, 'There's another way to do this.'\u00a0\" If Amazon had found another way, Ladd said, \"it would have been a hell of a lot better for the people who were killed-but once the machine starts moving it takes on a life of its own.\"</p><p>As Amazon executives were becoming increasingly worried about the hazards of warp-speed growth, other pressures inside the company kept ratcheting up. Earlier this year, Amazon announced that it would soon start guaranteeing to many customers delivery in one day, rather than two, putting even more stress on couriers and workers.</p><p>A growing number of regulators in Washington, D.C., and in Europe argue that Amazon, along with other tech giants, needs to be reined in. Until the nineteen-seventies, many process companies were constrained by a fear of U.S. antitrust enforcement. Alfred Sloan always kept a close eye on the size of G.M.'s market share. \"Our bogie is forty-five per cent,\" Sloan told a reporter, in 1938. \"We don't want any more than that.\" His trepidation was justified. The federal government repeatedly sued G.M., once charging Sloan personally with criminal antitrust activity. Almost none of the suits prevailed in court, but they cowed the company.</p><p>Sloan died in 1966, and, in the decades that followed, the government's attitude toward antitrust enforcement changed. During the Reagan Administration, regulators and courts decreed that antitrust decisions should largely be based not on a company's size or on its bullying tactics but, rather, on any price hikes imposed on customers. By the time Facebook and Google appeared, giving away their products for free, and Amazon arose, with its devotion to keeping prices down, antitrust enforcement was a remote concern. The legal scholar Lina Khan, writing in the Yale Law Journal in 2017, observed, \"It is as if Bezos charted the company's growth by first drawing a map of antitrust laws, and then devising routes to smoothly bypass them.\"</p><p>Things began changing earlier this year. In June, the head of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, a Trump appointee and a respected authority on economic competition, gave a speech declaring that antitrust regulators would no longer be constrained by \"the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low.\" Delrahim's address was the equivalent of firing a starter's pistol. In a recent conversation, he told me that tech companies \"should think very seriously about their conduct,\" adding, \"If you're one of the big guys, you should be careful to make sure you don't snuff out competitors because you think that's good for your business. That's not what free markets really mean, and we're going to come down on you like a ton of bricks if that's what you do.\"</p><p>Soon after Delrahim's speech, it was reported that the F.T.C. had issued subpoenas for data regarding third-party sales on Amazon. In July, the E.U. declared that it was investigating Amazon, and the U.S. House of Representatives held a hearing and interrogated an Amazon lawyer about how the company harvests data. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, asked the lawyer, \"You're saying that you don't use that in any way to promote Amazon products? I remind you, sir, you're under oath.\" The attorney replied that the firm shows customers only the best product, regardless of who profits from the sale, and that Amazon did nothing untoward.</p><p>Many members of Congress suspect otherwise. Cicilline, who chairs the House's antitrust subcommittee, told me, \"There's bipartisan consensus that we have a responsibility to get these markets working again. More competition means better protection of privacy. It means better control of your data. It means more innovation.\" Elizabeth Warren, one of the most forceful critics of the tech industry, has said that, if she wins the Presidency, she intends to break up Amazon, Facebook, and Google. She has proposed making it illegal for companies such as Amazon to own online marketplaces and at the same time to sell goods on those platforms. \"Amazon crushes small companies,\" Warren wrote, in a plan for expanding online competition. If she is elected, she said, \"small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business.\"</p><p>Other regulators and lawmakers are more measured in their proposals and their rhetoric, but a loose consensus has emerged around a group of concerns, which some people refer to as the Four \"C\"s. The first is concentration. A high-ranking F.T.C. official told me, \"The bigger a tech company becomes, the more they can bully, so we need to put hard caps on how big companies like that can grow, on what they can acquire.\"</p><p>Rohit Chopra, one of the F.T.C.'s five commissioners, told me that the second \"C\" is the conflict of interest that comes from \"both controlling the pipe and selling the oil.\" Chopra, who agreed to speak only about antitrust generally and not about Amazon specifically, explained, \"If you do both, you will structure your marketplace in a way that ultimately is self-dealing, and you will use the data from those who sell on your marketplace to benefit yourself.\" There's a long history of the government forcing industries to separate distribution and sales; for years, movie studios have generally been prohibited from owning movie theatres.</p><p>The next area of concern is contracts. Big tech companies often make highly restrictive deals with smaller venders. Amazon retains a contractual right to hold sellers' revenues for long periods after a sale, and imposes limits on what data sellers can share with other companies. Another F.T.C. commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, told me, \"There are a lot of terms that go into boilerplate contracts that consumers or workers don't really have an opportunity to negotiate. It is absolutely appropriate for us to be thinking about banning those.\"</p><p>Lastly, regulators worry about the complexity of current antitrust law. \"You really have to be an expert, or hire an expert attorney, if you feel like one of these companies is acting inappropriately,\" an F.T.C. official said. \"The law only works when it is simple enough for the little guy to bring an action on their own.\"</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate's subcommittee on antitrust, told me that such reforms are bound by a central idea: \"The big tech companies are completely reshaping the way we buy goods and sell goods in the marketplace, our privacy rules, and our democracy rules, without any checks and balances from the government.\" She continued, \"So many people are finally getting tired of the dominance. When Amazon starts owning Whole Foods, when they control the producers, when they control all the parts of the supply chain-people deserve a level playing field.\" American history, Klobuchar said, shows that such imbalances can spark widespread activism. \"This goes back to the Founders and the Boston Tea Party,\" she said. \"These are highly emotional political moments.\"</p><p>Amazon has responded to the mounting political threat by expanding its lobbying efforts. Federal records indicate that, in 2018, Amazon lobbied more government bodies than any other U.S. tech company. It has made its case across Washington, to senators, representatives, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, even NASA. Much of Amazon's lobbying has been devoted to winning government contracts: it is a leading contender for a ten-billion-dollar project to centralize the Department of Defense's cloud computing. But a former federal official who works on antitrust issues told me that the company's other lobbying was \"about telling us that, if you even think about breaking up Amazon, you're going to make markets less efficient, and there are going to be a lot of lost jobs-and Amazon employs a ton of people in your district.\"</p><p>Amazon has a Twitter account devoted to cheery photographs and videos of lawmakers touring warehouses, posing alongside rows of Amazon trucks, and putting items in boxes. (If the videos are any indication, legislators are permitted to work much more slowly than Amazon productivity standards require.) Such theatrics used to serve the company well. However, a regulator who is familiar with Amazon's lobbying said that \"there's been a bit of hubris, because, in the past, they were able to tell a story about how consumers love them. But now that's changing, and it's very concerning to them.\"</p><p>According to Amazon insiders, Bezos adamantly refuses to consider slowing the company's growth, fearing that its culture will break down if the pace slackens. He is determined to defend his creation aggressively. For years, Amazon was largely content to remain silent amid criticism-one Leadership Principle is \"We accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time\"-but the company now responds to nearly every provocation. In June, after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on television that Bezos's wealth is \"predicated on paying people starvation wages and stripping them of their ability to access health care,\" Amazon's communications and policy chief, Jay Carney, went on the attack, tweeting, \"All our employees get top-tier benefits. I'd urge @AOC to focus on raising the federal minimum wage instead of making stuff up about Amazon.\" That month, the Times ran an article accusing the company of \"a kind of lawlessness\" in its bookstore: counterfeit medical textbooks were for sale, and Amazon seemed unconcerned with \"the authenticity, much less the quality, of what it sells.\" A long rebuttal appeared on Amazon's blog, arguing that \"nothing could be further from the truth\" and accusing the reporter of cherry-picking examples. Last year, Amazon tapped a group of warehouse workers to be a kind of Twitter rapid-response army, deputizing them as \"ambassadors.\" When a Bernie Sanders supporter tweeted that Amazon was anti-union, a fulfillment-center employee, @AmazonFCJanet, fired back, \"Unions are thieves.\"</p><p>Amazon offered few specifics on its lobbying activities. \"There is abundant competition in the retail sector, and many retailers are thriving,\" the company wrote in response to questions. \"There is no power imbalance between Amazon and the sellers and vendors who work with us.\"</p><p>Executives at Amazon have argued to regulators and lawmakers that the company is distinct in fundamental ways from Facebook and Google. Whereas those firms essentially created their industries, Amazon's realm-the retail marketplace-has existed since the dawn of commerce. \"The idea that there is only one marketplace is demonstrably false,\" the company wrote in a statement, noting that Walmart still brings in more revenue than it does. Amazon executives point out that, if you ignore the distinction between online and real-world sales, Amazon is responsible for about four per cent of U.S. retail transactions. \"If we do not compete on prices, selection, delivery speed and customer service, customers will choose other competitors,\" the company statement noted.</p><p>Part of Amazon's defensiveness stems from executives' conviction that regulators' concerns are based not on logic but on a misguided understanding of retail. One executive told me that the real problem is that Amazon is disproportionately popular among lawmakers. Congressional aides, high-profile journalists, and other \u00e9lites often use Amazon to buy kitchen supplies and Christmas gifts. They watch \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and shop at Whole Foods. They don't even know the location of the nearest Walmart, the executive said, and therefore think that Amazon is much more powerful than it really is.</p><p>Perhaps it's true that policymakers would have a broader perspective if they logged more hours at Costco. But, in any case, Amazon now has such a severe image problem that it can no longer count on being able to do whatever it pleases. High-ranking executives allow that there are some limited concessions Bezos is willing to make, such as donating more of his wealth to charity. And Amazon may agree to strengthen its oversight of drivers and of workers' safety. One executive told me that Amazon is determined to remain open-minded and polite with regulators; one of Microsoft's missteps in the nineties, he said, was that it was dismissive. But few of the current Amazon executives I spoke with said that the company needed to make major changes. And few believed that regulators would compel them to do so. After all, Amazon employs hundreds of thousands of people across the nation, many of them voters, and has warehouses in dozens of states. A tech lobbyist told me, \"Neither Facebook nor Google has that. Sometimes you survive just because there are other targets to absorb the blows.\"</p><p>Bezos, after attracting scandal earlier this year, has lately sought to recede. His media appearances have become rare and highly scripted. When he was onstage this past summer at one of his few recent public outings-an Amazon conference in Las Vegas-the performance was studiously boring, a clear attempt to rob himself of glamour. While Bezos was droning on, a protester jumped on the stage, shouting something about chickens and terrible conditions on industrial farms. Bezos froze, as if worried that the smallest bacterium of controversy might prove contagious. After the woman was removed, he glanced around and said, \"I'm sorry-where were we?\"</p><p>Within Amazon, there are concerns that, no matter how strenuously Bezos embraces banality, he can't be dull enough. \"We have all this attention now,\" a former executive complained. Since Bezos and Lauren Sanchez went public with their relationship, they have regularly appeared in gossip columns. The New York Post's Page Six has reported on the swimsuit that Bezos wore in Saint-Tropez (\"quirky, octopus-print trunks\"), and how he met Sanchez's parents at the N.F.L. Hall of Fame (\"This all leads Amazon sources to ponder how long it will be before the couple say 'I do'\u00a0\").</p><p>The government's scrutiny of General Motors never scored any fatal hits-one antitrust lawsuit dragged on for years, ending in a dismissal-but the scar tissue was damaging enough. David Farber, a University of Kansas historian who wrote a biography of Alfred\u00a0P. Sloan, told me that the G.M. executive \"didn't see himself as someone that needed to be loved or respected by the public, but eventually even he gave in.\" He noted a pattern in American history: \"There's an economic revolution, it creates amazing new opportunities, and then the companies that seize those opportunities become so powerful that the people revolt-they say the winners have become too powerful, they start attacking the people who are the embodiments of winning, sometimes with gossip, sometimes with facts. And then we have an era of constraint enforced by the federal government.\" We may be at a breaking point now. \"It's like the eighteen-eighties or the nineteen-thirties all over again,\" Farber said. \"The pressure is going to continue building, the powerful are going to continue being watched and criticized and gawked at, until something pops.\"</p><p>Jeff Wilke, the Bezos deputy, told me that all process companies eventually falter. The challenge is to stave off decline as long as possible. Day Two, he said, \"is inevitable-the question is when.\" When Day Two does arrive at Amazon, at least Ian Freed, the executive who oversaw the Kindle and the Echo, won't have to suffer through it. A few years ago, he consulted an internal Amazon application called the Old Fart Tool, which shows employees how many new people have been hired since their first day, and discovered that more than three hundred thousand workers had joined Amazon since he started there. Freed had come to Amazon because he loved being at a place that moved fast and did the impossible. He was proud of his work-once, while on vacation in Mexico, he had peeked into his sons' hotel room and seen their Game Boys lying on the nightstand while they read on their Kindles. \"That was pretty special,\" he told me. \"For the rest of my life, I can tell my grandchildren that I built the Amazon Kindle and the Amazon Echo.\"</p><p>Yet Amazon had changed, and Freed missed the old days. He wanted to spend more time living by Leadership Principles that were loftier than simply selling everything as fast and as cheaply as possible. He wanted to see if his next flywheels could power a project with higher ideals. Such goals wouldn't likely have satisfied Amazon's constant hunger, but to Freed they seemed satisfying enough. And Freed no longer had to worry about earning a salary: during his tenure at Amazon, its stock price had gone from forty-three dollars to $1,052 a share. And so in 2017 he quit Amazon, and not long afterward he founded Bamboo Learning, a company that builds voice-activated education software. One product teaches kids how to do division when they say, \"Alexa, open Bamboo Math.\" The startup has only two full-time employees. Freed just signed his first big contract, with the publisher Highlights for Children. \"It just got to the point where I wanted to do something different,\" he told me. \"I wanted to work with nonprofits and feel like I'm contributing in a different way. If this succeeds, we'll bring education to parts of the world where you can't get print books, where companies don't deliver things overnight, where it's not even guaranteed that people are literate.\"</p><p>Freed is building something that is neither strictly a product company nor a process company. It will be both grander and more modest in its ambitions than Amazon, which Bezos has famously described as \"the everything store.\" Freed told me, \"It's another chance to change the world. A smaller change, but it's real, and it feels important to me. It's something that deserves all of what I've learned.\"\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_1019_23</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-3CX1-DYWH-90M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

But Jeff Bezos is ready to use his power to fight back.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2017, a few months after Forbes named Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, the world's richest man, a rumor spread among the company's executives: Bill Gates, the former wealthiest person on earth, had called Bezos's assistant to schedule a lunch, asking if Tuesday or Wednesday was available. The assistant informed Bezos of the invitation, and told him that both days were open. Bezos, who had built an empire exhorting employees to be \"vocally self-critical,\" and to never \"believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume,\" issued a command: Make it Thursday.</p><p>Bezos's power play was so mild that it likely wasn't noticed by Gates, but within Amazon the story sparked a small panic (and, later, an official denial). Such a willful act of vanity felt like a bad omen. At Amazon's headquarters, in Seattle, the company's fourteen Leadership Principles-painted on walls, posted in bathrooms, printed on laminated cards in executives' wallets-urge employees to \"never say 'that's not my job,'\u00a0\" to \"examine their strongest convictions with humility,\" to \"not compromise for the sake of social cohesion,\" and to commit to excellence even if \"people may think these standards are unreasonably high.\" (When I recently asked various employees to recite the precepts, they did so with alarming gusto: \"\u00a0'Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention!'\u00a0\") A former executive said, \"That's how we earn our success-we're willing to be frugal and egoless, and obsessed with delighting our customers.\"</p><p>Amazon is now America's second-largest private employer. (Walmart is the largest.) It traffics more than a third of all retail products bought or sold online in the U.S.; it owns Whole Foods and helps arrange the shipment of items purchased across the Web, including on eBay and Etsy. Amazon's Web-services division powers vast portions of the Internet, from Netflix to the C.I.A. You probably contribute to Amazon's profits whether you intend to or not. Critics say that Amazon, much like Google and Facebook, has grown too large and powerful to be trusted. Everyone from Senator Elizabeth Warren to President Donald Trump has depicted Amazon as dangerously unconstrained. This past summer, at a debate among the Democratic Presidential candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders said, \"Five hundred thousand Americans are sleeping out on the street, and yet companies like Amazon, that made billions in profits, did not pay one nickel in federal income tax.\" And Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, declared that Amazon has \"destroyed the retail industry across the United States.\" The Federal Trade Commission and the European Union, meanwhile, are independently pursuing investigations of Amazon for potential antitrust violations. In recent months, inquiries by news organizations have documented Amazon's sale of illegal or deadly products, and have exposed how the company's fast-delivery policies have resulted in drivers speeding down streets and through intersections, killing people. Company insiders were accustomed to complaints from rivals at book publishers or executives at big-box stores. Those attacks rarely felt personal. Now, a recently retired Amazon executive told me, \"people are worried-we're suddenly on the firing line.\"</p><p>Amazon executives were also concerned about dramatic changes within the company. In 2015, Amazon had roughly two hundred thousand employees. Since then, its workforce had nearly tripled. Bezos, now fifty-five, had transformed as well, from a pudgy bookseller with an elephant-seal laugh to a sleek, muscled mogul whose empire included a television-and-movie studio. (Bezos declined to be interviewed for this article.) Amazon executives comforted themselves with the thought that, even if the story about the Bill Gates lunch was true, at least their boss wasn't reckless, like, say, Elon Musk or Travis Kalanick or Adam Neumann. Many admired Bezos's dedication to his wife and children, and saw it as an embodiment of the company's integrity. Still, they whispered, what if his flywheel has gone off track?</p><p>The notion of the flywheel-the heavy disk within a machine that, once spinning, pushes gears and production relentlessly forward-is venerated within Amazon, as Ian Freed learned on his first day of work, in 2004. Freed had initially glimpsed the power of the Internet as a Harvard student, when he guessed an e-mail address in Indonesia that led him to strike up a correspondence with the country's minister of telecommunications. After graduating, Freed built computer networks in Russia and drafted policy papers for the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development. He felt that every organization he advised failed to take advantage of all the opportunities created by the Internet. He moved to the West Coast, where he became an expert in streaming networks. Then he joined Amazon, as a director of its fledgling mobile-services team. During an orientation that included a warehouse stint unloading boxes of shampoo and stocking shelves with toothpaste, he realized that people at the company saw things in a fundamentally different way.</p><p>Most firms have a mission statement that even the C.E.O. has trouble remembering. Amazon employees, Freed discovered, studied the Leadership Principles like Talmudic texts. During his first few years, he occasionally pulled colleagues, and even Bezos, aside to ask questions. What, for example, does \"leaders are right a lot\" really mean? Bezos explained, \"If you have a really good idea, stick to it, but be flexible on how you get there. Be stubborn on your vision but flexible on the details.\" Executives at other companies tended to lay out definitive plans. But Bezos urged his people to be adaptable. \"People who are right a lot change their mind,\" he once said. \"They have the same data set that they had at the beginning, but they wake up, and they re-analyze things all the time, and they come to a new conclusion, and then they change their mind.\" Freed often felt an impulse to answer his subordinates' questions, but at Amazon leaders are encouraged to let team members puzzle out problems on their own.</p><p>About a year after joining the company, Freed became Bezos's technical assistant, which gave him entr\u00e9e to almost any meeting and provided a deep education in the company's culture. Amazon's internal processes were \"mechanisms,\" Freed learned, as in \"What's the mechanism for talking to the press?\" Executives were expected to reduce \"complexifiers,\" and someone who failed to suggest ways to simplify a process might be interrupted by Bezos asking, \"Are you lazy or just incompetent?\"</p><p>The Leadership Principles were never paraphrased; when a question over wording arose, the laminated cards were often whipped out. PowerPoint was discouraged. Product proposals had to be written out as six-page narratives-Bezos believed that storytelling forced critical thinking-accompanied by a mock press release. Meetings started with a period of silent reading, and each proposal concluded with a list of F.A.Q.s, such as \"What will most disappoint the customer on the first day of release?\"</p><p>Tech companies are often profligate, but Amazon had an ethic of thrift. Freed learned to anticipate the eye rolls that greeted new employees who printed on just one side of paper, or the admonishment coming to anyone who wanted to book a business-class seat. Whenever Amazon moved to new offices, Bezos had them furnished with cheap desks made from wooden doors. Whereas other tech companies supplied employees with an array of free meals and snacks, Amazon offered only coffee and bananas. (In a statement, Amazon said that it is \"frugal on behalf of our customers.\")</p><p>Freed and other Amazonians were delighted by the company's quirks. Bezos amused his colleagues when he humble-bragged about being such a sci-fi nerd that he owned a Jean-Luc Picard uniform from \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\" And staffers loved it when Amazon offered a promotion, known as Share the Pi, in which customers were given a discount of 1.57 per cent (3.14 divided by two). When Amazon leaders joined the low-carb craze, they ended meetings debating the finer points of ketosis, and raced one another up the stairs. It wasn't fair to call Amazon a cult, but it wasn't entirely unfair, either. \"We never claim that our approach is the right one,\" Bezos wrote, in a 2016 letter to shareholders. \"Just that it's ours.\"</p><p>Above all, Freed loved Amazon's focus on spinning its flywheels faster, and finding new markets where they could whirl. \"Amazon's culture is designed to prevent bureaucracies,\" he told me. \"Everything Jeff does is to stop a big-company mentality from taking hold, so that Amazon can continue behaving like a group of startups.\" Among the worst sins was doing anything that slowed the company down. (As the Leadership Principles put it, \"Speed matters.\") Freed was soon assigned to help oversee the creation of a new e-reader, the Kindle. His team expanded quickly (\"Hire and Develop the Best\"), came up with dozens of concepts and prototypes (\"Invent and Simplify\"), and, in just a few years, delivered a device of startling simplicity and elegance. When the Kindle was launched, in 2007, it sold out in less than six hours, and soon became one of the most popular gadgets of the past quarter century.</p><p>As Freed learned, it was also fine to stumble at Amazon, as long as the experience yielded strategic insight. After overseeing the Kindle, Freed was asked to help lead a team developing the company's first smartphone. Bezos had become enamored of a sophisticated display that approximated 3-D. For four years, Freed oversaw a group that grew to a thousand employees, and spent more than a hundred million dollars. But when the Amazon Fire Phone was released, in 2014, it was a flop. No matter: when Freed had presented an early prototype of the phone's software to Bezos, he'd shown him how it included voice recognition that could hear, and then play, any popular song whose title a user said aloud. \"I can ask for any song?\" Bezos asked. \"What about 'Hotel California'?\" The tune began playing. \"This is fantastic,\" he said.</p><p>A few days after that presentation, Bezos asked Freed to help build a cloud-based computer that responded to voice commands, like the one in \"Star Trek.\" Freed started amassing a team that eventually reached two hundred people, and was given a fifty-million-dollar budget. The Fire Phone's voice-recognition technology had been licensed from another firm, and wasn't an exact fit for what Amazon was seeking. So Freed and his team hired speech scientists and artificial-intelligence experts, and created new software that could comprehend someone from Louisiana as well as someone from Liverpool-and distinguish the babble of a toddler from parents talking with food in their mouths. The team chose a name (and a \"wakeup\" word) for the device by considering hundreds of possibilities, before landing on Alexa-a name that was sufficiently familiar yet unusual enough to avoid too many accidental commands. Just four months after releasing the disastrous Fire Phone, Freed revealed the Echo, a voice-activated speaker that can tell you the weather, compile a grocery list, remind you to take a pie out of the oven, and play \"Hotel California.\" The initial price was a hundred and ninety-nine dollars. Today, you can buy one for half that, and fifty million homes have them.</p><p>Around the time of the Echo's launch, Amazon wrote off more than a hundred and seventy million dollars in costs associated with the Fire Phone. Bezos told Freed, \"You can't, for one minute, feel bad about the Fire Phone. Promise me you won't lose a minute of sleep.\" By 2015, Freed was a vice-president and Amazon was the most valuable retailer in the world.</p><p>Identifying and building flywheels became second nature to Freed. When a junior executive came by his desk with an idea-\"What if we made a streaming device that you could plug into a television?\"-Freed invited him to lunch, coached him through writing a mock press release, and took him to pitch the idea to Bezos. They reminded Bezos that, with existing streaming devices, searching for content was difficult. \"It's really hard to type 'Gene Hackman movies from the nineteen-seventies' when you're using a remote control,\" Freed explained. Amazon's product, he said, would allow customers to simply say what they wanted to watch. The flywheel began spinning. If Amazon sold a streaming device, it could collect more data on popular shows; if Amazon had that data, it could begin profitably producing its own premium movies and television series; if Amazon made that content free for Prime members-customers who already paid ninety-nine dollars per year for two-day delivery-then more people would sign up for Prime; if more people signed up for Prime, the company would have greater leverage in negotiating with UPS and FedEx; lower shipping costs would mean bigger profits every time Amazon sold anything on its site. The Amazon Fire TV, as the device was named, soon became one of the most popular streaming devices on the planet. Amazon Studios began producing premium shows, and before long it had won two Oscars for \"Manchester by the Sea\" and eight Emmys for \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\" In 2017, the number of AmazonPrime subscribers surpassed a hundred million.</p><p>Although Freed was thriving at Amazon, he could see that there was something dizzying about its flywheel mentality. \"It was hard,\" he said. \"That's the culture-do whatever it takes, even if it seems impossible.\" Amazon's obsession with expansion made it the corporate equivalent of a colonizer, ruthlessly invading new industries and subjugating many smaller companies along the way. In 2006, the company had launched Fulfillment by Amazon, an initiative in which outside sellers-everyone from mom-and-pop venders to major Chinese manufacturers-housed inventory inside Amazon's giant warehouses and paid a fee for Amazon to handle logistics, such as packing and shipping products and fielding customer-service calls. Companies enrolled in Fulfillment by Amazon often appeared in the Buy Box, the top search listing on Amazon.com. To participate, many venders had to pay about two dollars per item. They also had to let Bezos collect valuable data on which products were becoming popular and which companies were having trouble satisfying demand. Soon, some venders felt as though they had to participate in Fulfillment by Amazon; they couldn't otherwise attract much attention on Amazon.com, or ship products inexpensively enough to compete with rivals.</p><p>Today, Amazon.com lists more than three hundred and thirty million products sold by other companies. Scott Needham, whose company, BuyBoxer, sells about seventy thousand products on Amazon, ranging from toys to sporting goods, paid the company roughly twenty million dollars in fees last year. \"There's really no other choice,\" Needham said. \"There's a lot of things I don't like about Amazon, but that's where all the customers are.\" Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives and the European Union began scrutinizing Fulfillment by Amazon and similar programs, out of concern that they impede competition. \"Amazon is the gatekeeper,\" Needham said. \"It makes all the rules.\"</p><p>Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia, said, \"Amazon is a microeconomist's wet dream. If you're a consumer, it's perfect for maximizing the efficiency of finding what you want and getting it as cheap and fast as possible. But, the thing is, most of us aren't just consumers. We're also producers, or manufacturers, or employees, or we live in cities where retailers have gone out of business because they can't compete with Amazon, and so Amazon kind of pits us against ourselves.\"</p><p>Freed loved how things whizzed along at Amazon headquarters, but he understood that the \"Speed matters\" credo meant something different at the warehouses. \"Is it the role of a company to only do what's best for shareholders?\" he asked me. \"Yes, shareholders are critical, but it's also important to understand the impact on employees.\" More than a hundred thousand people work at Amazon's fulfillment centers, and nearly everything they do is digitally tracked and evaluated, meaning that if someone falls behind-even for just a few minutes-it can be grounds for reprimand. Many employees carry handheld scanners that deliver a constant stream of instructions, such as a countdown clock detailing how many seconds remain until the next item must be plucked from a shelf. Workers can walk more than fifteen miles a day, and their breaks, including trips to the bathroom, are brief and closely measured. A company document explains, \"Amazon's system tracks the rates of each individual associate's productivity and automatically generates any warnings or terminations regarding quality of productivity without input from supervisors.\" A former warehouse employee told me that she knew of people who got fired largely \"because they were too old, or their knees started acting up, or they just had a bad week.\" She added, \"Managers are always vague about what will get you fired, which creates this paranoia.\" Employees, she said, sometimes ask questions about \"what exactly will get them fired, and the responses are so vague that you basically know that if you're not constantly moving, you're probably gone.\" Employees line up at vending machines that dispense free over-the-counter painkillers. For years, some Amazon warehouses lacked sufficient air-conditioning; this changed only after reports emerged, in 2011, of workers passing out and requiring emergency medical treatment for heat-related problems.</p><p>William Stolz, who has worked for two years at an Amazon warehouse in Shakopee, Minnesota, told me that he's expected to grab an item every eight seconds, and has seen co-workers injure their wrists, knees, shoulders, and backs by repeatedly kneeling, or by rushing up and down ladders. \"There's a constant pressure to hit your numbers,\" he said. If you get four writeups within ninety days for falling below the expected productivity rate, you will be fired. Stolz said, \"I've seen people who aren't even thirty years old get injuries they're going to have for the rest of their lives, but whenever we ask for the speed of work or the repetitive motions to be changed we're told that's not going to happen.\"</p><p>When Safiyo Mohamed moved from Somalia to Minnesota, in 2016, at the age of twenty-two, she found work at the Shakopee warehouse, sorting products and moving boxes on and off conveyors. The job was taxing and the pressure relentless, she said. One day, when she picked up a heavy box, she tore an intervertebral disk in her back. The pain was excruciating, but Amazon didn't offer her time off; her managers seemed not to care. \"If you can't work all the time, you are nothing to them,\" she said. A doctor told her that the injury was pinching a nerve, and that the discomfort might never abate. She quit Amazon, and got an office job that allows her to pause, or stretch, when her back hurts. \"How am I going to have a baby when I can't pick him up, when I'm worried about being pregnant?\" Mohamed said. \"I'm so angry. Amazon doesn't want humans, they want robots. I will have this forever because of them. They don't care at all.\"</p><p>At Amazon's corporate headquarters, many executives' performances are similarly quantified and ranked. \"It can be a hard place for women,\" a former executive told me. \"If you have a kid, it's a disadvantage to your career, unless your husband is the primary parent.\" (Amazon said, in a statement, that it \"disagrees strongly with this perspective,\" and noted that it offers twenty weeks of paid parental leave.) A former senior female executive told me she counselled younger colleagues that \"it's not the company's job to create a work-life balance-it's your job,\" adding, \"The idea of a company as a caretaker is not our culture.\" There is only one woman on Amazon's S-Team, the group of eighteen executives who largely run the firm. The lack of female representation is a sensitive topic at the company. A current high-ranking executive told me, \"I'm not sure it would be any different for a woman at an investment bank or a big law firm. The pace is fast, yes, and it's not for everyone or every stage of life, but these are highly compensated people who know they can easily get other jobs. No one works at Amazon-at least, in corporate-unless they want to.\"</p><p>Amazon argues that criticisms of working conditions in its warehouses are unfair. Dave Clark, the senior vice-president for worldwide operations, told me that work expectations at its facilities \"are very achievable for folks.\" He said that the company has increasingly automated its warehouses, to ease physical tasks. \"We make mistakes,\" Clark said. \"And, when we do hear about it, we learn from it, and we go out and fix it.\" Amazon pays all U.S.-based employees at least fifteen dollars an hour-more than the minimum wage in many places-and full-time warehouse workers have access to the same health and retirement plans as executives. A company statement noted that workers at Amazon begin and end every shift with a short meeting and a group stretching session; it also said that employee performance is evaluated over extended periods, noting, \"We would never dismiss an employee without first ensuring that they had received our fullest support, including dedicated coaching.\"</p><p>Many Amazon executives have become defensive about the fact that even centrist politicians like Joe Biden see the company as a symbol of capitalism gone awry. (On Twitter, Biden recently said of Amazon, \"No company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.\") Jeff Wilke, one of Bezos's top lieutenants, told me that Amazon \"tries to be a good corporate citizen,\" and added, \"We've built a for-profit enterprise that is improving the lives of customers and taking great care of employees. There's a lot to be proud of.\" The company, he said, has committed to spending seven hundred million dollars to train its workers in such subjects as coding and robotics. One senior Amazon executive said of its warehouses, \"It's a hard economy for people without college degrees right now. We can't run a philanthropy, but we're trying to be the best of those bad kinds of jobs.\" Another top executive suggested that Amazon was merely a cog in the American economic machine-and inevitably reflected how contemporary inequality had created winners and losers. \"We're doing what we can,\" he said. \"But ultimately this is a problem only the government can really solve-by changing how the economy works.\"</p><p>Amazon has always been unabashed about being a cutthroat competitor. When the company started, in 1995, with fewer than a dozen employees, Bezos considered naming it Relentless. (The company still owns the URL for relentless.com-it redirects you to Amazon.com.) Amazonians know that outsiders want them to change, but listening to outsiders is not one of the Leadership Principles. One executive told me, with barely suppressed resentment, \"What has made us great for so long is suddenly being seen as something we ought to be ashamed of!\"</p><p>In 1913, an employee of the Ford Motor Company went to the Swift &amp; Co. meatpacking plant, in Chicago, to study how hogs moved through the facility on conveyor belts while butchers stayed in place, making the same cut again and again. Someone prepared the carcass; another person cut the left haunch; another was responsible for incisions along the shoulder. The knives never stopped moving as the animals sped through the plant. When the Ford employee returned to headquarters, he told his colleagues, \"If they can kill pigs and cows that way, we can build cars that way.\" The man's boss, Henry Ford, a lifelong tinkerer, had developed a radical new product: an automobile, with an inexpensive internal-combustion engine, that could be manufactured in a couple of days and sold for less than a thousand dollars. When Ford managers heard about the meatpacking plant, they began work on another major innovation: the mechanized assembly line. Within four years, Ford's plants could manufacture a car in less than two hours and sell it for about four hundred dollars.</p><p>In 1918, a man named Alfred\u00a0P. Sloan began working as an executive at a much smaller company, General Motors. Sloan wasn't especially interested in automobiles. He loved making money-and figuring out how to manage people in order to make profits grow faster. Once installed at G.M., Sloan staged a coup by way of a memo, \"Organization Study,\" which eventually reoriented the firm around himself and a set of foundational credos that included five \"objectives.\" A chart of eighty-nine boxes connected by a blizzard of lines mapped out each executive's place in the hierarchy. It was the first org chart of its kind. Sloan's theory was that G.M. could codify the processes that delivered information up to headquarters and guidance down to managers. \"If the whole General Motors central organization should be hit by an atomic bomb, Pontiac could go on just exactly the same,\" Sloan boasted to a reporter. Soon, the company had standard procedures for budgeting, hiring, firing, prototyping, promoting, and resolving disputes. Within this rigid framework, executives were given the freedom to be creative; G.M. essentially became the first company to segment the automobile market, selling Chevrolets to the middle class and Cadillacs to the wealthy.</p><p>When Sloan joined the company, G.M. was on the verge of bankruptcy. Within a decade, it had outpaced Ford, becoming the nation's largest carmaker, and for the next eighty years it dominated the auto business and, eventually, a wide variety of other industries. Sloan's systems made G.M. one of the country's biggest loan financiers and a powerful real-estate investor, and placed it among the largest manufacturers of refrigerators, industrial magnets, home appliances, aeronautic equipment, military gear, and medical equipment. In 1952, G.M. made the first mechanical heart. Sloan launched a sophisticated corporate polling division-another first-that uncovered customer tastes that other companies had overlooked; the R.\u00a0&amp;\u00a0D. department used this information to create new products. The same playbook that dreamed up Cadillac's space-age tail fins was soon designing sleek Frigidaire iceboxes. G.M., in other words, was adept at creating flywheels. It sold plenty of cars, but, unlike Ford, it wasn't a product company-it was a process company.</p><p>Silicon Valley is filled with product companies. Google invented two products-a spectacular search engine and a set of algorithms for matching people's online behavior to ads-that today deliver eighty-five per cent of its revenue. Facebook invented (and acquired) addictive social-media products and then basically imitated Google's ad-matching algorithms, and gets ninety-eight per cent of its revenue from those products.</p><p>Amazon is a process company. Last year, it collected a hundred and twenty-two billion dollars from online retail sales, and another forty-two billion by helping other firms sell and ship their own goods. The company collected twenty-six billion dollars from its Web-services division, which has little to do with selling things to consumers, and fourteen billion more from people who sign up for such subscription services as AmazonPrime or Kindle Unlimited. Amazon is estimated to have taken in hundreds of millions of dollars from selling the Echo. Seventeen billion came from sales at such brick-and-mortar stores as Whole Foods. And then there's ten billion from ad sales and other activities too numerous to list in financial filings. No other tech company does as many unrelated things, on such a scale, as Amazon.</p><p>Amazon is special not because of any asset or technology but because of its culture-its Leadership Principles and internal habits. Bezos refers to the company's management style as Day One Thinking: a willingness to treat every morning as if it were the first day of business, to constantly re\u00ebxamine even the most closely held beliefs. \"Day Two is stasis,\" Bezos wrote, in a 2017 letter to shareholders. \"Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day One.\"</p><p>For many entrepreneurs, Amazon has been a godsend. David Ashley, who sells handcrafted address signs from Jackson, Mississippi, told me, \"We probably wouldn't be in business without Amazon.\" The 2008 recession almost killed Ashley's small company. Then he began selling his signs on Amazon and discovered that-for forty dollars a month and fifteen per cent of each sale-Amazon would handle such tasks as processing credit-card transactions, identifying potential customers, and helping to insure that products were delivered on time. \"But the biggest thing is that people trust Amazon,\" Ashley said. \"And so they trust us.\" More than 1.9 million small businesses in the United States take advantage of Amazon's services. Last year, nearly two hundred thousand sellers earned at least a hundred thousand dollars each on the site.</p><p>Other retailers, however, don't share Ashley's enthusiasm. When David Kahan became the chief executive of Birkenstock Americas, in 2013, he began to discover how thoroughly Amazon had changed his industry. Kahan had started his career as a shoe salesman at Macy's; he went on to become a sales manager at Nike and, eventually, a top executive at Reebok. Birkenstocks have been made by hand, in Germany, for two hundred and forty-five years-thirty-two workers touch every pair. When Kahan became C.E.O., Amazon was among the company's top three shoe sellers. \"They sold millions of dollars' worth of our shoes,\" Kahan told me. \"But during my first year I was sitting in my office, where I can hear the customer-service department, and we were getting a flood of people saying their shoes were falling apart, or they were defective, or they were clearly counterfeits, and, every time the rep asked where they had been purchased, the customer said Amazon.\"</p><p>Kahan investigated, and found that numerous companies were selling counterfeit or unauthorized Birkenstocks on Amazon; many were using Fulfillment by Amazon to ship their products, which caused them to appear prominently in search results. \"We would ask Amazon to take sellers down-or, at least, tell us who is counterfeiting-but they said they couldn't divulge private information,\" Kahan told me.</p><p>Kahan also discovered that Amazon had started buying enormous numbers of Birkenstocks to resell on the site. The company had amassed more than a year's worth of inventory. \"That was terrifying, because it meant we could totally lose control of our brand,\" he said. \"What if Amazon decides to start selling the shoes for ninety-nine cents, or to give them away with Prime membership, or do a buy-one-get-one-free campaign? It would completely destroy how people see our shoes, and our only power to prevent something like that is to cut off a retailer's supply. But Amazon had a year's worth of inventory. We were powerless.\"</p><p>Kahan spent months trying to negotiate with Amazon executives in Seattle. At the Birkenstock Americas office, in Marin County, California, he and his deputies would spend hours preparing arguments about why stopping unauthorized sellers would help Amazon's customers, and then they'd crowd around Kahan's desk and turn on the speakerphone. Sometimes the Amazon executives would let them go on; other times, they'd cut them off midsentence. It wasn't Amazon's place to decide who could and couldn't sell on the site, the executives explained, as long as simple guidelines were met. \"They basically didn't care,\" Kahan said. \"We're just one company, and there's millions of companies they deal with every day. But this is the biggest thing on earth for us. Amazon is the shopping mall now, and, normally, if you open a store in a shopping mall, you can expect certain things-like the mall operator will clean the hallways, and they'll make sure Foot Locker isn't right next door to Payless, and if someone sets up a kiosk in front of your store and starts selling fake Air Jordans, they'll kick them off the property.\" He continued, \"But Amazon is the Wild West. There's hardly any rules, except everyone has to pay Amazon a percentage, and you have to swallow what they give you and you can't complain.\"</p><p>Hundreds of other companies have told Amazon about counterfeiting or what they see as unfair competition-some of it generated by Amazon itself. In the early two-thousands, a San Francisco firm named Rain Design began selling an aluminum laptop stand that had a graceful curve, and it became an unexpected best-seller on Amazon. Amazon then released its own stand, with a nearly identical design, under the brand AmazonBasics, at half the price. Rain Design's sales fell. In 2016, Williams-Sonoma had started selling a low-backed mid-century-modern chair called the Orb. A year later, Amazon released an almost identical chair, which they also called the Orb. Last December, Williams-Sonoma filed a lawsuit claiming that \"Amazon has unfairly and deceptively engaged in a widespread campaign of copying.\" Earlier this year, a judge denied Amazon's motion to dismiss the case, ruling that the company might be \"cultivating the incorrect impression\" that ersatz products were authorized by Williams-Sonoma.</p><p>Critics say that Amazon uses the torrent of data it collects each day-how long a customer's cursor hovers over various products, how much of a price drop triggers a purchase-to divine which products are poised to become blockbusters, and then copies them. In July, the E.U. announced an investigation into whether Amazon uses \"sensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace\" to unfairly promote its own goods, or to create imitation products. Europe's top competition regulator, Margrethe Vestager, told me that Amazon is \"hosting thousands and thousands of smaller businesses, but at the same time it is a competitor to them.\" She added, \"This deserves much more scrutiny.\"</p><p>In a statement, Amazon said that many other retailers also produce their own versions of best-selling items, that such goods make up only one per cent of Amazon's sales, and that Rain Design's stands continue to sell well, despite competition from Amazon's stand-which, it insists, isn't a replica. The company added that it does not use \"data about individual sellers to decide which products to launch.\" (Company insiders, however, told me that Amazon does use aggregate data from multiple sellers to make such decisions.)</p><p>Kahan, of Birkenstock, eventually decided to take extreme measures. He announced that his firm would no longer sell shoes on Amazon, and he sent a letter to retailers declaring that if they listed Birkenstock products on Amazon they would be \"severing\" their \"relationship with our company.\" According to Kahan, Amazon began contacting authorized retailers, inviting them to sell their supply of Birkenstocks to the site. Kahan wrote to his retailers, \"To me, the solicitation is quite frankly a 'wolf in sheep's clothing.'\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I take their desperate act as a personal affront and as an assault on decency.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Amazon can't get Birkenstock by legitimate means so why not dangle a carrot in front of retailers who can make a quick buck.\"</p><p>Kahan's outrage hardly mattered. Today, despite Birkenstock's refusal to do business with Amazon, there are numerous resellers-some overseas, others with names that obscure their true identities-offering Birkenstocks on Amazon. Kahan has no idea who these resellers are, and Amazon won't tell him. Birkenstock requires authorized retailers to charge roughly a hundred and thirty-five dollars for its classic Arizona sandal. On October 8th, Arizonas were going on Amazon for as little as fifty dollars-which is great for customers looking for cheap shoes but potentially disastrous for Birkenstock, which relies on those higher prices to pay for marketing, product design, and the salaries of customer-service employees (who replace defective shoes for free).</p><p>Amazon says that it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on anti-counterfeiting efforts, including machine-learning technology that identifies suspicious items. Nevertheless, the site remains full of dubious products. A recent investigation by the Wall Street Journal identified thousands of products for sale on Amazon that \"have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulators,\" including children's toys containing dangerous levels of lead. Many of these products were shipped from Amazon warehouses, some through the Fulfillment by Amazon program. And Birkenstock's customer-service department still gets calls from customers who bought fake sandals on Amazon and expect Birkenstock to provide a refund.</p><p>Amazon says that it cannot accommodate the demands of Birkenstock and other companies that wish to \"limit availability of competitively priced products.\" In a statement, Amazon said that it is not its role to decide who is, and is not, authorized to sell various items. Amazon isn't a mall, a current executive told me. He described it as a Web site that offers unlimited shelf space for an almost unlimited number of products and sellers. Some might call this a platform. Other tech giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, describe themselves as platforms, partly as a way of justifying spotty oversight of their sites.</p><p>Kahan told me that, with the rise of Amazon, the give-and-take that has long undergirded the retail economy has become lopsided in a titan's favor. \"Capitalism is supposed to be a system of checks and balances,\" he said. \"It's a marketplace where everyone haggles until we're all basically satisfied, and it works because you can always threaten to walk away if you don't get a fair deal. But when there's only one marketplace, and it's impossible to walk away, everything is out of balance. Amazon owns the marketplace. They can do whatever they want. That's not capitalism. That's piracy.\"</p><p>On January 7, 2019, as public criticism of Amazon's excesses grew louder, Jeff Bezos received an e-mail from Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media, the parent company of the National Enquirer. \"I write to request an interview with you about your love affair,\" the message began. Howard then asked dozens of questions about Bezos's involvement with Lauren Sanchez, a helicopter pilot who had founded a company, Black Ops Aviation, that filmed promotional videos for Bezos's rocket company, Blue Origin. Reporters for the Enquirer had been trailing Bezos and Sanchez for months, the e-mail indicated, photographing them in hotels and at airports, and compiling a dossier of trysts. Bezos and Sanchez were both married, and the Enquirer was prepared to expose it all.</p><p>Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, a novelist, had been together for twenty-seven years. When executives went to their house for weekend meetings, it wasn't unusual to see them reading the newspaper together or helping their kids with homework. \"They seemed to have the perfect marriage,\" a former Amazon executive told me. \"I once saw them get out of the car at our holiday party, when they thought no one was looking, and hold each other's hand. It was that kind of relationship, real inspirational. Like, if they could stay together and keep their family sane, with all the work and money and stress, then the rest of us could, too.\"</p><p>Around the time that Bezos became the world's richest man, his life style changed. He appeared on television at the Academy Awards. He bought a mansion in Beverly Hills, and he threw a party co-hosted by Matt Damon. He was following an intense weight-training and diet regimen. He was in Seattle less frequently, employees noticed, and he often attended events without MacKenzie. Now the Enquirer was accusing Bezos and Sanchez of hiding their assignations from MacKenzie and from Sanchez's husband, Patrick Whitesell, a powerful talent agent whom Bezos had socialized with as Amazon expanded into Hollywood. A former American Media executive said of the Enquirer investigation, \"It was a kind of weird story for us. Enquirer readers don't really care about C.E.O.s. But everyone was all worked up and excited about it-cackling about blackmail and dick pics. It was like the unpopular kids had finally found something embarrassing about the quarterback.\"</p><p>Two days after Bezos received Howard's e-mail, he posted a message on Twitter. \"We want to make people aware of a development in our lives,\" he wrote, in a note co-signed by MacKenzie. \"After a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.\" Hours later, the Enquirer started publishing articles about the affair, making reference to \"sleazy photos\" and \"X-rated selfies\" exchanged by Bezos and Sanchez. The tabloid quoted some texts that he had sent her-\"I want to smell you\"-which suggested that his or her phone had been compromised. But the tabloid did not end up publishing racy photographs; it ran mundane images of Bezos and Sanchez, some of which had already appeared online. According to the former American Media executive, the publication might not actually have had explicit images. \"If we had pics of Jeff Bezos's dick, I would have seen them,\" the former executive told me. \"That's standard operating procedure-you pass them around. But whenever I asked I was told, 'Well, we don't actually have them here right now.' I was, like, 'You're bluffing the richest man in the world?'\u00a0\" (A representative of the Enquirer said that the publication had \"acted lawfully and stands by the accuracy of its reporting.\")</p><p>Marriages break up all the time, yet many of Bezos's colleagues felt disoriented by the fact that he had been so undisciplined as to let his personal life become tabloid fodder. \"The basis of Jeff's stature was a lot of things, but integrity was No. 1,\" a former colleague told me. \"The way he dealt with his family, and customers, and the people around him-that was at the core of why we respected him so much. And then this thing happened, and it was so hard to make that fit into the picture of the person we knew.\" Even Bezos's friends were concerned. \"It was like Jeff had been abducted by aliens and replaced,\" one told me. \"It'd been going on for about a year-the bodybuilding stuff, and Hollywood, and just a big change in how he was-and then this came out, and I still don't know how to process it.\"</p><p>Once Bezos's affair became public, more mainstream publications began digging around. When the Wall Street Journal prepared a story about how Bezos's divorce might affect his company, Amazon's P.R. department, which had been known for using mild language, responded acidly. The company's communications and policy chief, Jay Carney, told the paper, \"I didn't realize the Wall Street Journal trafficked in warmed-over drivel from supermarket tabloids.\" Meanwhile, Bezos launched an internal audit of his cell-phone data. If someone had gained access to his private texts, what else had been collected? E-mails? Business plans? Bezos ordered his personal head of security, the consultant Gavin de Becker, to scrutinize electronic records and to conduct interviews. Was the breach part of a sophisticated attack whose purpose was larger than simply to embarrass Bezos?</p><p>Bezos had plenty of enemies, and not just aggrieved companies like Birkenstock. For years, he had been battling various groups, from pro-union organizers to activists critical of Amazon's tax practices, and some of the clashes had been nasty. Labor organizers had been a particular source of conflict. In 2000, when the Communication Workers of America tried to unionize four hundred of Amazon's customer-service representatives in Seattle, the company closed down the call center where those employees worked, as part of what it said was a broader reorganization. In 2014, when a group of technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to allow them to vote on whether to unionize, Amazon hired a law firm that specialized in fighting organized labor, and held meetings warning that unionization could be bad for workers' jobs. Employees voted against joining the union. According to the Times, when other workers in Delaware tried to unionize, their manager gave an emotional speech about his youth: after his father had died, steps from his front door, the union had offered no support. The speech apparently worked-employees did not authorize a union vote. After the speech, outside organizers found an obituary of the man's father: he had been a partner at an insurance agency, not a union member, and had died while jogging, on vacation in South Carolina. After Amazon bought Whole Foods, in 2017, and workers began exploring unionization, store managers reportedly received a video explaining that \"you might need to talk about how having a union could hurt innovation, which could hurt customer obsession, which could ultimately threaten the building's continued existence.\" The union push stalled.</p><p>Dave Clark, the senior vice-president for worldwide operations, told me that Amazon already provides many of the benefits that a union would demand, and so \"there's really no reason to put an interstitial layer between employees' ability to directly come tell their manager that something is broken.\" Amazon, in a statement, said that it complies with the National Labor Relations Act, and that any member of the public can sign up for a free tour of its warehouses. \"Our direct connection with our people is the most valuable way to run the business,\" Clark said. \"It's the fastest way to run the business. It's the most innovative way to run the business.\" He added, \"I can't see how unions add any value to our current operations.\"</p><p>Groups unrelated to organized labor also had an incentive to embarrass Bezos. In 2018, when Seattle's city council, facing a homelessness crisis, unanimously passed a measure that would have required the city's largest companies to pay a tax of two hundred and seventy-five dollars per local worker to build homeless shelters and affordable housing, Amazon balked. The law would have initially cost Amazon less than twenty million dollars per year, at a time when its annual revenue exceeded two hundred and thirty billion dollars. Before it passed, Amazon announced that it had halted construction on a new tower in Seattle and was reconsidering an expansion into seven hundred thousand square feet that it had leased. A company spokesperson implicitly blamed the tax for these shifts, telling local reporters that Amazon was \"apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses.\" Amazon donated twenty-five thousand dollars to No Tax on Jobs, a group opposing the initiative. The tax's supporters pushed back, accusing Bezos and others of being \"O.K. with the city having shantytowns and favelas,\" but within a month the city council surrendered, and repealed the tax measure. \"This is not a winnable battle at this time,\" one councillor explained. \"The opposition has unlimited resources.\" Seattle's homeless population rose four per cent that year. The city has the third-largest population of homeless residents in the nation.</p><p>Activists have also noted that Bezos is much less philanthropic than many of his peers. Among America's top five billionaires, he is the only one who has not signed the Giving Pledge-a program, created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, that encourages the world's wealthiest citizens to give away at least half their wealth.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, has drawn particular criticism for its approach to federal taxes. Financial filings show that Amazon likely paid no U.S. federal income tax in 2018. The company reported a negative federal-tax charge on $11.2 billion in profits, in part because it received tax benefits by paying employees in stock rather than in wages, giving it a $1.1-billion deduction, and because of research-and-development credits that yielded a four-hundred-and-nineteen-million-dollar tax break. Most large tech firms avail themselves of similar opportunities-and Amazon, unlike Apple or Google, doesn't transfer profits to foreign countries, thus avoiding U.S. taxes. However, the company's low reported tax bill has infuriated its detractors on the left. In one of several criticisms levelled at Amazon in a recent Democratic debate, Andrew Yang said that Amazon was closing \"America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it.\" (Amazon says that last year it paid $1.2 billion in income taxes globally, but declines to disclose how much it has paid in the U.S.)</p><p>Some of Bezos's close friends and colleagues say that Amazon's tightfistedness reflects his political leanings. \"Jeff is a libertarian,\" a close acquaintance, who has known Bezos for decades, told me. \"He's donated money to support gay marriage and donated to defeat taxes because that's his basic outlook-the government shouldn't be in our bedrooms or our pocketbooks.\" One of Bezos's earliest public donations was to the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank and publisher. In 2013, he bought the Washington Post and invested heavily in its editorial operations, which remain independent; the effort has helped restore the paper's journalistic lustre (and expanded its readership). Yet he also froze the company's pension plan-a move that offered no real financial benefit to Bezos, given that the plan was already significantly overfunded-leaving some Post employees with the prospect of fewer benefits when they retired. Fredrick Kunkle, a reporter who is part of the newsroom's union leadership, said of Bezos, \"He doesn't think companies have obligations to employees beyond paying wages while they work.\" Bezos's close acquaintance agrees: \"There's an empathy gap there, something that makes it hard for him to see his obligations to other people. Seattle is filled with businesspeople-Gates and the Costco founders and the Boeing leadership-who have invested in this city. But the one time Amazon could have pitched in, on the homelessness tax, instead of taking the lead Jeff threatened to leave. It's how he sees the world.\"</p><p>Every billionaire has critics and enemies, but, when the Enquirer published Bezos's secrets, people close to him wondered if the disclosure might be part of a gambit to embarrass him and weaken him at, say, the union bargaining table, or to force him to change his philanthropic habits. Such tactics have a surprising history of success. When Alfred Sloan and G.M. were fighting labor unions and tax foes, in the nineteen-thirties, the company's critics began providing tabloids with photographs of G.M. executives enjoying their luxury sailboats and cavorting with showgirls. In 1936, the United Auto Workers staged a weeks-long sitdown strike in Flint, Michigan, and labor activists smuggled gossip about Sloan to reporters. Walter Lippman soon declared that Sloan was a \"bungling\" menace. When Sloan refused to meet with union representatives, the Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, took him to task publicly, yelling at him, \"You are a scoundrel and a skunk, Mr. Sloan! You don't deserve to be counted among decent men.\" Soon afterward, G.M. agreed to recognize the union.</p><p>In 1937, the Treasury Secretary accused Sloan of \"moral fraud\"-\"the defeat of taxes through doubtful legal devices.\" Sloan insisted that he'd actually paid sixty per cent of his income from the previous year in taxes, and given half of what remained to charity, but the attack further blighted his reputation. Eventually, Sloan caved. He donated fifteen per cent of his wealth-the modern equivalent of a hundred and eighty million dollars-to fund the Alfred\u00a0P. Sloan Foundation, and he eventually gave hundreds of millions of dollars more to universities and other organizations.</p><p>Bezos, who is reportedly worth a hundred and fourteen billion dollars, has so far donated less than three per cent of his wealth to charity. Three months after the homelessness-tax incident, he pulled a Sloan-like move: he announced the launch of a two-billion-dollar foundation named the Bezos Day One Fund. Since then, it has given grants to advocates for the homeless, and it is creating a network of Montessori-inspired preschools in low-income communities.</p><p>Fortunately for Bezos, the labor movement does not have as much power as it did in Sloan's day. When, earlier this year, Amazon cancelled its plans to open a second headquarters, in New York City, in part because of disputes with local unions, some politicians, rather than attacking Amazon, blamed the unions for scuttling the deal. In an open letter, Governor Andrew Cuomo's budget director wrote, \"Some labor unions attempted to exploit Amazon's New York entry.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The union that opposed the project gained nothing and cost other union members 11,000 good, high-paying jobs.\" Amazon currently has more than a hundred and fifty warehouses, and many of them are in economically depressed areas, where employment is scarce and politicians and workers are less likely to complain. Emily Guendelsberger, a journalist who briefly worked in an Amazon warehouse in 2015, said, \"People really want those jobs. It's gruelling, miserable work-I was taking Advil like candy. But one woman told me she drove an hour each way because Amazon paid more than the pizza place in her home town.\"</p><p>Some economists say that focussing on Amazon's miserliness or on the conditions inside its warehouses obscures larger, more positive truths. Michael Mandel, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute, told me, \"These are hard jobs, no one disputes that. They are definitely harder than office jobs, and they are harder than working in a clothing store or at a movie theatre. But wages in clothing stores have been declining for forty years, and wages have also gone down in manufacturing, and what I see is Amazon creating tens of thousands of jobs that pay thirty per cent more than competitors, that offer real benefits, that help high-school graduates get skills they need. Eventually, workers will demand that Amazon's pie gets divided more evenly. But the only reason we're even having this conversation is because Amazon has been expanding the pie for the people left behind.\"</p><p>Gavin de Becker concluded that the National Enquirer's publication of Bezos's personal data was indeed intended to serve political ends-but he didn't blame Amazon's critics on the left. De Becker began speaking with reporters, claiming that he had evidence that the Enquirer's reporting was \"politically motivated.\" He eventually claimed that the expos\u00e9 was related to Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post.</p><p>In March, de Becker laid out his accusations in the Daily Beast. \"Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos's phone, and gained private information,\" de Becker wrote, alleging that there were links between the hacking and a conspiracy related to the 2018 murder of the Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey. \"The Saudi government has been intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the Post began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi's murder,\" de Becker wrote. Now the Saudi government, with help from the Enquirer, was \"trying to strong-arm an American citizen.\" Precisely why the Saudis wanted Bezos's selfies, and what they hoped to accomplish by passing them to a tabloid, de Becker did not say. (Nobody connected to the internal investigation would discuss in detail any of its findings.)</p><p>De Becker, in his article, pointed out that in recent years the Enquirer had become overtly political. It was so closely aligned with Donald Trump that, during the 2016 Presidential race, its publisher paid hush money to silence one of the candidate's alleged mistresses. When the Enquirer's stories on Bezos appeared, President Trump-who has accused Bezos of buying the Post to wield political influence and keep Amazon's taxes low-tweeted, \"So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.\"</p><p>Reporters at mainstream publications found little evidence to substantiate de Becker's claims. The Enquirer, which was having financial difficulties, was wary of getting drawn into a possibly expensive political fight. (It was easy to imagine subpoenas coming from Capitol Hill.) The publication strenuously denied de Becker's accusations. The former American Media executive said, \"We were hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, our hedge-fund owner was getting freaked out, and it was, like, what's the endgame here? This had been a bad idea from the beginning. They wanted out.\"</p><p>A representative of American Media sent a private communication to Bezos: if he would release a statement saying that he had \"no knowledge or basis for the suggestion\" that American Media's \"coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces,\" American Media would agree \"not to publish, distribute, share or describe unpublished texts and photos.\" In a separate letter, Dylan Howard, the American Media chief content officer, described images that he claimed to have, among them a \"below the belt selfie-otherwise colloquially known as a 'd*ck pick.'\u00a0\" The company provided no evidence of having such photographs. (Their existence has never been verified.) \"It would give no editor pleasure to send this email,\" Howard wrote to Bezos's representatives. \"I hope common sense can prevail.\"</p><p>Howard's strategy backfired. Bezos posted the tabloid's correspondence on the Web site Medium, alongside an open letter. \"Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten,\" he explained. (The letter was written by Bezos and edited by his lawyers.) \"It's unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\"</p><p>It was a brilliant act of jujitsu. For the first time in years, Bezos was widely hailed in the mainstream media. (A typical tweet was \"Just in: Jeff Bezos' dick pic reveals he has balls of steel.\") Meanwhile, reporting by the Wall Street Journal and other outlets offered a simpler explanation for the hacking: the purloined messages had come from Lauren Sanchez's brother, Michael, a reality-television talent agent. The Enquirer had paid him two hundred thousand dollars for the texts. Michael Sanchez was a Trump supporter, and it was possible that the Enquirer had learned of the affair and had urged him to peek at his sister's phone. De Becker, however, still believed that his boss was the victim of a plot, and said that he was forwarding his intelligence to federal officials. For most Americans, though, the mystery seemed solved: a tabloid, not for the first time, had paid for gossip.</p><p>Within six weeks, the owners of the Enquirer had announced its sale. Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos finalized their divorce in July, and she received a thirty-eight-billion-dollar settlement. Shortly afterward, she announced that she was signing the Giving Pledge.</p><p>Bezos's personal tumult distracted Amazon's leaders at a particularly fraught time. The company's headlong growth has led to a series of scandals, and executives have been unsure how to contain the damage. Like other process companies, Amazon is learning that a flywheel, once spinning, is very hard to stop.</p><p>Several years ago, Amazon built a vast network of independent couriers to provide what's known as \"last-mile delivery\": the final leg of a package's journey to a customer's door. For years, Amazon had relied upon UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service to deliver packages. But in 2013 that system broke down; at Christmastime, tens of thousands of orders were stranded in warehouses. Amazon began constructing a delivery network of its own. Rather than build internally, however, the company signed contracts with hundreds of local drivers and courier firms, in cities across the country.</p><p>The benefit of outsourcing was that Amazon could build a delivery network quickly. Brittain Ladd, a former Amazon senior manager who specialized in logistics and operations, told me earlier this year that \"it was really easy to scale up-there's thousands of courier services out there, and so once you figure out the model you can expand it almost overnight.\"</p><p>Still, some people within Amazon, including Ladd, thought that these partnerships were a bad idea: it would be impossible for Amazon to insure that delivery companies were hiring responsible drivers and using rigorous safety protocols. \"Frankly, you have very little control over these individuals,\" Ladd told me. He said that he had hand-delivered to multiple colleagues a memo, marked \"PRIORITY: HIGH,\" in which he expressed \"grave reservations\" about relying on contractors, warning, \"I believe it is highly probable that accidents will occur resulting in serious injuries and deaths.\" He recommended instead that the company carefully build its own last-mile-delivery network, one with a \"zero-tolerance policy\" for safety violations. Ladd said to me, \"I attended meetings, and I told them that the last thing you want is a newspaper article reading 'Amazon driver high on drugs hits and kills family.' But we were growing so fast, and there was so much pressure, and if we tried to build this internally it would have taken at least a year. And so a decision was made that the risk was worth it.\"</p><p>Amazon tried to work solely with courier services that met basic safety requirements, according to a current executive who helped establish the program. But Amazon pushed only so far, deciding that it wasn't practical to compel firms to give drivers regular drug tests or to require extensive training. Local courier services are often run by inexperienced businesspeople. Meanwhile, the pressure to expand remained intense. \"We were moving very, very fast,\" a former manager who helped build the network recalled. \"We were learning as we went.\"</p><p>In 2015, Amazon contracted with a courier company called Inpax Shipping Solutions, and it began delivering packages for the company in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Miami, Dallas, and Chicago. Amazon executives apparently failed to note that Inpax's chief executive had once pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and had declared bankruptcy after defaulting on debts. After Amazon signed the deal, its executives seemed not to notice that the Department of Labor was investigating Inpax, or, later, that federal regulators had found that the company had committed numerous labor violations. Amazon also overlooked a lawsuit filed by an Inpax employee against his boss, which was documented in public records.</p><p>On December 17, 2016, a dispatcher working with Inpax received an e-mail from Amazon declaring that \"we are officially into 'no package left behind' territory.\" Five days later, an Inpax driver, Valdimar Gray, was rushing to deliver Christmas packages in Chicago when he flew through a crosswalk, hitting Telesfora Escamilla, an eighty-four-year-old woman walking home from a hair salon. Escamilla, who was dragged under the van, died. Escamilla's grandson Anthony Bijarro, who was at the scene, told me, \"Amazon killed my grandmother because they wanted packages delivered a little faster. Amazon doesn't care who's driving, they don't care if they're reckless.\" Escamilla's family has sued Inpax and Amazon. Amazon, in a statement, said that it regularly audits its delivery partners to insure that they are in compliance with the law and with Amazon's policies, and takes action \"when they aren't meeting our high bar for safety and customer experience.\" The company has terminated its relationship with Inpax. (Inpax and Gray declined to respond to questions.)</p><p>ProPublica has identified more than sixty accidents involving Amazon, all since 2015, that resulted in serious injuries or deaths. Reporters at BuzzFeed have found records naming Amazon in at least a hundred lawsuits related to accidents involving package deliveries, which have included at least six deaths. Those are likely just a fraction of such collisions, because in many cases delivery vehicles were unmarked, and victims weren't aware of Amazon's role. Ladd, the former senior manager, said, \"Amazon could have built this network in-house, or they could have acquired a logistics company to really teach them last-mile delivery, or they could have chosen partners more slowly, to make sure the right safety procedures were in place. But this was not a well-oiled machine-this was a bunch of people thrown together. They asked me for advice, and I was saying, 'There's another way to do this.'\u00a0\" If Amazon had found another way, Ladd said, \"it would have been a hell of a lot better for the people who were killed-but once the machine starts moving it takes on a life of its own.\"</p><p>As Amazon executives were becoming increasingly worried about the hazards of warp-speed growth, other pressures inside the company kept ratcheting up. Earlier this year, Amazon announced that it would soon start guaranteeing to many customers delivery in one day, rather than two, putting even more stress on couriers and workers.</p><p>A growing number of regulators in Washington, D.C., and in Europe argue that Amazon, along with other tech giants, needs to be reined in. Until the nineteen-seventies, many process companies were constrained by a fear of U.S. antitrust enforcement. Alfred Sloan always kept a close eye on the size of G.M.'s market share. \"Our bogie is forty-five per cent,\" Sloan told a reporter, in 1938. \"We don't want any more than that.\" His trepidation was justified. The federal government repeatedly sued G.M., once charging Sloan personally with criminal antitrust activity. Almost none of the suits prevailed in court, but they cowed the company.</p><p>Sloan died in 1966, and, in the decades that followed, the government's attitude toward antitrust enforcement changed. During the Reagan Administration, regulators and courts decreed that antitrust decisions should largely be based not on a company's size or on its bullying tactics but, rather, on any price hikes imposed on customers. By the time Facebook and Google appeared, giving away their products for free, and Amazon arose, with its devotion to keeping prices down, antitrust enforcement was a remote concern. The legal scholar Lina Khan, writing in the Yale Law Journal in 2017, observed, \"It is as if Bezos charted the company's growth by first drawing a map of antitrust laws, and then devising routes to smoothly bypass them.\"</p><p>Things began changing earlier this year. In June, the head of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, a Trump appointee and a respected authority on economic competition, gave a speech declaring that antitrust regulators would no longer be constrained by \"the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low.\" Delrahim's address was the equivalent of firing a starter's pistol. In a recent conversation, he told me that tech companies \"should think very seriously about their conduct,\" adding, \"If you're one of the big guys, you should be careful to make sure you don't snuff out competitors because you think that's good for your business. That's not what free markets really mean, and we're going to come down on you like a ton of bricks if that's what you do.\"</p><p>Soon after Delrahim's speech, it was reported that the F.T.C. had issued subpoenas for data regarding third-party sales on Amazon. In July, the E.U. declared that it was investigating Amazon, and the U.S. House of Representatives held a hearing and interrogated an Amazon lawyer about how the company harvests data. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, asked the lawyer, \"You're saying that you don't use that in any way to promote Amazon products? I remind you, sir, you're under oath.\" The attorney replied that the firm shows customers only the best product, regardless of who profits from the sale, and that Amazon did nothing untoward.</p><p>Many members of Congress suspect otherwise. Cicilline, who chairs the House's antitrust subcommittee, told me, \"There's bipartisan consensus that we have a responsibility to get these markets working again. More competition means better protection of privacy. It means better control of your data. It means more innovation.\" Elizabeth Warren, one of the most forceful critics of the tech industry, has said that, if she wins the Presidency, she intends to break up Amazon, Facebook, and Google. She has proposed making it illegal for companies such as Amazon to own online marketplaces and at the same time to sell goods on those platforms. \"Amazon crushes small companies,\" Warren wrote, in a plan for expanding online competition. If she is elected, she said, \"small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business.\"</p><p>Other regulators and lawmakers are more measured in their proposals and their rhetoric, but a loose consensus has emerged around a group of concerns, which some people refer to as the Four \"C\"s. The first is concentration. A high-ranking F.T.C. official told me, \"The bigger a tech company becomes, the more they can bully, so we need to put hard caps on how big companies like that can grow, on what they can acquire.\"</p><p>Rohit Chopra, one of the F.T.C.'s five commissioners, told me that the second \"C\" is the conflict of interest that comes from \"both controlling the pipe and selling the oil.\" Chopra, who agreed to speak only about antitrust generally and not about Amazon specifically, explained, \"If you do both, you will structure your marketplace in a way that ultimately is self-dealing, and you will use the data from those who sell on your marketplace to benefit yourself.\" There's a long history of the government forcing industries to separate distribution and sales; for years, movie studios have generally been prohibited from owning movie theatres.</p><p>The next area of concern is contracts. Big tech companies often make highly restrictive deals with smaller venders. Amazon retains a contractual right to hold sellers' revenues for long periods after a sale, and imposes limits on what data sellers can share with other companies. Another F.T.C. commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, told me, \"There are a lot of terms that go into boilerplate contracts that consumers or workers don't really have an opportunity to negotiate. It is absolutely appropriate for us to be thinking about banning those.\"</p><p>Lastly, regulators worry about the complexity of current antitrust law. \"You really have to be an expert, or hire an expert attorney, if you feel like one of these companies is acting inappropriately,\" an F.T.C. official said. \"The law only works when it is simple enough for the little guy to bring an action on their own.\"</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate's subcommittee on antitrust, told me that such reforms are bound by a central idea: \"The big tech companies are completely reshaping the way we buy goods and sell goods in the marketplace, our privacy rules, and our democracy rules, without any checks and balances from the government.\" She continued, \"So many people are finally getting tired of the dominance. When Amazon starts owning Whole Foods, when they control the producers, when they control all the parts of the supply chain-people deserve a level playing field.\" American history, Klobuchar said, shows that such imbalances can spark widespread activism. \"This goes back to the Founders and the Boston Tea Party,\" she said. \"These are highly emotional political moments.\"</p><p>Amazon has responded to the mounting political threat by expanding its lobbying efforts. Federal records indicate that, in 2018, Amazon lobbied more government bodies than any other U.S. tech company. It has made its case across Washington, to senators, representatives, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, even NASA. Much of Amazon's lobbying has been devoted to winning government contracts: it is a leading contender for a ten-billion-dollar project to centralize the Department of Defense's cloud computing. But a former federal official who works on antitrust issues told me that the company's other lobbying was \"about telling us that, if you even think about breaking up Amazon, you're going to make markets less efficient, and there are going to be a lot of lost jobs-and Amazon employs a ton of people in your district.\"</p><p>Amazon has a Twitter account devoted to cheery photographs and videos of lawmakers touring warehouses, posing alongside rows of Amazon trucks, and putting items in boxes. (If the videos are any indication, legislators are permitted to work much more slowly than Amazon productivity standards require.) Such theatrics used to serve the company well. However, a regulator who is familiar with Amazon's lobbying said that \"there's been a bit of hubris, because, in the past, they were able to tell a story about how consumers love them. But now that's changing, and it's very concerning to them.\"</p><p>According to Amazon insiders, Bezos adamantly refuses to consider slowing the company's growth, fearing that its culture will break down if the pace slackens. He is determined to defend his creation aggressively. For years, Amazon was largely content to remain silent amid criticism-one Leadership Principle is \"We accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time\"-but the company now responds to nearly every provocation. In June, after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on television that Bezos's wealth is \"predicated on paying people starvation wages and stripping them of their ability to access health care,\" Amazon's communications and policy chief, Jay Carney, went on the attack, tweeting, \"All our employees get top-tier benefits. I'd urge @AOC to focus on raising the federal minimum wage instead of making stuff up about Amazon.\" That month, the Times ran an article accusing the company of \"a kind of lawlessness\" in its bookstore: counterfeit medical textbooks were for sale, and Amazon seemed unconcerned with \"the authenticity, much less the quality, of what it sells.\" A long rebuttal appeared on Amazon's blog, arguing that \"nothing could be further from the truth\" and accusing the reporter of cherry-picking examples. Last year, Amazon tapped a group of warehouse workers to be a kind of Twitter rapid-response army, deputizing them as \"ambassadors.\" When a Bernie Sanders supporter tweeted that Amazon was anti-union, a fulfillment-center employee, @AmazonFCJanet, fired back, \"Unions are thieves.\"</p><p>Amazon offered few specifics on its lobbying activities. \"There is abundant competition in the retail sector, and many retailers are thriving,\" the company wrote in response to questions. \"There is no power imbalance between Amazon and the sellers and vendors who work with us.\"</p><p>Executives at Amazon have argued to regulators and lawmakers that the company is distinct in fundamental ways from Facebook and Google. Whereas those firms essentially created their industries, Amazon's realm-the retail marketplace-has existed since the dawn of commerce. \"The idea that there is only one marketplace is demonstrably false,\" the company wrote in a statement, noting that Walmart still brings in more revenue than it does. Amazon executives point out that, if you ignore the distinction between online and real-world sales, Amazon is responsible for about four per cent of U.S. retail transactions. \"If we do not compete on prices, selection, delivery speed and customer service, customers will choose other competitors,\" the company statement noted.</p><p>Part of Amazon's defensiveness stems from executives' conviction that regulators' concerns are based not on logic but on a misguided understanding of retail. One executive told me that the real problem is that Amazon is disproportionately popular among lawmakers. Congressional aides, high-profile journalists, and other \u00e9lites often use Amazon to buy kitchen supplies and Christmas gifts. They watch \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and shop at Whole Foods. They don't even know the location of the nearest Walmart, the executive said, and therefore think that Amazon is much more powerful than it really is.</p><p>Perhaps it's true that policymakers would have a broader perspective if they logged more hours at Costco. But, in any case, Amazon now has such a severe image problem that it can no longer count on being able to do whatever it pleases. High-ranking executives allow that there are some limited concessions Bezos is willing to make, such as donating more of his wealth to charity. And Amazon may agree to strengthen its oversight of drivers and of workers' safety. One executive told me that Amazon is determined to remain open-minded and polite with regulators; one of Microsoft's missteps in the nineties, he said, was that it was dismissive. But few of the current Amazon executives I spoke with said that the company needed to make major changes. And few believed that regulators would compel them to do so. After all, Amazon employs hundreds of thousands of people across the nation, many of them voters, and has warehouses in dozens of states. A tech lobbyist told me, \"Neither Facebook nor Google has that. Sometimes you survive just because there are other targets to absorb the blows.\"</p><p>Bezos, after attracting scandal earlier this year, has lately sought to recede. His media appearances have become rare and highly scripted. When he was onstage this past summer at one of his few recent public outings-an Amazon conference in Las Vegas-the performance was studiously boring, a clear attempt to rob himself of glamour. While Bezos was droning on, a protester jumped on the stage, shouting something about chickens and terrible conditions on industrial farms. Bezos froze, as if worried that the smallest bacterium of controversy might prove contagious. After the woman was removed, he glanced around and said, \"I'm sorry-where were we?\"</p><p>Within Amazon, there are concerns that, no matter how strenuously Bezos embraces banality, he can't be dull enough. \"We have all this attention now,\" a former executive complained. Since Bezos and Lauren Sanchez went public with their relationship, they have regularly appeared in gossip columns. The New York Post's Page Six has reported on the swimsuit that Bezos wore in Saint-Tropez (\"quirky, octopus-print trunks\"), and how he met Sanchez's parents at the N.F.L. Hall of Fame (\"This all leads Amazon sources to ponder how long it will be before the couple say 'I do'\u00a0\").</p><p>The government's scrutiny of General Motors never scored any fatal hits-one antitrust lawsuit dragged on for years, ending in a dismissal-but the scar tissue was damaging enough. David Farber, a University of Kansas historian who wrote a biography of Alfred\u00a0P. Sloan, told me that the G.M. executive \"didn't see himself as someone that needed to be loved or respected by the public, but eventually even he gave in.\" He noted a pattern in American history: \"There's an economic revolution, it creates amazing new opportunities, and then the companies that seize those opportunities become so powerful that the people revolt-they say the winners have become too powerful, they start attacking the people who are the embodiments of winning, sometimes with gossip, sometimes with facts. And then we have an era of constraint enforced by the federal government.\" We may be at a breaking point now. \"It's like the eighteen-eighties or the nineteen-thirties all over again,\" Farber said. \"The pressure is going to continue building, the powerful are going to continue being watched and criticized and gawked at, until something pops.\"</p><p>Jeff Wilke, the Bezos deputy, told me that all process companies eventually falter. The challenge is to stave off decline as long as possible. Day Two, he said, \"is inevitable-the question is when.\" When Day Two does arrive at Amazon, at least Ian Freed, the executive who oversaw the Kindle and the Echo, won't have to suffer through it. A few years ago, he consulted an internal Amazon application called the Old Fart Tool, which shows employees how many new people have been hired since their first day, and discovered that more than three hundred thousand workers had joined Amazon since he started there. Freed had come to Amazon because he loved being at a place that moved fast and did the impossible. He was proud of his work-once, while on vacation in Mexico, he had peeked into his sons' hotel room and seen their Game Boys lying on the nightstand while they read on their Kindles. \"That was pretty special,\" he told me. \"For the rest of my life, I can tell my grandchildren that I built the Amazon Kindle and the Amazon Echo.\"</p><p>Yet Amazon had changed, and Freed missed the old days. He wanted to spend more time living by Leadership Principles that were loftier than simply selling everything as fast and as cheaply as possible. He wanted to see if his next flywheels could power a project with higher ideals. Such goals wouldn't likely have satisfied Amazon's constant hunger, but to Freed they seemed satisfying enough. And Freed no longer had to worry about earning a salary: during his tenure at Amazon, its stock price had gone from forty-three dollars to $1,052 a share. And so in 2017 he quit Amazon, and not long afterward he founded Bamboo Learning, a company that builds voice-activated education software. One product teaches kids how to do division when they say, \"Alexa, open Bamboo Math.\" The startup has only two full-time employees. Freed just signed his first big contract, with the publisher Highlights for Children. \"It just got to the point where I wanted to do something different,\" he told me. \"I wanted to work with nonprofits and feel like I'm contributing in a different way. If this succeeds, we'll bring education to parts of the world where you can't get print books, where companies don't deliver things overnight, where it's not even guaranteed that people are literate.\"</p><p>Freed is building something that is neither strictly a product company nor a process company. It will be both grander and more modest in its ambitions than Amazon, which Bezos has famously described as \"the everything store.\" Freed told me, \"It's another chance to change the world. A smaller change, but it's real, and it feels important to me.

So it set up an ordering function on its website, slapped a \"Shop Now\" button on its Facebook page to send people to its takeaway menu, and began offering kerbside drop-off to former patrons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A day after the lockdown, Paulista was back in business. \"Good luck to everyone as we start to figure out new patterns and ways of life!\" it told followers.</p><p>Small businesses battling for survival during the pandemic have turned to Facebook and other Big Tech platforms to help fill the gaps caused by lockdown. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: \"With so many businesses forced to close their physical storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences, and those that already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as their primary storefronts.\"</p><p>That shift has been good for the titans of the digital economy. While the coronavirus hurled the world into recession, unleashing a deluge of bankruptcies and record unemployment, sales for Zuckerberg's empire surged by 18% in the three months to March. Profits doubled to $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn).</p><p>Different versions of the same story played out last week for the remainder of the Five Horsemen of Big Tech: Microsoft, Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon. They have weathered the storm far better than most as people spend more money - and time - online. Amazon's sales exploded by 26% to $76bn and it hired 175,000 people to feed the surge in demand. A pledge to plough $4bn into its coronavirus response, which will push it into loss, shocked Wall Street, but the move also underlined a confidence that what it does will be more in demand as the pandemic leads to dramatic behaviour shifts. Microsoft also impressed, its stock jumping 5% after it beat expectations.</p><p>While the world burns, Big Tech appears more unstoppable than ever. As of Friday, the five giants accounted for more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 - breaking the record last seen in 2000 before the bubble burst, when the top five made up 18% of the market. This sets the stage for an almighty fight with competition regulators in America, which were already knee-deep into market abuse investigations of four of the five: Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet.</p><p>The rumblings are growing louder as they tighten their grip. Republican senator Josh Hawley last week demanded an investigation into Amazon after The Wall Street Journal revealed instances where it allegedly mined data about popular items from third-party sellers on its site to craft its own, rival products. Hawley said \"predatory data practices threaten these businesses' very existence\". Amazon said such practices were prohibited and that it has opened an internal probe.</p><p>Facebook is understood to have redoubled efforts in Washington to reshape how it is seen by politicians, perhaps with an eye to the crisis passing and Congress shifting its gaze back to Silicon Valley. Washington lobbyists are reportedly attempting to convince congressional staffers that the universe in which Facebook operates is far broader than the one populated by direct rivals such as YouTube or TikTok. It competes with anything online that draws attention, be it a newspaper, a blog, a video game or a film.</p><p>In anti-trust cases, defining the market is critical. The bigger it is, the smaller a company looks. In its attempted reframing, Facebook's biggest fight is apparently with spare time itself - a foe from which it pluckily extracts small victories.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Congress - or regulators - will be convinced.</p><p>More probably, Facebook will emerge stronger from the crisis. It told investors that the advertising dip it saw in March as stay-at-home orders rippled across the globe had already \"flattened\". Analysts speculated that a rush of smaller operators, such as Paulista, taking out hypertargeted ads at suddenly lower rates, had buttressed sales. Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley said he expected more of the 140 million small businesses on Facebook to join the eight million organisations that advertise on the platform. \"We underestimated the advertising durability that Facebook's [platform] can bring,\" he said.</p><p>The contrast with most of the rest of the economy is stark. Newspapers, especially regional publishers, are shuttering at alarming rates; Enders Analysis predicted a third of frontline journalism jobs could be lost in this recession.</p><p>Facebook, on the other hand, plans to hire \"at least\" 10,000 new engineers and product professionals.</p><p>Farmers in America have begun mass culls of livestock because of a sudden glut caused by the closure of restaurants and meat-packing plants. Apple steered through store closures and lockdowns of suppliers in China to eke out a 1% rise in first-quarter sales to $58bn.</p><p>Like Amazon, which offers data storage through its cloud operation, film, television and smart home gadgets, Apple has sailed through so far because it has become a conglomerate. The estimated 920 million iPhones in circulation are all tied in to Apple's \"garden\" of services, from iCloud data storage to Apple Music - and now its television and film offering.</p><p>Its services arm, which encompasses these, brought in a record $13.3bn in sales for the three months to March. If it were a standalone business, the operation, with its 65% profit margins, would be more profitable than ExxonMobil. Tim Cook raised Apple's dividend by 6.5% just as oil major Shell cut its payout for the first time since the Second World War.</p><p>Facebook and Google are winning for a different reason: they have, for most users, become the internet, controlling messaging, email, voice, text and search. In a world forced to reorientate itself around digital services, they are perfectly placed to grab even more land.</p><p>The same applies, to a lesser degree, to Microsoft, which saw sales for its cloud arm, Azure, rise sharply, along with profits from its gaming operation, XBox, and tools such as Teams, its productivity app for remote workers. Chief executive Satya Nadella said the crisis had brought forward \"two years' worth of digital transformation in two months\".</p><p>On the investor call, Zuckerberg admitted worse was to come as the fallout from Covid-19 intensified: \"In times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future.\" Beyond the lofty heights of Big Tech, it is a luxury precious few have.</p><p>They have weathered the storm better than most as people spend more money online</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-159662886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTG-9G81-JCBW-N0WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1107\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 3, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

So it set up an ordering function on its website, slapped a \"Shop Now\" button on its Facebook page to send people to its takeaway menu, and began offering kerbside drop-off to former patrons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A day after the lockdown, Paulista was back in business. \"Good luck to everyone as we start to figure out new patterns and ways of life!\" it told followers.</p><p>Small businesses battling for survival during the pandemic have turned to Facebook and other Big Tech platforms to help fill the gaps caused by lockdown. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: \"With so many businesses forced to close their physical storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences, and those that already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as their primary storefronts.\"</p><p>That shift has been good for the titans of the digital economy. While the coronavirus hurled the world into recession, unleashing a deluge of bankruptcies and record unemployment, sales for Zuckerberg's empire surged by 18% in the three months to March. Profits doubled to $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn).</p><p>Different versions of the same story played out last week for the remainder of the Five Horsemen of Big Tech: Microsoft, Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon. They have weathered the storm far better than most as people spend more money - and time - online. Amazon's sales exploded by 26% to $76bn and it hired 175,000 people to feed the surge in demand. A pledge to plough $4bn into its coronavirus response, which will push it into loss, shocked Wall Street, but the move also underlined a confidence that what it does will be more in demand as the pandemic leads to dramatic behaviour shifts. Microsoft also impressed, its stock jumping 5% after it beat expectations.</p><p>While the world burns, Big Tech appears more unstoppable than ever. As of Friday, the five giants accounted for more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 by value - breaking the record last seen in 2000 before the bubble burst, when the top five made up 18% of the market. This sets the stage for an almighty fight with competition regulators in America, which were already knee-deep into market abuse investigations of four of the five: Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet.</p><p>The rumblings are growing louder as they tighten their grip. Republican senator Josh Hawley last week demanded an investigation into Amazon after The Wall Street Journal revealed instances where it allegedly mined data about popular items from third-party sellers on its site to craft its own, rival products. Hawley said \"predatory data practices threaten these businesses' very existence\". Amazon said such practices were prohibited and that it has opened an internal probe.</p><p>Facebook is understood to have redoubled efforts in Washington to reshape how it is seen by politicians, perhaps with an eye to the crisis passing and Congress shifting its gaze back to Silicon Valley. Washington lobbyists are reportedly attempting to convince congressional staffers that the universe in which Facebook operates is far broader than the one populated by direct rivals such as YouTube or TikTok. It competes with anything online that draws attention, be it a newspaper, a blog, a video game or a film.</p><p>In anti-trust cases, defining the market is critical. The bigger it is, the smaller a company looks. In its attempted reframing, Facebook's biggest fight is apparently with spare time itself - a foe from which it pluckily extracts small victories.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Congress, or regulators, will be convinced. What appears clear is that Facebook will emerge stronger from the crisis. It told investors that the advertising dip in March as stayat-home orders rippled across the globe had already \"flattened\". Analysts speculated that a rush of smaller operators, such as Paulista, taking out hyper-targeted ads at suddenly lower rates, had buttressed sales.</p><p>Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley said he expected more of the 140 million small businesses on Facebook to join the eight million organisations that advertise on the platform. \"We underestimated the advertising durability that Facebook's [platform] can bring,\" he said.</p><p>The contrast with most of the rest of the economy is stark. Newspapers, especially regional publishers, are shuttering at alarming rates; Enders Analysis predicted a third of frontline journalism jobs could be lost in this recession. Facebook, on the other hand, plans to hire \"at least\" 10,000 new engineers and product professionals.</p><p>Farmers in America have begun mass culls of livestock because of a sudden glut caused by the closure of restaurants and meat-packing plants. Apple steered through store closures and lockdowns of suppliers in China to eke out a 1% rise in first-quarter sales to $58bn.</p><p>Like Amazon, which offers data storage through its cloud operation, film, television and smart home gadgets, Apple has sailed through so far because it has become a conglomerate. The estimated 920 million iPhones in circulation are all tied in to Apple's exclusive services, from iCloud data storage to Apple Music - and now its television and film offering.</p><p>Its services arm, which encompasses these, brought in a record $13.3bn in sales for the three months to March. If it were a standalone business, the operation, with its 65% gross margins, would be more profitable than ExxonMobil. Tim Cook raised Apple's dividend by 6.5% just as oil major Shell cut its payout for the first time since the Second World War.</p><p>Facebook and Google are winning for a different reason: they have, for most users, become the internet, controlling messaging, email, voice, text and search. In a world forced to reorientate itself around digital services, they are perfectly placed to grab even more land.</p><p>The same applies, to a lesser degree, to Microsoft, which saw sales for its cloud arm, Azure, rise sharply, along with profits from its gaming operation, XBox, and tools such as Teams, its productivity app for remote workers. Chief executive Satya Nadella said the crisis had brought forward \"two years' worth of digital transformation in two months\".</p><p>On the investor call, Zuckerberg admitted worse was to come as the fallout from Covid-19 intensified: \"In times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future.\" Beyond the lofty heights of Big Tech, it is a luxury precious few have.</p><p>They have weathered the storm better than most as people spend more money online</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-159666040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTG-9G81-JCBW-N0WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 3, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

So it set up an ordering function on its website, slapped a \"Shop Now\" button on its Facebook page to send people to its takeaway menu, and began offering kerbside drop-off to former patrons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A day after the lockdown, Paulista was back in business. \"Good luck to everyone as we start to figure out new patterns and ways of life!\" it told followers.</p><p>Small businesses battling for survival during the pandemic have turned to Facebook and other Big Tech platforms to help fill the gaps caused by lockdown. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: \"With so many businesses forced to close their physical storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences, and those that already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as their primary storefronts.\"</p><p>That shift has been good for the titans of the digital economy. While the coronavirus hurled the world into recession, unleashing a deluge of bankruptcies and record unemployment, sales for Zuckerberg's empire surged by 18% in the three months to March. Profits doubled to $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn).</p><p>Different versions of the same story played out last week for the remainder of the Five Horsemen of Big Tech: Microsoft, Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon. They have weathered the storm far better than most as people spend more money - and time - online. Amazon's sales exploded by 26% to $76bn and it hired 175,000 people to feed the surge in demand. A pledge to plough $4bn into its coronavirus response, which will push it into loss, shocked Wall Street, but the move also underlined a confidence that what it does will be more in demand as the pandemic leads to dramatic behaviour shifts. Microsoft also impressed, its stock jumping 5% after it beat expectations.</p><p>While the world burns, Big Tech appears more unstoppable than ever. As of Friday, the five giants accounted for more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 by value - breaking the record last seen in 2000 before the bubble burst, when the top five made up 18% of the market. This sets the stage for an almighty fight with competition regulators in America, which were already knee-deep into market abuse investigations of four of the five: Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet.</p><p>The rumblings are growing louder as they tighten their grip. Republican senator Josh Hawley last week demanded an investigation into Amazon after The Wall Street Journal revealed instances where it allegedly mined data about popular items from third-party sellers on its site to craft its own, rival products. Hawley said \"predatory data practices threaten these businesses' very existence\". Amazon said such practices were prohibited and that it has opened an internal probe.</p><p>Facebook is understood to have redoubled efforts in Washington to reshape how it is seen by politicians, perhaps with an eye to the crisis passing and Congress shifting its gaze back to Silicon Valley. Washington lobbyists are reportedly attempting to convince congressional staffers that the universe in which Facebook operates is far broader than the one populated by direct rivals such as YouTube or TikTok. It competes with anything online that draws attention, be it a newspaper, a blog, a video game or a film.</p><p>In anti-trust cases, defining the market is critical. The bigger it is, the smaller a company looks. In its attempted reframing, Facebook's biggest fight is apparently with spare time itself - a foe from which it pluckily extracts small victories.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Congress, or regulators, will be convinced. What appears clear is that Facebook will emerge stronger from the crisis. It told investors that the advertising dip in March as stay-at-home orders rippled across the globe had already \"flattened\". Analysts speculated that a rush of smaller operators, such as Paulista, taking out hyper-targeted ads at suddenly lower rates, had buttressed sales.</p><p>Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley said he expected more of the 140 million small businesses on Facebook to join the eight million organisations that advertise on the platform. \"We underestimated the advertising durability that Facebook's [platform] can bring,\" he said.</p><p>The contrast with most of the rest of the economy is stark. Newspapers, especially regional publishers, are shuttering at alarming rates; Enders Analysis predicted a third of frontline journalism jobs could be lost in this recession. Facebook, on the other hand, plans to hire \"at least\" 10,000 new engineers and product professionals.</p><p>Farmers in America have begun mass culls of livestock because of a sudden glut caused by the closure of restaurants and meat-packing plants. Apple steered through store closures and lockdowns of suppliers in China to eke out a 1% rise in first-quarter sales to $58bn.</p><p>Like Amazon, which offers data storage through its cloud operation, film, television and smart home gadgets, Apple has sailed through so far because it has become a conglomerate. The estimated 920 million iPhones in circulation are all tied in to Apple's exclusive services, from iCloud data storage to Apple Music - and now its television and film offering.</p><p>Its services arm, which encompasses these, brought in a record $13.3bn in sales for the three months to March. If it were a standalone business, the operation, with its 65% gross margins, would be more profitable than ExxonMobil. Tim Cook raised Apple's dividend by 6.5% just as oil major Shell cut its payout for the first time since the Second World War.</p><p>Facebook and Google are winning for a different reason: they have, for most users, become the internet, controlling messaging, email, voice, text and search. In a world forced to reorientate itself around digital services, they are perfectly placed to grab even more land.</p><p>The same applies, to a lesser degree, to Microsoft, which saw sales for its cloud arm, Azure, rise sharply, along with profits from its gaming operation, XBox, and tools such as Teams, its productivity app for remote workers. Chief executive Satya Nadella said the crisis had brought forward \"two years' worth of digital transformation in two months\".</p><p>On the investor call, Zuckerberg admitted worse was to come as the fallout from Covid-19 intensified: \"In times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future.\" Beyond the lofty heights of Big Tech, it is a luxury precious few have.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-62613353</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTF-H5H1-F021-64FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1095\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 2, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

It had to turn itself into an online business - and fast. It set up an ordering function on its website, slapped a \"Shop Now\" button on its Facebook page to send people to its takeaway menu and began offering kerbside drop-off to former patrons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A day after the lockdown, Paulista was back in business. \"Good luck to everyone as we start to figure out new patterns and ways of life!\" it told followers.</p><p>Small businesses battling for survival during the pandemic have turned to Facebook and other Big Tech platforms to help fill the gaps caused by lockdown. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: \"With so many businesses forced to close their physical storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences, and those that already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as their primary storefronts.\"</p><p>That shift has been good for the titans of the digital economy. While the coronavirus hurled the world into recession, unleashing a deluge of bankruptcies and record unemployment, sales for Zuckerberg's empire surged by 18% in the three months to March. Profits doubled to $4.9bn ((EURO)4.4bn).</p><p>Different versions of the same story played out last week for the rest of the Five Horsemen of Big Tech - Microsoft, Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon. They have weathered the storm far better than most as people spend more money - and time - online. Amazon sales exploded by 26% to $76bn, though profits fell by a third to $2.5bn as it hired 175,000 people to feed a surge in demand. Microsoft's stock jumped 5% after it beat Wall Street expectations.</p><p>While the world burns, Big Tech appears more unstoppable than ever. As of Friday, the five giants accounted for more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 - breaking the record last seen in 2000 before the bubble burst, when the top five made up 18% of the market. This sets the stage for an almighty fight with competition regulators in America, which were already knee-deep into market-abuse investigations of four of the five - Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet.</p><p>The rumblings are growing louder as they tighten their grip. Republican senator Josh Hawley last week demanded an investigation into Amazon after The Wall Street Journal revealed instances where it allegedly mined data about popular items from third-party sellers on its site to craft its own rival products. Hawley wrote: \"At a time when most small retail businesses must rely on Amazon because of coronavirus-related shutdowns, predatory data practices threaten these businesses' very existence.\" Amazon said such practices were prohibited. It has opened an internal probe.</p><p>Facebook is understood to have redoubled efforts in Washington to reshape how it is seen by politicians, perhaps with an eye to the crisis passing and Congress shifting its gaze back to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Washington lobbyists are reportedly attempting to convince congressional staffers that the universe in which Facebook operates is far broader than one populated by direct rivals such as You-Tube or TikTok. It competes with anyat thing online that draws attention, be it a newspaper, a blog, a video game or a film.</p><p>In anti-trust cases, defining the market is critical. The bigger it is, the smaller a company looks. In its attempted reframing, Facebook's biggest fight is with spare time itself - a foe from which it pluckily extracts small victories.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Congress - or regulators - will be convinced.</p><p>More probably, Facebook will emerge stronger from the crisis. It told investors that the advertising dip it saw in March as stay-at-home-orders rippled across the globe had already \"flattened\". Analysts speculated that a rush of smaller operators, taking out hyper-targeted ads at suddenly lower rates, had buttressed sales. Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley said he expected more of the 140 million small businesses on Facebook to join the 8 million organisations that advertise on the platform. \"We underestimated the advertising durability that Facebook's [platform] can bring,\" he said.</p><p>The contrast with most of the rest of the economy is stark. Newspapers, especially regional publishers, are shuttering alarming rates; Enders Analysis predicted a third of front-line journalism jobs could be lost in this recession.</p><p>Facebook, on the other hand, plans to hire \"at least\" 10,000 new engineers and product professionals.</p><p>Farmers in America have begun mass culls of livestock because of a sudden glut caused by restaurant and meat-packing closures. Apple steered through store closures and lockdowns of suppliers in China to eke out a 1% rise in first-quarter sales to $58bn.</p><p>Like Amazon, which offers data storage through its cloud operation, film, television and smart home gadgets, Apple has sailed through so far because it has become a conglomerate. The estimated 920 million iPhones in circulation are all tied in to Apple's \"garden\" of services, from iCloud data storage to Apple Music and now its television and film offering.</p><p>Its services arm, which encompasses these, brought in a record $13.3bn in sales for the three months to March. If it were a stand-alone business, the operation, with 65% profit margins, would be more profitable than ExxonMobil. Tim Cook raised Apple's dividend by 6.5% just as oil major Shell cut its payout for the first time since the Second World War.</p><p>Facebook and Google are winning for a different reason: they have, for most users, become the internet, controlling messaging, email, voice and text, search and increasingly - along with Amazon - commerce. In a world forced to reorientate itself around digital services, they are perfectly placed to grab even more land.</p><p>The same applies, to a lesser degree, to Microsoft, which saw sales for its cloud arm, Azure, rise sharply, along with profits from its gaming operation, XBox, and tools like Teams, the productivity app for remote workers. Chief executive Satya Nadella said the crisis had brought forward \"two years' worth of digital transformation in two months\".</p><p>On the investor call, Zuckerberg admitted worse was to come as the fallout from Covid-19 intensified: \"In times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future.\" Beyond the lofty heights of Big Tech, it is a luxury precious few have.</p><p>They have weathered the storm better than most as people spend more money online</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-159659452</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTG-9G81-JCBW-N0F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 3, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Inequity and inequality is a huge part of it. But for me, one of the really big ones is climate change,\" he says. \"We have to solve this problem or we're all toast. We're going to need every bit of ingenuity to do that. I think it will become the focus of innovation.\"</p><p>That change in focus could also lead to an enormous raft of new jobs, he argues - provided the planet shifts away from fossil fuels, and what he describes as the \"Ponzi scheme\" of startup valuations.</p><p>O'Reilly stops short of pushing for the sweeping radicalism of \"a new socialism\", but he insists that \"we have to design this system for human flourishing.\"</p><p>The end of the golden age of the programmer</p><p>But what does that look like? How do we reskill the workforce to focus on this new class of problems, while ensuring the spoils are spread evenly, and not concentrated in the hands of big tech companies? Or entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, whom O'Reilly admires.</p><p>Short of telling people to \"learn to code\", O'Reilly sees a new set of literacies being required if the workforce of the future is to take advantage of the oncoming \"augmentation\" that intelligent systems could enable.</p><p>\"I think the golden age of the last couple of decades where you can become a programmer and you'll get a job... is sort of over,\" O'Reilly says. \"Programming is now more like being able to read and write. You just have to be able to do it to be able to get the most out of the tools and the environments that you're presented with, whatever they are.\"</p><p>\"Every working scientist today is a programmer,\" he adds. \"Programming can make a journalist more successful, programming can make a marketer more successful, programming can make a salesperson more successful, programming can make an HR person more successful. Having technical literacy is on the same level as being good at reading, writing, and speaking.\"\u00a0</p><p>No silver bullets</p><p>O'Reilly isn't blind to the trade-offs that society has made for the convenience that certain technologies bring. How does he maintain such a sunny disposition when it comes to the potential of technology in the face of growing inequality, the erosion of privacy, and the disinformation crisis that Silicon Valley has wrought?</p><p>\"It's quite clear that we're now really aware of the enormous risks of these technologies, the risks for abuse,\" he says, adding that he doesn't believe government should be singled out to solve all of these issues.</p><p>Although O'Reilly recognises that Congress recently announcing that it will\u00a0legislate to regulate facial recognition technology is a step in the right direction, he notes that it's not nearly comprehensive enough to truly mitigate the risks. \"We're not really getting to the root of our engagement with the question of what is the governance structure for technologies that are really changing our society,\" he says.\u00a0</p><p>Complex problems require complex solutions. Take the recent exodus of advertising revenue from Facebook, where brands such as Unilever and Ben and Jerry's have\u00a0pulled their marketing dollars from the social network over its policies surrounding hate speech.</p><p>O'Reilly argues that Facebook is only doing what it is designed to do and has been thus far rewarded by the market for doing: attract as many eyeballs as possible and sell ads against that attention using algorithms.</p><p>\"If you understand how algorithmic systems work, you realise they are curatorial systems, they represent choices,\" O'Reilly says. \"We need to have a completely different conversation about it. So too with facial recognition, it's on a continuum with all kinds of other technologies that take away people's privacy. On that continuum are things that people like and embrace and want, and things that they don't want.\"</p><p>There is no silver bullet to solve these issues, but there are some steps that could be taken to realign the priorities of technology companies with those of society at large.</p><p>\"Until we build ethical principles more broadly into our company governance - which things like the B Corp movement have tried to do - we have to take this as a comprehensive problem, with comprehensive solutions,\" O'Reilly says.</p><p>What next for open source?</p><p>As a long-time exponent of the power of open source, where does this community fit in to O'Reilly's vision for technology to help solve society's biggest problems?</p><p>\"Open source is really challenged in this world, it's not going to be the same thing that it was in the PC era,\" he says.</p><p>Tracing open source back to its roots, there have always been a plethora of opinions around what open source truly means, from the Free Software Foundation's definition, to the computer scientists at UC Berkley, or the MIT X Window System, which O'Reilly is most closely aligned with.</p><p>The central idea here is that all code should be openly available to be modified and copied, with the overall aim being to push forward the state of the art.</p><p>\"If you look at where open source is really thriving it is in areas like science, where there's not that desire to make a lot of money off of this, they just want other people to be able to use this and benefit from it,\" he says.</p><p>\"That's why, for example, very early on in the open source discussion, I was saying data is going to be the new source of lock-in, we shouldn't be so focused on source code,\" he adds. \"If we had focused a lot more on issues of what it means when somebody controls the data, when somebody controls the algorithms which shape what data people see? That's where the open source discussion needs to be now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INFDLY-3564824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INFDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608J-0F41-DY58-D15R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><timeReceived>01:10 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Data Group, Inc.

But what if that\u2019s not so bad?</p><p>For a year and a half \u2014 and more urgently for much of the last month \u2014 I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.</p><p>Because these companies control the world\u2019s most important tech platforms, from smartphones to app stores to the map of our social relationships, their power is growing closer to that of governments than of mere corporations. That was on stark display this week, when executives from two of the five, Facebook and Google, along with a struggling second-tier company, Twitter, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/facebook-twitter-google-hearings-congress.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">testified before Congress</url> about how their technology may have been used to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>Yet ever since I started writing about what I call the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/techs-frightful-five-theyve-got-us.html\">Frightful Five</url>, some have said my very premise is off base. I have argued that the companies\u2019 size and influence pose a danger. But another argument suggests the opposite \u2014 that it\u2019s better to be ruled by a handful of responsive companies capable of bowing to political and legal pressure. In other words, wouldn\u2019t you rather deal with five horse-size Zucks than 100 duck-size technoforces?</p><p>The insatiable appetite of digital technology to alter everything in its path is among the most powerful forces shaping the world today. Given all the ways that tech can go wrong \u2014 as we are seeing in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html?ribbon-ad-idx=10&amp;rref=homepage&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=origin&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Home%20Page&amp;pgtype=article\">Russia influence scandal</url> \u2014 isn\u2019t it better that we can blame, and demand fixes from, a handful of American executives when things do go haywire?</p><p>That\u2019s not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.</p><p>The Five Can Be Governed</p><p>Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo \u2014 and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.</p><p>One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today\u2019s tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.</p><p>Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet\u2019s capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades \u2014 from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism \u2014 the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies \u2014 one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs \u2014 it was never conceivable to limit that era\u2019s equivalent of fake news.</p><p>Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.</p><p>This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates \u2014 and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.</p><p>\u201cThis is new stuff everybody is dealing with \u2014 it\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \u201cBig Is Beautiful,\u201d a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \u201cSo when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You\u2019ve got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\u201d</p><p>The Five Hate One Another\u2019s Guts</p><p>Over the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome \u2014 so why was I including their company in that group?</p><p>It was an odd line. As an outsider to these companies, I tend to worry about the collective power of the Five, especially the way they have managed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/technology/frightful-five-start-ups.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Technology&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article\">control the fortunes of innovative start-ups</url>. But none of the Five see themselves as part of a group \u2014 each of them worries about the threat posed by start-ups and by the other four giants, which means that none feels it has the luxury to slow down in creating the best new stuff.</p><p>This dynamic \u2014 where each company competes mightily against the others \u2014 suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d with Mr. Atkinson. \u201cAs long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what\u2019s to complain about?\u201d</p><p>You can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control \u2014 for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.</p><p>At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways \u2014 with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.</p><p>\u201cSo, why pre-emptively say that maybe we\u2019ll be harmed in the future \u2014 that in 2030 they\u2019ll jack up their prices or something?\u201d Mr. Lind asked. \u201cWell, deal with that as it comes.\u201d</p><p>The Five Are American Grown</p><p>The Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale.

But what if that's not so bad?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a year and a half - and more urgently for much of the last month - I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Because these companies control the world's most important tech platforms, from smartphones to app stores to the map of our social relationships, their power is growing closer to that of governments than of mere corporations. That was on stark display this week, when executives from two of the five, Facebook and Google, along with a struggling second-tier company, Twitter, testified before Congress about how their technology may have been used to influence the 2016 election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet ever since I started writing about what I call the Frightful Five, some have said my very premise is off base. I have argued that the companies' size and influence pose a danger. But another argument suggests the opposite - that it's better to be ruled by a handful of responsive companies capable of bowing to political and legal pressure. In other words, wouldn't you rather deal with five horse-size Zucks than 100 duck-size technoforces?</p><p>The insatiable appetite of digital technology to alter everything in its path is among the most powerful forces shaping the world today. Given all the ways that tech can go wrong - as we are seeing in the Russia influence scandal - isn't it better that we can blame, and demand fixes from, a handful of American executives when things do go haywire?</p><p>That's not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.</p><p>The Five Can Be Governed</p><p>Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo - and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.</p><p>One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today's tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.</p><p>Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet's capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades - from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism - the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies - one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs - it was never conceivable to limit that era's equivalent of fake news.</p><p>Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.</p><p>This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates - and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.</p><p>\"This is new stuff everybody is dealing with - it's not easy,\" said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of \"Big Is Beautiful,\" a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) \"So when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You've got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.\"</p><p>The Five Hate One Another's Guts</p><p>Over the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome - so why was I including their company in that group?</p><p>It was an odd line. As an outsider to these companies, I tend to worry about the collective power of the Five, especially the way they have managed to control the fortunes of innovative start-ups. But none of the Five see themselves as part of a group - each of them worries about the threat posed by start-ups and by the other four giants, which means that none feels it has the luxury to slow down in creating the best new stuff.</p><p>This dynamic - where each company competes mightily against the others - suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote \"Big Is Beautiful\" with Mr. Atkinson. \"As long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what's to complain about?\"</p><p>You can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control - for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.</p><p>At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways - with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.</p><p>\"So, why pre-emptively say that maybe we'll be harmed in the future - that in 2030 they'll jack up their prices or something?\" Mr. Lind asked. \"Well, deal with that as it comes.\"</p><p>The Five Are American Grown</p><p>The Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects - where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it - it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.</p><p>But it wasn't inevitable that these companies would be based in and controlled from the United States. And it's not obvious that will remain the case - the top tech companies of tomorrow might easily be Chinese, or Indian or Russian or European. But for now, that means we are dealing with companies that feel constrained by American laws and values.</p><p>Yes, this is jingoistic; the idea of a handful of American tech giants controlling much of society has helped push regulators internationally to try to limit their power. But we would almost certainly do the same if a bunch of foreign companies attempted to take over our economy. At least it's our own giants that we have to fear.</p><p>I don't mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.</p><p>As I said, tech is messy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com\">farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com</email>;

But what if that's not so bad?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a year and a half -- and more urgently for much of the last month -- I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Because these companies control the world's most important tech platforms, from smartphones to app stores to the map of our social relationships, their power is growing closer to that of governments than of mere corporations. That was on stark display this week, when executives from two of the five, Facebook and Google, along with a struggling second-tier company, Twitter, testified before Congress about how their technology may have been used to influence the 2016 election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Yet ever since I started writing about what I call the Frightful Five, some have said my very premise is off base. I have argued that the companies' size and influence pose a danger. But another argument suggests the opposite -- that it's better to be ruled by a handful of responsive companies capable of bowing to political and legal pressure. In other words, wouldn't you rather deal with five horse-size Zucks than 100 duck-size technoforces?</p><p>  The insatiable appetite of digital technology to alter everything in its path is among the most powerful forces shaping the world today. Given all the ways that tech can go wrong -- as we are seeing in the Russia influence scandal -- isn't it better that we can blame, and demand fixes from, a handful of American executives when things do go haywire?</p><p>  That's not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five.</p><p>  The Five Can Be Governed</p><p>  Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo -- and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides.</p><p>  One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today's tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems.</p><p>  Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet's capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades -- from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism -- the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies -- one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs -- it was never conceivable to limit that era's equivalent of fake news.</p><p>  Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control.</p><p>  This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates -- and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms.</p><p>  ''This is new stuff everybody is dealing with -- it's not easy,'' said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of ''Big Is Beautiful,'' a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) ''So when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You've got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor.''</p><p>  The Five Hate One Another's Guts</p><p>  Over the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome -- so why was I including their company in that group?</p><p>  It was an odd line. As an outsider to these companies, I tend to worry about the collective power of the Five, especially the way they have managed to control the fortunes of innovative start-ups. But none of the Five see themselves as part of a group -- each of them worries about the threat posed by start-ups and by the other four giants, which means that none feels it has the luxury to slow down in creating the best new stuff.</p><p>  This dynamic -- where each company competes mightily against the others -- suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote ''Big Is Beautiful'' with Mr. Atkinson. ''As long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what's to complain about?''</p><p>  You can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control -- for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop.</p><p>  At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways -- with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics.</p><p>  ''So, why pre-emptively say that maybe we'll be harmed in the future -- that in 2030 they'll jack up their prices or something?'' Mr. Lind asked. ''Well, deal with that as it comes.''</p><p>  The Five Are American Grown</p><p>  The Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects -- where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it -- it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business.</p><p>  But it wasn't inevitable that these companies would be based in and controlled from the United States. And it's not obvious that will remain the case -- the top tech companies of tomorrow might easily be Chinese, or Indian or Russian or European. But for now, that means we are dealing with companies that feel constrained by American laws and values.</p><p>  Yes, this is jingoistic; the idea of a handful of American tech giants controlling much of society has helped push regulators internationally to try to limit their power. But we would almost certainly do the same if a bunch of foreign companies attempted to take over our economy. At least it's our own giants that we have to fear.</p><p>  I don't mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size.</p><p>  As I said, tech is messy.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING (DRAWING BY DOUG CHAYKA)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-277380171102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVT-7F61-JBG3-60FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/technology/five-tech-giants-upside.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/technology/five-tech-giants-upside.html</url><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 2, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is good to see establishment outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and National Review[2] coming to the same conclusion, or at least asking the same questions. We had to go back to the drawing board in our lawsuit[3] against these social media giant. The basis of our suit was challenging Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) under the First Amendment, which provides immunity from lawsuits to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, thereby permitting these social media giants to engage in government-sanctioned censorship and discriminatory business practices free from legal challenge. </p><p>Facebook and Google take in roughly half of all Internet ad revenue. In the U.S., Alphabet[4] Inc.'s Google drives 89% of internet search; 95% of young adults on the internet use a Facebook[5] Inc. product; and Amazon.com[6] Inc. now accounts for 75% of electronic book sales. Those firms that aren't monopolists are duopolists: Google and Facebook absorbed 63% of online ad spending last year; Google and Apple[7] Inc. provide 99% of mobile phone operating systems; while Apple and Microsoft[8] Corp. supply 95% of desktop operating systems. Both companies routinely censor and spy on their customers, 'massaging everything from the daily news to what we should buy.' In the last century, the telephone was our 'computer,' and Ma Bell was how we communicated. That said, would the American people (or the government) have tolerated ATT spying on our phone calls and then pulling our communication privileges if we expressed dissenting opinions? That is exactly what we are suffering today. Ma Bell was broken up by the government, albeit for different reasons. But it can and should be done.  An investigation revealed Facebook moderators make the wrong call on almost half of posts deemed offensive.[9] Facebook launches new guide for Muslims to help them report 'hate speech'[10] A chief officer from a major American communications company went to the terror state of Pakistan to assure the Pakistani government that Facebook would adhere to the sharia. The commitment was given by Vice President of Facebook Joel Kaplan, who called on Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. 'Facebook has reiterated its commitment to keep the platform safe and promote values that are in congruence with its community standards.' Why the block? Because under Islamic law, you cannot criticize Islam. Facebook adhering to the most extreme and brutal ideology on the face of the earth should trouble all of us, because Mark Zuckerberg has immense power. He controls the flow of information.Early last year I wrote:[11] The US government has used anti-trust laws to break up monopolies. They ought to break up Facebook. Section 2 of the Sherman Act [12]highlights particular results deemed anticompetitive by nature and prohibits actions that 'shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.' Couldn't the same be applied to information? The United States government took down Standard Oil, Alcoa, Northern Securities, the American Tobacco Company and many others without nearly the power that Facebook has. NRO has come to that same conclusion: Tech companies such as Google and Facebook are also utilities of sorts that provide essential services. They depend on the free use of public airwaves. Yet they are subject to little oversight; they simply make up their own rules as they go along. Antitrust laws prohibit one corporation from unfairly devouring its competition, capturing most of its market, and then price-gouging as it sees fit without fear of competition. Google has all but destroyed its search-engine competitors in the same manner that Facebook has driven out competing social media. Clearly Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos are contemporary 'robber barons.' So why are they not smeared, defamed and reviled like the robber barons of yesteryear? Why are huge tech companies seemingly exempt from the rules that older corporations must follow? First, their CEOs wisely cultivate the image of hipsters. The public sees them more as aging teenagers in T-shirts, turtlenecks, and flip-flops than as updated versions of J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, or other robber barons of the past. Second, the tech industry's hierarchy is politically progressive. In brilliant marketing fashion, the Internet, laptops, tablets, and smartphones have meshed with the hip youth culture of music, television, the movies, universities, and fashion. Think Woodstock rather than Wall Street. Corporate spokesmen at companies such as Twitter and YouTube brag about their social awareness, especially on issues such as radical environmentalism, identity politics, and feminism. Given that the regulatory deep state is mostly a liberal enterprise, the tech industry is seen as an ally of federal bureaucrats and regulators. Think more of Hollywood, the media, and universities than Exxon, General Motors, Koch Industries, and Philip Morris. (NRO)[13] The groovy t-shirt-turtleneck vibe may keep the great unwashed under their spell, but it's the shared political ideology with the left that keeps these corporate managers free from accountability. The WSJ writes that antitrust regulators have a narrow test: Does their size leave consumers worse off? Surmising that if that's the test, 'there isn't a clear case for going after big tech.' I disagree. The consumer is far worse off. If we are not free to speak and think in what is today's Gutenberg press, than we could not be worse off.

Should they be broken up?By Greg Ip, January 18, 2018: Standard Oil Co. and American Telephone and Telegraph Co. were the technological titans of their day, commanding more than 80% of their markets. Today's tech giants are just as dominant: In the U.S., Alphabet[14] Inc.'s Google drives 89% of internet search; 95% of young adults on the internet use a Facebook[15] Inc. product; and Amazon.com[16] Inc. now accounts for 75% of electronic book sales. Those firms that aren't monopolists are duopolists: Google and Facebook absorbed 63% of online ad spending last year; Google and Apple[17] Inc. provide 99% of mobile phone operating systems; while Apple and Microsoft[18] Corp. supply 95% of desktop operating systems.A growing number of critics think these tech giants need to be broken up or regulated as Standard Oil and AT...9] once were. Their alleged sins run the gamut from disseminating fake news and fostering addiction to laying waste to small towns' shopping districts.

Her remarks echoed those of Mark Esper, US defence secretary, and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state. But where are the US alternatives?</p><p>In our latest <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Swamp Notes </emphasis>newsletter, Rana Foroohar highlights the Department of Justice challenge last week\u00a0to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust ruling against\u00a0Qualcomm, which it had accused of violating patent rules. In an extremely unusual move, the DoJ showed up and argued that the ruling against Qualcomm would hurt national security, a clear indication\u00a0that its leadership in 5G chips was seen as more important than how it was exerting its market power.</p><p>We've a look today at how curbing the power of the big technology companies has been\u00a0a\u00a0theme of the Democratic presidential candidates' campaigns, with Elizabeth Warren being the most severe critic of how smaller competitors have been killed off and data privacy eroded. But Ed Luce, in the same <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Swamp Notes</emphasis>, says this has receded as an issue lately, with it not being raised at recent Warren rallies in either her speeches or questions afterwards. \u201cPart of the reason for this is Trump's aggressive stance on China, which has taken much of the wind\u00a0out of Democratic sails,\u201d he says. \u201cThey criticise Trump's methods but not his objective.\u201d</p><p>If the US is conflicted in its approach to Big Tech, Europe finds itself caught in the middle of any decoupling in trade and tech ( as does Cambridge). Our team in Munich report the sharp rhetoric of the US, countered by a speech from Wang Yi, China\u2019s foreign minister, stoked fears among EU countries that they are being forced into a choice between the US and China that they do not want to have to make.</p><p>The EU has been slow to devise a sophisticated China strategy, says today's Brussels Briefing. It was only last year that the European bloc for the first time branded Beijing a \u201csystemic rival\u201d in some areas, as well as an economic competitor in others and a negotiating partner in still more.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. SoftBank investment chief pushes hedge fund\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Rajeev Misra, the head of SoftBank\u2019s $100bn Vision Fund, has lined up billions of dollars of outside investment for a\u00a0 new hedge fund-style investment vehicle. The plan has found support from Abu Dhabi\u2019s state fund Mubadala and the government of Kazakhstan but would mark a sharp deviation from the vision of SoftBank\u2019s founder Masayoshi Son, who created the telecoms company\u2019s investment arm to take stakes in private, technology-focused start-ups and profit from scaling them up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. India's Big Brother legislation, Taiwan's little sister of democracy</emphasis><br/>India\u2019s first personal data protection bill, a comprehensive privacy framework introduced in December, is supposed to provide\u00a0new protections for India\u2019s internet users. But today's Big Read reports New Delhi\u2019s proposed law has alarmed many of its original champions by carving out broad exemptions for authorities to access the personal data of its 1.4bn citizens. Privacy activists fear\u00a0India will build up surveillance projects with minimal oversight. Rana Foroohar reports on a very different situation in Taiwan where\u00a0digital minister Audrey Tang is using distributed ledgers, quadratic voting and various online open-source platforms to enable greater participatory democracy in Taiwan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. US solar gets battery boost</emphasis><br/>Thanks to a wave of investment,\u00a0solar farms across the US are increasingly being built with\u00a0 industrial-scale battery packs \u00a0on site so that noontime surpluses can be stored for release in the evening hours when people come home to switch on lights, appliances and air conditioners.\u00a0Fund managers, power producers, utilities and energy-hungry tech companies are among those making big financial commitments to \u201csolar-plus-storage\u201d projects.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Coronavirus control</emphasis><br/>Beijing is tightening access to the uncensored global internet, while carefully controlling its domestic news reports, to increase its grip on the media narrative around the coronavirus epidemic, reports Yuan Yang in Beijing. Meanwhile, Samsung has begun flying electronic components for its latest Galaxy phones\u00a0 from China \u00a0to its factories in Vietnam, where it produces nearly two-thirds of its phones.<br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. The triumph of music's triumvirate</emphasis><br/>Warner Music filing for an IPO is a sign of the booming valuations and revenues that streaming has brought to the music business.\u00a0Recorded music revenues have been growing quickly for the past three years, topping $19bn in annual sales. But the industry is dominated by three large companies whose values had not been repriced to match their growing businesses, reports Anna Nicolaou.</p><p>Tech week ahead</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Monday:</emphasis>\u00a0</emphasis>Facebook's chief Mark Zuckerberg will discuss regulation with Margrethe Vestager, EU antitrust and digital commissioner, and Thierry Breton, the European commissioner charged with overseeing the digital economy. Mr Zuckerberg wrote in the FT that Big Tech needs more\u00a0 regulation, something he also called for in Munich.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wednesday: </emphasis></emphasis>The European Commission publishes a White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and the European Data Strategy, which aims to create a single European data market aimed at challenging the dominance of US tech giants such as Facebook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thursday:</emphasis></emphasis>\u00a0Online file-sharing\u00a0company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dropbox</emphasis> reports earnings for its December quarter. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lenovo</emphasis>, the world's largest maker of personal computers, will hold an investors conference.

It was an atypical intervention. First, because the COVID-19 epidemic has forced the changing of the usual rules for such events. Instead of sitting directly in front of commission congressmen Jeff <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai have defended their companies by videoconference.</emphasis><br/>But it has also been because of the very magnitude of the appearance, which many have compared to the government's confrontation with the big tobacco companies in the 1990s or <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft </emphasis>at the end of the same decade.</p><p><br/>These four giants dominate every aspect of digital life, from e-commerce to the digital identity of the vast majority of internet users. In Europe and Asia they have faced hefty fines or changed their policies when it comes to operations, but the US, until now, had not been concerned about the size of its operations. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Its power has grown and concentrated in recent years without any limitation by the government of the country.</emphasis><br/>A year ago, the Congressional Justice Commission began investigating them to determine whether they could be harming free competition. The intervention before Congress is part of this investigation and has forced the leaders of the companies, accustomed to operating in the territory without large foot cutters, to adopt for the first time a defensive attitude.<br/>Amazon, too big<br/>Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, has stressed, for example, that Amazon actually accounts for only 4% of U.S. retail sales and that large areas, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walmart,</emphasis>not only have a greater weight on the country's economy but are growing at a faster rate than Amazon. \"There is room in the world of retail commerce for many success stories,\" he told the commission.<br/>But part of Congress's concern is that its size and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the amount of information it holds from its customers</emphasis> allows it to sell products much more efficiently that traditional businesses can aspire to. Amazon has been selling consumer electronics products for years (Kindle e-books or Echo speakers, for example) and has begun to strengthen its position in fashion and add-ons also with its own brands.<br/>Bezos has downplayed this part of his business, indicating that it does not yet pose a great risk to more established brands.<br/>The founder of the company, in any case, was in favour of the Commission's attitude. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Amazon must be investigated. We should monitor all the big institutions, whether it's companies or government agencies. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass the count successfully,\" he has conceded.</emphasis><br/>In recent years several consumer advocacy organizations and some politicians have begun to appreciate the need to split Amazon's business into several independent companies, especially now that the company is developing its own logistics business, creating supermarket chains, and bearing in mind that it also controls a large part of the network infrastructure through its Amazon Web Services business. The company has also been questioned for its predatory practices towards traditional distributors and investigated for job abuses in its distribution centers.<br/>Apple, against the ropes<br/>Apple's problem is similar to that ofAmazon, but in digital. The Commission believes that its app store, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the AppStore, could be stifling third-party business.</emphasis>Apple takes between 15% and 30% of all in-store transactions, including the purchase of digital goods within the apps themselves, a commission that claims is \"similar\" to that of other digital stores but which many developers consider disproportionate.<br/>In order to secure the payment, the company has also put in place a number of policies that make it very difficult to operate alternatively. Developers, for example, cannot link directly to alternative purchasing methods for content. An additional problem is that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Apple often competes directly with its own apps and services with third-party developers, but benefits from not having such commissions.</emphasis><br/>Speaking to Congress, Tim Cook, Apple's president, defended the company's attitude by recalling that Apple has only a small part of the mobile phone market and that the AppStore has opened the door for many small developers, creating <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a platform that has generated more than $1.2 billion in revenue for them since its inception in 2008.</emphasis><br/>\"The only apps that have commission are those in which the developer buys a customer thanks to Apple,\" explained Cook, who recalled that the company doesn't take money for free apps or for the revenue generated by ad-supported apps. \"These are commissions well below 50% or 70% that many developers had to pay before the AppStore per distribution,\" he added.<br/>Several of these developers have testified before Congress independently as part of the research. In recent years, Apple has had to appease many of them because of the frustration generated by the draconian approval process of the different apps in the company's store. Unlike Android, where there are alternatives, it is only possible to reach iPhone users (a very lucrative market given the high purchasing level of the average customer) through this store, a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> fact that could complicate the Apple defense in a monopoly trial.</emphasis><br/>Facebook and the Chinese threat<br/>Facebook's absolute dominance of the social sphere thanks to the acquisitions of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WhatsApp and Instagram,</emphasis>and the adoption of many of its competitors' functions, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SnapChat,</emphasis>has forced the commission to also consider the power that Mark Zuckerberg, founder and president of Facebook, has over public discourse in the United States.<br/>In an election year it is a particularly worrying issue, especially when <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">considering derived problems such as the dissemination of fake news and propaganda.</emphasis> Zuckerberg took advantage of his appearance before Congress to explain some of the protective measures that have been implemented for the election and to recall the threat posed by the rise of certain social networks of Chinese origin, in a veiled reference to TikTok, which has managed to undermine the strength of Instagram, particularly among younger users.<br/>\"China is building its own version of the Internet, focused on very different ideas from ours, and they are exporting that vision to other countries,\" he explained. Zuckerberg also called on the government to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more actively regulate freedom of expression on the network, an issue that he claims should not be left to companies.</emphasis><br/>Google, the only search engine<br/>The Commission is considering, too, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">whether Google could have become too large a company in the web search business and the</emphasis>preventing the normal development of the activity for a company that does not want to use its services.<br/>Sundar Pichai, president of the company, assured the Commission that there are alternative search engines on the network, but that Google's success is solely due to the quality of its product. He also took advantage of the intervention to point out that his tools have been key to the survival of many small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Thanks to us, small businesses can compete globally today,\" he explained.<br/>Pichai noted that the search market has evolved in recent years and direct web search can no longer be considered as the only competition scenario for alternatives. Voice assistants or in-app search are also a reality and Google has strong competition in these sectors.<br/>Several independent studies, however, have concluded that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google's near-absolute dominance of the advertising market has led to an increase in the price of digital ads and that its size clearly destabilizes the market.</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13535574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-D161-DY1R-B0WS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1277\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Makan Delrahim laid out some of the possible arguments the US government will make against tech giants. Delrahim argued that existing antitrust laws are strong enough to regulate tech companies and that \"the Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition.\"\"Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low.\" +Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission agreed to handle any potential investigations into Amazon and Facebook, while the Department of Justice said it would handle Apple and Google parent Alphabet. Spotify has reportedly criticized Apple's practices, describing the company as anti-competitive in a complaint to the EU's antitrust regulators.</p><p><br/><br/>Here are arguments that the US government could use to probe antitrust cases against Big Tech:<br/><br/>1. The US sued Microsoft for anti-trust in 1998<br/><br/>Delrahim explained that the US government's had sued Microsoft its monopoly on personal computers. Microsoft had placed restrictions on the ability of OEMs and consumers to install the Internet Explorer browser and use other browsers such as Netscape. The successful anti-trust case against Microsoft in 1998 has enabled current tech giants like Google, Apple, and Facebook to enter the market with their own desktop and mobile products.<br/><br/>2. Coordinated behaviour<br/><br/>Delrahim said the antitrust division may look into \"coordinated conduct that creates or enhances market power\" referring to a Yahoo! and Google advertising agreement of 2008, which would have enabled \"Yahoo! to replace a significant portion of its own internet search advertisements with advertisements sold by Google\". The anti-trust's division into the case found that the agreement would have harmed the internet search advertising market and internet search syndication since both companies accounted for 90% of each market.<br/><br/>2. Exclusivity agreements<br/><br/>\"An exclusivity agreement is an agreement in which a firm requires its customers to buy exclusively from it, or its suppliers to sell exclusively to it. There are variations of this restraint, such as requirements contracts or volume discounts,\" Delrahim explained. He further explained that Microsoft's (19980 exclusive agreement to tie its Windows OS to internet explorer and discouraging OEMs and users from uninstalling the browser and was \"to the detriment of competition\" and that \"this theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets\".<br/><br/>4. Anti-competitive acquisitions<br/><br/>\"but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality. Such circumstances may raise the Antitrust Division's suspicions.\"<br/><br/>5. Competition and network effects on Big tech<br/><br/>Delrahim explains that the competition among tech firms - which is for user attention or clicks - may be difficult to assess. \"Firms operating in digital markets are typically built on proprietary technology.\" Talking about network affects, he says, \"The most successful ones seek to build and leverage networks that drive down costs while amassing a large number of customers. Eventually, the more customers a platform has, the more valuable it may be for each individual user\"  \"In many ways, AT&amp;T and Microsoft leveraged network effects to create or heighten barriers to entry.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0048264646</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB6-S3P1-DXMP-K160-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"607\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 13, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COVID collapse. The U.S. economy suffering its worst quarter in history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A tectonic testimony. Attention now shifts from antitrust to earnings for the Big Tech giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And seeing red. The United States launching the world's latest mission to Mars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Thursday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome to FIRST MOVE. Thank you for joining us, and I hope you're safe and well as always. Not a moment to lose. Today, where the data is both record breaking and devastating in equal measure. Here it is.</p><p>The United States is officially in recession. Second quarter GDP falling a staggering 32.9 percent annualized. It's the worst quarterly performance ever and of course, it follows the first quarter's five percent drop. It's a measure of the cost of economic shutdown in April, and of course this number comes despite the early reopenings that happened in May and June.</p><p>And for that reason, it's also backward looking data, which is why the weekly jobless claims, for example, is still another critical thing to watch, too.</p><p>A further 1.4 million Americans filing for first-time jobless benefits last week. Seventeen million people continue to collect -- and actually, that's a substantial rise from last week, and this, of course, comes as the enhanced benefits runs out this week and talks to extend them in D.C. seem deadlocked. We'll be talking about this throughout the show.</p><p>For now, this is the picture for U.S. futures. Softer today after solid gains yesterday. Tech stocks outperformed unfazed by criticism from lawmakers about their power and their influence, and just like an Amazon Prime delivery, there was a whole lot to unpack. We'll have analysis coming up for you.</p><p>But for now, I want to give you a look at the global picture, too, because that's sunk as well. Germany reporting a 10 percent drop in second quarter growth, another worst on record reading there. While over in Japan, they saw a fourth straight month of falling retail sales. The economic costs mount up.</p><p>The U.S. Federal Reserve repeated something that we've discussed here many times on FIRST MOVE. Yesterday, they said the only way to get fully back on track is to defeat the virus, and until that time, policymakers need to be ready to do more, and I'll keep repeating it.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins us now. Clare, just talk me through this historic collapse in quarterly growth on an annualized basis, let's be clear, here in the United States.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, it's a sobering number. Those of us who lived through this past quarter sort of watched it happen, but I think 32.9 percent, although slightly better than expected, but that's really semantic at this point. You really see the full force of this freight train, the virus and lockdown measures plowing through the U.S. economy.</p><p>Yes, it's backward looking. Yes, it was probably at its worst in April, but we do -- if you look into the sort of detail of this build up the picture of what exactly happened. Consumption is a big part of this. That of course, 70 percent of the U.S. economy in normal times. That dropped by 34.6 percent in the quarter within that, a 43.5 percent drop in services spending.</p><p>That's things like healthcare, food services, accommodations, recreation services. Of course, we all stayed at home. We all stopped doing anything and that is what is impacting this number, and of course looking back, this is hopefully as bad as it's going to get, but not necessarily.</p><p>We see a resurgence of cases. We see a rolling back of some reopening measures. And of course you talked about it, what is going to happen when stimulus runs out.</p><p>We are bumping up against those deadlines. Unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of this month. Things like support for airlines, which could be a huge deal when it comes to unemployment expiring at the end of September.</p><p>So I think the onus given this number is now really on Congress to see what they can do to sort of bolster the economy, because again, as you said, if you look at the initial jobless claims, that is a much more real time indicator of what is going on and this is the second straight week where those ticked up -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. You make some great points there. We're going to see a bounce back in the data. This number would have been so much worse if we hadn't have seen those reopenings. The cost of course is the rising cases that we are now seeing and the real fears there that we are going to see a stumble.</p><p>We're sputtering already as far as the economy is concerned, and you know, when I look at the continuing claims data here, the number of people that are already collecting benefits and continue to do so, that actually rose substantially a week and a half ago, two weeks ago, which is the latest data we have. These are warning signs.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, I think we can see this as a cautionary tale as the Federal Reserve said in its statement yesterday. This economy is going to be dictated by the course of the virus. I think, you know, you can deduce from the fact that we're seeing these resurgences in states that it's not seasonally impacted so it has to be impacted by what we, as citizens and consumers do, how we behave. And that of course, can have a negative impact on the economy.</p><p>Continuing claims, of course, really important. That's people who filed for claims for more than eight weeks running. That was up 867,000 the week ending July 18th from the prior week.</p><p>[09:05:31]</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So it's a really unnerving statistics there, Julia, and I will say that, if you look back at history, for example at the Great Depression, it shows that consumption can be really slow to return when you're working off a fear-based situation like this.</p><p>People stuffed their new deal paychecks under their mattresses and I think people are still very nervous. You can't undo the fear that we induced in people to get them to stay home in the second quarter.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's such a great point. Just because they're earning more than they were perhaps pre-COVID could argue that they weren't getting a living or weren't getting a living wage beforehand, and if you let that go, getting it back is going to be really tough, particularly in this environment. Clare Sebastian, thank you very much for that.</p><p>All right, the most powerful figures in tech under pressure on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, challenged on their internet dominations. The CEOs of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet were asked to explain their competitive practices. The Committee Chair's conclusion was clear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): This hearing has made one fact clear to me. These companies as exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.</p><p>We need to ensure the antitrust laws first written more than a century ago work in the digital age.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Donie O'Sullivan joins us once again. Donie, there were some deep detours. There were definitely some bites here. there were some lunch munching. What are your conclusions?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I mean, it was an interesting afternoon. You know, I thought as far as congressional hearings go, there was a bit more meat on the bones in this one, but as you say, there were a lot of detours and diversions, too.</p><p>A lot of Republicans focusing on, you know, the perceived conservative bias of Silicon Valley and asking those more politically charged questions. But this, after all, it was an antitrust hearing and I thought what the Democrats on the committee had done quite effectively was, you know, we've got to remember that this hearing yesterday was only part of a months' long investigation by the committee where they got many documents from inside these companies, internal e-mails, and lawmakers didn't hold back yesterday using those internal documents as evidence and putting it to the CEOs.</p><p>For instance, e-mails in 2012, internal e-mails at Facebook about the acquisition of Instagram and the Democratic representative, Jerry Nadler, putting to Mark Zuckerberg that Facebook viewed Instagram as a threat, and rather than competing with it, it decided to buy it because it didn't think it could compete with it.</p><p>So, you know, I think a lot of what was made public yesterday will feed into a lot of the ongoing investigations and I think, it will be interesting to see how it all plays out, particularly when it comes to things like the acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, whether anything will actually come of it on the other hand is a different story -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, was innovation suppressed and were consumers harmed when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are all free to their users. It will remain a question.</p><p>I want to talk about Apple as well because I think Tim Cook got off lightly here. There was one moment where he was asked about raising the costs of the App Store, access to the App Store for developers. Listen to this exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HANK JOHNSON (D-GA): What's to stop Apple from increasing its commission to 50 percent?</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: Sir, we have never increased commissions in the store since the first day it operated in 2008.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It doesn't mean you can't, though, and that's the definition of monopoly power. You can raise prices and people don't have a choice, they still come to you.</p><p>Donie, what do we make of this?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes, I mean, the honest answer is there's nothing to stop Apple from raising their commission like that. And, you know, that's what it's all about at the end of the day, whether it's Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Google. It's about these walled gardens that they have created that the app developers sort of have to play in that space. But that space is ultimately owned by these massive platforms.</p><p>So whether it's independent retailers who are trying to sell their products on Amazon and then Amazon decides to launch their own product and de-rank that independent retailer's product and take away a lot of their business, or whether it's Google who is pulling data out of websites and putting it in their search results.</p><p>So rather than having people go and click to go to a website that people stay within Google's search ecosystem, and of course, the same is true for the App Store.</p><p>I mean, Apple has total control. They can pull an app. They can charge commission, whatever they want. And so really, the app developers are totally reliant on these platforms and these companies, you know, keeping them afloat.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, at the mercy of -- Donie, very quickly, probability of some form of antitrust action as a result of what we saw yesterday? Give me a number.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: There's a lot of investigations. There's a lot of noise from both Republicans and Democrats. But as we've seen before, there's always -- it's very little action when it comes to tech companies. Maybe that will change after the election, maybe it won't. I can't make a prediction.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Hedging. Closer to zero than a hundred. Donie O'Sullivan, thank you very much for that.</p><p>China's Huawei has overtaken Samsung as the top smartphone maker in the world. Market research firm, Canalys says Huawei sold nearly 56 million phones in the second quarter, while Samsung chipped around 54 million phones. Huawei sold most of its smartphones in Mainland China.</p><p>Sherisse Pham is live in Hong Kong with all the details. Let's be clear, Sherisse, it's all about China and it's all about COVID here. How long will this dominance last?</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Whoa, that is the key question. Look, taking the number one spot is hugely important for Huawei. They want to show their brand is still strong so that they can convince customers and suppliers and developers to stick with them.</p><p>But as you raised right there, the main question is how long will this last? And analysts are saying pretty unlikely, and that's because this is only possible because of the unprecedented market situation that we're facing with COVID-19.</p><p>Huawei, as we know, we've talked about this for the better part of a year and a half, has been under a massive pressure campaign from the United States. It is cut off from key U.S. tech, which means its latest smartphones don't have Google apps, which makes them a lot less attractive to international buyers.</p><p>As a result, most of Huawei sales have now pivoted back to China. More than 70 percent of sales are in China. And so Huawei was able to capitalize on the economic recovery that played out in China because, of course, the pandemic and COVID-19 hit China earlier, and as a result, their recovery has also happened earlier.</p><p>Of course, they are also potentially facing a second wave right now. That's another conversation. So, look, will it last? Analysts saying no, because the other thing that also boosted Huawei here, not only was it their strong performance in China, but it was also Samsung's terrible performance everywhere else.</p><p>Huawei still saw sales decline, shipments decline, year-on-year for the quarter, six percent. Samsung saw a drop of 30 percent for smartphone shipments for Q2.</p><p>So huawei was able to sort of eke out a gain based on the economic recovery in China and based, of course, on Samsung's stumbles.</p><p>But analysts are already saying that this is really unlikely to last.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the catch-up is coming. Sherisse Pham, thank you so much for that.</p><p>COVID the main story here, too. Now, to Germany, Europe's largest eocnomy reporting the worst quarterly GDP drop since records began back in 1970. The German government says its economy contracted by more than 10 percent in the second quarter compared with the prior.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen is live in Berlin with more. It's a devastating number, Fred, but it doesn't reflect the economic reality today and this is really important, too.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think you're absolutely right and I think it is important. The Germans have said a couple of weeks ago that they believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel with that contraction that was going on, also because of the fact, Julia, that the Germans were able to reopen their society and thus, also, reopen their economy as well, because the COVID numbers have been quite good here over the past couple of months.</p><p>Of course, we know that they are going in the wrong direction at this point in time and it's actually one of the reasons why the German government is saying, look, people really need to continue to adhere to the physical distancing and to all the other hygiene rules as well to make sure there is not another economic lockdown and shutdown, which of course is so devastating for an export economy like the German one.</p><p>Nevertheless, the numbers of course are still quite devastating for this country, for this economy. And if you look at some of the companies that are involved, I saw numbers came out today from Volkswagen and they are deep in the red, really not looking good at all for VW. And of course, I don't know if you recall, but a couple of months ago, I was actually at Volkswagen as they were firing up some of their plants trying to get things back online. They have done that, but of course, business is very slow with the entire world in a difficult economic situation.</p><p>For the Germans right now, the big question is, they do make great cars, but who is buying them at this point in time? Right now they believe that China could help somewhat, but of course, the market in the U.S. is very difficult, and the market here in Europe very difficult as well.</p><p>[09:15:20]</p><p>PLEITGEN: And then you had numbers coming out from Deutsche Bahn, also the worst numbers that they have had since they became a privately owned company. So things looking devastating there as well. The German machine tool sector also in big trouble.</p><p>Again, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The German government says they believe that things are getting better, but certainly the data is not good and they do believe also that the recovery is going to be a fairly slow one and a lot of these big industrial sectors that of course are so important for Europe's largest economy -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. So many challenges, not only tackling the virus at the same time and keeping that under control, but businesses of all sizes and workers of course challenged here. Frederik, great to have that update. Thank you. Frederik Pleitgen there.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that are making headlines around the world.</p><p>Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong are outraged after four student activists were arrested because of their social media posts under the city's new National Security Law. Twelve pro-democracy candidates have been disqualified from upcoming legislative elections.</p><p>Zimbabwe's government has signed a $3.5 billion agreement to compensate white farmers who were evicted in the land redistribution program of the early 2000s. The economists warn that Zimbabwe's cash-strapped government can't afford the compensation.</p><p>CNN's Eleni Giokos spoke to Zimbabwe's Finance Minister and asked whether sectors such as health will suffer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MTHULI NCUBE, ZIMBABWEAN FINANCE MINISTER: This year, what we're going to spend is 8 billion Zimbabwean dollars on health. That's the target.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN BUSINESS AFRICA CORRESPONDENT: Eight billion Zimbabwe dollars on health. I mean, I don't know which exchange rate to look at, but if you look at the official rate, that is definitely, many would say, not enough.</p><p>NCUBE: The way to look at it is not the way we have explained it in terms of the exchange rate, but in terms of percentage of the government budget, because we will spend from what we have.</p><p>So in terms of timing, there's no issue about timing here. What we've done with the farmers' compensation, this is a constitutional requirement. We have to fulfill that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A short time ago, NASA launched a mission to Mars looking for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet.

China and the UAE have launched as well, and we'll have more on the mission to Mars later on in the show with the company behind battery protection technology onboard.</p><p>Also coming up on FIRST MOVE, two more of America's disastrous economic news, analysis from the former acting Labor Secretary, Seth Harris. That's coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:21:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, live from New York, where it's looking like a weak open for U.S. stocks. Futures at this moment down over one percent. We've got an avalanche of tech earnings later today, so that's probably giving investors pause for thought.</p><p>We've also had devastating economic data from around the world, including here in the United States. Second quarter GDP falling almost 33 percent on an annual basis. The worst-ever plunge in U.S. economic activity ever.</p><p>At the same time, jobless claims rising by another 1.4 million people. Just to give you a sense of scale, we'll do this every week, some 30 million people, according to the latest readings, still collecting some kind of benefit assistance. That comes in at around one in five American workers.</p><p>All of this as enhanced jobless benefits for needy Americans runs out this week and the moratorium on U.S. evictions ends. Tens of millions of Americans are in danger of losing their homes over the next few months if they can't afford rent, according to certain estimates.</p><p>Stimulus talks continue again today in Washington, but a deal does not appear close. Let's talk this through. Seth Harris joins us now. He was acting U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Obama. Sir, fantastic to have you on the show. These numbers are pretty devastating, whichever way you look at them.</p><p>SETH HARRIS, FORMER ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA: There's no question, Julia, this is the picture of a devastating and very rapid economic collapse.</p><p>I think we can expect to see some improvement in the third quarter, but the unemployment claims numbers that you cited are really deeply troubling.</p><p>The reality is that since the beginning of June, the unemployment claims numbers, which are something of a proxy for the number of people who are losing their jobs in any given week have been flat. They haven't changed, and they are at record high levels.</p><p>And so what that tells us is that we are not on a smooth path to recovery and the small increase in unemployment claims lately suggests that perhaps the economy is slowing again; not collapsing, but slowing down again. And the hopes of a V-shaped rapid recovery are simply silly and are gone.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's just tough to imagine what happens, whether it's the health crisis or just trying to get people back into the workplace assuming that those jobs are available. Because when I look at the numbers for job openings and compare them to the sheer scale of people collecting benefits, there's still tens of millions of people without jobs, even if you match up as many as you can.</p><p>The economics here are so challenged and they're challenged whichever way we look.</p><p>HARRIS: That's precisely right, Julia, and this is the big hole in the argument that President Trump and the Republicans in the United States Senate are making. They are trying to make the argument that the reason that people are not going back to work is because they have given them an additional $600.00 a week in unemployment benefits, essentially they argue incentivizing them to stay home.</p><p>But the truth is that right now in the American economy, or at least as of a few weeks ago, there are only five million job openings, and as you noted, 30 million people out of work. So even if you keep throwing incentives at people, it's futile. There are no jobs for these people to go back to and that's because demand in the economy has collapsed. We do not have enough economic growth going on in the economy to sustain new jobs for those 30 million people who are collecting unemployment benefits right now.</p><p>It's a flawed and, frankly, morally bankrupt argument designed to scale back government spending when, let me tell you, the GDP numbers tell us, the Gross Domestic Product numbers tell us that the one thing that is keeping our economy going is government spending, unemployment benefits, food assistance, support for small businesses.</p><p>And so, if we cut that off or if we don't do enough of it, we're going to drive the American economy back down into a deep recession.</p><p>[09:25:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The University of Chicago put out a study saying 68 percent of people actually are earning more now than they were earning pre-COVID. The median amount is a third higher than they were.</p><p>So I can see that some Republicans, the more conservative ones, will look at this and go, hang on a second, perhaps we got the numbers wrong. Fine if you want to reduce that perhaps to some degree or look at what people were earning before, but the logistical challenge of what the Republicans have presented here, never mind anything else of trying to work out what 70 percent of what people were earning pre-COVID and trying to do that for the coming months.</p><p>How is that possible given the challenges that we've seen even with what's already happened?</p><p>HARRIS: You're precisely right. State unemployment offices are completely overwhelmed, even now, and so if you ask them to take on a new complicated calculation for each individual unemployment insurance check they have to cut, it's going to slow them down even further.</p><p>Estimates are that it would take two to five months to implement the system that Senate Republicans and President Trump want them to implement.</p><p>And in the meantime, lots and lots of people are going to get an inadequate amount of money. So, the most important thing to remember about unemployment benefits is that it boosts the economy, it boosts consumer spending because there's a lot of evidence that unemployed workers, when they get a dollar, immediately turn around and spend that dollar.</p><p>That's what keeps their local economy going, the grocery store, the gas station, their landlord. And if you take that money out of their pockets, spending is simply going to go down.</p><p>So while there might be in a perfect world a better way to run this system, we don't live in a perfect world. We live in a technologically challenged under resourced world and we live in a world where the economy is really struggling. We need to pump as much spending into the economy as possible and unemployed workers are the perfect way to do that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, there is no perfect solutions here, but pulling back the support at this moment is not the answer. Seth, fantastic to have you on and we'll get you back soon to discuss this. It's an ongoing challenge, clearly. Seth Harris, the former acting Secretary of Labor under President Obama.</p><p>HARRIS: Thanks, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Sir, thank you again.</p><p>All right, the market opens next. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:30:31]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and U.S. are up and running this Thursday and it's a risk off day for global markets. We've got U.S. stocks trading lower early on in the session. As you can see, a bit of consolidation from yesterday's solid gains.</p><p>News that the U.S. GDP fell almost 33 percent in the second quarter annualized. It was expected, remember and it's backward looking. Where are we now? I think the best is perhaps, we'll have an even easier, an even easier time ignoring it if the economy were on a stronger footing today, but even the Fed yesterday warning that the economic bounce that we saw in late spring is fading.</p><p>Well, one of the big business is saying it's a busy day for earnings, Procter &amp; Gamble giving upbeat guidance as consumers continue to snap up the basics. Its stock is closing in, in fact on record highs.</p><p>What about UPS? Another company that continues to benefit from the stay-at- home trend? Its Q2 profits nearly doubling as demand for package deliveries remains strong. After the bell today, of course we're going to get some big tech results.</p><p>But for now, it is Wednesday's antitrust hearing in Congress that takes our focus. Facebook's CEO came under fire for the company's acquisition of Instagram. Lawmakers allege that the company copied and then bought its rival. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Facebook cloned a popular product, approached the company you identified as a competitive threat and told them that if they didn't let you buy them up, there would be consequences. Were there any other companies that you used this same tactic with while attempting to buy them?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Congresswoman, I want to respectfully disagree with the characterization. I think it was clear that this was a space that we were going to compete in one way or another. I don't view those conversations as a threat in any way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Joining us now, Roger McNamee, co-founder and Managing Partner of Elevation Partners, also the author of \"Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\" Roger, always great to have you on the show.</p><p>I want to just reiterate what Mark said earlier on in the hearing. He said we compete hard, we compete fairly and we try to be the best. Do you think an antitrust line was crossed with Instagram?</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: I think there is clear evidence of that. I mean, Julia, they produced documents from inside senior executives at Facebook that suggest precisely that threats were conveyed and that Instagram was put in this position of sell the company or effectively be destroyed by Facebook.</p><p>And to me, Julia, the thing that was striking about yesterday's hearing is the level of preparation, the amount of documentary evidence that that committee already has.</p><p>To me, what was striking in the past was that Congress looked overmatched when it met with tech CEOs. That was clearly not the case yesterday. And to be clear, the format of these hearings is terrible for the audience, right, because each Member of Congress gets only five minutes and they alternate Democrat and Republican, and so it's all over the place.</p><p>But if you sit there and just read the evidence that they have, it is, I think, conclusive relative to both Facebook and Amazon, and at least indicative relative to the others, relative to essentially using competitive power in ways that are a violation of antitrust.</p><p>And, you know, it's hard for me to imagine that we don't see some form of regulatory case that comes out of this. I mean, who knows when. And these processes take years.</p><p>But it does really appear to me that this case is much further along than I think investors generally thought.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How far along, I think, is the question, because there's a defense here and they will use the defense that was innovation suppressed? Was the consumer hurt when WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook are free products? There's a utility value that we've talked about and we talk about it time and time again, that you can't quantify here.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Julia, if the only standard that's going to be applied is the price to consumers, it will be hard to prove cases for many of these companies.</p><p>The question is whether that is standard, which is a very recent standard. It's only been in place for 40 years. In fact, it is the only one that can be used.</p><p>Remember, the United States has a long history, more than a hundred years where it had the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act from the end of the 19th Century and beginning of the 20th Century where very clearly, the goal was to promote competition. Big was bad.</p><p>[09:35:21]</p><p>MCNAMEE: Essentially, the notion was that monopoly is something that authoritarians like, and that if you want to have democracy, capitalism is the right model and we've gotten away from that.</p><p>Every industry in the economy is really concentrated today. Tech happens to have more power. But the same thing is true, part of the reason we see that horrible number on GDP for the quarter is because every industry is so consolidated that you don't have the flexibility to adapt around change.</p><p>And I think that's part of why our response to COVID is so bad. We have supply lines that are great for shareholders, but those supply chains were unable to adapt to make more PPE. They were unable to make cotton swabs. They're unable to scale testing.</p><p>I mean, all of those things are signs of an industry that is just too concentrated, and I think antitrust is one of those things that will be good for the markets and it will be good for basically democracy. I'm hopeful that we'll see more it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Amazon is only stronger as a result of COVID and we'll see those results tonight. I just want to play a quick recording of Jeff Bezos when he was asked about the use of third-party data and how that influenced their own behavior.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAYAPAL: Let me ask you, Mr. Bezos, does Amazon ever access and use third- party seller data when making business decisions and just a yes or no will suffice, sir.</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: I can't answer that question yes or no. What I can tell you is, we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Another one, and obviously on mute there, which is going to be infamous, I think. Roger, does Amazon have a problem here, too?</p><p>MCNAMEE: I think they do. And let us be clear, the question is not do these companies add a lot of value to the economy. The question is whether they use their market power in ways that in aggregate harm the company by reducing innovation, by reducing the diversity of choices available to consumers, and by undermining employment by concentrating all the power.</p><p>And I think on those issues, the tech giants are really vulnerable. Apple is in a different situation because it doesn't have the same negative impact on, say, public health that you've seen from the other companies and it certainly doesn't have the impact on democracy that both Google and Facebook have had.</p><p>Amazon, I think, is one of those companies that it's a victim of its own success. It has done extraordinary innovation in changing how products are distributed and I think there's a really strong call for turning the distribution portion of Amazon into a public utility.</p><p>But the notion that amazon can run a marketplace and also participate in it with its own branded products, that violates precepts of competition that date back more than a hundred years. And I will be very surprised if that does not lead to some kind of investigation and case against them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. They are almost so big, you're sort of hinting at the idea of the nationalization of a company because they're now so powerful.</p><p>MCNAMEE: I wouldn't go to nationalization, but I think the idea that it becomes like an electric utility that provides that service to everyone, and to be clear, that's been Jeff's strategy all along.</p><p>And from an investor point of view, the margins of public utility are actually higher than what they're doing in their distribution business today.</p><p>Julia, the one point I really want to make for our viewers is people have forgotten how important antitrust has been to the growth of the tech industry. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, beginning in 1956, an antitrust case created computers as a separate industry and put the transistor in the public domain, which started Silicon Valley.</p><p>And then every industry thereafter: software, personal computers, data networking, the internet, each one of these things came out at least partially as a result of an antitrust case.</p><p>Investors should be embracing antitrust as a positive thing because at this point we're going to have to rebuild our economy and entrepreneurship is our big strength.</p><p>And when these guys say, oh you can't regulate us, you need us to compete with China, I would point out that that's a false choice, because our competitive strength relative to China is democracy and it is the diversity of our capitalism and that we should play to those strengths, not to companies that are little Chinas. That's never going to be a successful strategy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You mentioned so many great points. I think we're in a position where investors think antitrust is a negative thing and we don't know our history well enough to understand. We will talk about this.</p><p>I also wanted to talk about their responses to China as well, and actually, we don't have time, but the difference between Mark Zuckerberg's response to being asked about Chinese theft and everyone else was illuminating.</p><p>But, Roger, I'm going to thank you.</p><p>MCNAMEE: It is. My pleasure, Julia. You take care. We will see again soon.</p><p>[09:40:21]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If you have a quick comment, we can do it. I'll take the shouting.</p><p>MCNAMEE: It's really simple. The China trade-off is nonsense. No one should pay attention to it. The way to beat China is to let a thousand flowers bloom.</p><p>Let's rebuild our entrepreneurial economy and go for maximum innovation. We can do that and this is the perfect time. We have to rebuild the economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We will have a conversation about this, because I completely agree. You have also written an op-ed for \"Time\" which is great saying safety -- regulating the safety of these internet giants is the most important thing and we can talk about that, too.</p><p>Roger, always a pleasure. Roger McNamee, co-founder and Managing Partner of Elevation Partners. Sir, stay safe. Thank you.</p><p>All right, after the break, what is NASA's multi-billion dollar Mars rover got in common with an electric super car worth over a million dollars? It's about keeping them cool.

The batteries onboard include special cooling technology made by KULR, which will also be found inside the Drako GTE, a high-performance luxury electric super car.</p><p>Joining us now Michael Mo, the CEO of KULR Technology. Wow, Michael, you've been busy. Great to have you on the show. Just talk to me and tell our viewers how your technology is being applied on this NASA mission.</p><p>[09:45:10]</p><p>MICHAEL MO, CEO, KULR TECHNOLOGY: Yes, hi, Julia. Good to see you again. Yes, our heat sink is on the Mars rover \"Perseverance.\" We're part of the instrument called SHERLOC which uses laser and camera to find signs of life on Mars.</p><p>So our carbon fiber technology is used to keep the laser and the electronics on the SHERLOC instrument cool and sound to find life on Mars.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How does it actually work, Michael? How much heat can they absorb? Because you've come on the show before and said, look, this application is being used by NASA, but it can also be used, as we just pointed out there, in super cars to keep lithium ion batteries cool.</p><p>MO: Yes, so last year, I was on the show. We were talking about our technology on the International Space Station to keep the astronauts' laptop batteries safe and cool.</p><p>You mentioned that we just announced a partnership with Drako GTE and this is 1,200 horsepower EV super car that goes at up to 206 miles per hour. I think its the fastest EV on the market right now.</p><p>We're going to take the Mars rover technology and apply to their battery pack and make it even cooler. So the goal is to make the car even faster and to make it the coolest and the fastest EV in the galaxy. So watch out, Elon Musk.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Cool and cool there. In terms of even just the physical substance here, because I was reading about it. It's a vertical carbon fiber architecture. It's like a wax, and it goes from solid to liquid as it absorbs the heat. This is pretty unique technology.</p><p>MO: Yes, that's a phase change. So as the wax, the paraffin, changes its form base from a solid form into a liquid form, it would absorb a lot of energy or put out a lot of energy without changing the temperature of the actual object heat sink in itself.</p><p>So you keep a nice engine temperature for the instruments to operate on Mars and that's how you can keep the lasers and the cameras, you know, the instruments operating well on the Mars harsh environment.</p><p>I believe that we actually have six of these heat sinks on SHERLOC, so different instruments have different temperature requirements. It's very important to keep those temperatures very constant and nice for the instruments.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, chemistry geek in me coming out here. When we last spoke to you, you weren't profitable. Where are we today? How is the business doing? Because this has been an incredibly challenging time for all businesses, I think. What has it meant for your company?</p><p>MO: Yes, last time we talked that we were in the growth phase. Obviously, COVID hit. We took the initiative to lower our costs earlier this year and we announced the forecast to be the Q2 to have over 200 percent growth year-over-year. So our earning will be coming out soon, but that was already given out as a forecast.</p><p>We lowered our cost on the operating side, you know, really hunkered down and focused on our bread and butter going after the commercial customers as well as the government contracts.</p><p>So things have been going well and we will continue to see growth in our business.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Will it suppress innovation, at least in the short-term? As you said, you're having to cut costs here. I believe you took a Paycheck Protection loan as well, which is another thing for the company to handle. To what extent is it going to sort of stagger the growth that you were hoping for here or can you circumvent that?</p><p>MO: Yes, I think that, you know, in this environment, you still have to just innovate. I think last year, we talked about what I called the KULR 1.0, which is really showcasing the space of technology on the International Space Station and now on Mars.</p><p>Now, we're on the journey for KULR 2.0, which is taking that space technology and start showing it in vertical applications like EV. Right? Take the Mars technology, going into the fastest EV car in the world.</p><p>We also announced earlier this month that we have a partner and customer called Volta Energy, going into the energy storage space and that's actually taking what we talked about last year about the International Space Station technology for keeping the batteries safe into energy storage.</p><p>So the customers are going to have energy storage in medical facilities, office space. So, you know, really going to these vertical markets.</p><p>And as a natural migration, we're going to continue to innovate and invest in the technology and grow into how to combine these technology vertical space and work with regulators about battery safety, you know, helping build our technology and our know-how into to keeping the public safer by working with regulators, as well as working with financial institutions such as insurance companies and leasing companies and so forth, and create the right kind of the financial and business model for the end customer.</p><p>[09:50:33]</p><p>MO: So, the natural migration is to continue to innovate and develop -- migrate the KULR business model from 1.0 to 2.0, hopefully to 3.0. So, maybe 2021 -- yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We get it. Michael, we get it. You are not standing idle. Great to chat with you. Thank you so much. Congratulations on the launch and we will see how the technology works.</p><p>MO: Okay, thank you, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Come back and talk to us soon. Michael Mo there, the CEO of KULR.</p><p>MO: Great, thank you so much.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, in the last few minutes, President Trump suggesting an unprecedented move with fewer than 100 days until the U.S. Presidential election, a tweet that we will discuss after this. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. Some breaking news, President Trump suggesting on Twitter a delay to the U.S. presidential election in November. He tweeted, and I quote, \"With universal mail-in voting, not absentee voting, which is good, 2020 will be the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the U.S.A. Delay the election until people can properly, securely and safely vote?\"</p><p>Joe Johns is in Washington for us. Joe, let's be clear, he doesn't have the power to delay an election, but for those that fear he will contest an election if he loses, this is fuel on the fire.</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That's absolutely right, Julia. This is the President of the United States delegitimizing, undermining an election yet to be held, set for November, in which he is well behind in the polls, at least right now, and since the Constitution does not give the President the power to change the time of elections, it's left up to the Congress, he's essentially setting himself up to make the claim after the election results are in that the election was bogus.</p><p>And, you know, that's the kind of thing that throws the United States into an uproar as it did in 2000 with Bush versus Gore.</p><p>Now, why can he do it? It's because the Constitution leaves it up to the legislature, both the House and Senate, to determine the time, place and manner of Federal Elections.</p><p>So that's it from here. I mean, I did talk to a source up on Capitol Hill and asked, well, what about this? What are Democrats saying? What's the important thing to know? The source says it can't be done, so why pay attention?</p><p>But the reason to pay attention, of course, the alternative view, is that the President is seeking to delegitimize this election in which polls show he is behind. Julia, back to you.</p><p>[09:55:11]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No coincidence, Joe, in timing, I think as well, on a day where we see the second quarter growth collapse for the United States, down some 33 percent.</p><p>The irony here actually is that the third quarter is meant to be better and that comes just a few days before the presidential election.</p><p>JOHNS: Right, because what that shows is one of the President's biggest arguments for reelection, only about a year ago, was the state of the economy, that he continued to take credit for.</p><p>Now, the economy clearly is in shambles and he is not going to be able to use that to run on, so it's certainly problems for him, continued problems for the President as he sort of throws things again the wall to see what will stick.</p><p>Add to the list the question about whether to delay the elections -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, this debate will continue, no doubt. Joe Johns, thank you so much for your context there.</p><p>Wow, that was a busy show and that just about wraps it up. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. I'm Julia Chatterley. Stay safe and I'll see you tomorrow. Have a good day.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020073001cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-V941-JB20-G2HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market, Economy, Big Tech, Coronavirus, Health and Medicine, Astronautics and Space, Labor and Employment, Technology, Government, Politics, Election, Donald Trump</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The Dow is up by 41 points despite the fact that we got GDP coming in at a solid 2.1 percent. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 are at record highs. The Dow though has been weighed down by industrial stocks, a lot of those companies concerned about a looming trade war. Those the markets, my friend, and these are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. economy takes its foot off the gas just as the Fed gets ready to make its move on rates. And shares in T-Mobile and Sprint are surging as I speak. Their massive cellphone merger is no longer on hold. It has been approved by the Justice Department and when it comes to threats on trade, Donald Trump is now putting French wine on the menu. We will explain why. Live from the world's financial capital here in New York City. It is Friday, July the 26th. I'm Zain Asher and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>All right, welcome everybody. Tonight, growth flows in the world's biggest economy. The U.S. GDP growth fell in the second quarter, down one percentage point from the first three months of the year. That number the still slightly better than what analysts had been expecting, a fall in business sentiment; investment rather balanced out strong increases in consumer and government spending.</p><p>President Trump is partly blaming the Fed for the weak number. He says the USA is set to the zoom. Our Cristina Alesci is following it also. Cristina, when you look at this in context of other GDP numbers that you've gotten since Trump has been President, this is actually the slowest increase. Just walk us through why.</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: So, part of it has to do with this looming trade war. Businesses do not have confidence in making investments, and that's usually a leading indicator. So, the consumer is usually the last to know that the party is over. And CEOs are reluctant to make decisions, they are reluctant to make investments, which really weighed down this growth number.</p><p>Trump is out there hitting the Fed. It's not the Feds fault. It's the fact that he has launched this protracted trade war with China. He has not been able to reach a deal, in addition to the fact that he cut taxes on corporate America in an attempt to boost growth. It doesn't look like that that really is sustainable, because it looks like we've -- we're weaning off the effects of that.</p><p>ASHER: So when you look at the GDP numbers, specifically, you talk about business investment being slightly lower. But then at the same time, you also have consumer spending being one area that's doing much better than people have been anticipating. Walk us through why.</p><p>ALESCI: Really unexpectedly strong consumer spending number. I mean, everybody thought it was going to be strong, but it was even stronger than expectations. And part of that has to do with like the booming stock market. So, people feel good. There's an incredible amount of optimism. In fact, there are some numbers that show that consumers are buying more durable goods, that they're making long term investments.</p><p>But again, this is against the backdrop of the business environment and business spending not being as strong. And typically, when I spoke to the economists this week, they were telling me that consumer spending is sort of a lagging indicator.</p><p>So, the consumers are the last to know that the economy isn't as strong as what would appear to be now. Look, I think we have real challenges for growth going forward. I think even if we do get a resolution or some kind of a deal with China, I think there are real questions about how the slowing global growth environment really impacts the U.S. And I think that's going to continue to be a big question.</p><p>Politically, though, it's really difficult for Trump to sustain and meet that three percent growth target that he has before the 2020 election. There is going to be a lot of pressure to do that.</p><p>ASHER: Right, so how might other candidates in the Democratic field 2020 capitalize on this?</p><p>ALESCI: They're going to hit him hard. They're going to hit him hard on the tax cuts, because that, again, was supposed to benefit the average American by -- the line from the administration was you cut taxes on corporations, they'll hire more, they'll give people more wage increases, and that doesn't appear to be the case.</p><p>So, the Democrats will come out and say, \"Hey, look, you gave corporations this big tax cut. Where are the benefits for the average person? Where is the wage inflation? The meaningful wage inflation ...\" and I think that's where you -- you already heard Joe Biden say it.</p><p>ASHER: Right. All right, Cristina Alesci, thank you so much.</p><p>ALESCI: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: Have a have a great weekend. Okay, so today's GDP report comes just five days before the Fed will announce its decision on interest rates. The New York Stock Exchange floor trader Peter Tuchman told CNN investors are ready and waiting for a cut.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:05:01] PETER TUCHMAN, FLOOR BROKER, QUATTRO M. SECURITIES: GDP numbers were good. Business investment is down. Manufacturing down. So, I think they're responding to potential global slowdown, and that's why they're actually lowering it. The market is loving it right now, right? The Dow at 27, 200. The S&amp;P having a really banner day here, up almost 20 handles.</p><p>So, the market tells us, in my opinion, what it thinks of these moves, of these big economic moves and they're loving it. People are buying this valuation. So, it seems good to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: And Wall Street is putting together an economic puzzle to really figure out what exactly the Fed is going to be doing next week. These are the pieces we had already. Markets. Markets have certainly been fairly strong and stable, but that's largely because investors are expecting the Fed to cut rates.</p><p>Jobs. Jobs is another area, again, strong but of course pay is lagging. And global factors. We actually heard this week, the European Central Bank is preparing fresh stimulus and that gets us through today's new piece, U.S. GDP. We've been seeing economic reports from retail sales to durable goods orders, that gave us an idea what it would look like.</p><p>There are still two key pieces missing, which we will actually get on Tuesday, inflation, how fast the cost of goods is rising; and of course, consumer confidence, how Americans feel about the future of the economy. That fell last month. Neither of those is likely to change what's already on the table. A lot of people are saying they really do anticipate a rate cut this time around. The question is, of course, how deep will that rate cut be?</p><p>Joining me now is the Founder and President of MacroPolicy Perspectives, Julia Coronado. Julia, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>JULIA CORONADO, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, MACROPOLICY PERSPECTIVES: My pleasure.</p><p>ASHER: So, just walk us through how this two percent -- 2.1 percent GDP that we just got actually affects the Fed's decision making? Does it make their decision harder at all? Even though everyone is anticipating a rate cut.</p><p>CORONADO: So, there's a couple of things in the report. One is the growth picture, which looks fine. The consumer spending which you just highlighted looks resilient. Investment is a worry spot and that does tend to be the leading indicator. So, that's a concern that reflects the global slowdown. Maybe it is one reason for the Fed to get ahead of that and ease policy a bit.</p><p>The other aspect of the report was the inflation. So, we got a preview of that. You mentioned we're going to get the details on Tuesday, but we it came in unexpectedly low. And that has been the story throughout the recovery. Inflation is just persistently low, it's lower than they want it to be. It's a reason to, at a minimum, just recalibrate policy a little bit.</p><p>ASHER: So, when you think about the fact that business investment isn't where -- either the government or some economist had been anticipating or hoping, how does that factor into how much they cut rates by?</p><p>CORONADO: Well, so you know, that's been a debate and we've gotten mixed signals from the Fed about whether they'll cut 25 basis points, whether they'll cut 50 basis points. I think that they've signaled pretty clearly they're going to cut 25. I think 50 would be a big surprise.</p><p>There isn't an emergency here. There isn't a recessionary threat looming. It's more of a let's get ahead of it. They're calling it an insurance rate cut. Let's get ahead of these risks and ease policy and keep markets well supported before those risks really hit the numbers, hit hiring and hit the consumer. So, for that reason, I think they'll go a little bit more gradually.</p><p>ASHER: Okay. So when you think about the economy overall, I mean it's doing well, maybe the 2.1 percent wasn't what we got in first quarter 2019, but it's still a solid number, nonetheless. Is the Fed thinking purely at this point governed by trade war fears?</p><p>CORONADO: No, there's -- they point to a few factors. One is the trade wars and the uncertainty that brings and we can see that weighing on business investment. They're hearing it from their contacts. We're seeing it in the numbers. The other is what you already mentioned, the global slowdown. You know, whether the trade war is the primary cause, there's a pretty pronounced global slowdown.</p><p>We heard from ECB and Mario Draghi. This is a worrisome picture, certainly for Europe, for China, for Asia. So, that's going to affect us. It already is affecting us through trade. Trade was exports and imports, both down pretty significantly in the first half.</p><p>ASHER: There's a lot who are saying the recession fears in the U.S. are not necessarily valid.</p><p>CORONADO: Right. There aren't flashing recessionary indicators in the U.S. So far, the picture of U.S. resilience is intact in the data, but that's what the Fed wants to ensure stays there.</p><p>ASHER: They said it's an insurance policy.</p><p>CORONADO: It is insurance policy. So, it's not the beginning of a long rate cutting cycle. If all goes well, it's a rate cut here, maybe another one down the road. Keep the train on the tracks. Don't wait until those recessionary factors are hitting you upside the head.</p><p>ASHER: Right. Right, right. Get ahead of the problem. So, when you think about consumer spending, I mean, yes, this is sort of a two-pronged GDP report whereby consumer spending turned out pretty well.</p><p>CORONADO: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Business investment, not so great. Why -- what is behind the growth in consumer spending?</p><p>CORONADO: So, consumers are feeling good. The labor market is strong. Wage gains are decent, they're not fabulous, but they're okay. Consumer confidence is pretty good.</p><p>[15:10:10] CORONADO: So, consumers are feeling, you know, they're feeling good about their economic prospects. They're spending at a reasonable pace. It's not really as much of a boom as today's numbers probably indicate. There's volatility in the numbers, just look at the first half of as a whole, and it is two and a half, slightly above two and a half percent spending. That's kind of where the consumer has been. They've been really rock solid, very stable and that's very important.</p><p>If you can't -- you're not going to get a recession if the consumer stays on track. So, the whole idea, I think, of getting ahead of this risk is short circuit that hit to confidence.</p><p>ASHER: I see. And when you think about the S&amp;P 500, even though the Dow - - we don't have it up there anymore -- but even though the Dow was sort of a bit lackluster today, when you think about the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ both in record territories, what's behind that boost?</p><p>CORONADO: Well, I mean, there's two things. One, I think the fact that we are learning yet again that interest rates are going to be low for as far as we can possibly see that is a sort of the discount rate at which we apply to future earnings. That boosts the stock market.</p><p>So, you've got the combination of the U.S. looks pretty resilient and interest rates are going to stay low for as far as we can see. Therefore, that gives you some good valuations. They may be a little optimistic. They are not discounting any of those recessionary possibilities or that global slowdown hitting.</p><p>And actually, we are seeing that in the earnings reports. Right? Some of the earnings haven't been meeting expectations. There's some guidance, especially with companies exposed to that global economy -- haven't been -- you know, we're not in double digit earnings territory. So, we'll have to see how that evolves as the year progresses.</p><p>ASHER: Julia, thank you so much. Appreciate you being with us.</p><p>CORONADO: My pleasure.</p><p>ASHER: So, GDP is just one factor and investors are watching. Let's take a look at the Dow. It has been a bit of an up and down day as I was saying earlier. Big industrial names like Caterpillar, Boeing and 3M are actually pulling the Dow back. But the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ as Julia and I were just talking about are both on pace as I speak for record closes. That's partly thanks to the better than expected GDP report, also strong earnings from Twitter and Google's parent company, Alphabet. We'll have a little bit more on that with our Clare Sebastian a little bit later on in the show.</p><p>And Sprint and T-Mobile have been trying to merge for more than a year. The U.S. Justice Department has just given the green light. One more agency and several lawsuits remain in the way though. And Hong Kong protestors chart a new course to make their message heard, staging a sit-in at the city's International Airport. We will bring you the latest developments after the break.</p><p>ASHER: The third and fourth largest wireless carriers in the U.S. has struck a deal with the Justice Department to complete their merger. Shares of Sprint and T-Mobile are rallying. The two companies argued they need to merge in order to take on Verizon and AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T, by the way, of course, owns CNN. Brian Fung is following this story from Washington for us. So Brian, just walk us through the terms of this deal.</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: Yes, let's talk a little bit about what is going to happen as a result of this settlement involving the Justice Department. Sprint, T-Mobile and Dish Network, which is going to become the nation's new next fourth wireless carrier by picking up Sprint, and it's prepaid segments including Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.</p><p>Now, that's not the only thing that's happening here. As a result of the settlement agreed with D.O.J., Sprint and T-Mobile will -- the new T-Mobile will give Dish access to its network for a period of seven years. That's to help the new carrier owned by Dish gain traction as it tries to become a viable fourth competitor here.</p><p>Now, we also have, you know, about nine million of these subscribers shifting from Sprint to Dish and I think, you know, one big question moving forward is going to be is that going to be enough subscribers to really make Dish a viable fourth here, particularly because these subscribers are going to be prepaid subscribers, not postpaid subscribers which tend to be a little bit more lucrative and valuable for a wireless carrier.</p><p>ASHER: Okay, so Dish is going to benefit. The only question is how much will they benefit? But in terms of what the new T-Mobile has to gain, obviously Sprint has been struggling, so the new T-Mobile, what do they have to gain in terms of being able to compete with AT&amp;T, which is number one in America, and Verizon, which is number two.</p><p>FUNG: Well, was the result of this deal, the new T-Mobile will have about 92 million subscribers, that's about as many as AT&amp;T currently has at 93 million. So, it really puts T-Mobile within striking distance of some of the big two wireless carriers in the United States.</p><p>And T-Mobile says with this deal, it will be able to spread next generation 5G mobile data to across the United States on a much faster basis than it would otherwise. Now, you also have a group of states that are suing to block this deal saying that's not what's going to happen here that in fact, prices are going to go up over the long term because you now have a reduction competition due to the fact that T-Mobile has now gotten bigger, and the fourth competitor Dish is much smaller.</p><p>ASHER: Brian Fung. Thank you so much. Softbank is launching a second massive tech fund. This one will be called Vision Fund 2 and will be done without money from the Saudi Kingdom. Instead, the likes of Apple, Foxconn, Microsoft and the Kazakhstan will contribute more than $100 billion to invest in startups working specifically on artificial intelligence.</p><p>The First Vision Fund has been a resounding success. Profit is actually up more than 300 percent in the fiscal year -- in the last fiscal year. Its greatest hit so far might actually be Uber. The Vision Fund made a big bet at a discount while Uber was going through a series of PR problems. It paid off when Uber finally went public earlier this year.</p><p>It also actually has a slice of Slack as well. The fund actually bought into Slack at about $5 billion valuations since its IPO. Slack is worth more than three times that. The Vision Fund was also in early on WeWork. Reports say WeWork could be aiming to go public this fall. It would be the year's second biggest IPO, only behind Uber.</p><p>Jerry Colonna is a venture capitalist who built some of the original tech investment funds working with Softbank back in the 90s. His book is called \"Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up.\" Jerry, I have to say first of all, I really thoroughly enjoyed your book, we'll get to that at a different date though, but --</p><p>JERRY COLONNA, COFOUNDER AND CEO, REBOOT: Well, thank you.</p><p>ASHER: When it comes to specifically, this Vision Fund 2, just walk us through the investment strategy because there is a target on AI. Why?</p><p>COLONNA: I think it's pretty obvious that AI and more specifically machine learning represent the future of technology. It represents the future of innovation, if you will. And Masayoshi Son has always been on the leading edge and way out in front. Sometimes a little scary, sometimes a little risky, but always been out in front in recognizing what the next trends are coming.</p><p>[15:20:06] COLONNA: And I think he did it in Vision 1. And I think he's going to do it again in Vision 2.</p><p>ASHER: So how much control will the founders actually have over the investment strategy now that they're obviously not going to be working with Saudi Arabia anymore?</p><p>COLONNA: I don't know the terms of the LP agreement. I don't know the terms that they have here. But it would surprise me if there's any dramatic change in Vision 2 than there was in Vision 1.</p><p>ASHER: So, how did this Vision 2 -- actually both funds really changed the relationship between startups, corporations, and investors? Walk us through that.</p><p>COLONNA: Yes, I think that that's the thing to really focus on here. What we're talking about is a magnitude of investment in that, you know, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, when I started in this business, we weren't talking about these numbers, you know, $108 billion fund was just not something that was seen before.</p><p>And with that kind of investing power, what you're seeing is significant investments $10 billion investments at a time, that really alter the trajectory and the timeframe it takes to launch a business.</p><p>This really challenges and changes the way the normal trajectory for a company to unfold, and then there's a corollary challenge, of course, which is it challenges leaders, it challenges the business leaders to grow in different ways in a much more rapid pace.</p><p>ASHER: So what effect does that have on Silicon Valley culturally?</p><p>COLONNA: I think that's really a fascinating question right now. One of the biggest concerns I would have and to be clear, one of the things I do right now is I coach many of these CEOs. And one of the challenges that they all have, is that we're raising the ante. We're raising the definition of what does it mean to be successful?</p><p>And so if I take a -- I mean, it sounds wonderful, if I take $100 million investment in a third round of investment in my company, I have to have a significant exit in order to generate a return on investment for my investors to satisfy the LPs who are in this fund, let alone the folks who are driving SoftbankVision 2.</p><p>That changes the dynamic and one of the concerns I would have is, are we then forcing inadvertently, unconsciously forcing, kind of the worst behaviors that we have seen of late in Silicon Valley, where there's just a heavy, heavy emphasis on return on investment and less of an emphasis on building a long-term sustainable and ultimately ethical responsible business?</p><p>ASHER: All right, Jerry Colonna, live for us, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Have a great weekend.</p><p>COLONNA: Thank you for having me.</p><p>ASHER: You're welcome. Okay, so tech titans, Google and Amazon capped off a busy week for FAANG stocks. Google parent, Alphabet shocked investors with better than expected earnings. The rebound from a weak first quarter has actually -- shares up 10 percent.</p><p>Amazon, a surprise too, ended a full quarter streak of record profits after spending more than $800 million in the second quarter speeding up shipping for Prime members. The miss has shares down, you can see here at around one and a half percent. Clare Sebastian is joining us live now to talk about Amazon more specifically.</p><p>So, when you think about just how much Amazon has been spending, just what they're spending trajectory has been that's really hurt them when it comes to profit.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: So this quarter was yes, it was all about the one day shipping. As you say, they spent more than $800 million, more than is crucial, because $800 million is what they projected it would cost and has proved to be more expensive. They've said because of transitioning in their fulfillment centers, because of moving product nearer to customers. All of this is a seismic shift to the vast distribution network.</p><p>The CFO compared it to when they first launched Fulfillment by Amazon when they move beyond books and media into a broad range of products that they sell now. So, this is a big issue. Plus they say they're only in the middle of this journey. This is going to go on for multiple quarters.</p><p>The profit deceleration is something of a big deal. Because is this taking us back, Zain, to the kind of a high growth, high investment, slightly lower profit model that Amazon has really come to define. And I think that's why we see the share price down a little bit today. We had become used to the profits going up for a number of quarters now.</p><p>ASHER: And Amazon is also one of obviously many tech companies that are facing regulatory scrutiny. Obviously, that's not necessarily impacted in these specific results, though.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: No.</p><p>ASHER: We didn't see that.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: They barely mentioned it. But that doesn't mean it's not a cloud on the horizon. Certainly, we've seen this week with the FTC fine that was leveled on Facebook. There were rumors that the FTC might be looking into Amazon. We know the Department of Justice has launched a broader investigation into Big Tech and antitrust concerns.</p><p>[15:25:00] SEBASTIAN: Plus, we had the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this week saying singling out quite starkly Amazon saying that it had ruined retail. That it was responsible for the demise of multiple smaller retailers.</p><p>So, clearly Amazon is in the sights of the administration. But for now, I think in the short term, certainly for investors, the bigger challenge there is how they going to maintain their market leadership position and how much they're going to have to spend to do that.</p><p>ASHER: And let's talk about Donald Trump tweeting today. Guys, can we put up the tweet? Actually, Donald Trump tweeted about France's digital tax on American companies. I actually can't read that without my contact lenses. The font is so small, but Clare, Donald Trump is basically talking here about the fact that France has just leveled a digital tax on several great American companies.</p><p>He is talking about retaliating. Walk us through how he plans to retaliate. I mean, obviously, he didn't mention specifics, but what are his options?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, he kind of did. He said, his last sentence there, he said, \"I've always said American wine is better than French wine.\" From the subtext, of course, the President doesn't drink. But I think that the implication there is that since it's clear that the French law, the three percent levy on the biggest tech firms unfairly in his eyes targets American companies, given that they are the biggest. He wants to retaliate by the implication being putting a tariff on French products.</p><p>Now, this is in theory possible. The U.S. has launched a Section 301 investigation into this this digital tax. That's the same kind of investigation that allowed them to put tariffs on Chinese goods. It's about unfair commerce discriminating against American companies.</p><p>So you know, this is a possibility. Does this now set up another front in this global trade war that we're seeing? I think that's the big question.</p><p>ASHER: Clare Sebastian, live for us. Thank you so much. All right. Still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.

Some are saying that after weeks of unrest, they fear the worst.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHAN KING, HONG KONG CHINESE IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS ASSOCIATION (through translation): The economy of Hong Kong has been affected in a big way. Our export in June saw a decrease of 9 percentage points from the last year. And we are really concerned about this. If the situation continues, the economy will be in big trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Isaac Stone Fish is with me. He's a senior fellow at the Asia Society. Thank you so much for being with us. So, and -- was it seem protests across Hong Kong, several months now. Is Hong Kong's status as a major financial hub in Asia under threat as a result of this?</p><p>ISAAC STONE FISH, SENIOR FELLOW, ASIA SOCIETY: I think it's a threat as a result of the protest. I think there's a lot of constituents on the Chinese mainland, especially in places like Shanghai and Tianjin which would love to see international companies that were headquartered in Hong Kong, move to the mainland and that they don't feel like they need Hong Kong to act as a gateway anymore.</p><p>ASHER: So then, in terms of business investment in Hong Kong, are people actually rethinking whether or not Hong Kong is the right place for them to invest their money as a result of this?</p><p>FISH: Can certainly imagine people getting off their flights from London and New York on Friday and seeing thousands of protesters protesting peacefully, nonetheless, but thousands of protesters and thinking, wow, this is not the financial center that I thought.</p><p>That said, I think a lot of people do appreciate the rule of law in Hong Kong and recognize that if this were to happen in places like Shanghai or Tianjin, police would crack down quite shortly (ph) on the protesters and that's not good for business either.</p><p>ASHER: Right, right.</p><p>FISH: Good for PR reasons and also for the idea of, oh, if we need a summary judgment here, we can't trust the police and the party to act in our interest.</p><p>ASHER: That's interesting. So you're giving a different perspective there. But in terms of a resolution coming out of this very quickly, that's obviously going to be important for people who have their money in Hong Kong.</p><p>[15:35:00] FISH: Certainly and that's not something that I or any of them should be holding their breath about. This really feels like it's going to be a story for the next several months, if not longer. There's no easy solution to this.</p><p>And what the people in Hong Kong want and what many in the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government want are quite different. And I think the remarkable thing about Hong Kong is that it will probably manage to remain quite a stable place both culturally, politically and financially. I mean, less politically, but certainly culturally and financially while this turmoil continues.</p><p>ASHER: So you see it's quite resilient financially then?</p><p>FISH: Exactly.</p><p>ASHER: And then when you think about this -- you know, we've been obviously taking about from the macro perspective, businesses or companies might, might be rethinking whether or not Hong Kong is the right place for them to do business, but what about businesses on the ground?</p><p>I mean, we heard just a sound bite of a gentleman talking about how -- just the fact that you have thousands of protesters closing the streets in some of the busiest parts of Hong Kong, for ordinary small businesses on the ground, that's got to be an absolute nightmare.</p><p>FISH: I think it does. I mean, I think the positive side, you do have people coming in and out which for certain consumer businesses can be helpful. But I think this is a large period of uncertainty. And uncertainty can really be a total buzz kill for certain investors. So I think for local businesses that feel like they need to be able to predictively plot out what their future is, this is certainly not a good time for them.</p><p>ASHER: And if Hong Kong isn't as resilient as you and I believe it is, let's just play devil's advocate for a second, and people do sort of rethink whether or not it is the right place for them to do businesses and companies start pulling out their money. What kind of effect does that have on the region?</p><p>FISH: I think it's excellent for Singapore, which has always been the best alternative for Hong Kong because it has a strong legal system as long as you stay away from the ruling family, strong legal system and high living standards. And I think it could also be beneficial for other cities across China depending on the macro with U.S.-China trade war.</p><p>I think it will have the worst effect for other countries around Hong Kong that do see, you know, that any sort of kind of deep financial start (ph) pieces of them going through Hong Kong and of course, not good for the Hong Kong people themselves.</p><p>ASHER: What would you say that a resolution actually looks like in this scenario?</p><p>FISH: I think it would probably at this point be the resignation and apology of the current chief executive --</p><p>ASHER: Carrie Lam?</p><p>FISH: -- Carrie Lam, along with something from the protesters agreeing to say back down. I don't necessarily see that happening and it's also kind of the, if you give an inch, take a mile fear.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>FISH: There's so many possibilities if Carrie Lam steps down and there's elements the protesters as you swath (ph) the protesters who want more.</p><p>So, I mean, it's -- part of I guess what we try to do is predict the future. It's really hard to know what's going to happen, but my best guess is that this is just going to continue without a resolution.</p><p>ASHER: Well, she certainly digging her hill when it came to the exhibition bill. So, we'll see what she does this time. Thank you so much. Appreciate you being with us.</p><p>All right, so up, Democrats are ready to take on big tech. This time, as Pete Buttigieg blasting Silicon Valley for ignoring workers' rights. That's next.</p><p>[15:40:49] ASHER: The field (ph) of 2020 Democratic hopeful is setting their sights on big tech as well. Pete Buttigieg is calling out Silicon Valley for failing to recognize workers rights. It's all part of his new economic plan aimed to protect the employees and boosting paychecks. In a campaign ad laying out the plan, Mayor Pete asked his supporters call him, said America's economic recovery has not lifted the ordinary worker. I want you to listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Economic progress has to mean that we are actually earning enough to live well. We were promised a rising tide that would lift all boats. Sure enough, GDP went up, businesses boomed, stock market grew over decades, but our paychecks didn't show it. Our incomes have basically stayed flat. That is why today, I'm sharing a plan that fights to get Americans the pay raise we deserve.</p><p>Does America deserve a raise?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKERS (in unison): Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: And Vanessa Yurkevich joins us live now. So, just walk us through what his plans are in terms of specifics. How is he trying to protect workers?</p><p>VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's very comprehensive. It's directed at the American worker, just some top line items off the bat. He's going to guarantee American workers the right to join the union. He's introducing multimillion dollar penalties for employers that interfere in union elections or workers rights.</p><p>He's allowing companies -- excuse me, he's allowing workers to collectively bargain directly with their companies and he's renewing calls for that $15 federal minimum wage with indexed wage growth.</p><p>And so, this is something that policy -- labor policy experts have been calling for, for years. And it's quite ambitious. So if, you know, Pete Buttigieg makes it all the way to the White House, this is going to be a very ambitious plan that he's going to try to push through.</p><p>ASHER: This is not just the $15 minimum wage federally, he also wants to make sure that men and women have equal pay in this country. But, how does he plan on making sure that happens?</p><p>YURKEVICH: He wants to make it public. So every big company out there, he would make it mandatory that these companies report publicly the wage discrepancies between men and women. Obviously, giving people a look at how they're doing in the marketplace.</p><p>He's also supporting existing bills that are already out there, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which passed through the House, would ban employers from using an employee salary history to determine their wages.</p><p>So he's really why the sweeping plan, but really targeting special groups like women and also minorities who have a harder time catching up to wages as it begins with.</p><p>ASHER: And a lot of people talks about this idea of the gig economy, the so called sort of Uber and Lyft drivers, how they're hurt by the fact that they're contractors and not necessarily forgoing employees. What's Mayor Pete saying about that?</p><p>YURKEVICH: This is a really big part of this policy proposal. He's calling out big tech companies by name, Google, Lyft, Uber, saying that you're hiring contractors which is limiting them to what their rights are, being able to apply for full benefits. So what his proposal is, is actually making it so that these contractors can unionize, can collective bargain and then will have stronger rights within these companies.</p><p>What's really interesting, though, to point out is that Mayor Pete had a huge big fund raising quarter in the second quarter about $25 million. A lot of that money came from Silicon Valley, from the Silicon Valley executives that he is now --</p><p>ASHER: Oh, boy.</p><p>YURKEVICH: -- proposing this plan for. So it will be interesting how things go in the future, yes.</p><p>ASHER: And then he's not really the only sort of Democratic candidate that's sort of using big tech as a punching bag. Obviously, Tulsi Gabbard is fighting a lawsuit against Google. I mean, just walk us through that.</p><p>YURKEVICH: And it's not just the Democrats. Republicans, you know, President Trump just tweeting today that Apple is not going to be getting a discount on their parts that they get from China. But, yes, Democrats very much speaking to big tech warn trying to break up big tech companies, including Amazon, saying they have a monopoly on the marketplace.</p><p>So, I think that we're going to be hearing a lot more of this as the stage sort of gets smaller in terms of the candidates that are going to be out there because, you know, tech companies are being squeeze from all sides right now. They're very much in the forefront of the news with these new regulations that are --</p><p>[15:45:05] ASHER: Privacy issues --</p><p>YURKEVICH: Exactly.</p><p>ASHER: -- internationally with the E.U. fines as well.</p><p>YURKEVICH: And I just think that presidential candidates are going to realize that this is an opportunity for them to start rolling out some policies, continue to roll out some policies that target this issue.</p><p>ASHER: Well, we've got the CNN debates next week. We shall see what they say.</p><p>YURKEVICH: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Vanessa Yurkevich, live for us. Thank you so much.</p><p>And don't forget as, I just said, the next Democratic debates will be live on CNN on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. See the feels of Democratic candidates there. Coverage begins 8:00 p.m. Eastern time here in the United States. But, actually, you can see it again if you miss those times at around 7:00 a.m. London time, the next day, of course, only on CNN. Trust me guys, you will not want to miss it.</p><p>Step right up and choose your player. The Fortnite World Cup is happening right now in New York. 100 of the world's top gamers have come to battle out for part of a $30 million prize pool. Many of them already making a career out of the video game. CNN talked to two teenagers taking home six figures a year for playing Fortnite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOAM ACKENINE, FAZE MEGGA, FORNITE PRO PLAYER: My name is Noam and people know me as FaZe Megga.</p><p>DANIEL WALSH, FAZE DUBS, FORTNITE PRO PLAYER: My name is Daniel Walsh and everyone knows me as FaZe Dubs.</p><p>ACKENINE: My old name used to be like Meggatroll, but like -- it didn't seem like professional for me, so I just sort to down to like Megga so it will look way cleaner.</p><p>WALSH: Right now, I make about $80,000 a year. And from tournaments I've made like over $100,000.</p><p>ACKENINE: I make like 120K, like this year, and especially with the World Cup coming up, I know I can make -- me and Dubs can make like even more.</p><p>WALSH: I definitely take this as my career because right now it's really competitive and we're in all of these tournaments. But like later, I plan to like be more on like the content side and do streaming and like YouTube and stuff.</p><p>ACKENINE: Yes, in five years, I also see myself like streaming, doing YouTube, and also playing pro.</p><p>Like I'm one of the youngest pro Fortnite players that qualified for the World Cup and it just feels amazing.</p><p>WALSH: I have grinding and I have put in the time so I know I am one of the best and I know I can win the tournament.</p><p>ACKENINE: Yes, it was like really unexpected like knowing the prize pool which was like really big. But me and Dubs, we've been like grinding for a while.</p><p>WALSH: To become like a really good duo, you have to put a lot of hours in and gain chemistry because if you don't have chemistry, you could be two of the best players, but if you don't have chemistry together, you can't be one of the best.</p><p>ACKENINE: It's definitely a little weird for like 18 year olds and 20 years olds like qualify, but at the same time, we've all been playing Fortnite for like the same amount of time and we've been screaming for about the same time.</p><p>WALSH: Fortnite definitely impacted my school because my grades started going down, but I was like making a lot of money so it was like hard for me. I switched to online school right after I qualified for World Cup.</p><p>KYLE WALSH, FAZE DUBS BROTHER: I'm Kyle Walsh. I'm FaZe Dubs's older brother and I'm super proud of him. This is a big deal. For me and my family, not a lot of people know, we don't come from much, like I live with a single mom and we live in like a townhouse. So, first and foremost, it would be crazy and Daniel keeps saying and he's like, we're going to -- I'm going to buy us a house.</p><p>AARON ACKENINE, FAZE MEGGAS BROTHER: Getting millions in the house out of nowhere, it's going to be crazy. I know he's not going to spend it crazy but, you know, my mom's been close to losing her house so he says -- he always he's going to help her first. So I think it's real humble of him.</p><p>Yes, it's hard when work is so important and they're making so much money that like our parents don't really see it. You have to convince your parents, yes, this is important, this is their career.</p><p>K. WALSH: Some good boys right here.</p><p>D. WALSH: Let's go.</p><p>N. ACKENINE: Let's go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: When we come back, a watch company has been taking to the skies. CEO of Breitling on what's ahead at his corporate jet team. That's next.</p><p>[15:51:53] ASHER: You may remember from watching this program yesterday that Richard finally got his top gun moment. He took off with the Breitling jet team on a flight like no other, full of daring spins, plenty of G-force and breakneck speeds. Through it all, Richard was a trooper. He made it out of one piece, but he says he's keeping his day job.</p><p>Before sitting up, Richard spoke with Breitling CEO who also oversees the company's luxury watches. He told Richard why Breitling is so committed to its feet and what time piece we should look for in 2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GEORGES KERN, CEO, BREITLING: We're working with the jet team since 17 years and we are the only corporation in the world having a private jet team, which we use to host clients or journalists and giving them the experience you're going to have today. And of course, as we have these strong roots in aviation, having such a platform was always very important for the brand.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST: It's not cost-effective though, is it? I mean, I don't know if any other company that has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.</p><p>KERN: Indeed, it's usually expensive. And the problem is -- I mean, you wouldn't have any Formula One team with just one sponsor. Mercedes has more sponsors on their car than just Mercedes, as well as Ferrari.</p><p>In particular, when you need to transport these planes, just transporting these seven planes, for instance, Dubai, for sure, would cost us 1.5 million. So this is why we're trying now to look also for additional sponsors to help us in internationalizing, I would say, the jet team.</p><p>QUEST: Talk about the business. You, having very clear strategy which is you simplified the line, you have increased the range at the same time, and -- within the marketing. But at the moment, just stick with the watches. What is the strategy now?</p><p>KERN: Well, we use, I would say, in the recent past last 20 years, really to concentrate on an aviation, but writing historically was more than that. We are the number one manufacturer of pilots watches and we will remain the number one manufacturer of pilots watches in the world. But, we did also - - we covered also two more areas, sea and land with products of the '40s and '50s, which we've been relaunching over the last couple of weeks and months.</p><p>QUEST: You've been CEO for 18 months, give or take, and the average CEO's life is three years -- three to four years. Now, you came in, you did a massive transformation. Let's say that's now in place, but you should be seeing evidence of that. Are you?</p><p>KERN: We are. We are. We are very happy to see gross, double digit gross and -- in all regions, even in our established markets, which was very important for us, but of course, also in Asia where we invest substantially.</p><p>QUEST: And expanding, obviously, China, women's watches. I mean, you know, women don't necessarily want as large a time piece.</p><p>[15:55:07] Are you prepared to make concessions and go smaller, neater, more nimble?</p><p>KERN: Yes. Next year would be a big women's year. And we have many new products as the pilot. Breitling has been very strong in the '90s and the early 2000s with women watches, but with sports women's watches, not with elegant women's watches and this is (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>QUEST: So, finally, in the future, how would you say you're going to divide the company between elegance and sport?</p><p>KERN: The beauty is we can do both, really. We have credibility and the history in both segments. The women's market is essentially 60 percent of the global watch market, so more than man. So, there's a potential here. But I think, again, it would be -- I would say, very well balanced.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: And at this moment left the trade on \"Wall Street.\" S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are on pace for a record close. We will have the final numbers and the closing bell right after this. Don't go away.</p><p>ASHER: Well, we are in the last few moments of trading on \"Wall Street.\" Let's look at the Dow first. We're up only 50 points or so, partly because of low volumes contributing to the days up and down, sort of seesaw moves. Investors are digesting mixed media report in the United States. Growth fell, but it was still better than expected.</p><p>Comments from the President, his top economic adviser cause a little bit of a dip earlier in the day. You see the slivers of red there. Larry Kudlow says we shouldn't expect a grand deal with China next week.</p><p>And let's take a look at the broader markets before we're going to leave you, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are, as I speak, at record highs with just one minute left in the trading day. Both are up around 2 percent for the week. Those gains are partly thanks to Google's parent company Alphabet and Twitter showing strong second quarter earnings.</p><p>European stocks also finished the week higher. U.K. and Swiss stocks were the best gainers. Market there still riding harder after the ECB hinted that more monetary stimulus is on the way, Thursday.</p><p>OK. That is \"Quest Means Business.\" I'm Zain Asher coming to you live from New York. The closing bell is ringing as I speak on \"Wall Street\" and \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" starts right now.</p><p>[16:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The four years that they were not were 1932, 1940, 2000, and 2008. Interestingly, all of those years had major events including the Great Depression, Second World War, the bursting of the tech bubble and the great financial crisis. Given the ongoing pandemic, one has to wonder if the same situation will play out this election year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In regard to the candidates, not only is Democratic candidate Joe Biden leading in the polls but if history is any precedent, current President Donald Trump could be in trouble: only one president, William McKinley, has won a re-election when a recession has occurred during the last two years of their first term. That said, we wouldn't discount the Trump wildcard factor, which left the majority of the pollsters embarrassed four years ago.</p><p>When it comes to the impact on U.S. markets, we think a Biden win and Senate sweep would be viewed as a near-term net negative, especially given his plans to hike corporate tax rates from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, and individual tax rates to 39.6 per cent from 37 per cent and treating capital gains and dividends as ordinary income.</p><p>That said, more fiscal spending directed to those in the low-and middle income brackets could help drive consumer spending and ultimately help drive inflation that has been missing from the economy for the past decade. The big question is will it be enough to offset the tax hikes, especially if implemented during such a fragile economic period.</p><p>The big tech stocks could also be in the sights of a Biden government when it comes to anti-trust legislation and enforcement, which is pretty important to market participants considering these stocks currently encompass 27.5 per cent of the S&amp;;P 500.</p><p>Then there are the remains of the U.S. energy sector, which would face much greater environmental regulation (and that includes pipelines). Energy, however, now only represents 2.8 per cent of the S&amp;;P 500.</p><p>On the flip side, any added regulations could help push the over-supplied sector closer to balance - a flight of capital away from U.S. shale could be big plus for other jurisdictions. This could be an opportunity for Canada to diversify globally, with the Keystone pipeline likely facing more hurdles under a Biden administration.</p><p>Looking out longer term, we believe that Biden and the Democrats would offer more stability when it comes to global trade and immigration. This would be great news for investors positioned in countries and regions that are large trade partners with the U.S., including Canada, Mexico and EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East). Perhaps this helps explains why the euro has recently rallied against the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Should Trump win, continued low taxes and market-friendly policies in the midst of a recession would be a positive for stocks. That said, we do worry about his wildcard factor and the potential for more unexpected surprises that could disrupt U.S. markets, such as the mishandling of the ongoing pandemic. Also, if Main Street's economic position doesn't improve and the inequality gap continues to widen, there could be further instability.</p><p>Finally, the Trump government's anti-trade positioning isn't good for international economies and we believe could lead to more of the same tech-heavy oligopolistic growth among the FANG stocks and other tech giants.</p><p>For Canadian investors, we think the safer bet is to trim back one's U.S. weightings ahead of the election, which probably should be done anyway given that region's outperformance this year, and rebalance abroad into EAFE and emerging markets.</p><p>Before deciding whether to reallocate some of this back into the Canadian market, we are facing the potential for our own election this fall and therefore recommend undertaking the same kind of analysis as to potential outcomes and impacts here. This would be especially prudent if this week's Throne Speech does indeed contain spending measures of the scale that has been rumoured in recent days. Those could create an entirely different set of risky scenarios that Canadian investors will have to deal with.</p><p>Martin Pelletier, CFA, is a portfolio manager at Wellington-Altus Private Counsel Inc.

The four years that they were not were 1932, 1940, 2000, and 2008. Interestingly, all of those years had major events including the Great Depression, Second World War, the bursting of the tech bubble and the great financial crisis. Given the ongoing pandemic, one has to wonder if the same situation will play out this election year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In regard to the candidates, not only is Democratic candidate Joe Biden leading in the polls but if history is any precedent, current President Donald Trump could be in trouble: only one president, William McKinley, has won a re-election when a recession has occurred during the last two years of their first term. That said, we wouldn't discount the Trump wildcard factor, which left the majority of the pollsters embarrassed four years ago.</p><p>When it comes to the impact on U.S. markets, we think a Biden win and Senate sweep would be viewed as a near-term net negative, especially given his plans to hike corporate tax rates from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, and individual tax rates to 39.6 per cent from 37 per cent and treating capital gains and dividends as ordinary income.</p><p>That said, more fiscal spending directed to those in the low-and middle income brackets could help drive consumer spending and ultimately help drive inflation that has been missing from the economy for the past decade. The big question is will it be enough to offset the tax hikes, especially if implemented during such a fragile economic period.</p><p>The big tech stocks could also be in the sights of a Biden government when it comes to anti-trust legislation and enforcement, which is pretty important to market participants considering these stocks currently encompass 27.5 per cent of the S&amp;;P 500.</p><p>Then there are the remains of the U.S. energy sector, which would face much greater environmental regulation (and that includes pipelines). Energy, however, now only represents 2.8 per cent of the S&amp;;P 500.</p><p>On the flip side, any added regulations could help push the over-supplied sector closer to balance - a flight of capital away from U.S. shale could be big plus for other jurisdictions. This could be an opportunity for Canada to diversify globally, with the Keystone pipeline likely facing more hurdles under a Biden administration.</p><p>Looking out longer term, we believe that Biden and the Democrats would offer more stability when it comes to global trade and immigration. This would be great news for investors positioned in countries and regions that are large trade partners with the U.S., including Canada, Mexico and EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East). Perhaps this helps explains why the euro has recently rallied against the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Should Trump win, continued low taxes and market-friendly policies in the midst of a recession would be a positive for stocks. That said, we do worry about his wildcard factor and the potential for more unexpected surprises that could disrupt U.S. markets, such as the mishandling of the ongoing pandemic. Also, if Main Street's economic position doesn't improve and the inequality gap continues to widen, there could be further instability.</p><p>Finally, the Trump government's anti-trade positioning isn't good for international economies and we believe could lead to more of the same tech-heavy oligopolistic growth among the FANG stocks and other tech giants.</p><p>For Canadian investors, we think the safer bet is to trim back one's U.S. weightings ahead of the election, which probably should be done anyway given that region's outperformance this year, and rebalance abroad into EAFE and emerging markets.</p><p>Before deciding whether to reallocate some of this back into the Canadian market, we are facing the potential for our own election this fall and therefore recommend undertaking the same kind of analysis as to potential outcomes and impacts here. This would be especially prudent if this week's Throne Speech does indeed contain spending measures of the scale that has been rumoured in recent days. Those could create an entirely different set of risky scenarios that Canadian investors will have to deal with.</p><p>Financial Post Martin Pelletier, CFA, is a portfolio manager at Wellington-Altus Private Counsel Inc.

The four years that they were not were 1932, 1940, 2000, and 2008. Interestingly, all of those years had major events including the Great Depression, the Second World War, the bursting of the tech bubble and the great financial crisis. Given the ongoing pandemic, one has to wonder if the same situation will play out this election year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In regards to the candidates, not only is Democratic candidate Joe Biden leading in the polls but if history is any precedent, current U.S. President Donald Trump could be in trouble: Only one president, William McKinley, has won a re-election when a recession has occurred during the last two years of their first term. That said, we wouldn't discount the Trump wild-card factor, which left the majority of the pollsters embarrassed four years ago.</p><p>When it comes to the impact on U.S. markets, we think a Biden win and Senate sweep would be viewed as a near-term net negative, especially given his plans to hike corporate tax rates from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, and individual tax rates to 39.6 per cent from 37 per cent and treating capital gains and dividends as ordinary income. That said, more fiscal spending directed to those in the low and middle income brackets could help drive consumer spending and ultimately help drive inflation that has been missing from the economy for the past decade. The big question is will it be enough to offset the tax hikes, especially if implemented during such a fragile economic period.</p><p>The big tech stocks could also be in the sights of a Biden government when it comes to antitrust legislation and enforcement, which is pretty important to market participants considering these stocks currently encompass 27.5 per cent of the S&amp;;P 500.</p><p>Then there are the remains of the U.S. energy sector, which would face much greater environmental regulation. Energy, however, now only represents 2.8 per cent of the S&amp;;P 500.</p><p>On the flip side, any added regulations could help push the oversupplied sector closer to balance - a flight of capital away from U.S. shale could be a big plus for other jurisdictions. This could be an opportunity for Canada to diversify globally, with the Keystone pipeline likely facing more hurdles under a Biden administration.</p><p>Looking out longer-term, we believe that Biden and the Democrats would offer more stability when it comes to global trade and immigration. This would be great news for investors positioned in countries and regions that are large trade partners with the U.S., including Canada, Mexico and EAFE (Europe, Australasia and the Far East). Perhaps this helps explains why the Euro has recently rallied against the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Should Trump win, continued low taxes and market friendly policies in the midst of a recession would be a positive for stocks. That said, we do worry about his wild-card factor and the potential for more unexpected surprises that could disrupt U.S. markets, such as the mishandling of the ongoing pandemic. Also, if Main Street's economic position doesn't improve and the inequality gap continues to widen, there could be further instability.</p><p>Finally, the Trump government's anti-trade positioning isn't good for international economies and we believe could lead to more of the same tech-heavy oligopolistic growth among the FANG stocks and other tech giants.</p><p>For Canadian investors, we think the safer bet is to trim back one's U.S. weightings ahead of the election, which probably should be done anyway given that region's outperformance this year, and rebalance abroad into EAFE and emerging markets.</p><p>Before deciding whether to reallocate some of this back into the Canadian market, we are facing the potential for our own election this fall and therefore recommend undertaking the same kind of analysis as to potential outcomes and impacts here. This would be especially prudent if this week's Throne Speech does indeed contain spending measures of the scale that has been rumoured in recent days. Those could create an entirely different set of risky scenarios that Canadian investors will have to deal with.

He has sought to radically change US foreign policy in line with his views over the objections of most of his national security team and the institutions of the state, including the Pentagon, the State Department, the intelligence community, the Congress, and the American public, which polls show has become even more supportive of alliances, free trade, and democracy during his term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President and internationalists within his administration and Congress have fought to a stalemate so far. On one hand, US alliances remain intact, US forces remain forward-positioned, and the official foreign policy doctrine of the US is oriented around great power competition.</p><p>On the other hand, the President has removed many of the constraints on his freedom of action, he is extremely critical of allies, and the US has abandoned any pretence to leadership in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, which is one of the greatest international crises of the past 50 years.</p><p>Several former senior officials in the Trump administration believe that he could strike a devastating blow against internationalists in a second term, effectively dissolving US alliances and bringing the post-Second World War order to a formal end.</p><p>This is what makes the election of 2020 even more important than 2016. It is the point of no return. The immune system of the postwar US national security state has been dramatically weakened. If the American people confirm their support for an America First president by giving Trump a second term, this system will break and be replaced by something else.</p><p>Moreover, the international order is especially fragile, reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic recession, along with continued uncertainty about America's role in the world. If Trump is re-elected, the rest of the world will conclude that the US has fundamentally changed and the period of post-Second World War leadership is at an end.</p><p>If Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden becomes president, the postwar US order will be granted a last-minute reprieve. Biden is an enthusiastic advocate of US alliances and American leadership.</p><p>Will Biden continue down the path of great power competition with China and Russia? Will Biden take advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to introduce major reforms to the international order, and what will the content of those reforms be?</p><p>Most important of all, can Biden set the stage for a renewal of American leadership, or will history remember his administration as a brief and futile last gasp of the foreign policy establishment that was preceded and succeeded by a more durable nationalist alternative?</p><p>The choice between Donald Trump and Biden is so stark and consequential that the two outcomes are unlikely to bear any resemblance to each other.</p><p>The best guide to Trump's foreign policy is to understand his psychology and disposition, not to study his administration's formal policy documents and actions.</p><p>In his first term, Trump systematically removed the constraints on his freedom of action and installed ultra-loyalists who would indulge his whims and preferences. This will continue and accelerate in a second term because he would view an electoral victory as an utter vindication of his approach.</p><p>He will likely pursue his instincts on alliances, trade, autocrats, and the grandeur of his own role with vigour and few constraints. This could result in dramatic departures from America's traditional postwar policy, including the effective dissolution of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and other alliances.</p><p>The question with Biden is not how he is different from Trump. It is whether he will be different from President Barack Obama. A series of substantive debates between centrists in the Democratic Party continues an earlier debate inside the Obama administration. The intra-centrist debate has two schools - a restorationist group who holds the world view of Obama, and a reform group that questions some of the basic assumptions of that administration, on China, globalisation, the Middle East, and the long-term future of the liberal international order.</p><p>The first half of a Biden term is likely to be defined by a struggle between these two world views. The coronavirus crisis will cast a shadow over all of this and raise fundamental questions about the future of the global economy, co-operation with China, and the future of international institutions.</p><p>If there is a unifying theme among these findings, it is that US foreign policy is in a crisis that is coming to a boiling point. The question is whether those who believe in the tradition of American leadership since the Second World War receive a reprieve.</p><p>If they do not, will there be anything left by the end of Trump's second term? If they do, how will they handle the opportunity: by reverting to the way things were in 2016, or by doing something dramatically different?</p><p>Trump's visceral beliefs about the world date back to the mid-1980s. He is sceptical of America's alliances, feels that free trade is bad for the US and has a fondness for authoritarian strongmen. However, when he unexpectedly won the presidency in 2016, he had a problem. He had paid no attention to how to convert these visceral beliefs into policy and there were very few foreign policy experts who believed what he believed, certainly none who were confirmable by the Senate.</p><p>So he turned to former generals and business leaders, men such as Jim Mattis, John Kelly, H R McMaster (after a brief and catastrophic couple of weeks with Michael Flynn), Rex Tillerson, and Gary Cohn.</p><p>Axis of Adults</p><p>But the \"axis of adults\", as they were quickly labelled, were traditionalists. For the most part, they believed in alliances, democracy, and free trade. They saw their role as placing a check on the President, not satisfying his whims and desires. They sought to constrain his choices and box him in to a \"normal\" foreign policy. When he rebelled - for instance, when he refused to endorse Article 5 in a speech at the new NATO headquarters - they prevailed on him to reverse course.</p><p>Trump was never going to accept a second fiddle role in his own administration and he grew resentful at being managed. As John Bolton notes in his book The Room Where It Happened, the adults were \"so transparently self-serving and so publicly dismissive of many of Trump's very clear goals (whether worthy or unworthy) that they fed Trump's already-suspicious mindset\".</p><p>Trump began to realise that as President he could do things even if his team disagreed. In early 2018, Trump forced out the axis of adults, replacing Tillerson, Cohn, and McMaster with individuals who placed loyalty to the President over their own independent judgment - Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and Larry Kudlow. This ushered in the second phase of Trump's presidency - the age of action.</p><p>Trump now acted more freely, pursuing his instincts even when they conflicted with the advice of his officials.</p><p>The age of action</p><p>He announced talks with Kim Jong-un without consulting his cabinet. He moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. He tweeted his response to Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons before talking with his national security team. He imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium. He held a summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and publicly accepted the Russian President's word on election interference over the unanimous consent of the US intelligence community. He started a trade war with China.</p><p>Bolton effectively abolished the inter-agency process through which the Departments of Defence and State and other entities have formal seats at the table where decisions are made. The removal of constraints was complete when Mattis resigned in December 2018 following Trump's promise to withdraw troops from Syria.</p><p>The age of reckoning finally arrived on 21 June, 2019, when Trump ordered air strikes on Iran in retaliation for their drone attack on a Saudi airfield, and then changed his mind. Trump wanted to shred the Iran nuclear deal and impose maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. He also wanted to avoid embroiling America in a new conflict in the Middle East. For more than a year, he pretended as if these two goals were not in conflict. When push came to shove, he decided he did not want a new war in the Middle East.</p><p>The same dynamic played out with China. The administration was pursuing a tough and competitive strategy towards Beijing, but Trump was primarily motivated by trade and economics. He never bought into the idea of a full spectrum great power competition - the centrepiece of his National Security Strategy and National Defence Strategy. He did not care about regional equilibriums or human rights (according to Bolton, he twice told Xi Jinping he supported the building of concentration camps in Xinjiang). He focused his ire on China's economy. All along he hoped for a deal that would provide an economic benefit that he could sell politically as a major win.</p><p>Trump has always had a dual narrative about his own prowess - where he is both the militarist and the dealmaker. With the election in sight, Trump chose to be a dealmaker so he could prevent his political opponents from describing him as a warmonger during the election campaign. He sought talks with the Iranian leadership in September 2019. He tried to invite the Taliban to Camp David around the time of the 9/11 anniversary. He negotiated a trade deal with China. As an obstacle to this agenda, Bolton was forced out.</p><p>Trump's personality and cognitive traits seem particularly ill-suited to a major crisis. In 2020, the long-awaited crisis finally arrived and it was a whopper - a once in a century pandemic with an economic collapse to rival the Great Depression.</p><p>This catastrophe could have been a political opportunity for another president. He could have set politics aside, told the public he would focus solely on defeating the virus, level with the American people about the severity of the challenge they faced, and present himself as a can-do businessman who would reach across the aisle.</p><p>There is no mystery as to why he did not take that path. It is simply not who he is. In the early weeks, as the coronavirus spread through Wuhan, Trump prioritised the trade deal he had negotiated with China. He dismissed the warnings from his national security and intelligence teams. He praised Xi and expressed the hope the virus would disappear, even though he privately knew it was a major and imminent threat to the US.</p><p>When COVID-19 became impossible to ignore, he reached for an eye-catching policy consistent with the Trump brand - the travel ban on China and subsequently on Europe - and declared victory. This took place on 31 January. He did almost nothing else on the coronavirus in February.</p><p>As cases and fatalities rose, Trump oscillated back and forth between bashing China and declaring the crisis over. He showed no interest in convening the international community or co-ordinating a national response. He liked to highlight and exaggerate the failures and tribulations of other countries to portray his own failures in a better light. He actively spread disinformation about the virus and the means of treating it. With no rallies and very limited travel or capacity to host visitors, he grew more isolated and volatile on social media.</p><p>This was the first major international emergency since the Second World War in which the US played no leadership role. The Trump administration could have convened world leaders to co-ordinate travel and economic restrictions, share information, and work on a vaccine.</p><p>Trump administration officials actively undermined the efforts of other nations who tried to fill the vacuum. When France tried to mobilise the G7 and the United Nations Security Council, the Trump administration insisted that these forums formally blame China as a precondition for action - something that doomed the effort before it began.</p><p>Even more disturbing was the Trump administration's attitude towards the World Health Organisation. In January, when Trump was praising China, the WHO was privately alarmed. Internal documents show that senior officials were concerned that China was covering up the virus but that they could not say so publicly in case it reduced China's co-operation even further.</p><p>Unilateralism</p><p>The US had an opportunity to work with the WHO and the international community to build a coalition to press Beijing for greater transparency and co-operation. Trump temporarily withheld funding from the WHO and set a 30-day deadline for talks with its leadership on reform.</p><p>Just eight days into the 30-day period, and unbeknown to his own officials, Trump announced he was withdrawing formally, dismaying America's allies and empowering Beijing.</p><p>Trump's first term followed a narrative arc of a president shedding constraints, becoming more comfortable wielding power, doing so in line with his own instincts and political interests, and persisting with this even as he encountered trouble and the catastrophic crisis the country is now engulfed in.</p><p>A re-elected Trump will feel fully vindicated. He and his team will be more prepared, both bureaucratically and psychologically, than they were in 2017. They will be willing to push the envelope further.</p><p>In a second term, he could well try to unravel some of America's alliances. He could unilaterally reinterpret Article 5 to effectively destroy NATO (for instance by saying he will not use force to defend any country that does not pay the US directly for providing security). He could withdraw troops from South Korea. While Trump got on well with Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, he could try the same tactic on new leader Yoshihide Suga.</p><p>Second, Trump will choose a team that enables him to behave in this way. Trump has made it clear he values loyalty above all else. In a second term, Trump has three pools of people from which to draw. The first are senior Republican politicians who have been steadfastly loyal to him, such as Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Josh Hawley, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and, of course, Mike Pompeo.</p><p>The second are ultra-loyalists who have no real power base of their own and owe their influence entirely to the President personally. This pool includes people such as former ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell and retired US Army officers Anthony Tata, and Douglas Macgregor, who came to Trump's attention through their commentary on cable news. It also potentially includes family members, particularly Jared Kushner, Ivanka, and Donald Jr.</p><p>The third group are younger officials who will have gained experience in the first term. The end result will likely be a mix, but the ultra-loyalists are poised to be the most influential.</p><p>That part of the Republican foreign policy establishment that is still on good terms with Trump will try to make the containment of China the centrepiece of Trump's second term, but it is not clear if the President is fully bought into it.</p><p>The problem they have is that Trump is mainly driven by concern about China's economic role. He has no issue with the Chinese Communist Party's domestic authoritarianism, and very limited interest in the geopolitical interests of US allies, including Taiwan.</p><p>A second Trump term will most likely mark the formal end of the post-Second World War and post-Cold War international order. We may see bilateral initiatives, but the era of structured and sustained co-operation will be over. This will most immediately be felt in the COVID-19 crisis - vaccine nationalism will prevail and there will be little effort to prevent the economic recovery from tilting in a protectionist direction.</p><p>In many ways, Joe Biden is a known quantity when it comes to foreign policy. He believes in American leadership, the liberal international order, democracy, alliances, treaties, and climate change. He has built a tent large enough for Republican Never-Trumpers, Democratic centrists (of whom he is one), and progressives.</p><p>Climate change</p><p>He will seek to undo much of what Trump has wrought - he will quickly rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, he will try to revive the Iran nuclear deal, he will work with other nations on combatting COVID-19, and he will resume US support for its allies.</p><p>Will his presidency differ in significant ways from that of Barack Obama? There have been hints. Biden has called Saudi Arabia a \"pariah state\". Does that portend a significant change in America's posture in the Middle East? He has taken a tough line on China. So, will he buy into the concept of great power competition? He has argued that globalisation must serve the middle class. Will he be more open to progressive reforms to the global economy?</p><p>Biden knows his connection to Obama is an asset, and no political benefit exists in distancing himself from the former president. In some ways, Obama's scepticism of American activism stemmed from his optimism about American power. He believed that if the US got its own house in order and acted responsibly on the world stage, China, Russia, and other potential challengers would not be able to compete.</p><p>One group of Democrats have not fundamentally changed their world view since the Obama administration. They want to protect American democracy against foreign interference, they are more wary of Russia, and, of course, they recognise COVID-19 as one of the most severe crises to hit the US and the international order over the past 50 years.</p><p>But they also continue to believe that the arc of history favours the US, they are sceptical of military interventionism, they do not want US foreign policy to be defined or constrained by geopolitical competition, even though they accept the US must stand up for its interests against China, and they continue to believe in the benefits of globalisation. This group can be described as restorationist.</p><p>No issue has been more controversial or widely discussed than how the US should approach China.</p><p>In 2018, Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs during the Obama administration, and Ely Ratner, Biden's deputy national security adviser in Obama's second term, published an influential article in Foreign Affairs arguing that some of the key assumptions underpinning China policy in successive administrations - for instance, that commercial engagement with China would lead to economic liberalisation, and that China would become a responsible stakeholder in the international order - were wrong. A year later, Campbell co-authored another article on how the US could take a more competitive approach to China while avoiding confrontation.</p><p>Reformers generally believe that under Xi, China has become more of a dictatorship than an autocratic system where power is shared or at least somewhat limited by a politburo. They also consider that China is becoming more repressive, as demonstrated by the deployment of facial recognition technologies and social credit systems, the widespread use of concentration camps in Xinjiang, and the destruction of Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems\" model.</p><p>Biden reformers</p><p>The reformers want the US to adopt a much more competitive strategy than the Obama administration did, but they are preoccupied with the question of how to blend competition and diplomacy so rivalry does not turn into confrontation and conflict, and so some cooperation on shared interests remains possible.</p><p>The reformers worry that the US is falling behind technologically and economically, and they believe major changes to US policy are required to get back into the lead. They want to see competition with China at the heart of America's alliances, including the trans-Atlantic alliance, and they are generally willing to use the China challenge to advocate for domestic policy changes.</p><p>They are open to the possibility of a limited decoupling between the US and China, particularly on technology and supply chains for critical health supplies and other strategically important parts of the economy.</p><p>By contrast, the restorationists tend to be less willing to accept that Xi has transformed China into a different type of regime that is inherently unreasonable and dictatorial. They are less pessimistic about the changes in the distribution of power and oppose using the China threat to mobilise the political system behind domestic changes.</p><p>The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism as a fault-line in world politics, a view they share with the progressives. They want the US to make democratic co-operation an organising principle of its foreign policy, partly as a means of competing with China, and partly because they believe that democracy itself is at grave risk. They want to work with other free societies to promote liberal norms and to compete with China and Russia in international institutions.</p><p>Restorationists, on the other hand, worry about creating an ideological fault-line in world politics that exacerbates competition with China. They see co-operation among democracies as just one piece of a larger diplomatic strategy.</p><p>In an article in early 2020, Jake Sullivan, Biden's former national security adviser, and Jennifer Harris, a former Obama-administration official, argue for reforming trade deals to target tax havens, prevent currency manipulation, improve wages, and generate investment in the US. Industrial policy should be used to compete with China, particularly in new technologies, and foreign policy should be a part of the antitrust debate on breaking up big tech.</p><p>The Sullivan-Harris agenda is generally aligned with thinking on the progressive side of the Democratic Party. Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy from within as well as from without. To counter it, the US must root out corruption and reform the global economy, including eliminating tax havens, regulating global finance, and tackling inequality.</p><p>Reformers are also willing to use the China challenge, which they believe is real and daunting, to mobilise support for an ambitious economic agenda domestically and internationally.</p><p>Biden restorationists</p><p>The restorationists tend to favour re-engaging in free trade deals, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. However, they are reluctant to use responding to China as an organising principle for the policy.</p><p>A Biden administration could take a series of rapid and far-reaching actions early in the term, particularly on climate change, tackling COVID-19, immigration, and multilateralism.</p><p>The coronavirus seems to have persuaded the Biden team that their presidency will require a transformative foreign policy in several respects - fighting the virus globally, including developing and fairly distributing a vaccine, reforming and rebuilding international institutions, and rebuilding the national and international economy. </p><p>If Trump wins a second term, the rest of the world will conclude that the US has fundamentally changed and is no longer committed to the traditional leadership role it has played since the Second World War.</p><p>In Asia, the big question will be whether Trump sticks to his tough China policy or tries to resurrect his trade deal with Xi while also pulling back from America's alliances with South Korea and Japan.</p><p>America's allies are concerned that Trump's brand of containment will preclude any possibility of co-operation with China on shared challenges and that decoupling is impractical and costly for countries that rely on China economically.</p><p>Trump's re-election would initially be broadly welcomed in Israel and the Arab world, where leaders accept his maximum pressure campaign on Iran, his indifference towards democracy and human rights, and his transactional nature. However, Trump has made it clear that he hopes to strike a deal with Iran on its nuclear program and that he has little commitment to supporting the regional order.</p><p>The impact of a Trump victory would be particularly acute in Europe. Trump's re-election would be interpreted by many Europeans as the end of the trans-Atlantic relationship and would serve as a wake-up call for European sovereignty and strategic autonomy, moves which are already slowly underway.</p><p>Australia has handled Trump better than any other liberal democracy, albeit after a rocky start with the terse phone call between then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Trump. As a conservative, Scott Morrison worked well with Trump administration officials and Australia was an early mover on pushing back against Chinese political interference and in placing restrictions on Huawei.</p><p>However, the uncertainty around Trump's commitment to maintaining the regional order in the Asia Pacific region is a concern for Canberra about a second term. The Australian government is likely to favour Biden taking a tougher approach to China than in the Obama administration.</p><p>A Biden victory would be widely, albeit not universally, greeted with relief and enthusiasm internationally as America's democratic allies will see the US as returning to its traditional role.</p><p>However, they would also assess that Trumpism could make a return in the 2024 election unless the President is defeated by an overwhelming majority.</p><p>The challenge for a President Biden will be whether he can make good use of these four years to firmly place American leadership on a more sustainable footing. Otherwise, his victory may just be a stay of execution for the postwar order.</p><p>This is an edited extract from a Lowy Institute Analysis paper, The Point of No Return: The 2020 Election and the Crisis of American Foreign Policy by Thomas Wright, a nonresident fellow at the Lowy Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520333207</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610C-C5S1-DY19-C04D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4398\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We will soon get the read on the Fed's tea leaves to find out if cuts are coming. And facing backlash, skeptical lawmakers voice concerns over Facebook's new crypto plan. And Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman tells our John Defterios that he doesn't think the trade wars will pull the U.S. into a recession. It is Wednesday, and this is FIRST MOVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All right, everyone. I am Zain Asher. Welcome to FIRST MOVE. The main event for Wall Street is just hours away. The US Federal Reserve releases its latest policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell holds a news conference at about 2:00 to 230 Eastern Time. Many investors hope the Central Bank will pivot on policy and announce that it could soon introduce interest rate cuts as markets brace for the Fed, it is looking like a mostly flat start to the trading day.</p><p>U.S. stocks soared Tuesday on stimulus hopes not only in the United States, but in the Eurozone as well where ECB head, Mario Draghi said he is ready to do more to boost growth. News that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will discuss trade at the G-20 Summit next week, also gave the market a bit of a boost as well.</p><p>But as we begin today's session, the S&amp;P 500 sits less than one percent away from record highs. Global stocks are at near two-week highs, whether the rally can continue, it certainly has a lot to do with what the Fed end up deciding.</p><p>One person who will be following today's developments especially closely will be none other than President Trump, who has reportedly considered demoting Chairman Powell for keeping rate levels that he believes aren't too high.</p><p>Clare Sebastian is joining us live now. So Clare, a lot of people are expected that we won't see a rate cut until July. What can we expect today?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Zain, the probability if you look at the markets is less than 25 percent for today, but that rises in July to about 65 percent, and by September, according to the CME groups Fed Watch, there's only a six percent probability that rates stay where they are today.</p><p>So certainly over the coming months, the expectations are pretty much unanimous that this will come. But as for today, the challenge for the Fed is how they communicate what's coming.</p><p>There's a lot of expectation on Wall Street that they will change the language in the statement that they will take away the word \"patient\" that they've had in there since the beginning of the year, since they've had rates on hold.</p><p>So they really need to try and deliver in a way what the markets are looking for. We've seen what happens when they don't do that. In the December, when the Fed came out slightly more hawkish than the markets were expecting, the markets fell sharply.</p><p>So all eyes will be on that statement. All eyes will be on the press conference from Jerome Powell today, and he has a very delicate balancing act when it comes to communicating this.</p><p>ASHER: And another thing that is sort of pushing -- putting pressure rather or seeming to put pressure on Jerome Powell is of course, the way that Donald Trump seems to address him. I want to play for our audience what the U.S. President had to say about Jerome Powell.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, let's see what he does. I want to be given a level playing field. And so far, I haven't been.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Trump also intimated about potentially demoting Jerome Powell. He said, \"Let's see what he does.\" How unprecedented is that for the U.S. President?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I mean, this is very unusual, Zain. The whole job of the Fed is to stay independent, and in a way to provide a counterpoint if the government's economic policy needs to access the economy or the opposite.</p><p>So this is extremely unusual, and the interesting thing is, as market expectations have risen of a rate cut, as it's looked increasingly like Trump might get actually what he wants, his pressure has only increased.</p><p>So the Fed now has to grapple with not only, you know, a mixed picture when it comes to the economy, not only the challenge of the market expectations, not only an unpredictable trade war that is also in the hands of the President, but the challenge of not appearing to bow to political pressure that is a huge communication challenge and it further complicates this picture.</p><p>ASHER: So aside from the trade war, what are the factors go into the Fed Chair's decision making when it comes to potentially a rate cut in July?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So their mandate, Zain, is twofold. It is price stability and full employment. So, you know, price stability, when it comes to inflation has been a bit of a complicated picture. Inflation has been persistently under shooting, it's never quite managed to consistently reach the two percent target that the Fed has been looking.</p><p>For unemployment, the jobs market had been extremely strong up until this month, and we got the May jobs report. It came in well below expectations. It also had downward revisions to the previous month.</p><p>[09:05:13] SEBASTIAN: So there are signs, not so much of a slowdown, but of an economy that may be losing momentum. We've also got data points that the Fed will be looking at when it comes to manufacturing consumer sentiment. They have also been showing signs of losing momentum.</p><p>So there are certainly data points out there that are increasing in number that could lead them to shift that stands to something more flexible. But overall, this isn't an economy that's on the brink of recession. So they have to signal that while also saying that they're going to stay flexible, and that's why this is such a delicate moment for them.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Clare Sebastian live for us. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Probable end to the China-U.S. trade war is lifting investor spirits pushing Asian shares higher. U.S. President Donald Trump said talks between the two countries will be resuming today. Will Ripley is joining us live now from Beijing.</p><p>Well, Will, we're also hearing that the U.S. President and Xi Jinping are going to be meeting on the sidelines of G-20 next week. Could this clear the path to a deal in terms of a trade deal between the U.S. and China?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Zain, I think at this stage, the best hopes of many analysts who are watching the situation and certainly investors here in Asia and around the world is that the two leaders will agree to put a pause on the additional tariffs that are currently being discussed right now in the United States, tariffs on $300 billion in additional Chinese goods. That is what China wants to avert.</p><p>And I would imagine the United States would like to avert it if they can get closer to what they want in terms of some of the key issues when it comes to U.S.-China trade.</p><p>Of course, one major issue of contention that seems like it's going to be very difficult to resolve, certainly in the informal discussions in the G- 20 in Japan between presidents Trump and Xi is the treatment of Chinese telecom giant, Huawei. That is a major, major issue of contention between the two countries.</p><p>But there is hope that because Trump and Xi have a good personal rapport, that they can perhaps secure some sort of an agreement much like they did in Argentina, when they last had that dinner meeting. Of course, that dinner meeting was held in the same day that one of Huawei's top executives was arrested and taken into custody in Canada and has since been extradited or is in the process of extradition and facing charges in the United States.</p><p>ASHER: And so just in terms of -- I mean, obviously, Huawei is a key issue, as you mentioned, but just in terms of the trade war so far. How much of an impact on the Chinese economy has this ratcheting up of tariffs had on Beijing, especially given the slowing economy there?</p><p>RIPLEY: Well, China's economy is expected to grow once again this year, but the growth is undoubtedly slowing. And it puts President Xi in a difficult spot because he has amassed so much power in this country, only to see the economy slowing and the trade war with the United States escalating.</p><p>Those are two fronts that have been very problematic for the Chinese President, which may be one factor as to why he is also going to be traveling to Pyongyang, North Korea tomorrow morning local time to have discussions or perhaps sign some sort of an agreement with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un just before he goes to meet with President Trump in Japan.</p><p>Obviously North Korea is one of President Trump's signature policy issues. And so if President Xi can come to Japan with some insight on that front, well, it certainly is a valuable card to play potentially for Xi as he also tries to talk with Trump about trade.</p><p>ASHER: And so what have been so far, Will, the major sticking points that have thwarted the U.S. and China from reaching a deal and obviously, even if a deal is reached, the issue then becomes how the U.S. ends up enforcing it. Just walk us through what the major sticking points have been.</p><p>RIPLEY: First of all, there is a major trade imbalance and President Trump has talked for a long time about the fact that the United States is buying hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars more every year from China than the United States is selling to China.</p><p>President Trump wants China and Chinese consumers to consume more American goods. He also wants it to be easier for Chinese markets to open up to American companies, and the United States wants to do away with things like forced technology and information sharing.</p><p>There's been a long held claim that in order for foreign tech companies in particular to do business here in China's lucrative market, they have to partner up with Chinese entities, share their secrets, and then those Chinese entities can take that information that they've learned and produce their own versions at a much cheaper price.</p><p>Then, of course, the issue with Huawei, which is a big one is national security. And that is something that China is trying to fight with the United States about right now, because Huawei holds a lot of patents in the United States that can be enforced, unless the U.S. can prove that Huawei is violating U.S. national security.</p><p>Obviously Huawei is a pillar of the Chinese economy and they're going to fight very hard to protect the business dealings of that company, which has essentially been blacklisted by the U.S., making it impossible at the moment for U.S. companies and U.S. allies to do a whole lot of business with Huawei without facing serious repercussions.</p><p>[09:10:22] ASHER: Will Ripley live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. Facebook's bold plan to release its own crypto currency is already facing fierce global political backlash. Concerns of data privacy and security have led to a leading American lawmakers to call for the project to be put on hold.</p><p>And the G7 has been asked to hold its own investigation into the currency. Brian Fung joins us live now. So really, already, Brian we are seeing this massive sort of uphill battle for Facebook just in terms of trying to win over the trust from consumers, general public, and also lawmakers as well.</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: Yes, absolutely. I mean, we're seeing a very strong reaction now from members of Congress. You had the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters, saying that this is another example of Facebook's unchecked expansion.</p><p>You had Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, saying this is another example of how Facebook is too big and too powerful.</p><p>Obviously, all this comes as Facebook is facing a lot of scrutiny from regulators both in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission, and the Justice Department, you know, over its practices on privacy and the rest of the tech industry too, is seeing a lot of skepticism from regulators about whether or not they're too big and too powerful. You have lots of, you know, Democratic presidential candidates calling for the industry to be broken up.</p><p>So all in all, a very challenging environment that Facebook is seeking to inject itself into with a new product.</p><p>ASHER: So how has Facebook -- I mean, obviously, it is early days yet, but how has Facebook already responded to calls, for example, from Maxine Waters for Libra to be put on hold?</p><p>FUNG: That's right. So you know, Facebook has said it is willing to engage with lawmakers and will be open to answering questions about them in the future. But you know, as you pointed out, you know, Congresswoman Waters has called for the cryptocurrency to be placed on hold and not developed further, while some of these questions get sorted out.</p><p>You had both her and the top Republican on that committee asking for hearings into the issue, and Waters has also asked for Facebook to submit providing testimony with executives, even testifying to Capitol Hill on this issue.</p><p>Now, obviously, Facebook wants this cryptocurrency to become mainstream and to potentially become a part of the global financial infrastructure, bringing on billions, potentially to the global banking system, especially particularly in the developing world.</p><p>So this raises real serious questions about what kinds of data Facebook could collect with the results of this technology, what it might be used for, and all of those questions are still relatively unresolved at this point.</p><p>ASHER: Right, Brian Fung, appreciate it. Thank you. Okay, so these are the stories that are making headlines around the world right now. The first independent investigation into the death of Jamal Khashoggi has found the journalist was the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution. The UN Special Repertoire also said that the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman should be hit by targeted sanctions unless evidence can be provided clearing him on the actual involvement in this particular execution.</p><p>Four people will face prosecution over the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. The plane crashed in Eastern Ukraine five years ago, killing 298 people. Three Russians and a Ukrainian have been named as suspects by international investigators. One of the suspects says the separatists cities in Ukraine were not responsible for the downing of the plane.</p><p>Donald Trump makes it official, the U.S. President has launched his bid for reelection with a rally in Florida. Obviously, he used it to bash some familiar targets and talk up the economy as well, promising even greater prosperity if he is given a second term. We are going to listen to part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our economy is the envy of the world. Perhaps the greatest economy we've had in the history of our country.</p><p>As long as you keep this team in place, we have a tremendous way to go. Our future has never ever looked brighter or sharper.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Joe Johns is joining us live now down in Miami, so John, you heard the President speaking in his usual superlatives. Whether you love him or hate him, one thing you cannot deny, this the man who does come on rock star adulation.</p><p>[09:15:10] JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: He certainly does. And that's what he got. It's so different from when he first got into the race going down that escalator at Trump Tower in New York City.</p><p>There were quite a few people there, but certainly nothing like this. It was an enormous crowd in Orlando, and they really soaked up every moment of it.</p><p>Of course, Florida is very important for him. The President sees Florida as his second home. So it was right and fitting, I suppose that they go ahead and do the kickoff here.</p><p>The President has a new campaign slogan this time around, Keep America Great Again. And the fact of the matter, though, is as I think you can see from all the transcripts, as well as the sound bites that have come out of that Orlando appearance, the President really harked back to many of the themes that we've heard from the countless rallies he has actually held over the last years.</p><p>He talked about Robert Mueller. He talked about Hillary Clinton. He talked about fake news, immigration, border security -- these are all things we've heard before pretty clear that while the campaign was seeking a reset for the President of the United States the second time around, they are not at least at this stage, planning on changing things very much -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: And Joe, even though obviously, the President is adored by his base, the fact is, he does have relatively low approval ratings, and you could compare him to other recent Presidents, what are the major hurdles to him getting reelected, do you think?</p><p>JOHNS: Major hurdles, as always, really, for any presidential campaign is going to be the middle of politics, those are the swing voters and states like right here in Florida, people who don't necessarily vote Democratic, don't necessarily vote Republican, and are waiting for the incumbent as well as the challenger to give them something they can hold on to.</p><p>The President has clearly alienated a certain segment of the voting population. And we know that from the strength of the opposition to him on the Democratic side, particularly among Liberal Democrats. So he is also going to have to stand on his record. The last time around, this is a man who ran against the Washington establishment and draining the swamp.</p><p>Now, he is the leader of the Washington establishment, at least as far as Republican politics is concerned. So he is going to have to run on his record. And there's also that sticky issue of immigration, very important to mention that simply because immigration is something he ran on four years ago, and he had quite a voice, didn't he, on that issue?</p><p>And arguably, if you use almost any metric, the immigration problem in the United States has gotten much more challenging since this President took office. The question is, whether that's a reflection of some of his policies.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Joe Johns live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. Still to come here, breaking up maybe hard to do, but activist shareholders think it's for the best. We look ahead at Google's contentious annual meeting and getting into bed with the competition, Airbnb joins forces with a brand new or rather a hotel app. That's next, after the break.</p><p>[09:21:40] ASHER: All right, welcome back to FIRST MOVE. I am Zain Asher. We are live for you here at the New York Stock Exchange and it's just a few minutes to go before the opening bell on Wall Street, in about nine minutes or so from now. Futures -- let's see -- are pointing to a bit of a flat open, slightly higher, but relatively flat.</p><p>The markets are in a wait and see position because we've got the Fed's decision coming out in about five or so hours from now. U.S. Treasury yields sell sharply in the previous session and with expectations of a new global stimulus. They are stabilizing today, but the 10-year yield remains below 2.1 percent.</p><p>To discuss it all, we've got Greg Peters, Managing Director and Senior Portfolio Manager at PGIM Fixed Income. So let's talk about the Fed. We've got the Fed decision coming out in a few hours from now. Do you expect like most people that there will be a rate cut in July not necessarily this time around?</p><p>GREG PETERS, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PGIM FIXED INCOME: Well, there's more drama around the meeting than the initially anticipated. So Mario Draghi yesterday kind of pulled for the debate on what the Fed should do and called to arms.</p><p>That being said, I do think it's not a likely probability of a breakup today. July is definitely on the table. But I think it's really important to take a step back and think about where we were just at the end of last year where the market was pricing in two rate hikes.</p><p>And now the market is pricing in three rate cuts through this year. So that's a dramatic shift. And the Fed ultimately has to deliver on that or the market is going to be really disappointed.</p><p>ASHER: How much has anticipating will there be a rate cut in July already been priced into the markets?</p><p>PETERS: It's already priced in. That's the whole thing. So the Fed actually has to deliver what the market is expecting, or I think the markets will kind of react negatively around it.</p><p>ASHER: So when you think about, as you mentioned, what a dramatic shift, you know, compared to this time last year to now with rate hikes versus now rate cuts. What have been the factors, the key factors?</p><p>I mean, obviously trade is obviously probably the most important factor. But what about the other factors that have gone into the Feds decision making?</p><p>PETERS: Well, growth has come down, clearly, and so it's particularly come down on the manufacturing side. And globally as well. The consumer still remains pretty strong, the labor market is pretty strong, but it is manufacturing and then its inflation.</p><p>What the Fed is looking towards is the weak inflation data. And so inflation continues to run below their mandate under two percent. And so they feel they have ample room to stimulate in order to boost that inflation number higher.</p><p>So I think it's really around inflation more than the economic data itself. But it's a confluence of those two factors that is ultimately feeding into the Feds decision.</p><p>ASHER: So when we saw markets really rally yesterday, how much of that was about the potential of a deal in terms of trade deals with the U.S. and China. Obviously,, the Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are getting to be meeting at the sidelines of G-20. Markets seem very optimistic about that versus other factors, you know, including the potential for rate cut and that sort of thing.</p><p>PETERS: Yes, so I think the answer is both. And so the markets reacted strongly before the open around Draghi's comments, and then the Trump tweet around a meeting at the G-20 just accelerated that.</p><p>[09:25:07] PETERS: But prior to them, the markets were really quite negative around the prospect of anything coming out of the G-20. So the expectation was really quite low. So that's been raised now as well.</p><p>So once again, you have a situation where the markets are really expecting action out of the G-20 and out of the Fed. And so we're really kind of pushing the limits here, in terms of the ability to deliver both those items.</p><p>ASHER: Some analysts believe that, you know, because we've seen an inverted yield curve and in about 12 to 18 months from now that a recession could be on the horizon, do you share that view or no?</p><p>PETERS: Well, the risks are rising. I think it's always important to remember that forecasting a recession is literally impossible, and so we look for certain fragments and segments to kind of point to, but growth slowing and so it's something to watch out for, but no, it's not a base case for this year, but the risks start to arise you know, 12 to 18 months down the road as a lot of the fiscal stimulus here in the U.S. rolls off, which still are around trade -- what that means ultimately -- so it's really hard to figure it out because there's so many moving parts.</p><p>ASHER: So what are the consequences of this sort of low rate, low growth environment that we're in right now, low inflation environment that we are in right now?</p><p>PETERS: Look, I mean, I think this is the reality of the world that we live in. The demographics are working against us. You're not seeing the same kind of productivity boost that we have in the past. I think low rates, low growth, low inflation is the future quite frankly.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Greg Peters, live for us. Thank you so much. Appreciate that.</p><p>PETERS: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: All right, we have the opening bell for you in about four or so minutes from now. We will be back with that bell after the break.</p><p>[09:30:00] ASHER: All right. The Australian Treasury Department there ringing the opening bell on Wall Street. Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, everyone. I am Zain Asher coming to you live from here at the New York Stock Exchange. That was the opening bell.</p><p>As I mentioned, the markets, let's take a look now, are pretty much flat right now. Basically in a wait and see sort of holding pattern as we await the Fed's decision at 2:00 Eastern Time.</p><p>A lot of people are expecting there's not going to be necessarily an interest rate cut this time around, but in July, people are pointing to July as when we will be seeing that rate cut.</p><p>That Fed announcement as I mentioned is expected to come at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time. We did see a broad based rally in the previous session on hopes for global stimulus and progress in the U.S.-China trade talks as well.</p><p>President Trump and Xi Jinping have actually confirmed they will meet next week on the sidelines of the G20 Summit. Could that mean there could be a trade deal on the horizon? We shall wait and see.</p><p>In the meantime, major U.S. companies are bracing for what could be years of trade uncertainty. A report out today says Apple is looking into whether major suppliers can move as much as 30 percent of their Chinese manufacturing to other Asian countries.</p><p>All right, let's talk about the global movers now. Adobe is higher right now. The software company's second quarter earnings came in five cents a share above expectations and its revenues rose 25 percent. Guidance for the current quarter was soft, but JPMorgan Chase is raising its price target for the company.</p><p>Mattel, you can see there is slightly lower, down about almost one percent or so. The toy maker's shares are under pressure amid harsh words from MGA Entertainment. MGA had considered buying Mattel, but it says, it is walking away from the deal because of Matte's many balance sheet liabilities. MGA which makes the Bratz line of dolls says Mattel quote, \"cannot be salvaged.\"</p><p>Facebook there at the bottom of your screen is down about one and a quarter percent. Also shares under pressure after the company unveiled Libra, their brand new cryptocurrency.</p><p>The Head of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee is calling for hearings in to Libra and France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire wants the G20 to actually investigate.</p><p>Now it is not unusual for activist investors to call for a company to be broken up, and that is exactly what some Alphabet stakeholders are doing.</p><p>The Google parent company holds its annual meeting today and activist investors are urging it to beat regulators to the punch by separating parts of its business.</p><p>I want to bring in Hadas Gold who joins us live now. So Hadas, it is not just this idea of potentially Alphabet breaking up into several different sort of subsidiaries. It's also the fact that there are 13 different shareholder-sponsored proposals that are on the table, which is in itself quite unusual. It is quite high.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Zain, that's a record actually, the 13 activist shareholder proposals. That's double the number that we've seen for Alphabet in previous years starting with that first one about breaking Google.</p><p>This comes from the group SumOfUs whose goal is to curb the growing power of corporations, they want Alphabet to break itself up, as you said to get ahead of regulators, because they think shareholders could -- and I'm quoting here, \" ... receive greater value from a voluntary or strategic reduction. Because alphabet may be too large and too complex to be managed effectively.\"</p><p>Now, this is as you said, one of 13 proposals, and at least five of them are actually backed by Alphabet employees themselves. And those proposal specifically deal with some of the issues we saw in previous months, those walkouts around how Google handles sexual harassment cases.</p><p>They include things like a ban on NDAs in all harassment and discrimination cases, rescinding of executive compensation. Another interesting one calls on a human rights impact assessment about Google's plans in China.</p><p>Now, as you can see on the screen, the Board is recommending against all 13 stockholder proposals. It's very unlikely to pass because Alphabet's two top executives hold 51.3 percent of all the shareholder votes.</p><p>But all of these proposals are a clear reflection of this sort of growing trend, not only to the concerns over breaking up big tech, but also how employees and activist shareholders are feeling they want to take matters into their own hands when it comes to things like sexual harassment, executive pay.</p><p>And we're not only going to see the action during this meeting itself inside. Outside, there are hundreds of people who are planning to protest Alphabet for various things, everything from Google's dealings in China to housing crisis in Silicon Valley and how Alphabet has contributed to that.</p><p>So we will be keeping a close eye on this, Zain, it's supposed to start in about three hours or so 9:00 a.m. on the West Coast in California, and we'll see if we'll actually hear any more comments from Alphabet regarding to any of these 13 proposals -- Zain.</p><p>[09:35:05] ASHER: Hadas, it has actually been quite a bit of a difficult year for Alphabet. I mean their share price fell after their last earnings announcement in April, and they haven't really recovered.</p><p>They've also dealt with a record number of E.U. fine when it comes to unfair competition. Just walk us through what the year has been like for Alphabet.</p><p>GOLD: Yes, it's been a difficult year for them, and actually, when you look at their share price, it's been underperforming compared to its rivals when you think about Facebook and Amazon and they have been really sort of been a target for regulators around the world, and for politicians as well have been targeting them talking about breaking them up alongside Amazon and the rest.</p><p>But you do hear from some analysts who think that sometimes Alphabet has maybe almost been unfairly bearing the brunt of all of this sort of anti- Big Tech protest where in the last few months, we saw those walkouts from Google employees themselves walking out in protest of how they say the company handles sexual harassment cases when it dealt with very high ranking executives. And there were some changes that were enacted after those protests.</p><p>But we're seeing that that is still having an effect now that we have these proposals coming forth. Like I said, very unlikely to pass, but I think we're starting to see a lot more activism not only from employees themselves, but also from shareholders -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Hadas Gold, live for us. Thank you so much. All right, coming up, Oxford University receives its biggest donation in centuries from the head of Blackstone. We'll hear from the Wall Street billionaire, next.</p><p>ASHER: All right, welcome back everybody. Within the next half hour, pilots, flight attendants and their unions will tell American lawmakers about their concerns over Boeing's 737 MAX planes.</p><p>Congress is investigating Boeing's handling of two fatal crashes which killed a total of 346 people. Drew Griffin joins us live now from Washington. So Drew, what are the sort of main concerns we expect pilots to say at this hearing?</p><p>[09:40:09] DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Zain, I think that the pilots here in Washington, D.C. want to make sure that the Congress is looking back directly at this plane and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's search certification of it.</p><p>There have been a lot of recent comments lately trying to blame the pilots for these crashes, especially foreign pilots who may not be trained properly in this, and the head of the Allied Pilots Association here that represents American Airlines pilots is really fuming about those statements.</p><p>He wants this to be squarely about the plane, its design, and why the U.S. F.A.A. actually certified this plane to go up in the air in the first place.</p><p>So you're going to see a lot of fireworks based on that not blaming the pilots, and if the pilots did have anything to do with this, Zain, that it was the fact that Boeing had a system on board that was not known to the pilots that the pilots were not properly trained on, and even that should be the focus of the F.A.A.'s certification process.</p><p>So I think the point of this hearing is to take it from the stakeholders who will actually be asked to go back into these planes, back flying these planes. It's not just the pilots, it is the flight attendants, too who want to make sure that Congress and the F.A.A. are going to take their time and completely make sure that this plane is safe to fly again, and there's no rush to get it back up in the air -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: No rush, Drew, but how rigorous will this certification process be for the F.A.A., when it comes to just trying to get those planes back off the ground and resuming flying?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Well, I can tell you that that process has been ongoing now, Zain, for months, even though the handoff per se hasn't happened yet between Boeing and the F.A.A. The F.A.A. has been very involved in what Boeing is doing, the changes being made to the plane, the changes being made to flight training manuals, to simulators, there's about a lot of give and take going back and forth between the F.A.A.</p><p>As for what happens next, there's going to be a certification flight done by the F.A.A. Look for that in the next two weeks, and then it'll be another four to six weeks after that, when a completely different review board, it's called the Technical Advisory Board will check everything that the F.A.A. has done to make sure that nothing has been missed.</p><p>So, the F.A.A. is trying to tell us this is going to be a very rigorous process. It's not being rushed. Look at the earliest for these planes to be okay to fly by U.S. airlines probably end of September, October, and then it'll be up to the international aviation authorities to determine how they will move forward -- Zane.</p><p>ASHER: Drew Griffin, live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. All right. Here's today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" The head of Blackstone is donated $188 million to Oxford University. It is the single biggest donation since the Renaissance and the pledge from U.S. billionaire Stephen Schwarzman will fund a Center for Humanities and will include an institute to study the ethics of artificial intelligence.</p><p>He spoke to our John Defterios about the investment and why he thinks it's so urgent to take action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CEO AND COFOUNDER, BLACKSTONE: Usually governments react to crises, so you make a mess, and then they pass something to address it. Since we know a mess is coming, we need not wait. And I'm not a regulatory, you know, advocate ordinarily, but this is something where business, the academic world and the government world and the media need to come together so nobody panics.</p><p>And the introduction of the technologies are fazed and nobody likes to be fazed. And so it presents a challenge, but it's a challenge that has to be overcome because if you don't address it, the outcome is going to be pretty clear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: All right, John Defterios joins us live now from London. So John, Stephen Schwarzman has also been speaking out about trade. He talks about the fact that even though there is some optimism about the fact that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are going to be meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit that he doesn't anticipate the deal is going to be reached there and then. It may indeed be some time.</p><p>You spoke to him about trade as well. What did he have to say?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, it's a pretty sober view, Zain, but some context on Blackstone itself, a half a trillion dollar is under management under the tutelage of Steve Schwarzman. So that's why everybody wants to hear what he has to say.</p><p>By the way on artificial intelligence, he told me, \"Look, if I didn't think I could make a difference on the dialogue around artificial intelligence and the disruption of jobs, I would have stayed out of the debate,\" but we wanted to talk to him about those two issues that are on the table today, and in fact, throughout the week, and that's the U.S.-China trade war, and also the very aggressive position by Donald Trump against Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve and the Feds decision coming forth.</p><p>Let's start on the first topic, U.S.-China trade, and can we get a deal or not? He says not yet.</p><p>[09:45:28] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: At the moment, the trade talks are basically not talking, and so the two Presidents need to reset their mutual expectations and if there is no overlap, then they'll end up being more tariffs and more divisiveness and less business confidence and slower global growth.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: So you've had experience in China and success? Do you think a deal can be done though, in that short of a timeframe?</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: No. A deal can be done by next week. That really, completely unrealistic. What the meeting between the two Presidents is meant to do is say, you know, we were close to a deal, you know, the Chinese have backed off it. And to make a deal, you have to know where they stand.</p><p>If they really want to do something, they'll come back and say, \"Well, I don't know why we did what we did,\" or, you know, \"Here's why we did this on this one point, maybe you can solve it,\" but if things stay the way they are, and you just have pleasant handshakes, there won't be anything.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Should the Federal Reserve be more accommodative as a result of the trade tensions with China? With India? Even south of the border with Mexico? Should they be more aggressive in your view or will they fight for that independence and hold the line against President Trump's request?</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Well, the U.S. economy is -- particularly in the manufacturing area is slowing, and so you can make the case regardless of what the President says or doesn't that the Fed should take another look at where they are.</p><p>Also, because European interest rates are so low now, negative, that it's starting to affect currencies. So is it fair to take a look? Yes, the Fed is independent and the Fed was set up to be independent and they should operate as independent.</p><p>And so usually, when the President says something the way he is, he is expressing a point of view. I'm sure they've heard it, and they should do whatever they think is right, that's their job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Steve Schwarzman once again, a little bit of nuance there, Zain, suggesting that the Fed should take another look at where we are, we're slowing down. But the thing that stood out for me, not part of that clip here. But part of the interview overall, he does not think that the U.S.-China trade war will tilt the U.S. into a recession in 2020.</p><p>But he says he sees the slowdown in manufacturing and the Fed should be responsive, perhaps to the call -- the pipeline, the data that they're seeing today, not the calls from the President and the aggressive nature on Jay Powell.</p><p>ASHER: All right, John Defterios, live for us there. Thank you so much. And by the way, programming note to all of you, you can actually see more of John's interview with Stephen Schwarzman in a few hours from on \"Quest Means Business.\" That's 3:00 Eastern Time. Thank you, John.</p><p>All right, still to come, Airbnb checks in with its rivals. We will speak to the CEO of his latest acquisition. That's next.</p><p>[14:50:50] ASHER: All right, welcome back. Airbnb is better known for disrupting the traditional hotel industry than investing in it. But as the company gears up for an IPO, it did just that.</p><p>A few months ago, it bought HotelTonight, and that offers discounted last minute hotel rooms from brands, including Sheraton and Hyatt as well.</p><p>For one the value HotelTonight brings, I'm joined now by a CEO, Sam Shank. Sam, thank you so much of being with us. So let's just talk first and foremost about why the synergy between Airbnb and HotelTonight makes sense. What do you guys both give each other?</p><p>SAM SHANK, CEO, HOTELTONIGHT: We are -- it's such a great match because we are so complimentary as brands. We bring a lot more supply that Airbnb doesn't have and we also bring a use case that Airbnb doesn't have.</p><p>We do a lot of business travel and it's mostly last minute for us. That's where we started with Tonight, and with a couple days ahead, and Airbnb is wonderful for - and more focused on the longer term stays that are planned further out.</p><p>So together we can bring something really, really great and complimentary.</p><p>ASHER: So how much autonomy do you still have, despite being bought by Airbnb?</p><p>SHANK: HotelTonight is a separate entity, separate brand completely autonomous. And that said, we are working together to bring the HotelTonight partners and the HotelTonight hotels partners to Airbnb and we're also looking at ways to bring Airbnb customers to HotelTonight when that's the best thing for them.</p><p>ASHER: I see. Okay, so just talk about some of the trends we are seeing in the hotel space right now. You know, you and I were just talking a second ago during the break about the rise of sort of themed hotels -- Equinox, I did a story on this several years ago, Equinox was coming out with their own hotel chain, The Gym coming out with their own hotel chain.</p><p>I know that West Elm, the furniture store is also looking at hotels as well. Walk us through some of these new sort of trends we are seeing in hotels.</p><p>SHANK: It's a really fascinating trend where you have a lifestyle brand that stands for something unique, and then mashed up with a hotel and this experience of being out of your regular routine.</p><p>And for the Equinox brands, it's about wellness and it's about fitness. And as I toured it, it was a really amazing product and an amazing -- it's going to be an amazing hotel.</p><p>There's also brands like Away which is a luggage company, a luggage startup that's been very successful that's planning a hotel. And then there's even -- there was a pop up hotel that Taco Bell did, and the Taco Bell fans went crazy for this place. And it was only open for a weekend or a week or something. But it was a big hit, especially on social media as you can imagine.</p><p>ASHER: I am sure. But some of the trends we're seeing in travel right now, especially with millennials, we're seeing more sort of last minute vacations. This summer is going to be record high travel. There's what's known as \"bleasure,\" which is when you mix business and pleasure travel as well. Walk us through that.</p><p>SHANK: The millennials and Gen Z and the younger generations, they look to optimize their life around experiences. And a big part of experiences for them is travel. So for them, it's about how many trips can I get in? How many experiences can I get in?</p><p>And so they look to places like HotelTonight and Airbnb for on-demand travel where they can fit in regional trips is a really big trend.</p><p>So going like just a day outside of the city or even a staycation within the city and having a very different experience staying in a hotel with a pool and then instead of having just two or three big trips a year, having, five, six, ten trips a year is the big trend.</p><p>ASHER: So now that you -- I mean, obviously HotelTonight, you accept last minute bookings. That's how you built your business. But you accept bookings in advance now. So how do you fend off competition? Or how do you distinguish yourself from competitors like Priceline and Expedia, booking.com?</p><p>SHANK: We looked at three things to make us better than the competition. First is our simplicity. And you can book a room in just 10 seconds, in three taps and a swipe on HotelTonight.</p><p>Second is value. We have amazing deals. We have a new deal feature called Daily Drop, which is an ephemeral deal. It's a deal that you unlock, and you get this really amazing discount. It's one of our best discounts. And then you get only 15 minutes to book it.</p><p>ASHER: How much of a discount are we talking?</p><p>SHANK: I've seen 30 percent to 35 percent off of that -- the discount varies and sometimes, you can even go higher than that. And then the last is our playfulness and the gamification. We have a rewards program that the more you book, the better the deals get.</p><p>[09:55:13] SHANK: We have achievements, so collect the number of cities and states and countries you've been to. And we love to celebrate travel, we love to make it fun. It ultimately is fun. And booking travel should be just as fun.</p><p>ASHER: So one trend that we're seeing everywhere is personalization. So how do you cater to that? I mean, do you have a profile of people knowing what sort of rooms they like, knowing where they tend to go -- that sort of thing?</p><p>SHANK: Yes, absolutely. The more you use HotelTonight, the better it gets for you and the results that we show you become more personalized and curated to your own tastes and it happens invisibly, and it just becomes that HotelTonight as you trust it more and more because it is showing you better and better things for you.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Sam Shank live for us. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. All right, that's it for us. Thank you so much for watching. I'm Zain Asher. International Desk with Robyn Curnow starts after the break. You are of course watching CNN. Have a great day.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In the meantime, it was an up-and-down day on Wall Street, ultimately down on some of these very concerns about whose next, what's next, how is it all going down, particularly in China? That will do it here. \"THE FIVE\" is now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I am Juan Williams, along with Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, and Emily Compagno. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. This is a Fox News alert. The family of Rayshard Brooks expected to speak soon following the announcement of charges against two police officers involved in that shooting death.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ex-Atlanta officer Garrett Rolfe, the cop who shot Rayshard Brooks in the back while outside a Wendy's now facing 11 total charges, those charges include felony murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The other officer involved, Devin Brosnan, will testify against his partner as a states witness. He's facing three charges, including aggravated assault.</p><p>Body cam footage shows the officers having a calm conversation with Brooks for more than 40 minutes before things got violent. Brooks then resisted arrest, stole an officer's taser, and took off. The officer says Brooks fired the taser at him and that's when he shot him. Fox News contributor and former homicide detective, Ted Williams, reacting to the charges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is why this case, I believe, will not be -- these officers will not be found guilty. It's because at that stage, unfortunately, Mr. Brooks turned and shot the taser at the officer. A taser is a weapon. A taser can be a dangerous weapon. We are not watching justice take place here. I don't give a damn about this white-black situation. These are human beings.</p><p>This is a rush to judgment. This is to satisfy a crowd. And prosecutions should never be based on satisfying a crowd. And that is what we have here. This is wholly unfair.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Emily, you are the lawyer on the panel today so let me get your thoughts on these multiple charges. And as you just heard Ted Williams, a former detective, former lawyer for the police here in Washington, says he thinks that the prosecution went too far.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Right, Juan. Well, two things struck me actually. First of all, the fundamental failure of basic arrest protocol that these officers failed to do, which was telling Mr. Brooks that he was under arrest, and also their behavior after Mr. Brooks was shot, kicking him and standing on him and that failure to render timely medical aid.</p><p>It was really nauseating to listen to that. And I know that it was a surprise for those in the courtroom as well because you could hear those audible gasps. But I want to speak to those charges for a moment, and that Georgia law requires that a grand jury indictment before those charges are actually formalized. And given the fact that we already know the second officer has flipped on Officer Rolfe and is testifying against him.</p><p>I -- and he's also facing the death penalty for this. Then I would be shocked if this even went to trial. And I foresee there being an eventual plea agreement. And my final thought is just that the amplification of the tragedy here is so sad. This is another life lost. These are two more police officers who have had their lives ruined.</p><p>One is literally facing the death penalty. And the ripple effect for all of us, for the community and the law enforcement community is just -- I think it is frankly never endingly tragic.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I hear it in your voice, Emily. Jesse, I know that you think that the officer had reason to fear for his safety when Brooks ran away and then fired the taser. What do you think about these charges?</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I think it's a political overcharge because the prosecutors, in a hotly contested runoff for election, and he's under state investigation for pocketing six figures that was supposed to go to the state to fight crime and it went into his personal bank account. So that's what that's all about, but he's playing with fire.</p><p>I mean, we are looking at a huge crime wave in the next decade because of this. This is the Ferguson effect on steroids. Police now, especially Atlanta, they will pull back. They'll let the streets run wild. And if there is an arrest, I bet suspects are taking their chances with officers after this. It's clear as day, Juan, that they gave this guy so many second chances.</p><p>They were so polite, so respectful. They tried to wake him up twice. They asked him if he was OK, if he was needed an ambulance. He punched in the face, wrestled with them, stole their taser. He points that taser, fires it, went right over the officer's head. If it connects, it incapacitates the officer. He steals the firearm. He's already stolen a taser.</p><p>He could do whatever he wants. And we've talked about police reform. We need that. We need people reform. And I'm not talking about this case. I'm not talking about black-white. Anybody, if you get pulled over, this is what I do. Yes, officer, no, officer. May I go, officer? I have my license and registration. If you have a small amount of marijuana in the car, that's a ticket.</p><p>Know the law. If you have a weapon in the car, say, officer, I have a weapon in the car. It's loaded. It's under the seat. If you want to fight the officer, fight him in court. You're talking about if you have warrants? Well, that's on you, but if you run, if you resist, if you assault an officer, you're racking up a massive amount of felonies that are going to haunt you for life.</p><p>They have helicopters. They have dogs. You're going to get caught and you're going to get in big trouble. People need to be respectful of law enforcement. Officer doesn't even have to pull out the taser, doesn't have to wrestle you, doesn't have to pull out a firearm. All of these fines, these lives lost, these tickets, they can all be saved if people just start conducting themselves appropriately. And that goes for everybody no matter who you are.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. Greg, one of the elements of Republican proposals here in Washington on police reform has to do with de-escalating tensions before you get to a violent situation, such as we saw in that Wendy's parking lot in Atlanta. Do you think that applies to this case? Is it a case where you could reasonably say let Brooks run away? What's the problem? There's no -- he is no threat to public safety.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. I mean, I think you can look actually at every single case, because there aren't a lot of them. Like I said, out of the 50 million police encounters in a year, you have roughly 50 cases like this where an unarmed man or a man in this case holding a taser is shot dead. There are more whites than there are blacks. And it's actually a greater proportion of encounters. The deaths are more among whites.</p><p>So you can actually -- they are enough that you can actually look at each one of them. And you can see how different each one is. Each one has its own problem when it comes to tactics and training. You can find a flaw in each one, but you also find these other universal things like resisting arrest, intoxication, and then flaws in tactics and training. These all come together.</p><p>So the goal of this reform movement is to take these one in a million tragedies. Because again, it's one -- it's 50 out of 50 million encounters, and go from one in a million to zero in a million, which I believe is impossible because we are imperfect human beings and there's going to be problems. We do have to increase training. And we do have to really re- examine the tactics.</p><p>But I'm going to back to my suggestion earlier about police recusal, where black officers only handles black suspects and white officers only handle white suspects. People will call that -- isn't that discrimination? But I actually found out that we are doing this already. Female cops frisk female suspects. You go to TSA, Juan. I know you are shaking your head.</p><p>You see that it's female TSA officers who are patting down females in line. So we actually do segregate in this world in order to reduce, you know, certain kinds of shocking visuals. We know what's behind this, this rage. Yet, you know, we know what's behind this rage. It's the perception of racism, OK? The fact is if -- what the sheriff said about these charges is that it's kind of an appeasement to the mob.</p><p>Appeasement signals don't work. They don't work. We saw Wendy's with half a million dollars. They gave a half a million dollars. They gave a half a million dollars.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: -- and their restaurant was still burned down. That has to be remembered.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Greg, I have to interrupt for just a second, because the family of Rayshard Brooks is having a press conference. Here we are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- from the very beginning. I want everybody to know that we want you to stay focused. This is not the finish line. This is the starting point. Yes, we appreciate and we commend the DA's office for charging these officers appropriately, but that's just step one. Step two is convictions on all charges. And then after that, we have to try to make things right for the Brooks family and for those children.</p><p>Like Chris and I said before, justice is not something that is going to be easy in this case. It never is. How do you find justice for three little girls who will never see their father again? How do you get justice for a little girl who on her birthday every single year from now until the rest of her life, she will remember that that is the day she found out that her dad died?</p><p>How do you get justice for that little girl? Since this happened, I have talked to several people who have said different things about what went on, about what Mr. Brooks should or should not have been doing, about what the officer should or should not have been doing. And to those people, I say with these new revelations. Again, I implore you. Look into your heart and have some empathy for another human being.</p><p>Because that's what Rayshard Brooks is and was, another human being. He may not look like you. He may not be from where you're from. But he's another human being just like you. Tomika Miller is a human being. She's a mother. She's a daughter. She's a wife and she is a human being just like you. So when you see Officer Rolfe kick Rayshard Brooks after he shot him in the back, while he's laying on the ground dying.</p><p>Think about that before you start to get into things that don't matter at all, that are completely irrelevant to this case, and to generally just to all of us as humans. We should be together on this, not apart. I was taught when I was a kid that you don't kick a man when he's down. I mean, I learned that playing sports. I was taught that. That was kind of an American thing, you know. That is one of our ideals.</p><p>We don't kick people when they're down. What you saw and what we all saw is one officer standing on a man who was dying, standing on top of him, and then the other officer literally kicking him while he was on the ground dying, literally kicking him while he's down. What that showed me as I was watching that press conference is this. America is not America for all Americans.</p><p>And as we come to the July 4th holiday in a couple of weeks, there will be a lot of people celebrating. But there will be just as many people who will still be in the streets fighting for injustice. So again, we ask everyone continue fighting. Keep doing your part. And stand with us. Support this family, because right now they really need you. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just want to say thank you. And I just hope that everything falls out how it needs to fall out and these officers are charged. I'm really hurt. Father's Day is coming up. And all I can do is just think about what if my husband was still here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The biggest question is how do we feel about the charges. I know there's a lot of them, a lot of charges. This isn't like a celebration or a victory lap of watching these officers get charged. Nobody's happy. Nobody is celebrating because this never should have happened. We shouldn't have to celebrate as African-Americans when we get a piece of justice, like today.</p><p>We shouldn't have to celebrate and parade when an officer is held accountable for actions that we saw and actions that we didn't know about until today. Some people thought we would be happy and be celebrating and have a fist in the air, but it's more a disappointment that this is the state of policing and this is where we are at. But I saw a lot of hope today.</p><p>As the district attorney said, this is the first time another officer has decided to be a government witness and testify against another officer. That's what policing is. That's the kind of officers that make these streets safe that stop instances like this from happening. When you're willing to step up and say that was wrong. Even if that's going to risk my career, even if people won't like me and other officers will be angry.</p><p>That's the reason that I will always say not every single officer's out there trying to kill somebody. But we are also not going to play that rhetoric game that you all saw today of all officers are great. No, we have seen what has happened. It's the same assumption that we don't want officers making about black people that all people are from the ghetto, that all people are good, that all of us are up to no good, that you need to search every black male that you see which leads to situations like this.</p><p>It's both assumptions. So we're watching these policies that directly affect families like this, all these arguments, Democrats versus Republicans, all of this ridiculousness, and they are not starting from step one. How do we actually fix this and not what's best for your political party, because the things that I saw today, we are going to be back here next year.</p><p>What's the point of a national collection of data if the data is flawed? We have handled cases where the internal affairs reports aren't taken properly. So you will be collecting data that's nonsensical and doesn't hold officers accountable unless you fix the department's internal affairs first. But they don't want reality. They want policies and elections.</p><p>And that's fine, but we will end here again. So was this justice today? Not yet. We still don't have a definition for it. It's more heartache that families have to go through this and fight the public to try and get justice for a man that was shot in the back twice. But we do thank everybody in this country for the outpouring of support, the people that are marching for change peacefully, keeping his name alive positively.</p><p>And maybe one day this country will get it right with policing, and we will all come together, brief questions real quick.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your point about the second officer agreeing to cooperate to be a witness. The attorney general saying the statement that the second officer is cooperating but has not agreed to be a witness against the other officer, has not agreed to plead guilty to anything. Do you have a comment on this?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah. I didn't believe he would plead guilty to anything. The information that they've already gotten so far has led them to believe that this is going to help secure the prosecution of the other officer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Those were the lawyers, Chris Stewart and Justin Miller, for the family of Rayshard Brooks, the man who was shot in a Wendy's parking lot last Friday night in Atlanta, Georgia. Tomika Miller, his widow, is there with the lawyers that you just heard. Dana Perino, I wanted to come to you just for a general reaction to what you heard.</p><p>But also I guess to the whole notion of police reform, because it is, you know, the poll show overwhelming support for it at this juncture.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes. And sometimes, it takes an event like we saw in order to enforce change and -- or at least get people to the table. The president had come forward with an executive order. We all know executive orders are not as strong as legislation, but that is why -- there are Republicans have put forward in the Senate a bill, the House, the Democrats.</p><p>That's how legislation gets done. And there's a commitment from the leader of the Senate to move it forward in a more timely fashion and not waiting until after the Fourth of July holiday. So on that front I think that people can take some comfort that Washington is being responsive. Juan, I was thinking about in Minneapolis, in the case of Derek Chauvin, and the frustration amongst the community that it took three or four days to get the charges against the officer.</p><p>Actually that -- for Minneapolis, that was actually quite quick. It was quite rapid. And one of the things that prosecutors stressed in Minneapolis, remember the charges were not second-degree murder. It was third-degree at first. But he explained to the community. We have to be able to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. That's how our system works.</p><p>If this goes to a jury and that jury does not convict on these very tough charges. That will be a major disappointment. Now, Emily, it could be right. There might be a plea deal. That might happen. But if you're the officer, you might want to take this to a jury, because again, you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>I will stop there since I know we've got to run. I'm sure we will be talking about this a lot more in the future.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I think that was insightful. Ahead, what some are calling a new example of conservative censorship after NBC apparently encouraged Google to go after right wing websites. That's next for you on THE FIVE.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Welcome back. New accusations of censoring conservatives, Google banning right-leaning financial blogs Zero Hedge from its ad platform and warning the Federalist it could be next. The tech giant claiming posts and comment sections violated its policies. The move apparently coming after NBC News influenced Google to take action. And Republicans are responding with a new bill that would allow Americans to sue big tech companies over political censorship.</p><p>The DOJ is proposing new rules to limit internet companies' liability protections. Greg, I wanted to start with you. You've been in so many formats of media throughout the years. What is your take in all this?</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I think this is how the woke crowd works. If you can't win in the field of ideas, you contact companies and report what you believe to be offensive material. The companies don't want the hassle so they operate on a hair trigger. They will do anything to comply with this mob. And actually, it's a fairly effective means of silencing speech.</p><p>Now, people will say this isn't silencing speech at all, because Google is a private company or it's a company. It's not a government. And nobody's telling you what not to say. But the fact is if your career and livelihood is at the mercy of an intolerant woke activism, then it is silencing speech. It is harming you. And this is actually spreading out.</p><p>And it's really frightening because you can see how the media avoids data and statistics about law enforcement in favor of polling. Remember, polling aren't facts. Those are gauging feelings. But stats tell you about behavior. And we are not hearing about statistics because the media is so cowardly about it. If they see statistics as a third rail straight to being cancelled or being ruined, and it's a travesty.</p><p>Because we need to know the facts in order to push the ball forward on issues like law enforcement. And instead, we are just stuck in, like, emotion and symbolism and virtue signaling.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dana, what are your thoughts on that new Senate bill?</p><p>PERINO: So I think -- one of the things I think that Google got suckered by an NBC media hoax, right? So they have somebody calling around saying, hey, have you seen this in your comments? And like, no we haven't seen it. And then as Greg said, they were on a hair trigger. And then they had a major public relations screw up.</p><p>So that leads to the fact that you have on the left, like, AOC, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She wants the tech companies to be regulated because she thinks they don't do enough to suppress speech that they don't like. On the other hand, you have someone like Josh Hawley, the Senator from Missouri, on the right, saying we want to regulate the tech companies so that they won't censor people on the right.</p><p>So it's weird, Hawley and AOC kind of want the same thing but for very different reasons. And the Congress, I believe, has had a little bit of a light touch when it comes to regulating the internet and big tech companies because we like the innovation. We like the freedom. I think we still like the First Amendment. But actions like what happened yesterday or, like, the concern that there was an action about to be taken against somebody raises everybody's hackles.</p><p>And I do think that the tech companies are looking at some sort of big reconciling in D.C. coming soon.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Jesse, how do you read all this, especially the reaction to the comments, not initial content?</p><p>WATTERS: Can we de-fund the speech police, Emily? I mean, that's the only police that the Democrats like. I am really sick of these narcs, the snitches, the control freaks, these intellectual lightweights that can't handle debate. They have to destroy you instead. Just think about what they are doing to the president on Twitter or any conservative on Twitter.</p><p>You say something, boom, you're cancelled. I mean, they sue the president to stop his rallies. They don't want to take the task force briefings. You know, they boycott Fox News. They boycott businesses. They boycott restaurants. You can't even say anything anymore. All lives matter is now racist. Cops' lives matter is now racist.</p><p>They could barely handle Merry Christmas. Remember, radical Islam. Oh my, god, you can't say that. You can't say anything anymore. I mean, they're coming after the clothes you wear. You can't wear the MAGA hats. You can't even wear a t-shirt. You have to apologize. You like the anthem, can't say that. You've got to apologize for that, too.</p><p>Or how about the statues, they're tearing down statues, getting rid of movies, getting rid of mascots, logos, history. Pretty much everything the left doesn't like they need to erase. This is just the cultural revolution right now. Bigger than a culture war and anything they disagree with, they want to wipe out. They want to bankrupt you. They want you fired.</p><p>Hell, I mean, if you work for the president, they would throw you in prison. And while everybody is so intimidated and scared by the mob, the left is seizing more and more power all over the country. They are not going to be satisfied until they have absolute control. And anything they don't like about this country, they want gone.</p><p>And the scary thing is they don't like a lot about this country. So it's all on the table for them. And people better start realizing right now this is a fight. Because right now, everything's on the table for destruction.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Juan, can you speak to Jesse's points, especially the one about the cancel culture and about how there are certain conservative principles or even symbols that really have been considered totally alt-right and have now been, you know, essentially completely canceled by the left. Speak to that, please.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, sure, Emily. Well, I mean, look, I'm a big free speech advocate. You know, I've been fired for speaking my mind. And here on THE FIVE I don't think there are any muzzles. People can say what they want to say and we go at it pretty good.</p><p>But I do think that in this case, you're talking about a private company. There's no first amendment protection for a private company. They can select what voices, what opinions they want to feature on their platforms. That's America, that's the law, and they have that right. And I don't think that we can say, you must hear this, you must hear that.</p><p>And of course, in response to what Jesse was saying, I -- you know, I think that there are offensive symbols and materials, that other people, you know, let's say the Germans, they don't have statues to Hitler. There's a reason for that. Yet we have Confederate statues, statues to people who are traitors to this country, to America, who wanted to break us apart. I think that's an indication of something out of balance. So to my mind, I may sound like a conservative here, but I think that private --</p><p>WATTERS: What about Christopher Columbus statues, Juan?</p><p>WATTERS: Hang on, hang on. Let me finish please. I just think that when we think about private companies, again, sounding like a conservative, I think we should stay out of the business, a private companies making decisions that are best left to them and their shareholders.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Those decisions only affect conservatives though. That's the issue, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's not true. Absolutely not true. The biggest media companies in America, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Rush Limbaugh.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it is, Juan. Everybody knows it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are they censored? Come on, Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: You know it, the audience knows it, conservatives are targeted by big tech.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We know what? We know what? You can't get conservative opinion in America?</p><p>COMPAGNO: We have to go. All right, we have to save this for the next block, you guys. Coming up, this one is not going to land well, the new airline regulation that's got Greg fired up. Stay with us.</p><p>PERINO: Welcome back. So there's new details from John Bolton's book that are coming out. The ex-National Security Adviser is accusing President Trump of misconduct including asking China for help with his reelection, that is among other various allegations of unethical behavior that Bolton lays out.</p><p>Joining us to react is Chris Wallace. He is the author of the brand-new book, Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World. Chris, it's good to have you. We're going to take it around the table here and ask you a few questions. Let me start with the John Bolton question.</p><p>Now, this is an interesting situation because Bolton had written a book. He does not have permission from the government to release the book, but the book is coming out and you have an interview that's already been done with ABC News that is going to air on Sunday night. And now you have an excerpt from John Bolton in the Wall Street Journal that ran just a couple of hours ago.</p><p>So this thing is coming out. What do you think the big takeaway is? Will it be a bombshell or was this sort of kind of like more of the same?</p><p>WALLACE: Well, it's significant. There have been other people, members of the -- of the Trump administration who have come out, but nobody this high up, the national security adviser, and written a book.</p><p>And he does have a lot of damaging things to say that the President, according to Bolton, pleaded with Chinese President Xi to buy more farm goods because that would help Trump win reelection with victories in the farm states, variety of other embarrassing things. And he hits the Democrat says that the mistake they made an impeaching Trump was that they should have actually gone on more issues, not just Ukraine, that there were a variety of foreign policy issues.</p><p>In terms of the impact it's going to have. You know, I've been thinking about that. I don't think that'll have a lot of impact. You know, I think that people are so locked in on Donald Trump. You either think he's, you know, been the savior of the country and has managed a great economy and is going to bring it back after COVID and all of that or you just hate him, or certainly don't want him to be president. And I'm not sure that this is going to change a lot of minds one way or the other.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Jesse Watters, you have a question for Chris?</p><p>WATTERS: Sure. I mean, a lot of the audience obviously hasn't read the book, so we can't really hash out all the specific allegations, and there's some big ones in there. But putting that aside, Chris, if you look at someone, who I guess, lobbies to be a part of the presidential administration, is hired as I guess, national security adviser, and then is entrusted with classified information -- it was over a year, I think he was there, and then leaves and writes pretty much a tell-all about the experience immediately after being fired right before the election. Doesn't that seem a little -- I don't I don't know how to characterize it, I guess I would say unusual?</p><p>WALLACE: I think you can argue that it says as much about John Bolton as it does about Donald Trump. I will tell you because I was around interviewing the president when he was president-elect, and he was considering John Bolton for a top job at that point in 2016 after the election, when he was president-elect, and he had two concerns about him. One, that he was too aggressive, too hawkish, you know, was one of the neocons who would help get us into Iraq.</p><p>And the other was the question of loyalty because -- and Dana can speak to this, George W. Bush expended a lot of political capital giving him a recess appointment to be U.N. ambassador, and when he left that post, he turned on bush and attacked his foreign policy. So he was concerned about the loyalty of John Bolton.</p><p>Having said that, I don't think it matters. Remember when -- I mean, it matters in an ethical sense and your judgement of John Bolton, but news is news. Remember when the Russians were able to hack John Podesta's e-mail, and they put it out and the Clinton campaign in 2016 kept like, you know, this is stolen material by the Russians. You shouldn't be reporting it. News is news. We're going to report this.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: Juan Williams?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I just wanted to ask a question about the book, Chris. Congratulations on Countdown. And I think in the current atmosphere, lots of people are going to ask what about lessons in terms of decision making, leadership that you saw coming from President Truman in the days before he makes that -- I mean, it might be the decision of the century to drop the bomb on Hiroshima.</p><p>WALLACE: I think -- thanks, Juan. There are a couple of points I make about Countdown 1945 and Truman. One was he was really meticulous. He went -- and it wasn't dropped the bomb or nothing. It was dropped the bomb or invade Japan. And he went over it again and again and again. And in fact, I think there would have been more loss of life invading Japan than there was in dropping the bomb.</p><p>Two, he sought out opposing opinions. He had a meeting shortly before the bomb was dropped with Eisenhower in Potsdam, Germany. And Eisenhower said, I don't think you should drop the bomb, Mr. President. I think the Japanese are going to surrender anyway. And I don't think we should be the country that introduces this technology. And I think it'll hurt on moral standing. Truman didn't follow Eisenhower's advice, but he welcomed it.</p><p>And the third thing I point I'd make is that Truman -- you know, all this talk about being famously decisive, the buck stops here, he agonized over this decision. He couldn't sleep at night. He complained to fierce headaches. And he wrote in his diaries about this in apocalyptic terms, the use of the bomb. He said, it's a terrible weapon, and he said, it's the fire destruction that had been prophesied in the Bible.</p><p>PERINO: Well, Chris, it is a great book getting great reviews. Thank you for coming on the show today. We will see you on Sunday, of course. Thanks very much.</p><p>WALLACE: You bet. Thank you, guys.</p><p>PERINO: And coming up, flying can be a hassle. There's a new rule that has Greg kind of mad in the age of coronavirus.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. Have you heard the phrase never let a pandemic go to waste? Well, now you have because I just said it. Some airlines are doing just that, Delta, American, among others are suspending all or part of their booze service to reduce interaction between passengers and crew and to limit bad behavior.</p><p>So this in medical circles is called a stupid, stupid, highly stupid idea. Do these idiots have any idea why alcohol sales boomed during the lockdown? It's because we were trapped in a room and we couldn't get out. Much like being on a plane where you're trapped with no way out unless you open an emergency exit and aim for a giant bush. I wouldn't suggest that under any circumstances unless you're seated next to Joy Behar.</p><p>It's a fact that flying is getting less enjoyable every year. And yet we never get anywhere faster. As computer speed doubles every two years, we still produce new jets lumbering through the air at the same speeds as the old ones did in the 70s. Worse, today were packed like sweaty veal, forced to endure endless delays and bizarre regulations that often leave us with hunger-induced migraines and distended bladders. And now they want to take away the booze?</p><p>Look, I get the face masks. And believe me I hate drunk jackasses who fly. I even hate myself, but usually not until the next day. But to punish everyone, especially me because of the actions of a few is not the way to solve problems. Sadly, though, that seems to be the trend these days. With just a few bad apples, we don't just throw up the whole batch. We defund the orchard. It's enough to make me drink and hate myself tomorrow.</p><p>All right, Emily, the best part about travel is that you can't be bothered by everyone -- anyone, and you can just sit for three hours and have a cocktail and chill. If they take that away from us. It's over.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Everyone is going to be on edibles. Greg. I'm the one that commutes across the country six hours. I am facing six hours each way of sobriety and mask wearing and everything. So honestly, this whole situation makes me so depressed. I'm with you. I mean, I'm just going to train all the way to New York from now on.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go. You know, Juan, everybody is going to be on edibles. I have a feeling that Emily is right. People are going to be sneaking stuff on. People are going to be sneaking. They're going to be a little -- they're going to duct tape booze in glad bags.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Does this bother you?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Holy smoke. I like sweaty veal too. What an image that was, Greg. But you know, look, I do think, you know, they have -- the airlines have to be concerned about the workers as well as the customers. And so when you hear them talk, you got to keep in mind, they're worried about you know, if the stewardesses and the pilots start getting sick, they don't have anyone to run an airline.</p><p>And the CDC as you said, recommends the masks and it requires close -- and they -- and CDC says no close contact. So, if you're serving drinks up and down the aisle -- so I understand that. But I also hear your voice I mean, you know, gosh, it's -- we're going to be confined on a plane for a long time with nothing to drink.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. All they have to do, Jesse, is have a big basket of little bottles of booze and wear rubber gloves and just throw the drinks out to people and the people can have their own mixers.</p><p>WATTERS: So let me get this straight. You can bring a therapy good on a plane but you can't have a scotch? I mean, I thought -- just when I thought I couldn't hate coronavirus anymore, this comes along. Greg, some of the great pleasures in life, drinking on a boat, drinking on a ski lift, and drinking on a plane. Do not take this away from some of us.</p><p>Some of us -- I mean, our lives would be totally different. If Dana Perino weren't plastered on that flight, she wouldn't have had the courage to flirt with Peter and they never would have gotten together.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's so true.</p><p>PERINO: And it was 10:00 in the morning.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is so true. By the way, that is exactly what I was going to say to Dana, by the way. Dana, can you respond to Jesse?</p><p>PERINO: I mean, I was totally hammered. It was 9:30 in the morning and I almost missed my flight. It was unbelievable. Here's what I say. Bring back the road trip. I love a road trip. I'm very, very good at it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. They're taking everything away from us. It's not fair. It's just not fair. And with that --</p><p>PERINO: Just stay home, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: \"ONE MORE THING is up next.</p><p>PERINO: Just stay home.</p><p>GUTFELD: I am.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They can take away our drinks, but they can't take away \"ONE MORE THING.\" Jesse, you're up.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Time for Jesse's Angry Bird News. Look at that. My hair has changed a lot. You guys want to see or hear the most annoying sound in the world?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: So that right there is a Australian Cockatoo. And ironically, that is the exact same sound that Greg Gutfeld makes when we change the rundown late in the afternoon.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's true.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Gutfeld, you have to respond here.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Well, I've actually heard that cockatoo will be sitting-in in The View. So that'll be exciting. OK, so --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Greg, you're up.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm finally doing my podcasts. Again, I'm doing my podcasts. The first one just went up. It's at Fox Newspodcast.com. I interviewed a legend named Robert Johnson, a music legend, but not the legend, legend. Just the different legend, Robert Johnson.</p><p>This guy has been everywhere. You can hear the music in the background. An amazing guitarist, he auditioned for the Rolling Stones, he's played with everyone from The Who. He knows everybody. It's a fantastic podcast. I urge you to check it out. Again. It's at FoxNewspodcast.com. And that's it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I hope he didn't trade his soul to the devil. Dana, you're up.</p><p>PERINO: OK, so I've had the nursing home residents of our country on our mind. I know we've talked a lot about it on here and focused on that. They've all been shut up in their rooms for three and a half months isolated and it's really upsetting. But one guy up in New Hampshire in a nursing home up there named Rich Vanderweit, he began a pen pal program for the seniors living at Summercrest Senior Living Community. And the word of the program has spread like wildfire.</p><p>They thought they might get a few letters across the country. They are completely slammed. Over 700 letters have come so far, they can't even take any more pen pals. So, America responded with really great heart and generosity here. So if you have anyone in a nursing home, you might want to send them a note.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's a lot of love. Emily, you're up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: OK. The cutest little bunny was just born in Northern Ireland, you guys, and his name is Leo, but he doesn't have any ears. So he just looks like the cutest little, almost like sort of like gerbil, but he actually can still hear. So he's little Leo with an Irish accent and no ears. It's so cute.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he has ears, he just doesn't have like the skin.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Internal ears, he just doesn't have the external.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But he can hear. Yes, yes. OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: Unlike a lot of us.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, folks, you've heard of Casper the -- folks, you've heard of Casper the Friendly Ghost. Well how about having Casper over dinner? Take a look at this Detroit area restaurant. To keep customers safely apart due to coronavirus, they cut out ghost-like figures and seated them at empty tables.</p><p>The idea is to keep the customer safely apart as they dine at Trattoria Da Luigi. And it works. The people returned to the restaurant after three months are enjoying it according to the owner. In fact, he said, it's now an attraction. Wow. No, I hope not.</p><p>Anyway, people making the best of these tough times. What do you think of that, Gregory? Did you like that one?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need-to-know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pushing plasma. The U.S. grants emergency approval for convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tencent ticks higher. The WeChat stocks climb amid reports Trump's executive order may be limited.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And double trouble. The U.S. Gulf Coast braces for storms Marco and Laura.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Monday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. I hope you had a restful weekend and a good start to the week depending on where you are coming from because coming up on the show, we'll be talking the politics and the promise of blood plasma treatment for COVID-19 with the Mayo Clinic, the institution that's collected the most data, and analyzed it on the subject.</p><p>Until then, President Trump's new plasma push, and tech stock gains are helping lift stocks premarket. Europe also higher as you can see. Germany and France both gaining two percent plus.</p><p>Tech, the dominant story in China as well with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange relaxing rules for firms looking to go public on its new Chinext subsidiary, a potential challenge to the dominance of Shanghai's star market, but I think the key there is the fostering of a new generation of tech giant hopefuls at a pivotal moment in time, of course, 18 tech stocks soaring more than 200 percent on their debuts today.</p><p>A strong session, as I mentioned, as well for the WeChat owner, Tencent, amid reports that U.S. restrictions on the app may be less severe than initially feared. All the details are coming up when I get my teeth back in.</p><p>Apple also up some three percent premarket. The firm worth more than $2 trillion when trade kicks off today. Let's call it a Cupertino coup. Apple contributed more than half of the S&amp;P 500's rise to records last week.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla also up more than four percent -- yes, more than four percent premarket. The more these tech titans rise, the greater the talk of course of stretched valuations and a lack of market breadth.</p><p>This is interesting, last week losers outpaced winners by a two to one margin and of course, all the while, the underlying economy continues to suffer. Well, step forward Jay Powell, the Fed Chair speaking this week. He may need to be Powell proactive yet again if economic trends soften further.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers. Christine, quick, take it away from me because I simply cannot get my words out today.</p><p>I read an article over the weekend -- this is shocking -- that said the top 10 percent of earners own some 87 percent of all stocks and that was during the first quarter of this year, and the data came from no other than the Federal Reserve. Eye-watering.</p><p>ROMANS: It really is and it shows you that the stock market is not the overall economy. You keep hearing people talk about -- the White House in particular -- a V-shaped recovery. Well, the economic recovery does not look V-shaped.</p><p>The stock market had a V-shaped bounce back here, but you're hearing a lot of people talk about what's in store in the weeks ahead, especially bringing back to Powell how frustrated must he be and must the Fed be at the lack of action on the fiscal front from Congress.</p><p>We do know the $600.00 a week in extra jobless benefits have been gone now. This is the fourth week in a row. This is entering the fourth week now, and there will be maybe half that much could get into some people's pockets for two or three weeks because of the President's action.</p><p>But even then, Goldman Sachs says it's too little too late. There will be a big hit to personal income in August and that will slow the recovery.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and it is bound to. I mean, when you have a gap in people's income to the tune of the numbers that we've been talking about, that's going to have an immediate impact on spending and this is a spending-driven economy.</p><p>Christine, talk to me about the K-shaped recovery.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We've dealt with the Alphabet soup, but I read about the K- shaped recovery over the weekend, whether you're talking about stock markets or the economy or the divergence between the two, and this actually ring true for me in many ways.</p><p>ROMANS: Me, too, Julia. I'm so glad you brought it up because you have seen probably in your own world, right, people who are recovering quite quickly because of the job they have or the ability to work from home and teach your kids from home.</p><p>There are some people who have adapted into this pandemic economy. There are others, particularly service sectors workers who have not.</p><p>So think of that K shape. Some people in the workforce recovering quickly and recovering nicely, others actually going in the wrong direction.</p><p>So actually, widening the disparity of opportunity and outlook for workers while you have the economy recovering. It's definitely not the same for everyone and it could even be worsening things.</p><p>I mean, I think back to the 2008-2009 financial crisis and I remember one of the lessons from that crisis was there are some people who recovered quite nicely and quite quickly and there are others, it took a decade. They were just getting back to even when this thing hit us now, right?</p><p>[09:05:38]</p><p>ROMANS: So it's just so unfair that this happens in the American economy, there will be winners and losers and I think you look at the workforce in particular, it feels like a K-shaped recovery.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and it's a lesson that Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve knows and the policymakers there have learned and lawmakers simply haven't, because allowing us to go through this period of weeks and weeks without further support is just exacerbating the length of time we have to recover here.</p><p>Christine Romans, thank you so much for that.</p><p>ROMANS: Nice to see you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Donald Trump touting what he calls a powerful therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. It uses plasma from the blood of people who have had the virus and since recovered. It just got emergency approval for widespread use, but just how effective is it?</p><p>Elizabeth Cohen is here and definitely the best person to talk us through this. Tens of thousands of people have been studied, but we go back to this idea once again of a randomized test to get results that we can say this is a solution, a treatment that has great efficacy.</p><p>Can we say that at this stage, Elizabeth?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: No, we can't. This was not a randomized trial. There were so many issues with this trial. It's almost hard to know where to start.</p><p>The only way to do this is to get super nerdy on you, Julia, but I know that you can handle it, so I'm about to get super nerdy.</p><p>The first point that I'm going to make is that in this trial, they had two different death rates that they could look at. And the Trump administration chose to look at the less reliable death rate, the one that was less reliable because it looked better. So they chose a less reliable death rate, but the number made them look better.</p><p>So let's take a look at exactly what happened, if we take a look at these numbers. The Trump administration says there was a 35 percent decreased death rate when people were treated with convalescent plasma earlier versus later in their hospitalization.</p><p>But that's when you look at how many people died seven days after getting treatment, just seven days out. When you look at it, 30 days out, which of course is much more reliable, it's more time, it's more data, that death rate was only decreased by 23.6 percent. So it was still decreased, but it wasn't as good.</p><p>It is interesting to note that they chose the better rate, the one that had the better optics, the one that had the better drama, but in fact was less reliable.</p><p>And Julia, this next point is actually even more important. That decreased death rate, could it be because people got convalescent plasma earlier in their hospitalization? Sure, that could explain it.</p><p>But you know what else could explain it? If they were getting convalescent plasma earlier in their hospitalization, they probably were getting other things earlier, too. Were they getting steroids earlier? We know that those help. Were they getting remdesivir earlier? We know that that antiviral helps.</p><p>So you and I have talked a lot about cause and effect. Just because plasma got there early and those people had a lower chance of dying, well, what else were they getting earlier? You don't need to be a medical genius to know that getting treatments earlier is almost always better than getting them later -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, you make some great points here and the selective choice of data in order to promote an argument here is incredibly worrying.</p><p>But if we separate the timing of this, the politicization of this, of course, the first day of the Republican National Committee this week, Elizabeth, I come back to the idea of doing no harm. Is there any suggestion of using this doing harm to patients versus making a judgment call that it's a wonder drug for treating them?</p><p>COHEN: You know, we don't know if we're doing harm or not until we've thoroughly studied it, and we haven't thoroughly studied it.</p><p>Convalescent plasma, giving plasma from a survivor to a current patient is generally thought of as being safe, that even if you're not helping them, you're probably not hurting them. But that wasn't been thoroughly studied, so we can't say that for sure.</p><p>But to sort of flip that around for a minute, Julia, the question is, are we really helping them? We don't know if we're really helping them, and without an F.D.A. emergency use authorization, without it, plenty of people were getting this treatment.</p><p>He didn't need this F.D.A. authorization in order to give people convalescent plasma. More than 100,000 people in the United States have gotten convalescent plasma for COVID. He didn't need to make this move. He did it for the theatrics of it because it looks like, wow, look what I'm doing. I, Donald Trump, personally am saving people, more than 100,000 people got convalescent plasma without him making this move. He didn't need to do this.</p><p>[09:10:19]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And therein lies the key. Elizabeth Cohen, thank you so much for that.</p><p>COHEN: Thanks.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Tencent adding billions of dollars in market value, shares of the Chinese tech giant closing higher by almost six percent in Hong Kong. That's after a report suggested the risk of a U.S. ban on Tencent's app, WeChat might be less than feared. It comes as another Chinese company, ByteDance is preparing to sue the White House.</p><p>Selina Wang is in Hong Kong for us. Wow, Selina, we're keeping you busy there. There's a lot going on. So there's some agree of optimism, it seems, from investors in Tencent that perhaps there could be some carve out for U.S. businesses that rely on WeChat for targeting consumers, customers in China, at least as far as reports are concerned. Talk us through who this might impact.</p><p>SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Julia, yes, a lot to unpack here. It seems that the Trump administration is realizing that an all-out ban on U.S. companies from working with WeChat would be devastating for these U.S. companies, citing unnamed sources, this report from Bloomberg said that U.S. administration officials are privately reassuring U.S. companies that they can in fact still do business with WeChat in China.</p><p>This is a major relief for Tencent as you're seeing from the stock rally, but it's an even bigger relief for these U.S. corporates doing business in China.</p><p>Julia, we have been talking about this for weeks now. WeChat is indispensable, not just for consumers, but also for businesses. This is a super app that is necessary for daily life, whether it's messaging, social payments, e-commerce, and for businesses whether you're Walmart or Starbucks, you rely on WeChat to market and sell to the Chinese consumer.</p><p>Apple of course has the most at stake here. It gets about a fifth of its sales from China and had an all-out ban been instituted, it would have meant that Apple would have had to remove WeChat from its App Stores in China. That would have meant a major dent on its iPhone sales in China.</p><p>Now, risks do still remain for these corporates in China until details on this executive order are released and Trump could still overrule anything that his senior administration officials decide on.</p><p>And even though we are seeing this partial carve out potentially as you noted, individuals in the U.S. would likely still face restrictions on using WeChat, which has major implications as well.</p><p>It's necessary for people in the U.S. to interact with friends, family and business contacts in China.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, but oh, boy. Imagine the lobbying going on for some of these U.S. businesses, to say, hey, we still want to be able to use WeChat, even if you restrict broader use of it elsewhere.</p><p>Selina, in the meantime, ByteDance biting back. I was dying to say that. What do we know about their apparent attempts to tackle the U.S. administration on potential restrictions, too?</p><p>WANG: We've been expecting this lawsuit to drop for quite some time, and over the weekend, ByteDance now officially saying they are going to sue the Trump administration. They could make an argument on the grounds that the Trump administration deprived it of its due process, that it violates the First Amendment.</p><p>It could also try and contest that it does not in fact pose a national security risk as you and I have talked about, most security experts say that the risk posed by TikTok is theoretical at this point and the administration hasn't presented any concrete evidence.</p><p>But the lawyers I've spoken to say that it is highly unlikely that TikTok is going to succeed on any of those fronts. It is quite rare for the courts to review sanctions imposed by IEPA, that's the International Economic Powers Act that the President used to invoke this ban.</p><p>And when the courts have, they've been largely deferential to the U.S. government. At the same time, they are also unlikely to second-guess the President's national security assertions. That's what we've said, according to these legal experts.</p><p>At the same time, though, it is possible that TikTok and ByteDance are trying to drag this litigation out long enough for there to be a change in the administration, hoping for a change in the President.</p><p>However, they've also noted that it is unlikely Biden would withdraw this executive order.</p><p>I do want to point out an interesting comment that one lawyer made to me, which is that the least obvious but most important part of this lawsuit is that it could maximize TikTok's value in a potential sale to a U.S. company because it raises doubts that this would be a fire sale, which then forces potential bidders like Microsoft or Oracle to come to the table with a sweeter deal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's such a great point. If we're going to be sold, we're not going to go down without a fight here and try and raise the value in the interim. Great point. Selina Wang, great to have you with us, as always. Thank you.</p><p>[09:15:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, these are some of the other stories making headlines around the world. The U.S. Gulf coast gearing up for not one, but two dangerous storms.</p><p>Marco was downgraded to a tropical storm, while tropical storm Laura is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. Both storms were previously forecast to strike the Louisiana Coast as hurricanes within miles of each other.</p><p>Let's get more on this from our meteorologist, Chad Myers. Chad, always great to have you with us. Just talk us through what to expect.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, the first storm, Marco, is very close to New Orleans, within probably a hundred kilometers. It will put down a lot of rainfall, but really only winds of about 30 or 40 kph, nothing all that significant.</p><p>What we're going to watch is the heavy rainfall. It could be 50 to 100 millimeters of rain as it rolls by. Everybody can handle that.</p><p>But now here comes Laura, the storm just south of Cuba getting into the Gulf of Mexico. That water is 30 degrees C, some spots 31 and it is going to grow and it's going to get much stronger, and we are looking at 165 kph storm or higher, really. This could certainly go higher than that because of the warm water, all the way down to the south of this year, guess what's there? U.S. oil offshore production.</p><p>All of the rigs here in all of these colors here, those are the rigs that are going to have to be evacuated because you can't be standing on a rig in 165 kph. So we're going to watch that certainly as the storm tries to grow in intensity.</p><p>Where we are now, we are not going to see too much here across the area from Marco. Marco is really just a storm that's going to move on by. The rain showers are going to be very heavy though, certainly some spots, 150 to 250 millimeters of rain is certainly likely, 500 is possible. So we'll keep watching all of this. This is part of the U.S. agricultural belt, too. More rainfall falling on there, but we are watching oil well derricks for sure -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're going to watch it with you. Chad, great to have you with us. Chad Myers there, thank you.</p><p>Thousands of firefighters are working tirelessly in California, as almost 600 wildfires blaze on. At least four people have died and around 400,000 hectares have been burned.</p><p>President Trump declared it a major disaster to release aid for the state's recovery.</p><p>In a few hours' time, U.S. President Donald Trump will speak in the first of four nights of the Republican National Convention. President Trump is expected to lay out his plan for a second term in the White House as the event builds up to formally naming him as the party's 2020 candidate for President.</p><p>The government in Belarus is warning protesters to maintain peace at demonstrations over a presidential election many see as illegitimate.</p><p>Independent observers have criticized the country's election as unfair and many in the international community are pushing for President Alexander Lukashenko to call a second vote.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE, but plenty more to come. It's peak summer vacation season, but what have COVID staycations meant to the hotel industry? Trouble, I can tell you.</p><p>Plus a damaging audio recording of President Trump's sister released as the Republican Party kicks off its national convention. Our preview of the R.N.C. next. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:21:22]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Hard to believe, but we're beginning the last full week of trading for August. Summer may be slipping away, but the rally on Wall Street remains red hot.</p><p>We are talking fresh records for the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ at the open. The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its fourth straight week of gains, thanks to the continued rally in a handful of big tech names as we've been discussing on a daily basis, it feels like.</p><p>Oil also on the rise as the U.S. Gulf Coast braces for the first of two tropical storms. Almost 60 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's oil production has been shut down as a precaution, 45 percent of natural gas production, too. Workers have been evacuated from more than 100 oil platforms.</p><p>All right, returning to one of our top stories today and how effective is convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19? President Trump and other officials say it could improve the survival rate of patients by some 35 percent.</p><p>Now, that number appears to have come from a study by the Mayo Clinic, but the way it was conducted is not how doctors normally measure the benefits of a treatment because it wasn't a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial.</p><p>From the Mayo Clinic itself, we can speaks to Dr. William Morice, who is President of the Mayo Medical Laboratories and he is going to help us understand the science here. Bill, great to have you on the show, as always. We do like to challenge you early in the morning.</p><p>I know you've done the biggest study and you've poured over -- what -- 70,000 patients who have been treated via this method, but the lack of randomized study is a challenge here. What were your findings?</p><p>DR. WILLIAM MORICE, PRESIDENT, MAYO MEDICAL LABORATORIES: Well, first of all, Julia, great to join you again. As always, a really great opportunity to be with you.</p><p>I think it's really important to go back to five months ago when we started the expanded access program for convalescent plasma therapy for COVID patients. We know from the history of medicine, really, going back to the use of anti-toxins to treat diphtheria patients at the turn of the century that this can be an effective for the treatment of infectious diseases where you take the plasma from one individual that has recovered from the disease and give it to another who is sick with the disease.</p><p>So, five months ago, what we wanted to do with others was to make that therapy available to COVID patients really designed to prove that it was safe, not designed really to prove efficacy through a randomized clinical trial or controlled trial as you referenced.</p><p>So that was the study design. It certainly accomplished those aims and more. Really, we were anticipating 5,000 or so patients being transfused and treated. And now, as you mentioned, over 70,000 have been treated. And we know from the data that the treatment is safe.</p><p>It's more challenging to prove that the treatment is actually effective or efficacious. And so that's what has taken a little bit longer. But it's really because of the way the study was designed and it was designed with the urgency of the pandemic in mind.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And this is a crucial point, because whether it's a vaccine or a treatment, everybody wants to firstly save lives. The President also clearly wants to look like action is being taken and benefits are being had by those impacted here.</p><p>I'm going to put you on the spot here and say, was this announcement in your mind politicized?</p><p>MORICE: Well, I think it's confusing to people because the medical community as a whole is really trying to rise to the challenge of the pandemic, which has overwhelmed the globe. So here, I think what we wanted to do was strike a note of caution before we said that the therapy had effect on patients. We knew it was safe and effective for patients.</p><p>And so that took longer, but while we are confident and the F.D.A. is confident that they can issue EUA, because when we look back at those 70,000 patients, we can see there is a positive effect of the treatment.</p><p>[09:25:23]</p><p>MORICE: Of course, this announcement comes in the backdrop of election season and what has become more and more of a charged topic in general for society, for all the other effects of economic shutdown and social distancing and all those impacts those are having on our lives.</p><p>So it does come in a very charged background, but I don't know -- the decision itself was founded in science.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You believe it was?</p><p>MORICE: Yes, I do.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so maybe the best thing to do here is for the F.D.A. just to publish the data and say, look, this is what we based our decision on to try and cut through some of the noise and the fears here in the selective use of pieces of data. Perhaps that will be the answer.</p><p>MORICE: Yes, well, I think that it is -- the answer really is in good transparency from all of the decision makers and how the data is being used, and that is not to criticize, per se.</p><p>The other facet of this, to your point, is that -- all of these decision are of great economic and societal importance, and so they're really in the crucible of public scrutiny and so that's something that just the medical community, as well as the healthcare community and the global community is really not used to.</p><p>So I think that does lead to some confusion, but we'll work through that. I mean, that's really why it's important now that this has received the UEA that we help people understand why the process took as long as it did and what is the information behind it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Absolutely. I also want to ask you something else as well about testing. The recent ruling by the U.S. Health Department on tests not needing to go to the F.D.A., to the regulators first.</p><p>Again, there seems to be a conflict between the Health Department and the F.D.A. that the regulator here, which again goes to the point that we're discussing here, which people aren't all on the same page and we need them on the same page in order to foster trust, whether it's a treatment or an approach to tackling this virus.</p><p>MORICE: Well, at Mayo Clinic Labs, like many and all labs really, we are committed to providing patients the diagnostic testing that they need and we really appreciate clarity of guidance from the government and how they want us to approach doing that.</p><p>Clearly, the ability of laboratories to create tests for patient needs is an important facet of how we provide care. We appreciate the H.H.S. really recognizing that. But we'll continue to work at Mayo Clinic Labs and the lab community will continue to work with regulators to gain that clarity here going forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, but to sum up our conversation, because I do think it's really important that we've had this conversation at this moment, the Mayo Clinic believes that using convalescent plasma is safe, but the studies that you've done does not prove efficacy, but it's a safety thing we can be talking about here.</p><p>MORICE: Well, it is safe, and actually I do think that the data now analyzed does show a positive effect for patients as well. So we know it is efficacious as well.</p><p>It's taken longer to make that observation just because of the way the study was designed. The other challenge with this, Julia, is that the study was designed to give the patients who needed the therapy the therapy. Many of the hospitals giving that therapy were overwhelmed with patients.</p><p>So therefore, it took longer to get the information back in terms of how those patients have responded. So, it's really not even just the design, it's just the fact that the entire country was trying to manage the pandemic and those giving the therapies were in the cross hairs or in the crucible of the pandemic in managing patients.</p><p>So it's just taken a bit longer, but there is efficacy as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, it is so important to chat with you. Thank you so much, because you had very short notice on this interview, so great to have you with us, as always, and get your wisdom. Dr. Bill Morice there from the Mayo Clinic. Thank you.</p><p>MORICE: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, the opening bell, next.</p><p>[09:32:24]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. The U.S. stocks kicking off the new week with fresh gains. Stocks rallying across the board with the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ both at all-time highs.</p><p>Important to note here that as we watch stocks continuing to rise, U.S. Treasury yields have not been moving much higher, which you should expect in healthy markets. That is a sign, I think, that bond investors are perhaps not as enthusiastic about the economic rebound as stock investors are reacting less well to stimulus, let's be clear.</p><p>Record low long-term yields of course have helped fuel a strong recovery in the housing market, too. Cheap mortgage rates.</p><p>That said, CNN's new back-to-normal index shows the U.S. economy operating at only 78 percent of its full capacity as of August 19th. The states colored darker green are in a better state on an economic basis than other parts of the country.</p><p>Now, the sun may be setting on the peak holiday season here in the United States, but it's not been a summer that most hotel owners will remember fondly.</p><p>The American Hotel and Lodging Association says occupancy near outdoor vacation spots is around 50 percent compared with normal levels at this time of year, which would be around 90 percent.</p><p>They say the situation in cities is worse with little recovery in sight. As bills come due and bookings remain weak, many hoteliers are at risk of defaulting on their debts. The financial analyst, Trepp say repayment worries in in the sector were at an all-time high last month. Nearly one in four borrowers were at least a month late with payments. Industry leaders are calling on Congress to provide urgent help.</p><p>The CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, Chip Rogers joins us on the show. Chip, always great to have you with us. That's just painted a picture of an ongoing and incredibly challenging environment.</p><p>CHIP ROGERS, CEO, AMERICAN HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION: Yes, it is a bleak picture, indeed. We do hope that since everyone is now beginning to work remotely that in fact, we can maybe extend summer another month. The weather should be good. But even with that, we're facing significant headwinds here.</p><p>And as you pointed out, this debt problem is the largest of all because if you can't make your payments, ultimately you lose your business and everybody that works for you no longer has a job.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I want to go to the silver linings a bit first, actually, and then we'll talk about the debt situation which clearly is incredibly worrying.</p><p>Given that people are embarking on staycations or tending to stay within states and traveling less due to many of the state-by-state restrictions, to your point could we actually see people perhaps extending their vacations or staying longer or pushing that out back towards the end of the year as well? Might that provide some respite?</p><p>[09:35:10]</p><p>ROGERS: It will provide a little. In fact, we're already seeing some of those trends, and we are beginning to see people stay on Sunday nights into Monday, a lot more than we used to, because they don't have to necessarily get back to the office on Monday.</p><p>We're beginning to see people show up for their weekend vacations on Thursday as opposed to Friday. So some of that is helping.</p><p>This idea, of course, that you can work from anywhere is the key to that continuing on. And then, of course, children not necessarily going back to school all across the country helps as well.</p><p>So there are some bright signs out there, but in general the big problem is no business travel, no conventions and conferences and large meetings and that is what is really hurting the industry.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Chip, how many workers, to your point, have the hotels managed to bring back on average?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, we brought back a healthy percentage of them, and if you look at where we were back in February, the full employment was about 900,000 job openings. And then you go to about mid-July where we probably had four million people not working, maybe of those people not working, 20 percent to 25 percent have come back.</p><p>But the bottom line is this, as we look at our economy and you talked about the CNN Index there a minute ago, unemployment is a big part of that. We see that our economy back in January had a 3.5 percent unemployment rate, it's now at about 10.5 percent. In the hotel industry, it's over 40 percent and that's the big problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow, a 40 percent unemployment rate.</p><p>ROGERS: Yes. It's shocking.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That is completely shocking. I guess not unexpected, though. We know that you were on the front lines of hit initially and of course, going to be one of the last to recover because people have to get their confidence back and be willing to stay away from home.</p><p>Talk to me about foreclosure risk. If we're talking about such a high proportion of hotels being unable to pay their debts, how many of these could close permanently?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, as you mentioned a moment ago, Trepp has already indicated that we are at an all-time high with delinquency rates for commercial mortgage backed securities, which is about a third of all the hotels that are out there. The traditional lending will soon follow.</p><p>I mean, there was some flexibility as we began this pandemic back in March and April, but banks can only offer flexibility for so long. So we're already beginning to see some of the foreclosures. It could mount into the thousands of hotels by the end of the year, if in fact nothing is done.</p><p>And the sad thing is with the Main Street Lending Act, which has frankly not been used at all and has been a failure up to this point, the money is there if they would simply change the rules and allow these commercial mortgage loans to get access to it. It's a sad situation because we know the money is appropriated.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And therein lies the key. The money is there, it's just about access. Chip, what needs to change?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, under the current rules, if you want to go get a Main Street lending loan, which is very low interest, long-term loan that can help you survive this, you can't really have any debt.</p><p>Well, if you have a commercial mortgage, if you're in an office building or a large hotel, you're going to have debt because that's your business and you have this large structure on a really prime piece of property.</p><p>And so, if they would change the rules like traditional lending rules that allow debt all the time on these structures, then hotels and commercial office buildings, they could gain access to this Main Street lending. They would pay the money back. It would work out great and it would save thousands of hotels, and possibly hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we were talking about this on the show last week, about a potential real estate crisis or a brewing challenge for this sector in particular, and you're pointing to one of the pivotal elements here and changes do need to be made.</p><p>Chip, have you had any response, very quickly? You're clearly saying that this is the help we need.</p><p>ROGERS: We have. In fact, we've asked Treasury again and again and again to help out. We believe they're looking at it. But even better than that, Congress has introduced legislation, a bipartisan bill called the Hope Act that would do exactly what the commercial mortgage borrowers need right now, this lifeline to gain access to funds just to pay their bills.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, well, we'll keep fingers crossed. Chip, great to have you on the show, as always.</p><p>ROGERS: Thank you so much.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Chip Rogers, the CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Great to have you with us.</p><p>All right, coming up on FIRST MOVE, as the Republican National Convention kicks off, President Trump's senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway announcing she will leave the White House, a potential impact on the Trump campaign and a preview of this week's R.N.C. straight ahead.</p><p>[09:42:40]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Last week, it was the Democrats, this week it's the Republicans. We're on day one of the Republican National Convention.</p><p>President Trump expected to make an appearance every night of the event this week. His formal acceptance speech is scheduled for Thursday.</p><p>Republican strategist and CNN political commentator, Doug Heye joins us now. Doug, fantastic to have you on the show. What can we expect from Republicans this week and what does success look like for President Trump?</p><p>DOUG HEYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think you've outlaid it already of what we can expect. We are going to expect a lot of Donald Trump. We are going to expect a lot of his family.</p><p>I was surprised, having worked on the setup for the 2012 convention, and this was one being in my old hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, on what we would see from speakers and so forth. It is very heavy-laden with Trump loyalists. Now, that's not a surprise, it's true with the Democrats as well.</p><p>But this is just doubling down on the base in every way possible, the opposite of the Democrats which tried to get really bipartisan popular Americans to address the audience so they could reach out to new voters.</p><p>I looked at the roster from the R.N.C. this time and it was a bit like looking at the schedule for Glastonbury and realizing there's not a single band that anybody wants to see.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What an analogy. You've pointed out the laser-like focus on the base here, but you know, if I look at the need to break through with things like college-educated women, for example, he's got to make the party himself look reasonably moderate this week, surely. Is any of that possible given tour Glastonbury style lineup?</p><p>HEYE: No, I don't think it is, and in part that's because it's just been announced this morning that there really is no Republican platform this time. They're not really codifying any policies or ideals other than everything being Trump-centric.</p><p>So you know, you talk about college-educated women. They're not talking about real issues that are going to affect them, they're not talking about higher education, which is a real issue right now in the country as we're dealing with remote learning in the country, it's like two view we are struggling with.</p><p>We're not talking about the other end of education, childcare, where childcare where America is saying that there is no economic recovery if we don't have childcare.</p><p>And you can go on a whole litany of issues where the Republican Party just don't have an organizing document on that, which traditionally they do every four years, as do the Democrats.</p><p>[09:45:08]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Doug, his job approval rating is under water by what -- 10 percentage points plus. It's hard to win another term surely if the majority of people already think you're doing a bad job, unless you can paint a picture of the alternative doing a worse job than you're doing.</p><p>Can he do that for a future President Biden, for the Democratic Party? Surely, he will try.</p><p>HEYE: He'll try, but it's complicated. And it is complicated for two reasons. One, if you look at a lot of the rhetoric that's coming from the President and his campaign right now, they're talking about violence in the streets and what it would look like under Joe Biden's America. The challenge there is we're in Donald Trump's America and that's happening right now.</p><p>The other challenge is -- you know, which we haven't talked about is the biggest issue in the country and really the world right now with COVID.</p><p>Donald trump now under his watch, 170,000 plus deaths, an economy as you just highlighted where no one is staying in hotels, nobody is taking flights. I haven't stayed in a hotel for six months for that matter.</p><p>And so he is not really addressing those issues, where Joe Biden can talk about tweeting last year that the United States is not ready at all for a pandemic, the administration isn't ready for this.</p><p>So it's very hard for Trump to be able to credibly bring Biden down. Maybe the best person to bring Biden down would be Joe Biden and it's why those three debates are going to be so much massively more important than even what we saw when it was Trump versus Clinton.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it is such an important point, and I think the tone from the Democrats was somber and frightening and it's tough to be an optimist if you bring it back to the pandemic, unfortunately.</p><p>I do want to talk about something on a bit of a tangent, but incredibly important and I think bewildering for an international audience, it is the focus that we have seen on the Post Office. The importance of being able in mail in the votes in this election and the under-funding.</p><p>I was looking at some of the numbers. The Post Office lost $83 billion since 2006, which is one issue. But how concerned should we be about fraud? Because the President argues it's a huge issue.</p><p>HEYE: Well, we shouldn't be worried about the issue of fraud. We should be worried about what's happening with the Post Office, full disclosure, I expected a package from the Post Office yesterday and it still hasn't arrived, and in this context, I am a little nervous about it.</p><p>But I have right here, Julia, a mail that was sent to me this weekend and says, \"Urgent Notice. Securely and safely request your absentee ballot.\" It is from the North Carolina Republican Party.</p><p>Now, one of two things has happened with that. Either they're sending that to somebody who hasn't been registered to vote in North Carolina, me since 2004, or this was meant for my deceased father who died just after the election in 2016, and the challenge with that is not only are they potentially asking somebody to vote who can't vote, but the last time I had dinner with my father before he passed away, he said that he was voting for Trump, but he sure wished Joe Biden was running so that he could vote for Joe Biden.</p><p>And I bet there are a lot more independent North Carolina voters and voters in other states who feel that same way.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just to be clear, Doug, and we're sorry for the loss of your father, could somebody fill in that form and send it back then?</p><p>HEYE: It's possible. Honestly, I haven't opened this. But voter fraud is something that, yes, it exists, but it's been really blown up as an issue in a way that is now an existential fear for especially Republicans, when it just doesn't really work out that way.</p><p>It is a concern, but it's always been a minor concern and I think that's where it should be with some time, some effect in local races, but nationally has not been a real concern, frankly, since 1960.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. Always great to have you on the show. I'm just trying to think, to sum up, we've been to Glastonbury, we have talked about potential voter fraud.</p><p>He hired, I believe, people that he worked with on \"The Apprentice\" to produce the R.N.C. this week. So more reality show, I guess is what we have to look ahead to.</p><p>Is he frozen? Can you hear me? I don't know. Doug, great to have you with us.</p><p>HEYE: I agree with you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: He was waiting for the punchline. It wasn't coming. Doug Heye, great to have you with us, Republican strategist and CNN political commentator.</p><p>HEYE: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you for that.</p><p>All right, the U.S. Postmaster General back in the hot seat on Capitol Hill, as we were discussing, this time testifying before a Democratic-led House Committee where he is likely to face a much different reception.</p><p>We'll have a live report straight ahead.</p><p>[19:51:38]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. U.S. Democrats want to know why the Postmaster General isn't reversing changes he made at the Postal Service that they say could sabotage the presidential election.</p><p>In around an hour, Louis DeJoy will testify before a Democratic-led House panel. He is expected to face questions on widespread mail delays that have been reported since he took over in June.</p><p>On Friday, DeJoy assured a Republican-led committee that mail-in ballots will be counted in time for the election. A day later, House Democrats held a rare session to approve legislation that would suspend the changes DeJoy has put in place and provide the Post Office with a $25 billion boost.</p><p>CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now from Washington. Kristen, great to have you with us. The tone likely to be very different today. What can we expect?</p><p>KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Julia. First of all, I just want to note quickly on the $25 billion for USPS that was voted on by the House. That is likely to not go anywhere.</p><p>The White House has already issued a veto threat and the Senate is not expected to take it up, and the reason why that is interesting is because it was not a partisan bill. There were dozens of Republicans who signed on for that.</p><p>And right now, given the current climate, that's actually pretty bipartisan for Washington. So something to note there as they continue to hash out this funding for the Postal Service.</p><p>But as you said, it is expected to be a completely different vibe today. We are talking about a Democratic-led House Committee. It is expected to be a more hostile reception. And remember, it was just last week that 90 of these House Democrats were actually calling for the removal of DeJoy as Postmaster General.</p><p>And you started to outline this, what exactly it is that House Democrats want to know about. They want to know about those changes in detail. How exactly did DeJoy arrive at them, cutting overtime, cutting Post Office hours, and the removal of those high-volume sorting machines?</p><p>They want to know why they're not all being reversed. Of course, we know DeJoy had suspended those changes ahead of the election, but he also said in Friday's testimony that any of these machines that have been unplugged or disconnected would not be reconnected because it's not needed.</p><p>So Democrats are going to have questions about that, particularly as we head into this election where millions of Americans, many of them for the first time, are expected to vote by mail.</p><p>The other big topic is Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin. CNN has reported that the Board of Governors actually briefed Mnuchin before the appointment of DeJoy and we are told by sources this is not a normal procedure.</p><p>We also heard from a former Board of Governors member who resigned because of Mnuchin's involvement. He was worried that the Trump administration was trying to politicize the Postal Service. So that is likely to come up today.</p><p>And Julia, we should note that the Postmaster General has said time and time again that the Postal Service is absolutely ready for this influx of mail-in ballots come November.</p><p>But when they talk about the numbers, when they walk through them, they try to reassure the American public, they say things like -- and this is a tweet from the Postal Service, that if all Americans vote by mail this year, 330 million ballots over the course of the election will be only 75 percent of what we deliver in a single day.</p><p>But Julia, as we noted, we're here because what they're delivering in a single day has been extremely delayed.</p><p>[09:55:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, extremely delayed, understatement, I think. Kristen Holmes, it's going to be an interesting morning. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>Now, 2020 has given us things that will be forever defined by this year, the pandemic, murder hornets -- remember those -- and yes, even mystery cubes found in the English City of Coventry.</p><p>Well now, we have something new. Watch it if you can bear it.</p><p>This was during a baseball game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Oakland A's, and even though the shot was unintentional, oh, the poor bear. It feels like something very cruel after everything this year.</p><p>Giant cutouts or stuffed toys are sometimes used at big events to make the seats look full. No word yet on how the bear is doing, but we do know they are the strong and silent type. I think the bear is fine, but, ouch.</p><p>All right, that's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. I'm Julia Chatterley. Stay safe. We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

This year's theme wasActive Intelligenceand at the conference hall held at the Shanghai World Expo and Convention Center we saw demonstrated 'smart' technologies ranging from smart city applications, smart education, smart transportation, smart everything One of the most impressive technology demonstrations was an AI that was able to translate Chinese to English and vis versa, faster and more accurately than the best human translators. This is just the start. Huawei is build an AI ecosystem of partners that is targeted to exceed1 million developers alone over the next 3 years[2]. In my latest bookBank 4.0:Banking Everywhere never at a Bank[3], I discussed the magnitude of China's fintech revolution and how it's leaving the US banks in the dust. </p><p>This year Ant Financial and Tencent will preside over more than $22 Trillion in mobile payments - representing 98% of the lucrative Chinese mobile payments market. To put that in perspective, that's more than the entire world's debit card and credit payments volume this year - Visa managed just$2 Trillion in Q2 of 2018[4]. China's mobile payments market is more than 4x the size of Visa's global transaction market as of today. There are 4,000 P2P lenders in China, and while arecent regulatory crack down[5]resulted in numerous defaults and a sizable shrinking of the sector, P2P lending already accounted for US$192 Billion in lending in 2017 (seeBloomberg[6]). While still only 2% of the retail lending market, it represents around 25% of the unsecured personal lending market in China. A serious foothold.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huawei.com/en/press-events/events/huaweiconnect2018/video-list/techtalk/201810101917\">http://www.huawei.com/en/press-events/events/huaweiconnect2018/video-list/techtalk/201810101917</url>Huawei Connect Live - Fintech in China and the emergence of #Bank4.0But the serious action is happening in transactional banking. This is where the US should take particular note because it signals that the threat from the likes of Amazon and larger Fintech's is still seriously under estimated. The world's most successful deposit product sits in Alibaba's sister company, Ant Financial's wheelhouse.Yu'e Bao[7]has generated more than $300Bn in consumer-level deposits in just a few small years. The nearest competitor to this in the US is JP Morgan's US Treasury Bond Fund which is less than half the size. This all without a single human financial advisor, paper-based application form or branch distribution channel whatsoever. The largest challenger bank in China was founded by Tencent, calledWeBank[8]. Today, WeBank has more retail customers than JP Morgan Chase has in the United States. WeBank, based in Shenzhen, has a real-time blockchain core, can monitor marketing campaigns, transactions, applications, cyber security threats and everything else operationally in real-time with an impressive control centre in the heart of SZ. With more than 80 million retail customers, this 3 year old bank is a phenomenal player in the Chinese ecosystem today, with no sign of slowing in its J-curve growth path. Just think about that. The biggest deposit product in the world is completely digital and 2x the size of the nearest major in the US. The largest fintech bank in China has more customers than JP Morgan Chase. The mobile payments business in China is larger than the world's entire plastic card market. Yup... This success in deposit taking and lending for fintechs and 'BATX' Big tech in China, has shocked the incumbents into action. Today 4 of the top 5 retail banks have deployed blockchain core systems for core retail activity. All of them now offer their suite of retail products via mobile; an innovation forced on them by the likes of Ant and Tencent. AI investment in the top 10 Chinese banks dwarves that of the entire US banking sector. The risk of fintech and tech disrupting China is very real with more than 40% of deposits now moving outside of the mainstream banking sector. None of the top 50 banks in the US has a blockchain core, and only a fraction of them can onboard customers on a mobile phone. With the regulatory mire in the US we see barely any support for Fintech investment writ large and current regulatory posture is aggressive positioned against digital only banks, along with the current administration's lack of clear policy in respect to Artificial Intelligence, the push back against H1-B visas and the broad lack of STEM investment in education - this is one Chinese Dragon the US has no hope of catching. The US could conceivably catch up, but they are likely already 7-10 years behind. It would take a miracle...

AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein[1]  Jeremy Straub[2], North Dakota State University[3] The Trump administration's recently announced[4] bans on Chinese-owned social media platforms TikTok[5] and WeChat[6] could have unintended consequences. The orders[7] bar[8] the apps from doing business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons or businesses after Sept. 20 and require divestiture[9] of TikTok by Nov. </p><p>12. The executive orders are based on national security grounds, though the threats cited are to citizens rather than the government. Foreign policy analysts see the move as part of the administration's ongoing wrestling match[10] with the Chinese government for leverage in the global economy. Whatever the motivation, as someone who researches both cybersecurity[11] and technology policy[12], I am not convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs. The bans threaten Americans' freedom of speech, and may harm foreign investment[13] in the U.S. and American companies' ability to sell software abroad, while delivering minimal privacy and cybersecurity benefits. National security threat? The threats posed by TikTok and WeChat, according to the executive[14] orders[15], include the potential for the platforms to be used for disinformation campaigns by the Chinese government and to give the Chinese government access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.   TikTok is an immensely popular social media platform that allows people to share short video clips. Aaron Yoo/Flickr[16], CC BY-NC-SA[17]  The U.S. is not the only country concerned about Chinese apps. The Australian military accused WeChat[18], a messaging, social media and mobile payment app, of acting as spyware, saying the app was caught sending data to Chinese Intelligence servers. Disinformation campaigns may be of particular concern, due to the upcoming election and the impact of the alleged 'sweeping and systematic' Russian interference[19] in the 2016 elections. The potential for espionage[20] is less pronounced, given that the apps access basic contact information and details about the videos Americans watch and the topics they search on, and not more sensitive data. But banning the apps and requiring Chinese divestiture[21] also has a national security downside. It damages the U.S.'s moral authority[22] to push for free speech and democracy abroad. Critics have frequently contended that America's moral authority[23] has been severely damaged[24] during the Trump administration[25] and this action could arguably add to the decline. Protecting personal information The administration's principal argument against TikTok is that it collects Americans' personal data and could provide it to the Chinese government. The executive order states that this could allow China[26] to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage. Skeptics have argued that the government hasn't presented clear evidence[27] of privacy issues and that the service's practices are standard in the industry[28]. TikTok's terms of service do say that it can share information[29] with its China-based corporate parent, ByteDance.   WeChat is a messaging, social media and mobile payment app that is nearly ubiquitous in China. Albert Hsieh/Flickr[30], CC BY-NC[31]  The order against WeChat[32] is similar. It also mentions that the app captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States. However, some of these visiting Chinese nationals have expressed concern that banning WeChat may limit their ability to communicate[33] with friends and family in China. While TikTok[34] and WeChat[35] do raise cybersecurity concerns, they are not significantly different from those raised by other smart phone apps. In my view, these concerns could be better addressed by enacting national privacy legislation[36], similar to Europe's GDPR[37] and California's CCPA[38], to dictate how data is collected and used and where it is stored. Another remedy is to have Google, Apple and others review the apps for cybersecurity concerns before allowing new versions to be made available in their app stores. Freedom of speech Perhaps the greatest concern raised by the bans are their impact on people's ability to communicate, and whether they violate the First Amendment[39]. Both TikTok and WeChat are communications channels and TikTok publishes and hosts content. While the courts have allowed some regulation of speech, to withstand a legal challenge the restrictions must advance a legitimate government interest and be 'narrowly tailored'[40] to do so. National security is a legitimate governmental interest. However, in my opinion it's questionable whether a real national security concern exists[41] with these specific apps. In the case of TikTok, banning an app that is being used for political commentary[42] and activism[43] would raise pronounced constitutional claims and likely be overturned by the courts. Whether the bans hold up in court[44], the executive orders instituting them put the U.S. in uncomfortable territory: the list of countries that have banned social media platforms. These include Egypt[45], Hong Kong[46], Turkey[47], Turkmenistan[48], North Korea[49], Iran[50], Belarus[51], Russia[52] and China[53]. Though the U.S. bans may not be aimed at curtailing dissent, they echo actions that harm free speech and democracy globally. Social media gives freedom fighters, protesters and dissidents all over the world a voice. It enables citizens to voice concerns and organize protests[54] about monarchies[55], sexual[56] and other human rights abuses[57], discriminatory laws[58] and civil rights[59] violations. When authoritarian[60] governments clamp down on dissent, they frequently target[61] social media[62]. Risk of retaliation The bans could also harm the U.S. economy because other countries could ban U.S. companies in retaliation. China and the U.S. have already gone through a cycle of reciprocal company banning[63], in addition to reciprocal consulate closures[64]. The U.S. has placed[65] Chinese telecom firm Huawei on the Bureau of Industry Security Entity List[66], preventing U.S. firms from conducting business with it. While this has prevented Huawei from selling wireless hardware[67] in the U.S., it has also prevented U.S. software sales to the telecom giant[68] and caused it to use its own chips instead of buying them from U.S. firms[69]. Over a dozen U.S. companies urged the White House[70] not to ban WeChat because it would hurt their business in China. Other countries might use the U.S. bans of Chinese firms as justification for banning U.S. companies, even though the U.S. has not taken action against them or their companies directly. These trade restrictions harm the U.S.'s moral authority[71], harm the global economy[72] and stifle innovation[73]. They also cut U.S. firms off from the high-growth Chinese market[74]. TikTok is in negotiations with Microsoft and Walmart and an Oracle-led consortium about a possible acquisition[75] that would leave the company with American ownership and negate the ban. Oversight, not banishment Though the TikTok and WeChat apps do raise some concerns, it is not apparent that cause exists to ban them. The issues could be solved through better oversight and the enactment of privacy laws that could otherwise benefit Americans. Of course, the government could have other causes for concern that it hasn't yet made public. Given the consequences of banning an avenue of expression, if other concerns exist the government should share them with the American public. If not, I'd argue less drastic action would be more appropriate and better serve the American people.

The orders[4] bar[5] the apps from doing business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons or businesses after Sept. 20 and require divestiture[6] of TikTok by Nov 12. The executive orders are based on national security grounds, though the threats cited are to citizens rather than the government. Foreign policy analysts see the move as part of the administration's ongoing wrestling match[7] with the Chinese government for leverage in the global economy. </p><p>Whatever the motivation, as someone who researches both cybersecurity[8] and technology policy[9], I am not convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs. The bans threaten Americans' freedom of speech, and may harm foreign investment[10] in the U.S. and American companies' ability to sell software abroad, while delivering minimal privacy and cybersecurity benefits.National security threat?The threats posed by TikTok and WeChat, according to the executive[11] orders[12], include the potential for the platforms to be used for disinformation campaigns by the Chinese government and to give the Chinese government access to Americans' personal and proprietary information. Disinformation campaigns may be of particular concern, due to the upcoming election and the impact of the alleged 'sweeping and systematic' Russian interference[13] in the 2016 elections. The potential for espionage[14] is less pronounced, given that the apps access basic contact information and details about the videos Americans watch and the topics they search on, and not more sensitive data.The U.S. is not the only country concerned about Chinese apps. The Australian military accused WeChat[15], a messaging, social media and mobile payment app, of acting as spyware, saying the app was caught sending data to Chinese Intelligence servers. But banning the apps and requiring Chinese divestiture[16] also has a national security downside. It damages the U.S.'s moral authority[17] to push for free speech and democracy abroad. Critics have frequently contended that America's moral authority[18] has been severely damaged[19] during the Trump administration[20] and this action could arguably add to the decline.Protecting personal informationThe administration's principal argument against TikTok is that it collects Americans' personal data and could provide it to the Chinese government. The executive order states that this could allow China[21] to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage. Skeptics have argued that the government hasn't presented clear evidence[22] of privacy issues and that the service's practices are standard in the industry[23]. TikTok's terms of service do say that it can share information[24] with its China-based corporate parent, ByteDance. The order against WeChat[25] is similar. It also mentions that the app captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States. However, some of these visiting Chinese nationals have expressed concern that banning WeChat may limit their ability to communicate[26] with friends and family in China. While TikTok[27] and WeChat[28] do raise cybersecurity concerns, they are not significantly different from those raised by other smart phone apps. In my view, these concerns could be better addressed by enacting national privacy legislation[29], similar to Europe's GDPR[30] and California's CCPA[31], to dictate how data is collected and used and where it is stored. Another remedy is to have Google, Apple and others review the apps for cybersecurity concerns before allowing new versions to be made available in their app stores.Freedom of speechPerhaps the greatest concern raised by the bans are their impact on people's ability to communicate, and whether they violate the First Amendment[32]. Both TikTok and WeChat are communications channels and TikTok publishes and hosts content. While the courts have allowed some regulation of speech, to withstand a legal challenge the restrictions must advance a legitimate government interest and be 'narrowly tailored'[33] to do so. National security is a legitimate governmental interest. However, in my opinion it's questionable whether a real national security concern exists[34] with these specific apps. In the case of TikTok, banning an app that is being used for political commentary[35] and activism[36] would raise pronounced constitutional claims and likely be overturned by the courts. Whether the bans hold up in court[37], the executive orders instituting them put the U.S. in uncomfortable territory: the list of countries that have banned social media platforms. These include Egypt[38], Hong Kong[39], Turkey[40], Turkmenistan[41], North Korea[42], Iran[43], Belarus[44], Russia[45] and China[46]. Though the U.S. bans may not be aimed at curtailing dissent, they echo actions that harm free speech and democracy globally. Social media gives freedom fighters, protesters and dissidents all over the world a voice. It enables citizens to voice concerns and organize protests[47] about monarchies[48], sexual[49] and other human rights abuses[50], discriminatory laws[51] and civil rights[52] violations. When authoritarian[53] governments clamp down on dissent, they frequently target[54] social media[55].Risk of retaliationThe bans could also harm the U.S. economy because other countries could ban U.S. companies in retaliation. China and the U.S. have already gone through a cycle of reciprocal company banning[56], in addition to reciprocal consulate closures[57]. The U.S. has placed[58] Chinese telecom firm Huawei on the Bureau of Industry Security Entity List[59], preventing U.S. firms from conducting business with it. While this has prevented Huawei from selling wireless hardware[60] in the U.S., it has also prevented U.S. software sales to the telecom giant[61] and caused it to use its own chips instead of buying them from U.S. firms[62]. Over a dozen U.S. companies urged the White House[63] not to ban WeChat because it would hurt their business in China. Other countries might use the U.S. bans of Chinese firms as justification for banning U.S. companies, even though the U.S. has not taken action against them or their companies directly. These trade restrictions harm the U.S.'s moral authority[64], harm the global economy[65] and stifle innovation[66]. They also cut U.S. firms off from the high-growth Chinese market[67]. TikTok is in negotiations with Microsoft and Walmart and an Oracle-led consortium about a possible acquisition[68] that would leave the company with American ownership and negate the ban.Oversight, not banishmentThough the TikTok and WeChat apps do raise some concerns, it is not apparent that cause exists to ban them. The issues could be solved through better oversight and the enactment of privacy laws that could otherwise benefit Americans. Of course, the government could have other causes for concern that it hasn't yet made public. Given the consequences of banning an avenue of expression, if other concerns exist the government should share them with the American public. If not, I'd argue less drastic action would be more appropriate and better serve the American people.

As Prime Minister Scott Morrison defined it: \"If you have a go, you get a go.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But analysts suggest both nations are increasingly less encouraging of competition, and that from supermarkets to social media to transport, monopolistic capitalism is on the rise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big is better - the Aussie way</p><p>ANU economist Adam Triggs says Australia is now riddled with non-competitive markets.</p><p>He and colleague Andrew Leigh surveyed concentration levels in 481 industries and <url normalizedValue=\"https://adamtriggs.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/aere12185.pdf\">found most sectors are now dominated by a small number of firms</url>.</p><p>\"Australia does seem to have a particular problem in this area,\" he<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/futuretense/one-big-game-of-monopoly/12575738\">tells ABC RN's Future Tense</url>.</p><p>\"When we looked across the economy, and collected data on every single industry, we found that more than half of Australia's markets are concentrated. That means the four biggest players control at least a third of the market.\"</p><p>Those concentration levels jump to 80 per cent in sectors like banking, supermarkets, internet service providers and health insurance.</p><p>That could explain why the World Economic Forum scores Australia low on the effectiveness of its anti-monopoly policies.</p><p>Dr Triggs warns that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to make matters worse.</p><p>\"It's very hard to think that it's going to have any effect other than a negative one,\" he says.</p><p>\"When you look at the businesses who are getting a lot of government support, they tend to be larger businesses.</p><p>\"And businesses that are larger tend to have bigger buffers. They can get assistance from the debt markets, for example, or they can issue equity.\"</p><p>Dr Triggs's research indicates high market concentration eventually leads to an increase in income inequality, as wealth is transferred from the poor to the rich.</p><p>\"It drives up savings and reduces aggregate demand in the economy, which is a reason that we see rising inequality, but also very weak inflation and very weak interest rates.\"</p><p>That view is supported by a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020057pap.pdf\">paper prepared for the US Federal Reserve Board</url>, which also found a heightened risk of financial instability and increased household debt as a result of corporate market power.</p><p>Rethinking privatisation</p><p>Late last year the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, issued a warning that key infrastructure points, such as airports and port facilities, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/the-dangers-of-monopolists-without-constraint\">were becoming monopolistic</url>.</p><p>\"It is bad for the economy when bottleneck infrastructure, at the end of a crucial value chain, is in the hands of a company with unfettered market power,\" he said, calling for legislative reform to encourage greater competition.</p><p>\"A monopolist that controls this type of bottleneck infrastructure, operating without any regulation, has a clear incentive to maximise profits by raising prices, even if this means reduced volumes or less of their service.\"</p><p>But University of Queensland economist John Quiggin argues increased competition isn't the answer to all market dominance issues.</p><p>Many large infrastructure facilities, he points out, were once publicly owned and only became profit-driven monopolies after being sold to the private sector. Prior to that, they operated to serve the public good.</p><p>What we understand by \"competition\", he says, got skewed in the era of \"small government\" and the rush to privatise government assets.</p><p>\"We have to go back to the 1980s and the emergence of a view, embodied in national competition policy, that the real problem wasn't monopoly and exploitation by firms, it was governments doing anti-competitive things,\" he says.</p><p>\"National competition policy really relaxed controls on things like mergers while pretty much constraining the public sector from competing 'unfairly', as it was seen, with corporations.\"</p><p>That change in thinking, Professor Quiggin argues, coincided with a rise in the belief that competition in sectors like electricity, aviation and telecommunications would axiomatically produce better outcomes and cheaper prices for consumers.</p><p>\"In fact, what we've seen is that that competition hasn't really emerged in the way that was hoped,\" he says.</p><p>\"We don't really have the market to support more than a couple of airlines, for example. The market is so small, it's hard to support a large number of competitors.</p><p>\"If we look at electricity, the hope was that competition and choice would produce great outcomes. Clearly that didn't happen.\"</p><p>He says we now have to consider \"whether we want to reverse the shift towards privatisation\".</p><p>\"We have to accept that although, in some respects, we can promote competition as an alternative for a monopoly, the idea that those are the only choices available to us is just out of date.\"</p><p>Big is better - the American way</p><p>Market concentration is also increasingly a feature of American economic and political debate.</p><p>But there, the overwhelming focus of public concern has been on the rise of the US tech titans.</p><p>In the late 1890s and into the early part of the 20th century, American politicians famously used what became known as \"anti-trust\" legislation to break up transport and energy monopolies and promote competition.</p><p>The word \"trust\" referred to firms that colluded to control prices and exert dominance.</p><p>But from the latter part of the 20th century, the effectiveness of anti-trust action has been called into question.</p><p>In July this year, the heads of four of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the US - Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company - were called before a Congressional hearing in Washington.</p><p>It followed a familiar path: there were accusations of anti-competitive behaviour, there were denials, and then the Washington circus folded its tent.</p><p>However, anti-trust campaigner Hal Singer is largely upbeat about the result.</p><p>He says the hearings achieved rare bipartisan scrutiny of the digital giants, and unearthed evidence of possible anti-competitive motivations in their dealings with app developers, content providers and independent rivals.</p><p>\"The final takeaway is that it's crystalised what the damage is - they were trying to snuff-out competition in its nascent form,\" he says.</p><p>A problem of definition</p><p>Economist Ryan Bourne says one of the difficulties in bringing an anti-competitive charge against the major digital players is that it's hard to define the exact market they're accused of dominating - or even who they are competing against.</p><p>Does Facebook, for example, compete in a social networking market, or in a digital advertising market?</p><p>\"When you consider who their 'paying customers' are you are probably best placed saying that Facebook and Google operate in the digital advertising market,\" Mr Bourne says.</p><p>\"And, in that sense, it's clear that they are not engaging in anything harmful to consumers. Digital advertising costs have fallen by 40 per cent over the last decade.\"</p><p>An emphasis on consumer welfare has been the traditional way US regulators have judged whether a large company should be allowed to dominate a market.</p><p>But Professor Singer says that approach no longer has relevance in a digital environment where consumers aren't directly charged for using a service.</p><p>\"The problem here, and what the platforms have figured out as kind of an end-run around the anti-trust law, is that they are not exercising their power vis-a-vis consumers in a traditional sense of price-gouging,\" he says.</p><p>\"You can see that their money, and certainly their profits, are not coming from gouging consumers, but rather from squeezing input providers.</p><p>\"That is the success of this business model.

Despite strong U.S. support for a free and open Internet, many worry that the December\u00a0 event\u00a0is just the beginning of an ongoing effort by the ITU to expand its power and regulate the Web on a global scale.</p><p> In his\u00a0 opening statement before the hearing, Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) hit the right tone when he noted that, \u201cGovernments\u2019 traditional hands-off approach has enabled the Internet to grow at an astonishing pace and become perhaps the most powerful engine of social and economic freedom and job creation our world has ever known.\u201d</p><p> Americans understand that the Internet brings innovative products to market, lowers communication barriers, serves as a source for investment and entrepreneurship and promotes free expression. Sadly, some foreign governments see an open and free Internet as a threat. In fact, 89 nations signed an ITU treaty to give greater government control over cyber security and spam. The nations included\u00a0Russia, Cambodia, Iran, China, Cuba, Egypt and Angola, none of which are known for promoting the open exchange of ideas. Their efforts, if successful, would close the door on freedom for millions around the world.</p><p> The treaty\u00a0 would grant\u00a0the ITU policing powers to legitimize government inspections over Internet communications and to decide what should be censored. More broadly, government regulations could mean\u00a0increased amounts of politicized engineering and a decrease in Internet growth. Entrepreneurs may be forced to seek bureaucratic permission to innovate and invest via the Web. This should be an eye-opener for nations that, like America, thrive on an open and unregulated Web.</p><p> Since the World Conference on International Telecommunication convened in Dubai, many have lashed out at the ITU, expressing their support for defunding the agency;\u00a0 Defundtheitu.org \u00a0is a website dedicated to this effort. Supporters have also started a\u00a0 petition on the White House\u2019s Web site. Many of America\u2019s free-market allies, including Germany, France, Spain and Finland, along with successful tech companies, have already\u00a0 taken steps to de-fund the ITU.</p><p> But the ITU\u2019s actions aren\u2019t the only ones that should raise concern. The U.S. is susceptible too, as we saw last year when lawmakers attempted to\u00a0 pass the\u00a0Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA). Supporters of Internet freedom acted overwhelmingly to stop SOPA and PIPA, and it\u2019s time for them to act again. Big tech industry names like\u00a0 Google and Verizon\u00a0are urging U.S. leaders to defend Internet freedom. As we saw with SOPA and PIPA, this is the time for all to get involved. You can\u00a0 contact\u00a0your member of Congress or\u00a0 tell your lawmaker\u00a0to support U.S. policy efforts to promote an uncensored Internet.</p><p> As the world\u2019s technology leader, the U.S. must lead the way in preserving a free and open Internet. The Internet is the lifeblood of our economy and helps individuals create businesses, trade goods and services, access low-cost banking resources, facilitate open communication and more. America must provide the example and walk the walk \u2013 not just talk \u2013 about preserving Internet freedom.</p><p> I commend the Energy and Commerce Committee for\u00a0 its recent hearing\u00a0reinforcing America\u2019s commitment to keeping the Internet open and free from government censorship and interference. I look forward to seeing Congress act to protect and promote a global Internet free from government control.</p><p> Image courtesy of iStockphoto, drnadig</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-1718007xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MSHNWS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57WR-6DM1-F0NV-F3T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Huawei has repeatedly denied that it spies for China.</p><p>Specifically officials said Huawei has built equipment that allows it to tap into telecoms using interfaces intended only designed for law enforcement without alerting the carriers. \"Huawei does not disclose this covert access to its local customers, or the host nation national-security agencies,\" the Journal cited a senior US official as saying.</p><p>Officials were non-specific about whether they've observed Huawei exploiting this access, and didn't give technical details other than to say they'd first spotted it in 2009 on 4G equipment.</p><p>Huawei was not immediately available for comment on the Journal's report when contacted by Business Insider, but a spokesperson told the Journal:</p><p>\"We emphatically reject these latest allegations.

Apple refused on the basis that its encryption means it doesn't have access to customers' passwords, and building any security flaw which would allow the FBI to break in by other means would mean weakening its security overall.</p><p>The case led to a huge standoff between Apple and the government, which Apple eventually won when the FBI announced it had found a third party to unlock the iPhone and dropped the case.

Introducing backdoors weakens the Internet for everyone, and leaves it so much more vulnerable to everyone from cybercrime rings to authoritarian regimes,\" he said.</p><p>The US government's allegation that Huawei has exploited a similar mechanism in telecoms equipment would lend weight to this argument.</p><p>Veale added that governments should invest in investigative powers that use the vast amount of internet data that isn't encrypted.</p><p>\"The world isn't 'going dark' to law enforcement because of encryption; law enforcement are going blind to the huge amount of unencrypted data that is available to help investigations. It does not follow that because criminals, like all of us, now communicate online, catching them should become as simple as a web search. If anything, this new encryption debate highlights the greediness, laziness, and cost-cutting desires of national governments, and their willingness to throw fundamental rights and economic trust under a bus in search of a shortcut to avoid investing in proper investigative capacity.\"</p><p>NOW WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-it-takes-to-be-an-nfl-referee-football-sunday-roger-goodell-tom-brady-2018-9?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">What it takes to be an NFL referee, according to an official who spent 19 seasons in the league</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Also:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-slams-witch-hunt-against-huawei-involvement-uk-5g-networks-2020-2?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">China says Huawei is the victim of a 'witch hunt' as it warns European countries not to freeze the company out of their 5G networks</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facial-recognition-fooled-with-mask-kneron-tests-2019-12?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">All it takes to fool facial recognition at airports and border crossings is a printed mask, researchers found</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/foxconn-face-mask-production-coronavirus-2020-2?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">iPhone maker Foxconn is warning workers in Shenzhen to stay home as it diverts production to face masks amid coronavirus outbreak</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO:\u00a0China says Huawei is the victim of a 'witch hunt' as it warns European countries not to freeze the company out of their 5G networks</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISIUS-5e43d6962dae5c0664153022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISIUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y67-YP01-JBG6-528P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465531</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><timeReceived>06:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Insider Inc.

The US has repeatedly accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government, but this is the first detail it's ever given about how it thinks Huawei does it. Huawei denies the allegation. The US government has been pressuring tech companies like Apple and Facebook to build vulnerabilities for law enforcement to access encrypted devices and messages for years. </p><p>Tech companies have argued against building backdoors, as they argue malicious actors would be able to exploit them. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. The US accused Huawei of spying on people through technological \"backdoors\" intended for use by law enforcement, the Wall Street Journal[3] reports. According to the Journal, US officials say Huawei has had this technology for over a decade. The US kept this information highly classified until late 2019 when it started sharing it with selected allies including Germany and the UK in a bid to get them to freeze out Huawei equipment from their 5G networks. The information doesn't seem to have troubled the UK however, as the country announced last month it would allow Huawei to build[4] a limited amount of its \"non-core\" 5G infrastructure[5]. The US has long accused Huawei of acting as a conduit for Chinese government spying, but this is the first time it's provided precise details of exactly how it thinks Huawei does this. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it spies for China. Specifically officials said Huawei has built equipment that allows it to tap into telecoms using interfaces intended only designed for law enforcement without alerting the carriers. \"Huawei does not disclose this covert access to its local customers, or the host nation national-security agencies,\" the Journal cited a senior US official as saying. Officials were non-specific about whether they've observed Huawei exploiting this access, and didn't give technical details other than to say they'd first spotted it in 2009 on 4G equipment. Huawei was not immediately available for comment on the Journal's report when contacted by Business Insider, but a spokesperson told the Journal: \"We emphatically reject these latest allegations. Again, groundless accusations are being repeated without providing any kind of concrete evidence.\"The perils of building backdoorsThis latest allegation against Huawei highlights a security argument which the US has been wrangling with tech companies for years \u2014 whether it's safe to build privacy vulnerabilities for use by law enforcement. The US has pressured big tech companies to build methods for allowing law enforcement to circumvent security measures like encryption for years.In 2015 the FBI started a long-running feud with Apple when it asked for the company's help breaking into the iPhone of a mass-shooter. Apple refused on the basis that its encryption means it doesn't have access to customers' passwords, and building any security flaw which would allow the FBI to break in by other means would mean weakening its security overall. The case led to a huge standoff between Apple and the government, which Apple eventually won when the FBI announced it had found a third party to unlock the iPhone and dropped the case. More recently however the FBI has requested Apple's help opening another iPhone[6], and President Trump lashed out at the tech giant[7] for \"refus[ing] to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements.\" Meanwhile Attorney General William Barr[8] has been pressuring Facebook to build methods for law enforcement to access encrypted messaging on WhatsApp, and asked it to hold off on encrypting its other messaging services[9].Digital Rights and Regulation expert Dr Michael Veale told Business Insider the pressure to build backdoors in encrypted services is dangerous. \"Cryptography is so heavily relied on by financial services, businesses, electronic commerce, whistleblowers, journalists and governments. Introducing backdoors weakens the Internet for everyone, and leaves it so much more vulnerable to everyone from cybercrime rings to authoritarian regimes,\" he said. The US government's allegation that Huawei has exploited a similar mechanism in telecoms equipment would lend weight to this argument. Veale added that governments should invest in investigative powers that use the vast amount of internet data that isn't encrypted. \"The world isn't 'going dark' to law enforcement because of encryption; law enforcement are going blind to the huge amount of unencrypted data that is available to help investigations. It does not follow that because criminals, like all of us, now communicate online, catching them should become as simple as a web search. If anything, this new encryption debate highlights the greediness, laziness, and cost-cutting desires of national governments, and their willingness to throw fundamental rights and economic trust under a bus in search of a shortcut to avoid investing in proper investigative capacity.\"NOW WATCH: People are still debating the pink or grey sneaker, 2 years after it went viral.

The funding lapse is increasingly having an impact on the technology, media and telecommunications industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Funding for federal courts is set to expire on Jan. 18. Among the cases under consideration by the federal courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is hearing the U.S. Department of Justice s appeal to the AT&amp;T Inc./Time Warner Inc. merger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oral arguments for the case were heard in December 2018, with the appeals court panel casting a skeptical eye on the DOJ's argument that a lower court judge made a \"clear error.\"</p><p>In the event that funds do expire, work pertaining to \"the resolution of cases and related services\" is expected to continue. However, an announcement on the website for the D.C. Circuit says that the courts face serious disruptions in the event funding is exhausted.</p><p>Funding for the courts was previously set to expire on Jan. 11, but the court was able to extend funding for an additional week by re-obligating funds not immediately needed.</p><p>When asked about the government's appeal to the merger in December 2018, ahead of the shutdown, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson said that he expects a decision to be made early in 2019 in AT&amp;T's favor.</p><p>The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, will hold confirmation hearings from Jan. 15-16 for the nomination of William Barr to be the next U.S. attorney general. Barr previously was attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush from 1991 to 1993 and is currently of counsel at the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP in its Washington, D.C., office.</p><p>Barr has an extensive background in telecommunications and on mergers within the industry. He was general counsel and executive vice president of Verizon Communications Inc. from 2000 to 2008. Barr also previously served on the board of Time Warner, which caught the attention of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee s subcommittee that focuses on antitrust.</p><p>In a Jan. 11 statement, Klobuchar announced that she had received a commitment from Barr to recuse himself from the DOJ s appeal to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger if he is confirmed.

Lawmakers from both parties have expressed a desire to rein in big tech companies through privacy legislation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The House will start with a hearing on Feb. 26 titled, \"Protecting Consumer Privacy in the Era of Big Data.\" The hearing, hosted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, will feature witnesses from a range of backgrounds, including civil rights and technology policy advocacy organizations, a conservative-leaning think tank and Dave Grimaldi, executive vice president for public policy at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an advertising business organization.</p><p>Rep.

Frank Pallone, D-N.J, chairman of the full committee, to Facebook on Feb. 19 asking for a briefing from the company after a complaint was filed to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleging that unauthorized personal health information was exposed to the public.</p><p>The Senate will follow up with a hearing the next day, on Feb. 27, held by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. In a hearing announcement, Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., indicated that the committee intends to work toward advancing bipartisan legislation.</p><p>\"It is this committee's responsibility and obligation to develop a federal privacy standard to protect consumers without stifling innovation, investment, or competition,\" said Wicker. \"As we continue to examine this critically important issue, I hope this first hearing will offer valuable insights that will help set the stage for meaningful bipartisan legislation.\"</p><p>A bipartisan effort on privacy legislation on the committee began in the last Congress. The ongoing effort is led by Sens. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who led the Senate Commerce committee's subcommittee with jurisdiction over consumer protection issues.</p><p>The bipartisan collaboration was announced in November 2018 with the stated intention of providing the FTC with additional resources and authorities.</p><p>Moran told reporters when the effort was announced that Wicker was also part of the collaboration. Blumenthal said at the time that he hopes the bill will be introduced sometime early in the congressional session of 2019.</p><p>The Feb. 27 hearing will be primarily comprised of industry representatives, including Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group representing edge providers such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.com Inc.

Jerry Brown, with the DOJ arguing that the California law improperly attempts to regulate interstate commerce.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state law would prohibit \"blocking lawful content, applications, services, or nonharmful devices, impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of internet content, application, or service, or use of a nonharmful device,\" reinstating several measures recently repealed by the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>The California law would also ban certain \"zero-rating\" practices determined to be anticompetitive or preferential. Zero-rating is the concept of exempting specific internet traffic against a customer's data cap.</p><p>California is the fourth state to adopt its own net neutrality law, following Washington, Oregon and Vermont, after the FCC adopted an order effectively eliminating the agency's Obama-era federal net neutrality rules. The FCC order went into effect June 11.</p><p>\"Once again, the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy,\" U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a Sept. 30 statement.</p><p>Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai lauded the DOJ's legal action in a press release, saying that the internet is an information service that should be regulated by the federal government.</p><p>Congress</p><p>Antitrust issues continue to be scrutinized by Congress. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights will host an oversight hearing Oct. 3 looking at enforcement of antitrust laws. The top two antitrust officials in the federal government   Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division at the U.S. Department of Justice and Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission   are expected to testify.</p><p>Major tech companies have increasingly come under the microscope of the federal government in recent months on issues ranging from privacy to online advertising monopolies, to misinformation and free speech. There is a growing sense among antitrust experts that some sort of action may be taken to regulate social media companies and search providers in the near future.</p><p>William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman and current law professor at George Washington University, recently told S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence that he believes it is very likely that the FTC will soon emerge as a focal point for possible law enforcement against large tech companies.</p><p>Under the leadership of Simons, the FTC recently launched a series of hearings to assess whether the commission needs to modernize its enforcement priorities for competition and consumer protection, which has included multiple panels on the state of U.S. antitrust law.</p><p>Earlier this year, the commission also announced it had opened an investigation into whether Facebook Inc.'s data privacy breaches violated a 2011 consent order with the commission to improve transparency around privacy practices.</p><p>At the Department of Justice, Delrahim led the agency's challenge to the AT&amp;T Inc.- Time Warner Inc. deal, arguing in an August appeals court brief that U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon's decision to approve the merger \"discarded the economics of bargaining.\"</p><p>Delrahim also reportedly attended a Sept. 25 gathering with a group of state attorneys general at DOJ, where the group was said to weigh an antitrust inquiry into top tech and social media companies.</p><p>On Oct. 4, the Senate Commerce Committee will also hold a hearing to examine the opportunities and challenges of broadband deployment in rural America. The committee says that the hearing will be a part of its efforts to \"continue to explore ways in which closing the digital divide will benefit American jobs and the economy.\"</p><p>A panel of executives from various rural and tribal telecommunications organizations are expected to testify.</p><p>The committee's chairman, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has been active on this issue. In March, Thune's bill, which requires that 255 MHz of spectrum be identified for fixed and mobile wireless broadband use by 2022 and was included in the omnibus spending bill, was signed into law. Thune has said that ensuring more spectrum is available for new technologies will help bring faster internet to rural areas.</p><p>On Sept. 26, the Federal Communications Commission adopted an order to make it easier for network operators to deploy small cells and build out 5G infrastructure more quickly. Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr argued that the order will incentivize the private sector to invest in providing more coverage in more rural areas.</p><p>Congress: Oct. 3 The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights will hold a hearing titled \"Oversight of the Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws.\" Oct. 3 The Senate Indian Affairs Committee will hold a hearing titled \"GAO Reports Relating to Broadband Internet Availability on Tribal Lands.\" Oct. 4 The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing titled \"Broadband: Opportunities and Challenges in Rural America.\" The FCC: Oct. 1 The World Radiocommunication Conference Advisory Committee, an advisory committee to the Federal Communications Commission, will hold a meeting in Washington, D.C.

In total, 3,400 MHz will be up for bid in an incentive auction that includes the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz and 47 GHz bands.

The FCC has taken steps over the past several years to open the band up for wider commercial use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before 2015, the 3.5 GHz band was primarily used by fixed satellite services and federal agencies, such as the U.S. Defense Department. In 2015, the FCC sought to promote spectrum sharing between federal and nonfederal users in the band by establishing three tiers of users, some of which were nonrenewable and confined geographically to a single census tract for three or six years.</p><p>In 2018, in an effort to spur 5G investment and deployment in the band, the FCC voted to expand priority access licenses, a user tier in the 3.5 GHz band, to encompass entire counties. The order also extended the licensing terms to 10 years and added the option of making them renewable. These changes made the terms for 3.5 GHz spectrum more in line with traditional wireless licenses.</p><p>Mid-band spectrum is seen as important for 5G since high band cannot travel far distances or penetrate certain surfaces, and low-band spectrum has become crowded due to 4G wireless services.</p><p>Bidding in the planned 3.5 GHz auction is scheduled to begin on June 25, 2020.</p><p>Turning to Congress, a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary focused on antitrust will host a hearing Sept. 24, \"Competition in Digital Technology Markets: Examining Acquisitions of Nascent or Potential Competitors by Digital Platforms.\"</p><p>Bruce Hoffman, director of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition, is listed among the scheduled witnesses.</p><p>Both the FTC and U.S. Justice Department have been engaged in scrutiny of large tech companies in 2019.</p><p>In July, Facebook Inc. disclosed that it was being investigated by the FTC for antitrust concerns, shortly after it agreed to pay a $5 billion fine to settle FTC-documented privacy violations. Additionally, the FTC has started interviewing sellers on Amazon.com Inc.'s platform as part of an investigation into the e-commerce giant's power over competition, Bloomberg News reported Sept. 11.</p><p>In July, the DOJ announced an antitrust review into \"whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\" A civil investigative demand from the DOJ has also been issued to Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC requesting information and documents relating to the company's prior antitrust investigations in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p><p>While it is not clear exactly which tech acquisitions the subcommittee will be looking at this week, one member of the subcommittee, Sen.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the subcommittee hosting the hearing, in a statement.</p><p>As the title of the hearing denotes, the hearing is the second of the probe. The first hearing on June 11 examined the impact that tech giants, such as Facebook and Google, have on news publishers.</p><p>In the U.S. Senate, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will hold a hearing July 16 titled, \"Examining Facebook's Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations.\"</p><p>Facebook recently announced plans to launch a cryptocurrency, called Libra, that will be a blockchain-based global currency aimed at easing money transfers across the globe and helping underserved populations that lack access to basic financial services. Set to debut in 2020, Libra will be backed by a reserve of assets designed to give it intrinsic value and more stability than other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Facebook has also announced a subsidiary, called Calibra, that will offer a digital wallet and allow users to send Libra to any user with a smartphone. David Marcus, head of Calibra, will testify at the July 16 hearing.</p><p>On July 8, Marcus sent a letter to Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, the lead Republican and Democrat on the committee, in response to a series of questions about Facebook's plans for the product, including how the new cryptocurrency-based system would work, what outreach the company has made to financial regulators and what privacy protections consumers would have.</p><p>\"Facebook has done outreach to financial services, regulators, central banks, treasury and finance ministry officials and other national policymakers, global standard setting bodies like the Financial Action Task Force, and other stakeholders like the Bank for International Settlements,\" wrote Marcus.</p><p>When it comes to privacy, Marcus wrote that Calibra is \"committed to protecting user privacy through providing simple, understandable, and accessible data management controls.\"</p><p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission recently voted to impose a fine of approximately $5 billion on Facebook, which has been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators for its privacy practices in connection with the company's privacy breaches and user data practices, The Wall Street Journal reported July 12.</p><p>Federal government</p><p>July 16 The House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Communications and Technology will hold a hearing titled \"Our Wireless Future: Building A Comprehensive Approach to Spectrum Policy.\" July 16 The House Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law will host a hearing titled \"Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 2: Innovation and Entrepreneurship.\" July 16 The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will host a hearing titled \"Examining Facebook's Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations.\" July 16 The Senate Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on the Constitution will host a hearing titled \"Google and Censorship through Search Engines.\" July 17 The House Committee on Financial Services will host a hearing titled \"Examining Facebook's Proposed Cryptocurrency and Its Impact on Consumers, Investors, and the American Financial System.\"</p><p>July 17 The Senate Special Committee on Aging will host a hearing titled \"Combatting Robocall Fraud: Using Telecom Advances and Law Enforcement to Stop Scammers and Protect Seniors.\"</p><p>July 17 The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs will host a hearing titled \"GAO Report on Tribal Access to Spectrum: Promoting Communications Services in Indian Country.\" July 19 The Federal Communications Commission's Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council VII will hold a meeting.
