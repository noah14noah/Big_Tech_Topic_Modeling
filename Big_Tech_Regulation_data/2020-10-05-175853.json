Doug Collins (R-Ga.), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), Ranking Member on the Antitrust Subcommittee, and David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, announced a bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets.</p><p>The investigation will include a series of hearings held by the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on the rise of market power online, as well as requests for information that are relevant to the investigation. A small number of dominant, unregulated platforms have extraordinary power over commerce, communication and information online.</p><p>Based on investigative reporting and oversight by international policymakers and enforcers, there are concerns that these platforms have the incentive and ability to harm the competitive process. The Antitrust Subcommittee will conduct a top-to-bottom review of the potential of giant tech platforms to hold monopoly power. The committee's investigation will focus on three main areas: *Documenting competition problems in digital markets; *Examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and *Assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues.</p><p>\"Big Tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\" said Collins.</p><p>\"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive.

The Committee has a rich tradition of conducting studies and investigations to assess the threat of monopoly power in the U.S. economy. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.\" \"Technology has become a crucial part of Americans' everyday lives,\" said Sensenbrenner.</p><p>\"As the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition.

Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers,\" said Cicilline.</p><p>\"After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is vital for Congress to step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or if we need new legislation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COH2U10603201960491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-BFJ1-JCCP-0197-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

Based on investigative reporting and oversight by international policymakers and enforcers, there are concerns that these platforms have the incentive and ability to harm the competitive process. The Antitrust Subcommittee will conduct a top-to-bottom review of the potential of giant tech platforms to hold monopoly power.</p><p>The committee's investigation will focus on three main areas:</p><p>* Documenting competition problems in digital markets;</p><p>* Examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and</p><p>* Assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues.</p><p>\"Big Tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\" said Collins. \"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive. Our bipartisan look at competition in the digital markets gives us the chance to answer these questions and, if necessary, to take action. I appreciate the partnership of Chairman Nadler, Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline and Subcommittee Ranking Member Sensenbrenner on these important issues.\"</p><p>\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\" said Nadler. \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications. The Committee has a rich tradition of conducting studies and investigations to assess the threat of monopoly power in the U.S. economy. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>\"Technology has become a crucial part of Americans' everyday lives,\" said Sensenbrenner. \"As the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition. I believe these hearings can be informative, but it is important for us to avoid any predetermined conclusions. I thank Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and Chairman Cicilline as we begin these bipartisan discussions.\"</p><p>\"The growth of monopoly power across our economy is one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today. Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers,\" said Cicilline. \"After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is vital for Congress to step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or if we need new legislation.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6746529 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6746529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-BSV1-DYG2-R38G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Regulators have negotiated to divide oversight of the tech industry between the two agencies in recent weeks, these people said. The two agencies have also reportedly split up oversight of Amazon, Apple and Facebook.</p><p>Long the darling of investors and politicians, the tech industry has come under intense pressure amid an array of privacy missteps, disinformation scandals and allegations of anti-competitive behavior. Industry critics such as Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a presidential candidate, have called for tough new regulations and demanded that the companies be broken up.</p><p>The industry probe will be wide-ranging. Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline, who heads the panel's subcommittee on antitrust and is leading the investigation, said it is aimed less at specific companies than at the \"tremendous concentration of market power\" held by Silicon Valley's most dominant platforms.</p><p>Key areas for the investigation include the tech industry's impact on local journalism, consumer privacy and the ability for new startups to enter the marketplace, according to Cicilline. At the heart of the inquiry are concerns about what Cicilline called the companies' \"tremendous market power,\" which in some cases he feels has led to their accumulating substantial political power. </p><p>Committee officials have notified Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook of the coming investigation. Cicilline said he wants to hear from senior tech executives, and that he won't hesitate to issue subpoenas to companies that fail to cooperate. Amazon and Google declined to comment.

Quick Fix    \u2014 Ahead of today\u2019s earning calls:  The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google went through the wringer Wednesday at a historic House antitrust hearing complete with partisan squabbling, technical difficulties and more than five hours of questioning.   \u2014 Privacy Shield problems: Leading tech industry groups from the United States and Europe are calling on both sides to quickly negotiate a new electronic data transfer agreement after Europe\u2019s top court invalidated Privacy Shield.   \u2014 DOJ rules on connected cars: The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division ruled that Avanci\u2019s new 5G licensing platform for the auto industry is \u201cunlikely to harm competition,\u201d a major decision affecting companies reliant on the technology underlying connected vehicles.

Tech of the Town    WHAT WENT DOWN ON WEDNESDAY? \u2014 The much-anticipated tech antitrust hearing revealed that \u201ca Congress that has largely soured on Silicon Valley is beginning to figure out how to hold it to account, compiling evidence that could prove that the industry's biggest companies aren't playing by the country's competition rules,\u201d Nancy Scola reports. \u201cAnd that could haunt chief executives Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook, whose companies are being increasingly challenged by lawmakers in Washington and beyond.\u201d   \u2014 Some top takeaways: Democrats came ready \u2014 and with the paperwork to back them up \u2014 while Republicans talked everything but antitrust. Read Nancy\u2019s dispatch here for more.   AND ON THAT NOTE: THE HEARING WASN\u2019T ALL ANTITRUST \u2014 Democratic lawmakers kept much of Wednesday\u2019s hearing narrowly-focused on competition issues. But over more than five hours, the session had not surprisingly touched on all sorts of tangential terrain, reminiscent of past high-profile hearings with tech CEOs that included broader grievances against the companies.   \u2014 Allegations of anti-conservative bias were raised by nearly every Republican on the panel. House Judiciary ranking member Jim Jordan and Rep. Matt Gaetz questioned whether Google would engage in \u201celectioneering\u201d to benefit Joe Biden in the presidential election. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner grilled Facebook on a recent restriction placed on Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s account, apparently confusing that platform with Twitter ( some excerpts here , via POLITICO audio). Still more bias accusations came from Reps. Greg Steube and Kelly Armstrong . Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin was perhaps most aggressive in clapping back at what he called \u201cthe endless whining,\u201d using his time at the end of the hearing to go after the GOP lawmakers, rather than the CEOs.   \u201cIt's futile to try to cure the obsessive persecution complex in victimology of some of our colleagues ,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that electioneering is something you're opposed to just strikes me as completely inconsistent with the history and the facts.\u201d The partisan squabbling (and heated warnings to \u201cput on your mask!\u201d) more than once threatened to derail the proceedings.   \u2014 Fallout from the pandemic wasn\u2019t part of the investigation when it launched more than a year ago, but it sure is now. House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler pressed Cook on \u201cpandemic profiteering\u201d while antitrust subcommittee Chair Rep. David Cicilline pressed Zuckerberg on the prevalence of false information about the coronavirus. (\u201cDoesn't that suggest, Mr. Zuckerberg, that your platform is so big, even with the right policies in place, you can't contain deadly content?\u201d) Bezos, meanwhile, was grilled on counterfeits.   \u2014 China was also an off-topic talker . Pichai was hammered for Google\u2019s work with the Chinese military (he insisted that the company\u2019s AI work in China is very limited). And in one of the most cringeworthy moments of the marathon hearing, Steube posed this question about China to all four CEOs: \u201cDo you have any recommendations on how Congress can better protect U.S. firms and U.S. companies from aggression and government intervention abroad?\u201d Like deer in (virtual) headlights, the witnesses stared silently into their cameras and didn\u2019t respond. Crickets, then the hearing moved swiftly on. ( More on the China tangent here .)   \u2014 Big tech\u2019s shortcomings on civil rights issues was also a focus. Raskin and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) brought up the #StopHateForProfit campaign , while Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ill.) demanded commitments from each CEO to do more and better on civil rights.   TECH QUOTE DU JOUR \u2014 \u201cIt appears to me that social media is a nuanced destruction machine, and I don't think that's helpful for a democracy,\u201d Bezos said at the hearing, in arguably the most notable instance of one CEO taking a swing at the others\u2019 companies. ( More on the exchange here .)   \u2014 Another Bezos byte: Amazon wants to be a player in the \u201csmart\u201d home market. In response to questions from Raskin, Bezos acknowledged that Amazon frequently sells its Echo smart speaker below cost. That backs up Sonos, a smaller player in smart speakers, who testified before the panel in February that Amazon (and Google) were selling their speakers for cheaper than they cost to make to corner the market.   Raskin also asked Bezos about Amazon\u2019s buy of smart doorbell company Ring . In emails released by the panel, Amazon execs recommended against buying the company. Bezos\u2019 response in the email exchange: \u201cTo be clear, my view here is we are buying market position \u2014 not technology. And that market position and momentum is very valuable.\u201d That\u2019s an argument Bezos used again in his response to Raskin, saying that it\u2019s normal for a business to look at a company's market position when considering a deal.   WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? \u2014 The subcommittee will have to publish a report on the findings of its more than a year-long investigation, Cicilline said. Members now have five legislative days to submit additional questions for the tech executives. (Either way, President Donald Trump doubts Congress will be all that effective .)   \u2014 And in the meantime: Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are set to report their second quarter earnings for 2020 today. Expect them to grapple with more questions about what came up at the hearing, and watch to see whether that scrutiny \u2014 and the pandemic \u2014 have affected the businesses.    Meanwhile, in non-hearing news...   BUSINESS PRESSES FOR NEW U.S.- EU DATA TRANSFER PACT \u2014 Business groups from the U.S. and Europe are calling on top officials to quickly negotiate a new agreement for data transfers across the Atlantic, after Europe\u2019s highest court two weeks ago invalidated the EU-U.S. \u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d pact .   \u2014 Electronic data flows of business and other information between the U.S. and Europe are the largest in the world and key to the largest trading relationship in the world, which is valued at approximately $1.3 trillion annually. The court decision has threatened those data transfers and created legal uncertainty for thousands of businesses.   \u201cSuch disruption must be avoided in order to minimize any negative economic consequences , particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis and the economic recovery in both Europe and the U.S.,\u201d the Information Technology Industry Council, ACT: The App Association, the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, and other business groups said in a letter today to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders and European Data Protection Board Chair Andrea Jelinek.   \u2014 And in the meantime: The groups asked for \u201ca reasonable enforcement moratorium,\u201d as well as guidance from both sides on how to proceed until new rules are in place.   DOJ\u2019S BIG DECISION ON CONNECTED CARS \u2014 The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division ruled that Avanci\u2019s new 5G licensing platform for the auto industry is \u201cunlikely to harm competition,\u201d the department announced this week . (Avanci is a one-stop shop for Internet of Things manufacturers to obtain licenses for essential patents that underlie 2G, 3G and 4G wireless technologies needed for vehicle connectivity; the group has reached deals with several major carmakers including Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo.)   \u2014 DOJ\u2019s decision took into account interviews with stakeholders in the automotive industry as well as patents issued for similar technology, POLITICO\u2019s Kayla Sharpe reports. Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement that Avanci has pledged to provide access to its technology at fair rates and implement safeguards to protect competition.   \u2014 Good for Avanci, not good for Continental: Continental Automotive sued Avanci and three patent owners over licensing practices last year, and the DOJ\u2019s decision this week could hurt Avanci\u2019s challengers in that ongoing patent-antitrust suit . (Continental, a major supplier for German carmaker Daimler, makes the telematics control unit that connects a car's systems to wireless networks.)   PS: GOT LUNCH PLANS? \u2014 Join POLITICO antitrust reporter Leah Nylen at 1:30 p.m. EDT as she moderates \u201c A Brave New World: The Future of Tech Regulation ,\u201d a virtual discussion held by the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy.

The probe will include a series of hearings and will give lawmakers an opportunity to seek information from the companies about their practices through requests and subpoenas.</p><p>The committee announced the probe would focus on three areas: documenting where competition is lacking in digital markets, exploring whether large companies are suppressing competition, and determining whether Congress and regulators need to do more to address Big Tech's dominance.</p><p>\"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive,\" Rep.

I am honored to offer my perspective during this critical moment in history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The data-driven digital marketplace now touches almost every facet of the human experience: in our homes, our workplaces, our schools, our hospitals, our cars, and even our relationships and our understanding of the world. The list is endless.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Around the globe, there is a growing consensus that today's tech titans operating data-intensive platforms pose a threat to innovation and to new business formation. Government studies and reports from the European Commission, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other major economies are raising more questions about whether companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are choking off competition.</p><p>\"We cannot and should not live in a country where the corporate royalty of the economy can create market conditions that makes it nearly impossible for new businesses to get off the ground or to compete. Without meaningful competition, we will miss out on the promises of the digital economy.</p><p>\"As the Committee continues its investigation, it will be important for members of Congress to evaluate evidence with several things in mind, including:</p><p>(1) Data has certain economic features that are unique and unlike other assets.</p><p>(2) Most online services are not actually \"free.\" While consumers and businesses are not paying with dollars, they are paying with data.</p><p>(3) Competition is not a click away. Today's tech titans are wholly integrated throughout the digital world, such that people and businesses cannot avoid them.</p><p>Data as an Asset</p><p>\"Firms throughout the economy are desperate for our data. It's not just the Big Tech companies or telecommunications companies like Comcast, AT&amp;#38;T, and Verizon. Even the automotive industry is recognizing that collecting and monetizing personal data can be extremely lucrative. Data is clearly an economic asset, since it can produce cash flow over time. Data, however, is unlike other assets and instruments of value.</p><p>\"First, it is not a finite resource, like precious metals or minerals. In fact, more personal data is created every second. Our location, our searches, and our conversations can all be catalogued.</p><p>\"Second, data is not \"consumed\" in the traditional sense. If I use grain to make a loaf of bread, that grain cannot be used for something else. Data is different: it can be copied and shared. When one company monetizes the information that the data provides, other actors can extract value out of it, too.</p><p>\"Third, data gets more valuable as you collect more of it. It has increasing marginal returns. As you collect data across a larger swath of the population, you don't just glean insights on an individual person or business, you can also glean valuable insights on others that interact with them or share common characteristics.</p><p>\"For example, Amazon recently purchased the Whole Foods grocery chain. Amazon can now connect your purchase history online with your purchases in stores. Because the company knows even more about what you buy, it can make more accurate predictions about you. For example, Amazon can more easily predict when you're on a diet, when you're sick, when you're expecting a new baby, or a whole slew of other conditions and life events. This allows companies like Amazon to adjust offerings - and even prices - based on relevant predictions of what you want to buy and how much you're willing to pay for it.</p><p>\"As consumers, workers, and citizens, we do not know the extent to which our personal data is being collected by firms and third parties, so even if we wanted to, we could not choose to provide it to another company. The exclusivity of data collection has given a significant advantage to the companies that have been collecting data the longest, have the ability to collect the most types of data from the most people, or have control over a unique data set. In each of these circumstances, the inability to replicate gives data owners control of a key asset. New entrants face significant barriers to entry because they lack the insights from historical data that they can't reproduce. New companies also lack the ability to collect data on the same scale and scope that incumbents can collect it.</p><p>\"The unique economic features of data have considerable implications for competition. Since data-intensive digital platforms connect buyers and sellers, consumers with advertisers, riders with drivers, and other similar transaction partners, an unregulated market is likely to tip toward a handful of platforms, or even just one. As more users join on a platform, it becomes even more valuable. For example, take the case of Uber, the ride-hailing app that operates on a closed, proprietary platform. As more riders were lured to the platform, this attracted more drivers, which increased availability. Since it is clunky for riders to check many different apps, their best bet is to use the platform that everyone else is using. This is known as a network effect. Network effects are also strong when it comes to search, social media, and so many other digital services.</p><p>Paying with Data, not with Dollars</p><p>\"If you go to a car dealership and exchange your station wagon for a used SUV, that is a trade. You would never say you got the SUV \"for free.\" But, too often, we mislabel online services as \"free.\"</p><p>\"Companies like Google and Facebook are not charities. They operate massively profitable behavioral advertising businesses built on extracting enormous amounts of data from users. When you watch a YouTube video or scroll through stories on Instagram, this is not the equivalent of reading a newspaper. The behavioral advertising model relies on constant collection of personal data, even while you're consuming content. These services do have a price, and you are paying for them with your data.</p><p>\"While the price that people pay in dollars is \"zero,\" Google and Facebook reap billions of dollars from us. In 2018, Google generated $116 billion in advertising revenue.1 That same year, Facebook pulled in $55 billion.2 The profit margins far exceed those in other key industries of the economy. This means that we are handing over extremely valuable assets to these companies. An economist might say that the real price of using these services should be negative - that is, they should be paying us.</p><p>\"The true economic value that is exchanged with digital platforms is hard for consumers and businesses to measure. In addition, consumers and businesses using these platforms have no bargaining leverage, and they participate by \"agreeing\" to complex and draconian terms of service. Digital platforms can usually change these terms at any time, granting themselves more ability to collect and use data more expansively and more intensely. This is the equivalent of a price hike.</p><p>\"In a competitive market, these price hikes would be hard to impose. But, in an uncompetitive market, companies can focus on blocking new entrants and limiting choice to protect their dominance and pricing power.</p><p>Competition is Not a Click Away</p><p>\"Twenty years ago, it seemed almost unimaginable that a few companies could dominate the web. After all, it was open and non-proprietary. With such low barriers to entry, the next innovator could offer up a better online service; competition was just a click away. In 2004, the website that would eventually become Facebook launched, and I was one of its first users. It was a clear alternative to MySpace, and importantly, this new social network offered far more privacy, since it allowed users to better control who would see their personal information.</p><p>\"Sadly, many investors and entrepreneurs have come to realize that this isn't really a possibility today. Competition is no longer a click away. Big Tech is now embedded throughout the digital world. These firms have integrated horizontally, vertically, diagonally - and across the web in ways so subtle, you'd need to be able to understand computer code to realize you were being tracked. These platforms have become ubiquitous and unavoidable.</p><p>\"Earlier this year, journalist Kashmir Hill chronicled her attempts to block Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft from her life.3 Hill discovered that Amazon controls 23 million IP addresses, preventing her from even accessing certain government websites.4 Her ability to communicate, engage in commercial transactions, and access basic information was sharply curtailed. If the internet were truly competitive, people could vote with their feet and select services that offer privacy and anonymity.</p><p>\"Much of this unavoidable surveillance is spurred by the financial incentives of online behavioral advertising, a market big tech firms also dominate. Behavioral advertising promises to target ads to the users most likely to engage with them. Advertisers pay for that engagement - the clicks, likes, video views, and sales conversions. Here, advertisers face the same conundrum as users: participate on Big Tech's terms or not at all. And like users, sitting on the sidelines comes at a high cost. Businesses put themselves at a significant disadvantage if they chose not to advertise. For example, companies that don't advertise on Google may find the link to their website buried after paid ads from their competitors or may not show up when people search for local businesses.</p><p>\"Absent vigorous competition in online advertising, advertisers won't have the leverage to demand transparency. This advertising model has virtually no independent oversight or accountability mechanisms. An advertiser can tune in to watch its television ad or listen to its radio ad, buy a newspaper or magazine to see its print ad, or drive by to look at its billboard ad. With contextual online advertising, advertisers can see the digital ad by visiting the website they pay to advertise on.</p><p>\"But the same is not true when you are, for example, paying to get women who like soccer and green shirts to watch your ad on Instagram. As an advertiser, you don't have access to data on which users watched your ad or whether they match your desired profile. Absent a proactive action off the platform like making a purchase or attending an event, advertisers can't easily verify that the engagement took place. Advertisers have few ways to determine if their ad spends match the value provided. Many wish they could independently verify that they are getting the engagement they are paying for and that they are engaging with real people, not bots and fake accounts.</p><p>\"This is not a theoretical problem. Last week, Facebook agreed to pay millions in a settlement with advertisers, after allegedly inflating the amount of time it said users spent watching videos by allegedly as much as 900 percent.5 These inflated numbers didn't just harm advertisers. Many also believe that Facebook's false video metrics convinced news outlets to lay off print journalists so they could heavily invest in capitalizing on a supposedly burgeoning video audience.</p><p>\"Advertisers aren't alone. App developers also few choices on reaching users. As more of our digital lives go mobile, app stores are now a critical gateway to participate in society and the economy - but app stores don't look anything like an open internet. Operators of app stores impose taxes and regulations on app developers, who are often completely dependent on these stores for distribution. This raises concerns about how operators of app stores might preference their own apps over those created by competing developers.</p><p>\"The Committee's investigation should seek to detail the consequences of this digital dominance. I am particularly concerned that many investors are reluctant to allocate capital to innovators that seek to challenge and disrupt this dominance. Instead, investors tell me they prefer to fund companies that can eventually be sold an incumbent. This distorts digital innovation and the progress that comes along with it.</p><p>Taking Action</p><p>\"Last year, the Federal Trade Commission convened a series of hearings examining a range of competition and consumer protection issues in digital markets. The FTC staff has outlined next steps for these hearings, including policy outputs and deliverables.</p><p>\"My top priority is to ensure that our path forward is grounded in reality. In my tenure as commissioner, I have actively advocated for approaching policy and enforcement with rigorous, quantitative understanding of how these markets actually work. The Commission does its best work when it comes to the table with deep knowledge and expertise of a particular market, rather than a superficial or theoretical approach. To this end, I hope that the Commission will pursue work based on Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,6 which allows the agency to conduct industrywide investigations and studies and making its findings available to the public.</p><p>\"Given its authority to prohibit unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive trade practices, the FTC is uniquely positioned to tackle the concerns associated with digital platforms. The twin goals of competition and consumer protection are inextricably linked. Most state attorneys general also have statutory authorities related to competition and consumer protection under their \"mini-FTC Acts.\"</p><p>\"Competition. Antitrust litigation by the FTC, Department of Justice, and state attorneys general can halt exclusionary practices and anticompetitive mergers. If firms engage in behavior for the purpose of impeding entry or stifling an upstart, antitrust law should intervene. Many dominant players in the technology industry are extremely acquisitive, gobbling up companies of all sizes. However, if these acquisitions substantially lessen competition, they are unlawful. Unfortunately, antitrust enforcement is slow and costly. In the past, high-profile cases have taken years to investigate and litigate. In today's environment, this is problematic. We need to figure out ways to act more quickly to prevent harms to innovation.</p><p>\"In addition, if enforcers uncover unlawful acquisitions or conduct, it is typical to seek asset divestitures as a remedy - but divestitures and spinoffs may be just one piece of the puzzle. We will also need to think carefully about remedies as they pertain to the unique characteristics of data. As such, remedies that eliminate barriers to entry and open access without sacrificing privacy will be particularly compelling.</p><p>\"When assessing remedies, we have to be mindful of the nuances of how data moves through the digital world. We need to be cautious when applying behavioral remedies that require significant supervision or that might be difficult to assess compliance. Considering the sophistication, scale, and scope of mass data collection, it can be difficult to enforce requirements to limit the use of data, or to give people the right to see and delete their data. Companies are collecting millions of data points at every moment and the government doesn't have the resources or the technical expertise to monitor whether data is being used solely for its intended purpose. And how would a person know if their large data has truly been deleted? Violations of these requirements are usually only detected when a large-scale disaster happens, or when problems are intermittently brought to light by journalists and whistleblowers.</p><p>\"In light of these challenges, I believe that remedies should not be directed at the data itself, but rather the structural incentives that are leading to the problems in the first place. We have allowed the next generation of the internet to develop as a series of walled gardens that are owned and operated for the benefit of a few dominant players. These companies decide who gets access and who doesn't, and impose taxes and regulations on participants. Behavioral data remedies do little to alter this fundamental structure or to stop privacy-related issues from happening. For example, Facebook immediately and repeatedly violated the FTC's 2012 Order on its data use and sharing practices. The recent proposed settlement gave a lot for Facebook to celebrate. Its business model remained intact, and its executives were all let off the hook. Like an unwieldy schoolyard bully who has been lightly reprimanded, the bad behavior will continue the minute the teacher's back is turned.</p><p>\"In our economic history, we have seen government interventions that facilitate open technology yielded enormous benefits for American consumers. For example, in 1956, the government remedied the anticompetitive conduct of American Telephone &amp;#38; Telegraph (AT&amp;#38;T) and Western Electric by ordering that the system's intellectual property be made available for public use.7 This decision unleashed innovation that would eventually lead to the birth of the internet. More recently, the government conditioned the America Online (AOL) and Time Warner merger by requiring that the dominant AOL Instant Messenger chat platform become interoperable, spawning new competition and innovation.8 The Microsoft antitrust case demonstrated the power of unbundling dominant operating systems from apps that sit on top of it.</p><p>\"We've also seen this in other industries. Decades ago, we laid the foundation for free and open capital markets by separating banking from commerce, which prevented Wall Street from discriminatory lending practices that would have distorted industries across the economy.9 In Hollywood, the big studios were banned from owning cinemas, leading to more access to distribution.10 Importantly, these structural separations did not require complicated oversight and micromanagement, and we can learn from them as we consider remedies for the marketplace problems of today.</p><p>\"Any remedies should reconsider providing government benefits to companies that continue to abuse them. This could include opening up the intellectual property rights to underlying technologies that power a marketplace. It could also include voiding certain one-sided, take-it-or-leave it contract terms that are typically enforced by our courts. These benefits provide significant value to companies, and should not continue to benefit those that break the law.</p><p>\"Policymakers should also look at brightline rules and outright bans wherever feasible. Complicated rules often work in favor of those that are already dominant and can pay lawyers to get around them. For example, we should consider whether companies, particularly repeat offenders or dominant players, should be allowed to collect and monetize certain data at all. Historically, we have banned some of this behavior. For example, telephone companies were not allowed to eavesdrop on our phone calls and then sell the information they gleaned.11</p><p>\"Outside of litigation, the FTC can engage in competition rulemaking, defining what constitutes an unfair method of competition.12 These types of rules don't need to place any substantive obligations on firms, but the rules can spell out what type of conduct is lawful or unlawful, creating more certainty. The rulemaking process also allows a diverse set of stakeholders to participate, rather than just a government plaintiff and a single corporate defendant. Competition authorities around the world have recognized these benefits.13 In fact, some have already begun to draft rulemaking that addresses the growing concerns associated with digital platforms.</p><p>\"Consumer Protection. Competition cannot solve all problems, especially when dominant firms can cheat consumers and businesses. Unfair or deceptive practices can also be motivated by a firm's desire to maintain its monopoly or dominant position.</p><p>\"To halt and redress unfair or deceptive trade practices, the FTC and state attorneys general can investigate, sue, and often seek penalties for unlawful conduct. There is one particular menace in today's marketplace that warrants serious attention from policymakers and regulators: the click-through contract.</p><p>\"When it comes to dominant players with significant market power, consumers and businesses have no bargaining leverage in a take-it-or-leave-it contract. Fortunately, the FTC has a history of banning certain unfair contract terms.14 New consumer protections in Australia and New Zealand also confront suspicious contract terms. Laws in some jurisdictions specify certain contract terms that are inherently suspect, while also providing a general framework for condemning new terms that may emerge. Understandably, the public has little trust in the efficacy of click-through terms of service, and we will need to evaluate whether existing agreements violate the law or need to be regulated.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>\"Congress must reject the narrow thinking of the past that we hear too often from Washington lobbyists singing from the song sheet of monopolists and other dominant incumbents. Markets do not thrive when the government is completely absent. Our country's history has shown that we can foster innovation and create wealth with rules and laws that promote competition and eliminate conflicts of interest, rather than allowing a handful of actors to dominate and impose their own regulations on the market.</p><p>\"If you believe in the promise of discovery and invention to improve lives and advance human progress, you should be concerned that today's digital market may be choking off new entrants and innovation. Today's landscape is not simply a reflection of engineers and entrepreneurs, it also the result of government policies. If the federal government and the states did not pursue its case against Microsoft over twenty years ago, many of the major players in today's market would not exist. Confronting anticompetitive conduct will not mean the end of digital products and services; it will mean unlocking even greater innovation and entrepreneurship that benefits families and communities around the world with more choices and more opportunity.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>* This testimony represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Commission or any other individual Commissioner.</p><p>1 Alphabet Inc., Annual Report at 27 (Form 10-K) (Feb. 5, 2019).</p><p>2 Facebook Inc., Annual Report at 44 (Form-K) (Jan. 31, 2019).</p><p>3 Kashmir Hill, Goodbye Big Five, GIZMODO (2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five\">https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five</url>.</p><p>4 Kashmir Hill, I Tried to Block Amazon From My Life.

This consensus is based on the recognition that corporate hegemony - that is, concentrated power exercised at scale - can be a threat to individual liberty, the free market, and independent thought in a free society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To that end, I started the Internet Accountability Project (IAP) with Mike Davis in September of 2019 to give a voice to conservatives concerned about the growing, concentrated power of Big Tech. Since founding the group last year, our concerns have only been amplified by the COVID19 pandemic, the upcoming election, and the role Big Tech plays in both.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to raising awareness about the dangers of corporate power exercised at this scale, IAP has focused its efforts on three areas of policy remedy: antitrust enforcement, data privacy and ownership, and reform of Section 230 - which one pro-tech law professor has identified as Big Tech's \"implicit financial subsidy.\"1</p><p>My remarks today will focus on the viewpoint discrimination exercised by these platforms and its downstream effects, and on Sec. 230 reform and antitrust enforcement as potential remedies to the broad and multifaceted issues that exist when corporate power is wielded without accountability against both independent thought and the free market.</p><p>I. Big Tech's Viewpoint Discrimination</p><p>As these Big Tech companies have grown, so too has their ability to filter information for billions of people around the world - that is, to control what they see, when, and what they can say.</p><p>Through its dominance of the search engine market, Google now decides how to filter information for 92 percent of the world2 - and 87 percent of the United States.3 One content decision by Google has enormous ramifications on what information is displayed, or what businesses are promoted. Facebook, with its nearly 3 billion active monthly users, has similar power to influence what users see and do not see.</p><p>Such decisions, when made at scale, have downstream effects on individual development of opinions and beliefs. They can single-handedly change the shape of markets - as is evidenced in the market disruptions that occur every time Google updates its core algorithm.</p><p>Conservatives feel the exercise of this power acutely. Content moderation and market power has been used by some of the major tech platforms with impunity against conservative political ads, fundraising opportunities, conservative news outlets, and even against the Twitter accounts belonging to members of this committee.</p><p>While such concerns are routinely dismissed as \"anecdotal,\" or \"unproven,\" the lack of transparency provided by these companies into their decision-making, and their promotion and amplification of algorithms, renders those claims as unverifiable as the ones they seek to invalidate. In other words, neither claim can be affirmatively proven or disproven.</p><p>As VICE News remarked after an image of Twitter's internal content moderation panels leaked, prominently displaying the phrases \"search blacklist\" and \"trends blacklist\" (emphasis added): We can't say with 100 percent certainty how the \"Blacklist\" tags work because we don't have full visibility into Twitter's moderation mechanism. We can see its public facing policy, but not debates inside of the company, and more critically, the technical process by which accounts are suspended, banned, or prevented from appearing in search.</p><p>This opacity creates a situation where a devastating lapse in Twitter's security leads to a leaked image of an internal panel that contains the word \"Blacklist,\" which Twitter doesn't use when talking about moderation, and which sounds more sinister than it is.</p><p>For years, academics, journalists, and yes, conservatives, have been demanding more transparency; these are the kinds of scandals that happen when a company's internal language is different from its carefully crafted blog posts and announcements.4</p><p>Mark MacCarthy, a senior fellow at the Institute for Technology Law and Public Policy at Georgetown Law, has also noted that the easiest way to dispel accusations of bias is for the tech companies to allow researchers to look under the hood:</p><p>If social media companies are selectively enforcing their rules more vigorously against conservatives than against other points of view, independent researchers should be able to verify this if they have sufficient access to social media data.5</p><p>To date, however, none of the Big Tech companies have provided regular and system wide algorithmic and content moderation transparency; though, depending on how President Trump's recent executive order on Sec. 230 is implemented, they may soon be required to do so. In the meantime, conservatives are left with case after case of what appears to be a systemic double standard applied by employees of these tech companies, whose staff are notably liberal.6</p><p>The control that a handful of corporations have over speech has become clear during COVID-19, and the runup to the 2020 election.</p><p>Facebook has taken on \"fact-checking\" with new parameters and absurd outcomes using the notably opaque and subjective category of \"missing context.\" Already, this has been used by PolitiFact to remove digital ads from conservative groups like the American Principles Project.</p><p>Facebook recently applied this same cudgel against conservative comedian Tim Young, who wrote an opinion piece speculating on what President Obama would have done if he had been presented with a Supreme Court vacancy. Absurdly, a fact check by USA Today claimed that an opinion piece speculating about a hypothetical scenario was too dangerous to appear on Facebook or Instagram (owned by Facebook) without a warning label.7</p><p>These platforms are also now in the medical profession, insofar as they determine what constitutes \"appropriate\" medical information for their users. Google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and other platforms have banned board-certified physicians from discussing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment,8 and positing alternative viewpoints about viral spread and how best to contain it.9</p><p>In April, Facebook made headlines by removing content promoting anti-lockdown protests for violating social distancing guidelines in certain jurisdictions.10 However, Facebook embraced no such pseudo-governmental enforcement role against more recent protest activities organized on their platform in violation of local ordinances.11</p><p>Google's YouTube recently removed an interview with Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist and professor at Stanford University Medical Center and an advisor on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The interview was a data-driven discussion about the social harms of sustained lockdowns. Notably, the interview, which was broadcast in June, was not declared to be \"medical misinformation\" until after Dr. Atlas joined the White House's Coronavirus Task Force in August.</p><p>The platforms routinely cite the World Health Organization (WHO) as the arbiter of what can and cannot be said about medical science on its platform. However, the WHO has shown it can be swayed by China's Communist Party, and as recently as January confidently relayed Chinese assertions that there is \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\" of the virus.12 Facebook has also acted as the arbiter of due process rights for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teen charged with fatally shooting two people amid the riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse's attorney says his client acted in self-defense, but Facebook has blocked all posts in praise and support of him, and taken down links to contribute to his legal defense.13 Facebook, by its own admission one of the most powerful speech companies in the world,14 has already declared him guilty of mass violence, and restricted the use of its platform to reflect their subjective, extralegal judgement.</p><p>Google has unprecedented power to filter information for most of the planet and seems to flex this muscle with impunity. A 2019 investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that Google \"made algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big businesses over smaller ones,\" and modified search results around subjects like abortion and immigration.15 In June, Google demonstrated how much power it has to demonetize entire news sites for minor violations of its ad policies.16 In July, the search engine inexplicably stopped presenting search results for several leading conservative websites.17 Breitbart News has presented analysis suggesting conservative sites are routinely downgraded.18</p><p>The gatekeeping role of these mega-platforms is taking on broad and opaque roles as it relates to the upcoming election. Big Tech's influence on voter behavior has already been well documented. Center-left leaning research psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Google \"displays content to the American public that is biased in favor of one political party.\" He estimated Google's search behavior, which he tested against other search engines in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election, swung as many as 2.6 million votes to Clinton. He also estimates that Google's algorithmic filtering has \"been determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide since at least 2015.\"/19</p><p>Facebook and other tech platforms are reportedly \"war gaming\" different election outcomes, as well as meeting with government officials about \"potential threats to election integrity.\" \"Digital platforms,\" according to reports, are now as important as state and local elections agencies in \"protecting public confidence\" as it relates to \"faith in democracy.\"20 The legality of content moderation itself is not at issue--but rather, the profound impact these actions have on the nature of free thought and expression when done at the scale at which these companies exist. A single algorithmic decision made by a private corporation, accountable to no one, changes what kind of viewpoints and information are available to billions of people around the world.</p><p>The appropriate remedy is not to suppress speech or politicize the platforms themselves, but to reform the tools these platforms use to control what we see, and to ensure that consumers have the power to engage with that process. It is also incumbent upon our antitrust enforcement agencies to ensure that whatever actions these tech companies are taking, they are not doing so with monopoly power.</p><p>II. Remedies</p><p>a. Section 230</p><p>A comprehensive approach to combating Big Tech's power will include reforms to Sec. 230, Big Tech's congressionally created liability shield. Multiple Sec. 230 reform efforts are simultaneously happening at once, but all of them share one common goal: to make the recipients of Sec. 230's benefits more transparent and accountable to their users in exchange for the statutory legal privilege they receive.</p><p>The initial intent and purpose of Section 230 was to provide a very narrow immunity designed to give platforms the freedom to filter content that is \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable\" without fear of liability.</p><p>Unfortunately, embedded in that section is a catch-all phrase, \"otherwise objectionable,\" that gives tech platforms discretion to censor anything that they deem \"otherwise objectionable.\" Such broad language lends itself in practice to arbitrariness.</p><p>The intended protections were designed to protect the \"good Samaritan\" behavior of these platforms to remove smutty content online at a time when infant tech companies needed protection from massive liability. In today's Big Tech era, it has created extraordinary legal protections for these massive companies from lawsuits that challenge their suppressive, discriminatory power over the lawful viewpoints of everyday Americans.</p><p>Conservatives are concerned with both sides of the Sec. 230's judicially bloated immunity: that which empowers tech platforms to engage in viewpoint discrimination without recourse, and the shield it gives to tech companies to ignore the harmful content that facilitates unlawful conduct.</p><p>The parade of horribles is long and indefensible, and includes child pornography, revenge porn, and terrorist conduct.</p><p>As law professor Mary Graw Leary stated in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year, Sec. 230 \"was created with the goal of shielding children from objectionable content, protecting good Samaritans, and protecting a nascent internet. The internet is no longer nascent, and children are at risk of exploitation at unprecedented levels.\"21</p><p>This latter part is, disturbingly, true. A New York Times report published in February revealed that reports of online sexual abuse grew by more than 50 percent in 2019, \"an indication that many of the world's biggest technology platforms remain infested with the illegal content.\"22 Between 2017 and 2018, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline saw a 541 percent increase in videos reported containing the sexual abuse of children.23 Some argue that it is simply the prosecutorial arm of the Department of Justice (DOJ) that needs better resourcing. However, the issue for the tech platforms is less the prosecution of offenders than it is their failure to remove the images from circulation. In one case presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee, images of one child's abuse were on more than 160,000 websites.24 There is far more these platforms can do to target the preservation and circulation of this content.</p><p>As Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) put it in March, \"some people respond to light, others respond to heat, and I bet if we took away the 230 protection, these companies would feel both light and heat.\"25</p><p>The DOJ recently put forward a proposal that aims to address both viewpoint bias and the harmful content which Sec. 230 enables. A summary of their proposal is as follows: Incentivizing Online Platforms to Address Illicit Content</p><p>* The DOJ has proposed denying Sec. 230 protections to truly bad actors that \"purposely facilitate or solicit third-party content or activity that would violate federal criminal law.\"</p><p>* The DOJ's reform also carves out from a liability shield any material that includes child exploitation and sexual abuse, terrorism, and cyber-stalking.</p><p>* Also left unprotected by Sec. 230 would be any platform that had actual knowledge or notice that the third-party content violated federal criminal law or was otherwise provided with a court judgment holding that the content is unlawful in any respect.</p><p>Clarifying Federal Enforcement Capabilities to Address Unlawful Content - The DOJ reform legislation also increases the protection of Americans by making clear that Sec. 230 does not bar civil enforcement actions brought by the federal government.</p><p>Promoting Competition</p><p>* The DOJ also would reform Sec. 230 to explicitly clarify that federal anti-trust claims are not barred by Sec. 230, which only protects against the publication of third-party speech and not liability for anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Promoting Open Discourse and Greater Transparency</p><p>* The DOJ reform proposal would specifically replace the vague \"otherwise objectionable\" language in (c)(2) with \"unlawful\" and \"promotes terrorism.\" This would focus on the core objective of Sec. 230 and remove platforms' ability to remove content arbitrarily based on subjective determinations.</p><p>* The draft legislation adds a statutory definition of \"good faith\" in order to provide more accountability and transparency and to prevent hiding behind the Sec. 230 shield regardless of intent.</p><p>* Lastly, the DOJ suggests explicitly overruling Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v Prodigy Services Co., 1995 WL 323710 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995) to clarify that a platform's removal of content does not, on its own, render the platform a publisher or speaker for all the content on its site.</p><p>Given how pervasive content curation is on online platforms, I believe Congress should consider whether this blanket immunity continues to be justified when platforms actively amplify or suppress the content of others - either through human moderators or their algorithms.</p><p>b. Antitrust</p><p>Antitrust enforcement, the subject of this committee's remit, is equipped to tackle Big Tech's anti-competitive dominance in multiple sectors of the marketplace.</p><p>This committee has heard testimony about various antitrust concerns: if and how Amazon prioritizes its products and services over those of its partners and competitors; Google's dominance in online advertising; Facebook's acquisition strategy for smaller competitors; and if and how Apple favors its own products through the App Store. You have also heard compelling testimony from small businesses about wanton and aggressive anti-competitive behavior by Big Tech giants.</p><p>Small businesses are not the only competitors impacted, however. Entire industries are at the mercy of Big Tech's power. As the National Association of Broadcasters told this committee in a statement earlier this month:</p><p>It is no answer to tell broadcasters that, if they feel disadvantaged by the policies and revenue opportunities offered by the dominant platforms, they can decline to publish their content on Google, YouTube or Facebook and forego availability via various apps or devices. Because hundreds of millions of U.S. consumers use Facebook, Google and YouTube, and own smartphones, tablets and smart speakers produced by companies like Apple and Amazon, local stations have no real choice. Beyond offering over-the-air services, broadcasters must be available on all major platforms and types of devices to remain relevant to audiences and advertisers in the digital age. As a result, TV and radio stations lack bargaining power when dealing with the digital giants that have become gatekeepers for content providers, including local media outlets, seeking to reach audiences and monetize their content online. The digital giants have clear financial incentives to keep consumers engaged with their own platforms, content and apps, and lack effective incentives to adopt policies and practices that promote or financially reward the providers of other content, including local news.</p><p>In short, the dominance of the leading digital platforms significantly and increasingly impairs broadcasters' ability to earn the ad revenues needed to support production of local news and information.26</p><p>News publishers have also long argued that Google uses its dominance to force publishers to give up their content without adequate compensation. As the News Media Alliance put it: In today's digital age, the tech giants' dual control over news distribution and monetization threatens the very survival of news organizations. These tech giants use secret, unpredictable algorithms to determine how and even whether content is delivered to readers. They scrape news organizations' content and use it to their own ends, without</p><p>26 Online Platforms and Market Power, Part I: The Free and Diverse Press: Hearing Before the United States House Judiciary Comm. on Antitrust, Commercial and Admin. Law, 116 Cong. 2 (2020) (Statement by Gordon H. Smith) <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/pdfs/09220_HJC_Local_Journalism_At_Risk_Submission.pdf\">http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/pdfs/09220_HJC_Local_Journalism_At_Risk_Submission.pdf</url>.</p><p>permission or remuneration for the companies that generated the content in the first place.</p><p>They also suppress news organizations' brands, control their data, and refuse to recognize and support quality journalism. In effect, a couple of dominant tech platforms are acting as regulators of the digital news industry. Only these regulators are unconstrained by legislative or democratic oversight. And their primary motivation is not to serve the public interest, but rather to maximize their own advertising revenues. Indeed, two dominant platforms--Google and Facebook--now take the vast majority of U.S. online ad revenue through their online advertising services, leaving news organizations with little to reinvest in high-quality, original journalism. They capture that revenue in two ways. First, they scrape news organizations' content and display it on their own pages, where they can monetize it through ads. Second, they control the advertising technology news organizations use to sell ads on their own sites, and the platforms charge increasingly exorbitant fees for the use of those technologies.27</p><p>While Congress cannot enforce the antitrust law itself, it has a critical role to play in performing the oversight which ensures the responsible agencies are adequately policing the market. It is critical that these agencies have both the congressional support and resources to assess the growing dominance of billion-dollar companies in the market. Many times, this involves reviewing if previous agency decisions were wisely made.</p><p>For example, William Kovacic, appointed by President George W. Bush to the Federal Trade Commission and later its chair, voted to approve Google's acquisition of the ad technology company DoubleClick. Kovacic recently told the New York Times, \"If I knew in 2007 what I know now, I would have voted to challenge the DoubleClick acquisition.\"28 Many on the Right take issue with the use of antitrust enforcement against Big Tech firms. Their claims are generally summarized as follows:</p><p>* Antitrust is being used by conservatives as a political tool to go after Big Tech platforms they do not like.</p><p>* Antitrust cannot solve speech concerns</p><p>* Discussions of antitrust enforcement are actually proxies for updating antitrust law away from the consumer welfare standard.</p><p>I will take these claims one at a time. First, the bipartisan efforts and wide-ranging remedies under discussion make clear that there is growing awareness among legislators that Big Tech's unchecked power in specific circumstances warrants review. Big Tech isn't being singled out for its own sake; rather, specific actions - antitrust violations, viewpoint discrimination, and the facilitation of various criminal acts - are being targeted.</p><p>Second, antitrust's application to \"speech concerns\" may not be direct, but proper enforcement of the law against violations could certainly have tangential effects. Antitrust enforcement does not occur in a vacuum. Enforcing against the monolithic dominance of these companies in one sector, if warranted, could free up the market in such a way that concerns over viewpoint bias could be competed away in ways which Big Tech's market dominance now makes impossible.</p><p>Third, it is the view of myself and the Internet Accountability Project that our antitrust laws do not need to be updated; that the laws on the books are sufficient for tackling per se violations of antitrust as they exist in the tech sector. Antitrust enforcement is law enforcement. As conservatives, we do not support legal amnesty for those who violate our nation's laws - and this should extend to corporations who violate competition laws in the market.</p><p>Conservatives who rightly champion the innovation generated by a free market should be equally vigilant about maintaining its integrity. To repurpose the old adage from Ronald Reagan, \"trust, but verify.\"</p><p>As Congressman Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a member of this committee, has rightly noted: Big isn't inherently bad and we should celebrate American success stories. However, when companies use their success as a bat to bludgeon smaller rivals, Congress must address the root causes of these inequities to ensure the American dream remains attainable for all Americans.29</p><p>III. Conclusion</p><p>When it comes to the expansive power of Big Tech, the question really distills to one of who will rule. In America, it should not be the bureaucrats; it should not be the mob; it should not be the tech oligarchs. Rather, in America, it is the people who rule through our system of selfgovernment.</p><p>\"I will not willingly cede more power to anyone, not to the state, not to General Motors, said William F Buckley in Up From Liberalism. \"I will hoard my power like a miser, resisting every effort to drain it away from me.\"30</p><p>Conservativism follows a tradition of skepticism when it comes to concentrations of power. In 1960, Barry Goldwater wrote Conscience of a Conservative. Goldwater - America's first libertarian politician, according to Reason magazine31 - had a prescient and applicable reminder for American conservatives today. \"Let us henceforth make war on all monopolies--whether</p><p>corporate or union,\" he noted. \"The enemy of freedom is unrestrained power, and the champions of freedom will fight against the concentration of power wherever they find it.\"32 But perhaps it is Russell Kirk, one of the founding fathers of conservative thought, who surmised the challenge most aptly: \"Our conservative task is to reconcile personal freedom with the claims of modern technology, and to try to humanize an age in which [Permanent] Things are in the saddle.33</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 Eric Goldman, Want to Kill Facebook and Google?

First is the realization that political actors abroad and in the United States had figured out how to exploit digital platforms to distribute propaganda and misinformation - popularly called \"fake news\" - in ways that disrupt our electoral systems and politics. Second is that the advertising-dependent business models of Facebook and Google (and increasingly Amazon) are based on an intimate surveillance of the actions and communications of hundreds of millions of individuals, and on the manipulation of user and business data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These two private corporations simultaneously have centralized control over the flow of information and news between reporters and readers and diverted advertising revenue away from both traditional and Internet \"native\" publishers, at both the national and local levels, into their own coffers. With the ability to control the distribution of information, ad money, and the relationship between the reader and the news outlet, tech platform monopolists now have unprecedented power over reporters and news publishers themselves. This dynamic poses a threat to American democracy and to the most fundamental liberties of the individual.</p><p>Americans have faced similar challenges before, with the rise of then-revolutionary technologies such as the telegraph and telephone in the 19th century and of radio and television in the 20th Century. In each instance, we used government and competition policy to ensure the independence and financial viability of the news media. Over the course of more than two centuries, Americans developed many regulatory and policy tools that can be of use to us today.</p><p>II. Threats to Democracy</p><p>For today's hearing, I will focus on three main ways that digital platform monopolies threaten American democracy: (1) disinformation and propaganda; (2) the starving of journalism; and (3) control over speech.</p><p>A. Disinformation and Propaganda</p><p>First, digital platforms like Facebook and Google, and the Google-owned YouTube, are the main source of disinformation and propaganda. Facebook and Google track people both on their platforms and off, in order to target and influence them with advertising. And just as these platforms enable advertisers to influence people's purchasing decisions, they likewise enable propagandists to influence people's political decisions. Propagandists and disinformation agents are not hacking these platforms or misusing them. Rather, they are using these platforms exactly as designed, for influence and manipulation.</p><p>The problem is not just that Facebook and YouTube cannot properly identify and quickly take down disinformation, but rather that these platforms actually amplify propaganda. Facebook and YouTube program their algorithms to prioritize engagement to keep people on their platforms longer, collecting more of their data and showing them more ads. Their algorithms boost disinformation and propaganda because fear and anger \"engage\" humans the most.</p><p>Even worse, through ubiquitous tracking and compiling the data sets of billions of people, Facebook and Google learn what messages people are susceptible to - whether advertisements, extreme political propaganda, or election meddling.</p><p>Facebook and Google make a lot of their money by renting out their manipulation machines to just about anyone who comes along. In 2016 alone, the year of the U.S. presidential election and the Brexit vote, Facebook nearly doubled its ad revenue. n1 The scale of the manipulation is massive because of Facebook and Google's dominance and control of the flow of information globally.</p><p>These problems are not inevitable, but rather are the result of business choices. If Facebook and Google stopped collecting massive amounts of user data to feed their targeted advertising business models, foreign agents would not be able to so easily interfere with our elections by precisely targeting and manipulating users. If Facebook and YouTube stopped programming their algorithms to prioritize engagement, fake news and incendiary, hateful and polarizing content would not rise to the top of news feeds. Facebook and YouTube make business choices to prioritize engagement, keeping users on their platforms as long as possible to show them ads and collect their data.</p><p>We cannot have Democracy if we turn our broadcast platforms over to control by foreign agents and purveyors of disinformation.</p><p>B. The Starving of Journalism</p><p>A second important threat is that Facebook and Google exploit their middlemen positions to divert advertising away from publishers and into their own pockets in ways that starve trustworthy journalism. Last year Facebook and Google accounted for approximately 85% of the growth of the more than $150 billion North American and European digital advertising market. n2</p><p>That's because Facebook and Google can hyper-target users based on their 360-degree views of what their users read, think, and do, thanks to their ability to track users across millions of websites and even offline. Facebook got so good at tracking consumers - whether on Facebook or on millions of other websites with Facebook pixels n3 - that it could target ads better than any publisher could. Google likely knows more about consumers than even Facebook does. n4</p><p>No publisher has anything similar, which means no publisher can really hope to compete with Google and Facebook for the advertising dollars needed to support journalism. As a result, we have seen our society hugely disrupted by the collapse of journalism at the local and state level. This means thousands fewer reporters and editors are covering the news.</p><p>The story of Women You Should Know, a pioneering online publisher that has been telling empowering women's stories for years, illustrates these first two threats to democracy. The site's founders, Jen Jones and Cynthia Hornig, built their small business with Facebook at its core, growing their Facebook fan base to more than 350,000 loyal followers. Their digital ad-supported business thrived, with Facebook followers regularly clicking to read their articles on their website.</p><p>But recently they began getting confusing messages from their followers, messages criticizing Women You Should Know for only sharing negative stories of violence against women and straying from their positive brand. Jen and Cynthia were baffled. Sure, they occasionally shared a story about gender-based violence, an important issue, but the uplifting stories outnumbered those articles by 20 to 1. Jen and Cynthia realized that Facebook's algorithms often were not showing followers their positive stories, but rather serving up the stories the provoke fear and anger. Jen and Cynthia wanted to empower women, but Facebook's algorithms were programmed to prioritize engagement, and so Facebook made women afraid instead.</p><p>Then Facebook tweaked its algorithm in 2018, promising to show more posts from friends and family. n5 Facebook's flip of a switch decimated Women You Should Know's website traffic, as it did to many other publishers, a stark demonstration of Facebook's monopoly and gatekeeper power. Jen and Cynthia tried to enlist financial support from their huge base of Facebook followers. But Facebook, again, had other plans. All posts that used words like \"donate\" or \"contribute\" got buried by Facebook's algorithms and did not show up in their followers' news feeds. Why? Facebook had vertically integrated into fundraising, and in order to get donations to show up in followers' feeds, Jen and Cynthia needed to use Facebook's own fundraising feature. This is a common tactic of big tech platforms, using their monopoly power to steer users to their own products and services.</p><p>Women You Should Know is a publisher that is digital-native, with a huge Facebook following, and Facebook nonetheless managed to decimate them. Publishers like Mother Jones, n6 Vox n7 and Slate n8 also reportedly had their livelihood threatened by the 2018 algorithmic change. If Facebook had not consolidated gatekeeper power over the internet, its changes - even purportedly well-intentioned ones - would not determine which news publishers get to exist.</p><p>Jen and Cynthia are still struggling like so many other publishers to find a new, sustainable business model.</p><p>C. The Automation of Fear</p><p>On top of amplifying propaganda and starving journalism, Facebook and Google can exploit their control over access to the market to silence potential criticism. In most cases, people won't speak up in the first place, due to fear of retribution.</p><p>Wired Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein in February 2018 published what may be the most concise description of today's relationship between reporters and publishers and the platform monopolists, a relationship characterized increasingly by dependence, exploitation, and fear.</p><p>\"Every publisher knows that, at best, they are sharecroppers on Facebook's massive industrial farm... And journalists know that the man who owns the farm has the leverage. If Facebook wanted to, it could quietly turn any number of dials that would harm a publisher - by manipulating its traffic, its ad network, or its readers.\" n9</p><p>Nick recently updated that piece in an article titled \"15 Months of Fresh Hell Inside Facebook.\" n10 He wrote that, just after the first article appeared last year:</p><p>\"[T]raffic from Facebook suddenly dropped by 90 percent, and for four weeks it stayed there. After protestations, emails, and a raised eyebrow or two about the coincidence, Facebook finally got to the bottom of it. An ad run by a liquor advertiser, targeted at WIRED readers, had been mistakenly categorized as engagement bait by the platform. In response, the algorithm had let all the air out of WIRED's tires. The publication could post whatever it wanted, but few would read it. Once the error was identified, traffic soared back.\"</p><p>Nick concluded by doubling down on what he wrote last year: \"It was a reminder that journalists are just sharecroppers on Facebook 's giant farm.\"</p><p>The same relationship applies to Google. As Jim VandeHei of Axios wrote recently, \"The media is obsessed with Facebook.\" n11 But publishers and reporters are \"exponentially more dependent on Google.\" The corporation, he wrote \"is a gigantic octopus, with sprawling, growing tentacles reaching deep into every nook and crevice of media companies.\"</p><p>Today, in America, news publishers understand very well that digital platforms have the power to cut off their pathway to the reader and to cut off what little revenue remains. We cannot have democracy unless every one of us, every citizen and every journalist, feels free to speak their mind.</p><p>III. The Role of Weak Competition Policy</p><p>These threats to democracy are not an inevitability of the internet, but rather they result from bad competition policy and poor enforcement of the law. In this section, I will explain why these threats are monopoly problems and how weak antitrust enforcement impacted where we are today.</p><p>A. Unfair Competition Between Facebook, Google, and Publishers</p><p>A major problem in the age of big tech is that platform monopolists are internet gatekeepers that also compete against companies that must get through their gates to reach users. But of course, this is not a fair competition. Rather, tech platforms have what I call platform privilege - the incentive and ability to prioritize their own products and services over those of competitors. Tech platforms get to both umpire the game and play in it too.</p><p>As an example of platform privilege, Google was found by the European Commission to have abused its dominance by prioritizing its own comparison shopping services in Google search and tweaking its algorithms to demote competitors in search results. n12 Amazon has reportedly preferred its own goods and services on its platform. n13 And Apple has been accused of discriminating against Spotify and giving favorable treatment to Apple Music. n14</p><p>In the same way, Facebook and Google compete against news publishers that must get through their gates to reach users, due to the two platforms' concentrated power over the flow of information. But Facebook and Google compete against news publishers for user attention, data and advertising dollars. n15 Because Facebook and Google control the playing field for this competition, publishers never had a fair shot. How can publishers compete against platforms that can tweak their algorithms at any time to bury them?</p><p>Facebook and Google can simply change their algorithms or adjust their product design to keep users within their digital walls and reduce traffic to news publishers' properties, depriving publishers of the revenue essential to fund journalism and to counter disinformation.</p><p>Facebook's goal is to keep users engaged with content on its platform as much and as long as possible. The more time users spend on Facebook's platform, the more data it collects, the more ads it shows, and the more money it makes. On Facebook's first quarter 2016 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that users spend on average more than 50 minutes per day using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, up ten minutes from the number reported in 2014. n16</p><p>And about 70 percent of Alphabet's total 2016 revenue came from the ads that the company sells on its own digital properties, including Google web search pages, YouTube and other Google apps. n17 Google thus has the incentive to steer search users to its own properties. YouTube benefits from prioritization in Google search results, and, like Facebook, makes more revenue the more people engage with content on its platform.</p><p>Because disinformation is more likely to gain attention and foster engagement, it better serves both Facebook and YouTube's advertising-based business models than does trustworthy news. The more outrageous content is, the more it elicits likes, shares, comments and clicks, and the more the algorithms promote it.</p><p>B. Loss of Choice and Bargaining Power Due to Market Concentration</p><p>Because they lack meaningful competition, Facebook and Google can tailor their algorithms to serve their financial interests, rather than making profit-reducing changes to combat disinformation. Without choice and lacking bargaining power, consumers who want trustworthy news prioritized instead of disinformation and propaganda have limited ability to switch to alternatives. Hence the normal checks and balances of a free, competitive market do not constrain Facebook and Google from pursuing profits to democracy's detriment.</p><p>News companies also lack alternatives and bargaining power against Facebook and Google. Facebook and Google are constantly changing terms and adjusting their algorithms, and publishers have little choice but to adapt and accommodate regardless of how the changes may negatively affect their own profitability. In 2009, Rupert Murdoch accused Google of stealing media content and threatened to withdraw his media companies' articles from Google search, but he could not viably follow through on the threat.</p><p>Imagine instead a world with robust competition against Facebook and Google. Purveyors of disinformation would have less impact. News publishers would have bargaining power. Journalists and citizens would not be afraid to speak out. Users could vote with their feet when Facebook and Google amplify disinformation or abuse their privacy. The ability to switch to an alternative would apply competitive pressure on Facebook and Google to fix their problems because profits would be at stake. n18</p><p>C. The Use of Anticompetitive Mergers and Conduct to Grow Monopoly Power</p><p>Facebook and Google started on their paths to dominance with innovation, but their monopoly power is not purely the result of competing on the merits or being the best.</p><p>Acquisitions of competitive threats have helped both firms amass and maintain market power, and weak merger enforcement is a big part of how we got where we are today. Instagram built a thriving social network with 27 million users on iOS alone, centered around sharing images. n19 Then Facebook bought it. WhatsApp succeeded in getting the attention of 450 million users and was also acquired by Facebook. Facebook even reportedly has its own app to detect new apps that could be competitive threats, so that it can build its own version. n20 Doubleclick was the leader in display advertising, and then Google bought it. Google's acquisitions cemented its market power throughout the vertical stack of the ad ecosystem, as it acquired the digital ad market spoke by spoke. n21</p><p>Together Facebook and Google have bought over 150 companies just since 2013. n22 Google alone has acquired nearly 250 companies since 2006. n23</p><p>Anticompetitive conduct has also grown Facebook and Google's monopoly power. Google has not competed purely on the merits, according to the European Commission decisions finding abuses of dominance regarding Google Shopping, Android, and AdSense. n24 In the Android case, the European Commission found that Google required phone manufacturers to install a suite of apps on Android phones as a condition of installing the must-have Google Play app, conduct that mirrors the Microsoft antitrust cases regarding Internet Explorer. The contracts also prohibited manufacturers from preinstalling competing search engines and other competing apps in Android phones, helping Google maintain its monopoly in search as the world moved from desktop to mobile. Google has also integrated into search verticals like reviews, maps and travel, and has been accused of degrading its search quality results in order to prioritize its own verticals or content that keeps users on Google search pages. n25</p><p>As for Facebook, the German cartel office recently determined that the social media platform abused its dominance by excessive and improper collection of user data, in violation of Europe's privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation. n26 And documents recently published by the UK parliament provide evidence of Facebook cutting off competitors' access to its API. n27 Such conduct likely amounts to a discriminatory refusal to deal, which is prohibited under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</p><p>Thus far antitrust enforcers have not stopped Facebook and Google from using acquisitions to grow and maintain their monopoly power and leveraging their monopoly power to exclude competition. Weak antitrust enforcement deserves a large part of the blame for publishers' lack of bargaining power and alternatives to Facebook and Google, and it set the stage for these platforms to extract the fruits of publishers' labor.</p><p>IV. History of the American System of the Free Press</p><p>The failings of competition policy are not the only cause of the devastation of journalism in America. Government has also failed to protect the free press through public policy.</p><p>To understand what went wrong, the history of American journalism is instructive. That history is one of ceaseless private initiative and innovation, as individual citizens strive to figure out better ways and smarter business models to a) keep a check on government and private power, b) inform citizens, and specific communities within society, of the basic events and challenges of the day, and c) pay the costs of reporting, editing, and distributing the news.</p><p>From even before the Declaration of Independence, Americans used government both to promote the building of technologically sophisticated infrastructures to distribute the news, and to directly address threats to the free press posed by either private monopolists or by government actors. n28</p><p>By the first decades of the 19th century a basic American model of the Free Press had been shaped. The model had three main components:</p><p>* Local ownership of newspapers. Most towns of any consequence came to have at least one and often more, independent papers.</p><p>* An advertising-based business model. Although many early papers were supported in part by various forms of government and party patronage, by the early 19th century American newspapers were supported, crucially, by subscriptions and local advertising.</p><p>* A politically neutral network for distributing the news, strongly buttressed where necessary by government funding, initially in the form of the Post Office system.</p><p>A. Protecting the \"American System\" Against the First Tech Monopolies</p><p>The first great technological challenge to the basic balances of this \"American System\" of the free press came in the 1840s with the rise of the railroad and, especially, the telegraph. These technologies greatly sped the movement of news both in the form of the physical newspaper and in the form of the news story itself, which could now be distributed almost instantaneously across hundreds of miles by the telegraph. These technologies, however, also created chokepoints in the flow of information and ideas. During this period, the distribution of news became dependent on infrastructures developed and owned by rich and powerful private corporations that often enjoyed positions as de facto monopolies - over both communications and transportation - across large swaths of the nation. n29</p><p>In response, American legislatures and courts at all levels of government began enacting policies designed to ensure that the private ownership and operation of these crucial technologies did not privilege some people's speech while suppressing others. Although there were widespread calls simply to nationalize the telegraph system, and perhaps attach it to the Post Office (as many European nations were then doing), Americans generally focused more on using other legal and policy tools to prevent these networks from discriminating in favor of, or against, any one person, party, or corporation, while leaving ownership and management of the networks in private hands. n30 Hence, perhaps the single most important action during this period was to impose various forms of common carriage rules, or common-carriage-like principles, to these new networks.</p><p>One of the first such efforts was New York State's Telegraph Act of 1848. Its goal was to check what one journalist at the time called the \"stupendous power\" of telegraph monopolies over the flow and content of news by making it easier for new competitors to join the market. n31 The law did so by prohibiting telegraph operators from discriminating in favor of any one person's or company's messages, which it did by mandating that the operator carry messages on a first- come, first-served basis, and that it charge all senders the same price and terms.</p><p>By the beginning of the 20th century, monopolists such as John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan had captured control over great swaths of the American economy and American politics. Yet despite numerous attempts by the powerful to exploit the monopoly nature of the telecom and transportations networks of the day, Americans managed to protect and perpetuate the American System of the free press.</p><p>Indeed, it was America's magazines and newspapers which published the most powerful investigations and exposes of the Rockefellers and Morgans of the country, and of the politicians in Washington who served them, helping to catalyze public support for greater anti-monopoly action from the federal government.</p><p>B. Perpetuating the \"American System\" in the Era of Radio and Television</p><p>During and immediately after the First World War, Americans allowed the federal government to monopolize control over key communications and transportations systems, and over the use of the new wireless technologies. But after the end of the war, Americans moved swiftly to return telecommunications and transportation networks to private control. Despite the fact that radio (and later television) introduced entirely new ways to broadcast the news and sped up communications dramatically, Americans began to shape these technologies to make them fit with the American System of free press that had worked so well for so long.</p><p>Indeed, while other major nations moved to centralize communications and the news under the control of the government - as in the case of the United Kingdom's BBC -Americans took a directly opposed path, working to ensure that the new wireless networks would be as decentralized and democratic as possible, composed of thousands of local stations that would be locally owned, locally directed, and locally funded, mainly through local advertising. n32</p><p>Within a few years, Americans had established policies that strictly limited the number of broadcast licenses a single person or corporation could control. They did so, for instance, by blocking any one corporation or individual from owning more than one TV or radio station in the same market, and by blocking corporations from owning more than seven TV stations, seven AM radio stations, and seven FM stations nationally. n33 They also limited how many networks any one independent broadcaster could affiliate with. n34</p><p>American legislatures and courts also continued to promote and enforce \"common carrier\" rules that prohibited price discrimination in communication markets and kept networks open and neutral.</p><p>C. The American System in Crisis - Neoliberalism and the Internet</p><p>Over the last generation, the American System of Free Press has come under unprecedented pressure. Although many Americans only really began to focus on the state of the news media following the revelations about Russian meddling in the last general election, there has been a sharp and persistent decline in the number of American journalists working at the local, national, and international levels. n35 This is true for the journalism that aims to keep a check on our governments. And it is true for the journalism that is designed to keep a check on large private enterprises, such as business corporations and financial institutions. The overall result is a grave and growing threat to American liberties and American democracy.</p><p>Two radical changes are largely responsible for the dangerous state of American journalism today.</p><p>The first is intellectual, in the form of a new philosophy of competition. From the founding, Americans used government to promote open markets and wide distribution of power and opportunity. This played out in policies that promoted independent farms, independent business, and local control of enterprise and finance, across the whole American political economy, in almost exactly the same way as Americans promoted wide distribution of ownership over the news media. To the extent there was an organizing concept behind this approach to political economy, it was to protect and promote the interests and rights of a thinking, acting, productive citizenry.</p><p>But a generation ago, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, an alliance from across the political spectrum promoted the adoption of a new approach to competition policy. The new goal, they said, should be to promote more \"efficient\" forms of production, distribution, and business organization, in theory to create more material wealth to share across society. To the extent there was an organizing concept, it was to protect and promote the interests of the American as a \"consumer.\" This movement is sometimes known as the \"Chicago School,\" as many of its early promoters taught at the University of Chicago. It is also widely known as \"neoliberalism.\"</p><p>This radical shift from a philosophy that promoted diversity and the distribution of power, to a philosophy that promoted efficiency--and hence the concentration and centralization of power-- directly affected the American System of the free press in profound ways. Following the insights of the Chicago School, antitrust enforcers permitted private actors to concentrate far greater control than ever before over American news and entertainment media. And policymakers made a series of decisions that actually made it easier for powerful actors to further centralize control over news and information flows.</p><p>The second radical change over the last generation was the development and deployment of the Internet. Much in the same ways that the telegraph and the radio disrupted preexisting balances in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the rise of globe-spanning Internet-based communications corporations such as Facebook and Google similarly broke down existing structures and practices. These new tech platforms consolidated power over America's news system, controlling and manipulating the flow of news and information across the internet.</p><p>And, closely related, these platforms developed a new system of automated advertising that depended on the intimate surveillance of individuals, and that - over the course of a few short years - allowed them to capture control over much if not most of the advertising market that once sustained America's independent press, and especially its local news media. The result, in a remarkably short period of time, was the choke pointing of news across a few vital platforms, the creation of extreme or even complete dependency by journalists and publishers on these platforms, and the development by the platforms of ever more automated systems for controlling and manipulating news flows in ways that promote their own financial - and ultimately their own political - interests.</p><p>Google and Facebook erected a duopoly over online advertising. Because these companies command far more data than other advertising-based businesses can hope to bring in, Google and Facebook can offer ads that are more targeted, more precise, and which reach more people than those sold by newspapers, magazines, and other journalistic outlets.</p><p>This is a significant change from the previous structure of the U.S. advertising market, under which news organizations drew in advertising revenue by creating products that attracted local audiences. Under the new system, it doesn't matter if newspapers attract local audiences or forge a strong connection with local readers. No matter what, advertisers can reach those audiences by going to Google or Facebook directly, bypassing local media entirely.</p><p>The rise of Facebook and Google's advertising businesses neatly coincides with the declining ad revenue of America's newspapers. Google launched its digital advertising business in 2001 and made its first billion from digital advertising in 2003. Facebook started its digital advertising business in 2009, after which it grew every single year. The two corporations in 2017 grossed just under $140 billion in advertising revenue, which represents 73% of the entire digital advertising market. Meanwhile, newspapers' aggregate revenue fell from the 2005 high of nearly $50 billion to less than $20 billion in 2017, when adjusted for inflation. n36</p><p>The main difference in recent years from previous periods in American history is that for the first time ever, America's citizens have not used government to neutralize the power of today's monopoly communications networks. As a result, the executives and financiers in charge of these corporations have been left almost entirely free to further increase their power through the buying of potential rivals, to manipulate the flow of news between reporters and readers through such practices as personalized (\"first-degree\") discrimination in pricing and terms, and to divert the great bulk of remaining advertising dollars away from local and even national news media into their own pockets.</p><p>V. Solving the Crisis: Towards Regulated Competition n37</p><p>Drawing on these lessons from history, saving the free press will require organizing market structures around four principles.</p><p>1. Business models must exist that allow for independent news gathering, because independent news gathering is a social good critical to democracy.</p><p>2. Any policy levers must preserve free speech and avoid government censorship.</p><p>3. Markets should be decentralized so that information production can be decentralized. Local communities need to be able to produce and distribute information about their own communities.</p><p>4. There should be no price and terms of service discrimination against consumers, advertisers, or publishers. Relationships between publishers and the audience should be kept under the control of publishers and audiences, and not structured to enable third parties to monetize relationships they don't invest in to produce.</p><p>Specific solutions include: a) non-discrimination regulations; b) structural separation; c) stronger antitrust enforcement; d) interoperability; and e) data privacy rules.</p><p>A. Non-Discrimination</p><p>Tech platforms that are providers of essential communications and information services should be subject to common carrier style regulation, which we have applied to every previous network monopoly in our history. There must be no discrimination in price or terms, be it towards the user or the publisher. When private companies become the infrastructure of the economy, policymakers must impose neutrality, non-discrimination, and equal access regulations.</p><p>B. Structural Separation and Market Segmentation</p><p>Both Google and Facebook have not only enormous advertising power but also multiple dominant networks as subsidiaries. As discussed above, each has an incentive to unfairly and inefficiently prioritize the content of its subsidiaries.</p><p>By applying common sense standards to network products to split up Facebook and Google, policymakers would produce new independent companies that can compete: Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Maps, Search, YouTube, Android, Play, Analytics, DoubleClick Advertising, Analytics, Chrome, Gmail, and infrastructure services. This has been done before. One model for such a simplification would be the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which forced utility holding companies to break themselves up into component parts.</p><p>C. Stronger Antitrust Enforcement Against Mergers and Anticompetitive Conduct</p><p>First, the Department of Justice or Congress should recreate vertical merger guidelines to prohibit mergers that create anticompetitive market structures. These guidelines should establish \"bright lines\" for market share thresholds that make enforcement simple and market expectations clear.</p><p>Second, policymakers should establish a new strengthened framework for vertical restraints and monopolization. Congress could implement rules by statute, or the FTC could use its Section 5 rule-making authority to bar exclusionary practices by dominant internet platforms. It should also bar the use of dominant platform power to foreclose on or discriminate against competitors using that platform, and bar the use of data acquired as a result of platform dominance in anti-competitive ways.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice brought its antitrust case against Microsoft 18 years ago. The dearth of enforcement in the meantime is partly attributable to legal precedent that imposes high bars for prevailing on monopolization claims. Legal precedent involving monopoly, monopoly leveraging, attempted monopoly, predatory pricing, tying and bundling all require adaptation for Sherman Act Section 2 to optimally serve its purpose of preventing monopolization. Even under existing U.S. law, however, antitrust enforcers have the tools to combat illegal conduct and are beginning to gain the political will as well.</p><p>Immediately, antitrust enforcers should bar Facebook and Google from acquiring competitive threats and companies that fortify their monopoly power. Enforcers should also unwind anticompetitive deals to open up competition and sue to stop exclusionary practices.</p><p>The antitrust laws, however, should not be used against journalists who collectively negotiate against tech platforms. The Open Markets Institute thus supports the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act proposed by Representative Cicilline. Although Open Markets ordinarily does not favor exemptions from the antitrust laws, this measure is now necessary due to the absence of bargaining power against tech platform monopolists. The exemption is structured in a way that is limited in scope and duration.</p><p>D. Interoperability</p><p>Policymakers should impose interoperability requirements to end the chokehold over the flow of commerce.</p><p>Interoperability requirements for tech platforms would be a mechanism to organize procompetitive regulations to reduce the market power of any specific choke point for information flow. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a branch of the Commerce Department designed to organize standards. It has promulgated standards recently on fingerprinting technology, SMART grid interoperability frameworks, industrial control system security, and cybersecurity. NIST and the FTC could jointly serve as a convening body for the development of interoperability standards for platform.</p><p>Interoperability requirements would allow competitors to emerge by reducing entry barriers to competition. Such requirements were imposed by both regulators and antitrust enforcers against ATandT and by antitrust enforcers in US v. Microsoft. n38</p><p>E. Data Privacy Rules</p><p>Policymakers need to restore the bargaining leverage of publishers and the ability of individuals to protect their right not to be tracked.</p><p>Since the late 1990s, consumer groups and technologists have been proposing various mechanisms to enable more consumer control. One popular idea is a Do Not Track list, a global list maintained by the Federal government barring collection of personalized data across the web by companies whose business model is largely studying, monitoring, or analyzing user behavior. Such a Do Not Track list would mean a single toggle switch for a citizen in which that citizen could prevent third-party tracking of their data or use of that data by an intermediary whose business model is oriented around behavioral manipulation or targeting.</p><p>Such a law, if structured and implemented well, could reorient bargaining power and protect privacy towards institutions that build trusted relationships with users by creating useful content. Each entity in the market - whether an entertainment website or the New York Times - would have to compete with each other with only the data they have on each user from a first-party relationship.</p><p>A related concept would simply bar the tracking of individuals for personalized behavioral ad targeting and the combination of personalized third-party data for such targeting. Individually targeted ads would be legal when the user has a first-party relationship with a publisher, but that targeting can only use data acquired from that relationship.</p><p>For instance, the New York Times can segment and target its readers with ads, but only based on their use of the New York Times apps and website. Facebook, however, could not individually target users with ads based on their purchase of Mastercard data, or their acquisition of data through social plug-ins on third-party sites, or their use of the Facebook Audience Network. Such a market structure would prohibit publishers from using data not acquired in that direct relationship with the publisher.</p><p>Implementing either policy would end up protecting the rights of publishers to control their subscriber and user data, because publishers have a first-party relationship with their audience. Publishers would be allowed to engage in granular targeting, but the use of third-party user-specific data to engage in ad targeting would be significantly restricted. In this framework, you can only target your own readers. This would restore the power imbalance in the market and reduce intermediaries to their rightful place of matching ad buyers and publishers.</p><p>VI. Conclusion</p><p>At the Open Markets Institute, we believe the American people have both a right and a duty to use government to ensure the independence and financial viability of both national and locally based news organizations. As a country, we have been here before. We have stood up to powerful tech monopolists. Each time, we were better for it. We unleashed new waves of innovation. We dispersed opportunity. We restored our markets and removed gatekeepers. But if we don't act now to change the structure of our markets, titans will continue to control speech, journalism will continue to suffer, and so will our democracy.</p><p>n1 \"Facebook Ad Revenue Tops $10bn,\" BBC News.

Our mission is to make the internet safe for free enterprise and for free expression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We work to promote the integrity and availability of the global internet and are significantly engaged in issues in the states, in Washington, and in international internet governance organizations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New developments in markets and in business-to-business and business-to-consumer relationships show robust competition and innovation</p><p>The online environment is robust, healthy, and market players are numerous. For consumers, prices are low. For small businesses, opportunity and entrepreneurship are growing. And these results are because competition is robust.</p><p>Today, American consumers have more choices and more information than ever. Historically, consumers had to rely upon only a handful of nearby businesses from which to purchase products and services. These businesses could set prices higher than competitors located further away, and customers had a difficult time researching the comparative value and quality of options.</p><p>Today, thanks to the internet, consumers have access to a smorgasbord of products, businesses, and information about pricing. With a couple of clicks customers can find the lowest prices for goods they want. No longer limited to just nearby stores, the internet enables customers to buy from hundreds of thousands of stores across the country.</p><p>Online services have evolved to help consumers find the lowest prices. Websites such as Slickdeals n2 help consumers find active discounts. Services such as Honey n3 enable real-time price comparison and coupon testing at checkout. Today, customers can easily find the products they want at the lowest prices.</p><p>For businesses, the internet has reduced barriers to entry and increased their potential marketplace. Now an art student can easily sell paintings from her studio to anyone around the world, without first obtaining access to dealers and conceding markups to galleries. A parent can sell their childrens' old toys in a large market rather than relying on a one-day neighborhood yard sale. Anyone can compete with any business, big or small.</p><p>There is no dearth of competition. The marketplace has never been more competitive.</p><p>Large platforms help small businesses</p><p>Anti-business advocates claim that \"big is bad.\" But for America's small and mid-size businesses, the bigger the platform the better for reaching larger audiences.</p><p>Consider the local custom furniture store. Just fifteen years ago businesses like this could barely afford to place an ad in a local newspaper, let alone on TV or radio. Thanks to large online platforms, for less than ten dollars a small business can reach thousands of potential customers and target them more accurately than ever.</p><p>Large online platforms have given new growth opportunities to America's small businesses. Consider the app stores on the Apple and Android platforms. Developers can reach markets of millions of customers. And the costs for a developer to distribute an app are intentionally low, to empower small developers to compete. Fifteen years ago, this was only possible through significant outlays for advertising, distribution, and logistics to move software to customers.</p><p>And even if developers decide to not publish their apps in the Android or Apple marketplaces, they can make their services available via device websites.</p><p>Or consider how the platforms Etsy and eBay enable small sellers to find customers across the country and even around the world.</p><p>These benefits are the result of allowing online platforms to grow and flourish because America's antitrust law has relied upon the consumer welfare standard to regulate that growth.</p><p>Polling shows that Americans oppose government limitations on business acquisitions and Americans do not see consumers as the chief beneficiaries of big-tech breakups</p><p>Polling of Americans conducted by Zogby Analytics and commissioned by NetChoice found overwhelming opposition to limitations on acquisitions by large online platforms. n4 Moreover, this polling found overwhelming concern with breaking-up large online platforms.</p><p>Question: Some groups are calling for the break-up of large tech businesses. Who do you believe would most benefit from a break-up?</p><p>* 28% of those with an opinion said, \"Consumers\" would most benefit.</p><p>* 53% of those with an opinion said, \"Traditional industries competing with tech businesses\" and \"Anti-business groups\" would most benefit.</p><p>Question: If an online business becomes successful, should the government prevent them from acquiring any tech startups that seek to be acquired?</p><p>* 86% of those with an opinion said \"No\"</p><p>That same polling shows that:</p><p>* Only 10% of Americans think the government should prevent successful online businesses from acquiring other companies.</p><p>Americans said that the government should most focus its anticompetitive resources on sectors other than tech.</p><p>When asked:</p><p>* Only 5% of Americans say the government should most focus its anticompetitive enforcement on tech platforms. n5</p><p>To compare:</p><p>* 29% of Americans say the government should most focus its anticompetitive enforcement on pharmaceutical companies, and</p><p>* 11% of Americans say the government should most focus on the electricity and gas industry.</p><p>These findings are also seen in an NBC poll, \"By a more emphatic 68% to 28%, respondents said such decisions [about big-tech breakups] should be left to the free market rather than government.\" n6</p><p>While a Wall Street Journal - NBC poll shows that a majority of users have privacy concerns, there are other findings that are far more relevant to today's hearing. For example, their polling shows that Americans have very positive feelings about the large platforms (see image below). n7</p><p>Disruptive and generational changes in technology provide new avenues for competition</p><p>With changes in technology, and in particular the growth of online platforms, we've seen a breakdown of barriers for new entrants into established markets. Rapid innovation, combined with low barriers to entry, forces existing businesses to innovate and compete.</p><p>Despite claims by some that \"consumers are locked into large platforms and will not leave\" public opinion and consumer behavior shows just the opposite.</p><p>When it comes to online shopping the growth of new market entrants like Jet.com and Rakuten show competition is robust. Online search enjoys robust competition, too. For local search Americans choose from Yelp, TripAdvisor, UrbanSpoon, and Angie's List to name a few. For travel searches there are Expedia, Travelocity, Kayak, and many others. More shoppers start their product searches on Amazon than on Google. n8 And for general search we've the incredible growth of new search engines like DuckDuckGo. n9</p><p>As Yelp describes it in its latest earnings report, \"We compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and we expect competition to intensify further in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants.\" n10</p><p>Competition is only an innovation away.</p><p>Nationwide polling conducted by Zogby Analytics and commissioned by NetChoice n11 showed consumers can and do leave platforms when better options are available.</p><p>Question: Do you think that the services offered by online platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon can be replaced if a better competitor comes along?</p><p>* 70% of those with an opinion said \"Yes\"</p><p>Online advertising is competitive and new competitors are growing fast</p><p>In the online advertising environment it is clear that there is robust competition to serve advertisers.</p><p>But regulators should first question why they are limiting any market analysis to an \"online environment.\" Rather than look only at the online market, regulators should expand their analysis and market definition to cover all advertising - including television, radio, and newspapers. When it comes to these three markets they are often controlled by a few large players. Moreover, advertising on TV and radio stations is exclusively controlled by the owners.</p><p>Rather than look at online advertising in a vacuum, it is incumbent on regulators to look at consumers as multi-homing. Americans no longer spend so much time watching broadcast television or listening to the radio.</p><p>Americans now engage in multitasking - surfing the web on their phones while watching a sporting event, for example. In that scenario there is an overlap in advertising and regulators should include this overlap in their analysis.</p><p>Second, if regulators incorrectly limit their market analysis to only online advertising, they should discover that the online market is clearly competitive and new entrants are growing.</p><p>While Google and Facebook remain the two largest online advertising platforms, Amazon's service is catching up fast.</p><p>From the Wall Street Journal: n12</p><p>Amazon's ad revenue is expected to increase to $15 billion in 2020, or just under 10% of the digital ad market share in the U.S., from $11.3 billion in 2019 and an 8.8% share, according to the latest forecast.</p><p>LumaSCAPE n13 (below) shows just how diverse and complex the online advertising ecosystem is.</p><p>With such prolific diversity among advertising platforms, ad exchanges, and ad networks, it is clear that competition is robust. And using Amazon as an example, growth for new competitors is happening.</p><p>Failure of anti-business proponents to prove their case</p><p>Proponents of breaking-up tech companies via new theories of antitrust have failed to substantiate their allegations - even though the burden of proof rests with these accusers.</p><p>Consider Sen. Elizabeth Warren's Medium post, n14 where she proclaims Facebook and Google as \"monopolies\" while ignoring their actual market share and growing competition in every market they serve.</p><p>With less than 20 million U.S. users, Facebook's messaging tool WhatsApp is much smaller than Apple's iMessage, which connects over 90 million American consumers.</p><p>TikTok, a fairly new competitor in the social media market, has over half a billion users worldwide.</p><p>And in search, Google's competition is a click away as we see the rapid ascent of new general search engines like DuckDuckGo n15 and Google competes with tailored search like Yelp for restaurants and AngiesList for services.</p><p>The consumer welfare standard looks to overall consumer welfare and economic efficiency as the main factors when engaging in antitrust analysis.</p><p>These American businesses are not consumer-harming monopolies as some claim but are social networking services that have earned global success in a competitive marketplace.</p><p>American success stories, such as Google, Apple, and Facebook, empower small businesses to reach new customers all over the world like never before. From online marketplaces, to app stores, to photo sharing services, these platforms allow individuals to connect with the world in ways only dreamt of twenty years ago.</p><p>We have seen other anti-business proclamations without facts from Tim Wu, who fails to make a substantive case throughout his book, The Curse of Bigness, despite having 300 pages in which to do so.</p><p>Consider one of Wu's first points. He cites indexes showing fewer large firms as evidence of consolidation. But Wu ignores similar indexes showing the resurgence in small firms.</p><p>The Kauffman Index of Growth Entrepreneurship shows that entrepreneurship is at its highest levels since 2008. Main street growth and startup activity are likewise up. n16 The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found self-employment is up since 2014 and is projected to grow at 7.9% -- faster than the projected rate for all workers. n17 This shows the inherent danger in making snap-decisions that ignore market changes over time.</p><p>In essence, there is a direct correlation between the growth of small entrepreneurs and online platforms like eBay, Facebook, and Google. These platforms are helping small businesses the same way a large retailer operates as an anchor for a shopping center or mall.</p><p>The larger these platforms grow means the more customers small businesses can reach with better targeting and lower costs. To America's entrepreneurs, bigger is better when finding a platform for the most effective advertising. 58% of Americans, and 73% of those between 18 and 24 years old, say online platforms helped them discover a small business they had not previously known. n18</p><p>Tim Wu sees a world where one business controls the market and once it has dominance, it raises prices on consumers and businesses. Take for example the oil industry, the example around which Wu bases his theory.</p><p>But under the existing consumer welfare standard, if big oil uses market power to raise prices, that would violate our existing antitrust standards. Moreover, Wu ignores President Teddy Roosevelt's apprehension about the break-up. Roosevelt lamented, \"I do not see what good can come from dissolving the Standard Oil Company into 40 separate companies.\" n19</p><p>Wu also cites actions against ATandT and IBM as evidence of antitrust failures. So, while Wu thinks he has found a slam-dunk argument against the consumer welfare standard, he actually shows that the current antitrust system and standards work effectively.</p><p>Back in 2010, Tim Wu complained n20 that Facebook's size alone precludes new entrants. Yet Wu's prognostications missed emerging Facebook competitors Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit, YouTube, and LinkedIn. And since 2010, we've seen the rise of additional social media competitors like Twitch, TikTok, Pinterest, and Tumblr.</p><p>Likewise, Tim Wu and Sen. Warren complain about businesses giving preference to their own products ahead of others. But it's become expected for retailers - online and off - to offer their own brands to consumers seeking lower cost alternatives from a producer they trust.</p><p>For example, Costco features its Kirkland brand in stores. Safeway features its O Organics and Signature Cafe brands. Kohl's is known for its Tony Hawk brand while Macy's has over 20 of its own private label brands. Trader Joe's and Aldi markets prominently feature their proprietary products.</p><p>If the prosecutor fails to prove their case, as Sen. Warren, Tim Wu, and their allies have, then governmental action cannot be justified.</p><p>Reviewing merger consent decrees</p><p>When the termination date of a merger or acquisition consent decree is approaching, that is a prime opportunity to do a second review of market conditions and company conduct. The overseeing agency should review the current market and identify whether the concerns that gave rise to the earlier consent decree remain relevant. If those concerns are no longer relevant, the consent decree should be allowed to expire.</p><p>However, if pre-acquisition or pre-merger concerns remain, or the company shows evidence of anti-competitive behavior, then the consent decree should be extended.</p><p>For example, the approved merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation was subject to a 10-year consent decree that expires in 2020. n21 This approved vertical merger allowed the dominant ticketing platform to merge with the largest promoter of concerts.</p><p>When reviewing the Ticketmaster-Live Nation transaction in 2010, the Department of Justice raised concerns that \"This loss of competition likely would result in higher prices for and less innovation in primary ticketing services.\" n22 The DoJ was prescient: in the decade since that merger, Ticketmaster continues to maintain a market share of 70-80% in primary ticket sales. n23</p><p>Ticketmaster and Live Nation are now expanding efforts to control event ticketing transactions, by restricting how fans sell or give away their tickets. They are preventing resale of tickets on non-Ticketmaster platforms, using their dominance in primary ticket sales to prohibit competition with respect to ticket resales.</p><p>In addition to using terms and conditions, technology, and business conditions with their partners to restrict transferability of tickets amongst consumers, n24 Ticketmaster-Live Nation also uses threats of retaliation to dominate the ticket market and impede competition. n25</p><p>Any objective review of Ticketmaster-Live Nation would conclude that the consent decree is not working. This is a prime example of where oversight agencies should use their merger review powers to maintain a competitive marketplace that serves consumer interests and institute remedies that will ensure competition in the ticket industry.</p><p>Congress should proceed carefully when hearing calls to \"break-up\" technology businesses - no matter how loudly a few are complaining. Instead, Congress should retain and protect the model on which consumers and business have relied and it has and will continue to work - the consumer welfare standard for antitrust</p><p>We thank you for your consideration and look forward to your questions.</p><p>n1 NetChoice is a trade association of e-Commerce and online businesses, at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.netchoice.org\">www.netchoice.org</url> The views expressed here do not necessarily represent the views of every NetChoice member company.</p><p>n2 Slickdeals.net</p><p>n3 JoinHoney.com</p><p>n5 Id</p><p>n6 John Harwood, Americans don't support Sen.

I commend you for examining these issues that affect American consumers and the interests of U.S. businesses, both here and abroad. It is my hope that I can offer some helpful perspective, as former Acting Chairman and Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission and a longtime antitrust practitioner, that will assist the Committee with this important effort.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In reaction to today's increasingly connected and technology-driven economy, there is a perception in some quarters that antitrust needs to change. Some have asserted that increasing business concentration has reduced competition across the economy; n1 that antitrust officials lack the tools to address competitive issues involving technology-enabled business models; and that antitrust should address the size and conduct of large firms, especially successful online platforms, regardless of whether it affects the competitive process. n2 In their view, current events have overtaken the hard-won political consensus that antitrust should principally focus on protecting consumers, and they urge changing the rules of antitrust to intervene more aggressively in markets to pursue a wide variety of goals other than consumer welfare.</p><p>Given the clear consumer benefits of technology-driven innovation, I am concerned about adopting an approach that will diminish the focus on consumer interests in the pursuit of other, perhaps even conflicting, goals. But believing that consumer welfare is the appropriate goal of antitrust does not mean being passive or embracing the view that antitrust in the pursuit of consumer welfare cannot be improved. Antitrust law has evolved as our understanding of market dynamics has gotten more sophisticated, and it should continue to adapt as we refine our predictive tools. If those tools suggest that competition will be harmed and consumers made worse off from the behavior of any firm, antitrust enforcers should act.</p><p>I have devoted much of my professional career to efforts to safeguard and foster competition, and I believe in its key role in fostering economic growth and innovation. n3 As the Supreme Court recently observed, \"Federal antitrust law is a central safeguard for the Nation's free market structures.\" n4 And, in our system of limited government, it is appropriate that antitrust agencies look to the law as interpreted by the courts for guidance in pursuing their enforcement work. In fact, my experience as an antitrust enforcer suggests that a successful antitrust case rests on three pillars: a secure foundation in the law, a solid factual basis, and strong economic evidence of an anticompetitive outcome.</p><p>Thus, I firmly support regular evaluation of antitrust enforcement with the aim of improving its ability to predict, prevent, and address anticompetitive mergers and conduct in all sectors of the economy. Any assessment of the state of antitrust enforcement should necessarily entail an understanding of 1) antitrust law as interpreted by the courts, 2) the application of that law to particular types of anticompetitive behavior in defined markets, and 3) the boundaries between antitrust law and regulation.</p><p>I. What is an antitrust violation?</p><p>Turning to the legal standard, I will address the foundational issue of what is an antitrust violation. A defining quality of an antitrust violation is the elimination or weakening of a market constraint on a firm's power to set the terms of its market interactions. This can be achieved through a collusive agreement among competitors, a merger between current or likely future competitors, or by the exclusionary conduct of a company with market power. We sometimes think of an antitrust offense in terms of anticompetitive effects, but, properly understood, it is how the scrutinized conduct affects the universe of market constraints facing the relevant firm. In other words, we examine the impact on the \"competitive process\" through which a firm makes its decisions on price, quality, and the need to innovate, among other terms. A good formulation of this concept as applied to a particular type of antitrust violation appears in the FTC and DOJ Horizontal Merger Guidelines. n5</p><p>I do not mean to say, of course, that negative market outcomes are irrelevant in antitrust law. To the contrary, antitrust enforcers should direct their limited resources to areas where consumers are suffering from or are likely to experience harms such as higher prices, reduced quality, or fewer innovative offerings. In commentators' zeal to scrutinize business conduct and protect consumers, however, sometimes simply the size or conduct of large players become synonymous with a problem that antitrust enforcement can solve.</p><p>Having identified a \"problem\" in the economy, some want to correct it by condemning certain observed behavior by large online platforms, even if that behavior did not lift a competitive constraint on the firm's market power. But simply condemning a particular structure or term of dealing in markets with large online platforms divorced from its impact on consumers is not the purpose of antitrust. n6 It is a regulatory action meant to reengineer market outcomes to reflect values other than market competition, such as fairness, consumer privacy, n7 or the protection of small business. By contrast, antitrust violations involve a restraint, practice, or acquisition that removes a market constraint on a firm's behavior. n8</p><p>This definition of antitrust hews to the core premise of the Sherman Act, which is our belief that a market economy, free of private restraints and unnecessarily burdensome regulations, produces superior outcomes over time. n9 This is a time-honored idea; for example, in its 1978 opinion, National Society of Professional Engineers, the Supreme Court embraced the \"assumption that competition is the best method of allocating resources in a free market[.]\" n10</p><p>The Supreme Court also clearly expressed this position in its Trinko opinion, which dealt with a lawsuit that accused Verizon of monopolizing a telecommunications market by not sufficiently interconnecting with competitive local exchange carriers. n11 Reversing the Second Circuit, the Supreme Court dismissed the antitrust claim, even though the compulsory-access requirements of the 1996 Telecommunications Act may have produced lower prices, greater output, and more varied choice for consumers. But liability did not turn on whether exclusion caused higher prices. Something more fundamental was at stake.</p><p>In the Court's view, markets encourage competition only if prevailing firms can reap what they sow. Taking away that prize would undermine the competitive process, replacing market forces with a more \"competitive\" market structure featuring low prices, but lacking incentives that drive investment in infrastructure, technology, and advancement. n12 Hence, the Court's famous observation that \"charging . . . monopoly prices . . . is an important element of the free-market system.\" n13</p><p>In sum, antitrust enforcers should intervene only when firms are or are likely to corrupt the competitive process and gain or maintain market power through means other than competition on the merits, such as by colluding with rivals, merging with competitors to reduce competition, or, for a firm with market power, engaging in exclusionary conduct that does not benefit competition on balance. This allows antirust to foster the incentives in our free market system that reward the players that best meet consumer demands, which over time leads to greater innovation in the economy.</p><p>II. How have enforcers applied antitrust law to particular anticompetitive behavior in defined markets?</p><p>Antitrust law's focus on protecting the competitive process does not mean that it cannot reach many of the competitive concerns raised by today's commentators, as long as there is sufficient factual and economic evidence of cognizable competitive harm under the antitrust laws. These concerns may include price effects, reductions in quality, n14 and impacts on innovation, as well as the ability of a dominant player to acquire and neutralize a nascent competitor. I'd like to offer some facts and examples to show what U.S. enforcers have been able to accomplish in recent years.</p><p>Antitrust enforcers generally agree that mergers creating durable market power do not serve consumers well. Thus, the pace of merger enforcement at the antitrust agencies in recent decades has generally varied on the basis of overall economic activity rather than on the political affiliation of the administration. For example, during my time as the Acting Chairman, when the FTC had only one Republican member and one Democratic member, the FTC identified a total of 32 proposed mergers with significant competition concerns. Of these, the agency accepted a consent agreement to protect consumers in 19 cases, with the balance of these deals either abandoned in the face of our challenge or contested in litigation. n15 At one point, the FTC had ten competition matters in active litigation at the same time, with three more on appeal, which approached historic levels of activity. And the action didn't stop at merger review; the FTC also brought forward nine different conduct cases, including several challenging anticompetitive behavior by drug manufacturers.</p><p>I would like to highlight our challenge to the merger between CDK and Auto/Mate. n16 The fact pattern was essentially a large, established firm with a substantial share of the market buying a relatively small upstart that had enjoyed some recent success and appeared poised to challenge the market leaders more aggressively. The market was concentrated and barriers to meaningful entry were substantial. To be sure, there was some current competition between the firms, but the greatest concern we identified during the investigation was the likely future competition that would be lost, should Auto/Mate be absorbed by CDK.</p><p>Some have questioned whether the existing antitrust paradigm can ever reach this kind of behavior, where a big player squashes or absorbs a promising upstart before it can ultimately grow into a more substantial competitor. The CDK-Auto/Mate action shows that the antitrust law can address this competitive issue if the facts and economic evidence support it. As a counterexample, the FTC was unsuccessful in challenging the Steris merger based on a loss of potential competition, which the court ultimately failed to sustain on factual grounds. n17 Again, the three pillars are essential to successful enforcement, as they should be.</p><p>I'd like to say a few words about so-called \"vertical mergers,\" which have been a hot topic in the antitrust world of late. A \"vertical\" merger is one in which the parties do not directly compete, instead operating on different levels of the supply chain. A classic example would be a manufacturer merging with its distributor or retailers selling its products, and there are many recent examples in the tech sector as well, including Apple's purchase of music-recognition app Shazam, and Google's acquisition of ITA Software and its flight-search engine.</p><p>The vast majority of vertical arrangements are pro-competitive. n18 FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson, has convincingly laid out the reasons why: vertical deals eliminate no head-to-head competition in any market, create cost-saving benefits such as the elimination of double-marginalization, incentivize investment by aligning upstream and downstream incentives, and are confirmed to be typically procompetitive by retrospective analyses, such as those collected by the Global Antitrust Institute. n19 Vertical mergers can, however, raise antitrust concerns when the parties gain an ability and incentive to foreclose their rivals from a significant portion of the market. Thus, as with horizontal mergers, vertical deals should be evaluated case-by-case based on all the available evidence and not pre-judged based on the size of the parties or concerns outside of preserving market competition.</p><p>It is true that some technology-fueled markets, including but not limited to markets with online platforms, may present interesting analytical challenges to antitrust enforcers if they have significant network effects, high switching costs, and resulting barriers to entry. But these issues are not unique to these markets, and their implications have been well studied by economists and antitrust lawyers alike. They have also made their way into the body of antitrust case law over the past few decades, providing legal roadmaps for future enforcement cases. The necessary tools exist today to account for these market characteristics. However, reverting to my three pillars for successful enforcement, the mere presence of network effects does not necessarily support a conclusion of an anticompetitive market outcome. n20</p><p>Even with the best analytical tools and intentions, though, no enforcer can get it right 100% of the time, which is why I agree that occasional retrospective reviews of mergers and enforcement remedies are very important. And the agencies regularly undertake such reviews, probing the effectiveness of their past decisions and using that information to inform future enforcement. For example, in 2017 the FTC updated its divestiture study to examine seven years' worth of remedies, taking a hard look at whether each remedy succeeded in preserving competition. n21 While the overall prognosis was positive, the results showed that FTC-approved divestitures of limited asset packages had a higher failure rate than divestitures of whole business lines. The FTC staff took that information to heart and used it immediately to apply more scrutiny to proposed asset packages in deals under review. A limited number of retrospectives of prior deals, using the best available economic analysis, could provide similarly helpful insights, though I would caution against doing this routinely as it would divert resources away from the important job of enforcement.</p><p>I should also note that the agencies can and do review already-consummated mergers and order divestitures when justified by the facts and law. This occurs most commonly in mergers that fall below the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act reporting thresholds, such as the 2008 Polypore-Microporous n22 acquisition that was finally unwound in 2013 following a challenge by the FTC, and the Commission's current challenge to the Otto Bock/Freedom Innovations merger. n23</p><p>But trying to \"unscramble the eggs\" through a divestiture remedy long after a merger has been consummated, or using a breakup as a remedy in a conduct matter, is a drastic step that carries serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers. As pointed out by the D.C. Circuit in the Microsoft case, the dissolution of an already-unified company is rife with \"logistical difficulty,\" and should be \"imposed only with great caution, in part because its long-term efficacy is rarely certain.\" n24 Such a remedy could actually reduce consumer welfare if the breakup leaves the company unable to innovate or with higher costs. As Frank Easterbrook noted many years ago, breaking up particularly innovative firms risks chilling innovation, because as \"innovations and other forms of information become a larger and larger fraction of the cost of production, breaking up firms with substantial market positions imposes greater and greater costs\" as the reward for all their RandD is dispersed. n25 Aside from practical concerns, divestitures in monopoly cases require a particularly \"significant causal connection between the [challenged] conduct and creation or maintenance of the market power.\" n26 I agree with my former FTC colleague, Commissioner Noah Phillips, that breaking up established companies, even those credibly accused of monopolistic conduct, is a \"treatment [that] may be worse than the disease,\" and should be a last resort for the most inveterate antitrust offenders. n27</p><p>The current state of antitrust law may in very limited circumstances allow for divestiture when a prior merger is demonstrably anticompetitive, but prophylactic enforcement is a much-preferred solution wherever possible. Whatever enforcement direction the agencies take, they should be careful not to create a kind of \"antitrust double jeopardy\" where previously cleared deals are subject to a \"do-over\" investigation solely due to a change in political winds. The primary focus should be on getting it right the first time, based on provable facts and sound economics, which will respect procedural fairness and better preserve benefits for consumers.</p><p>Mergers are not the only area of competitive concern and other recent enforcement efforts targeted firms using a dominant position to exclude competition, such as FTC's action against McWane for exclusionary conduct against rival manufacturers, n28 as well as the DOJ's continual efforts in the criminal sphere to uproot and squelch price-fixing and other antitrust conspiracies that deprive consumers of the benefit of competition. n29 In the latter category, the FTC and DOJ's joint efforts to crack down on no-poach agreements that stifle wages and other employee benefits, including a new criminal enforcement policy, have built on the DOJ's enforcement actions against numerous tech companies with anticompetitive \"no cold call\" agreements.</p><p>I believe antitrust can and should address such anticompetitive behavior by any company, including innovative technology companies, as set forth in the thoughtful D.C. Circuit opinion in the Microsoft matter. n30 Among other things, that case teaches that under current antitrust law a dominant provider must maintain its position through legitimate competition on the merits, rather than through exclusionary conduct that has little or no purpose beyond disadvantaging rivals. n31</p><p>The Microsoft decision stands for the proposition that monopolists can improve their products to better serve their customers just like any other market participant. But enforcers will not tolerate the use of market position to short-circuit competition on the merits. In essence, monopolists need to fend off their rivals the same way other firms do, by doing things better than the next guy. This standard leaves enforcers plenty of room to attack the kind of exclusionary conduct the antitrust laws are meant to address.</p><p>In sum, I believe that today's antitrust paradigm can confront meaningful competitive harm in the modern, digitally mediated economy but that antitrust enforcement should always turn on the specific facts of each individual case and the likelihood of actual consumer harm. Enforcers can and should bring cases in these areas when the interests of consumers are threatened and should continue to refine their tools to better identify when such consumer harm is likely to occur. Through this approach, enforcement can pursue the goal of antitrust as articulated by the Supreme Court, which is to protect free and open markets for the benefit of consumers.</p><p>III. What are the boundaries between antitrust and regulation?</p><p>Conversely, competition enforcers should not intervene simply because they dislike certain market outcomes. Antitrust is about protecting the process, not guaranteeing a particular result at a particular time. Our free market system rests on the conclusion that markets in which firms must endure competitive pressures will produce favorable outcomes in terms of price, output, quality, and innovation in the long run. But if some competitors seem to be winning the race at a point in time, we should not use antitrust enforcement to hamper them or to require them to compete less aggressively, as long as they are not corrupting the competitive process. As the Supreme Court observed in National Society of Professional Engineers even \"occasional exceptions to the presumed consequences of competition\" are not grounds for antitrust enforcement. n32</p><p>We should also carefully examine some of the assumptions made by those who would seek a more interventionist role for competition enforcement involving online platforms, which are present in many sectors. Perhaps the most troubling assumption here is that regulators can divine how new technologies should develop and where and how they should be used. Our enforcement agencies are specialists in analyzing and enforcing antitrust law, not in divining the next big innovation in technology-based offerings. n33</p><p>In considering whether to replace antitrust with a detailed regulatory structure, we should think about some of the subsidiary questions that would require the government to decide. n34 Can these technology firms branch out into new markets, or must they narrowly focus on their original, core competency? When a technology company lowers prices, should that be permitted by regulators because it helps consumers or prohibited because it makes some other business less likely to succeed? How should a regulator weigh these effects against each other?</p><p>Also, even well-intentioned regulatory interventions can have unintended, substantial negative impacts on competition, as the recent adoption of the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) in Europe demonstrates. A recent op ed by several economists described the results of their study on the impact of GDPR on investment in Europe, which found the observed effects on small technology firms \"were immediate, pronounced, and negative.\" n35</p><p>Furthermore, the U.S. has consistently been a strong voice globally in advocating for competition law to focus on consumer welfare goals and not to include other policy goals. I fear that abandoning this clear position in the U.S. will encourage regimes around the world to pursue industrial policy goals, such as favoring domestic industry, to the detriment of U.S. consumer and business interests. n36</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I hope my remarks have provided some helpful context on the role of antitrust law in protecting competition, including in markets with online platforms. This nation's antitrust enforcers have many tools in their arsenal to combat anticompetitive mergers and practices by any company, including platforms, but these tools are powered by the facts and evidence specific to each case, as they should be in our system of limited government. We should reflect very carefully before asking our enforcers to go beyond this well-established mission of antitrust.</p><p>n1 Starting in 2016, some journalists and others observed industry census data; noted that concentration across certain broad industry classifications like retail, transportation, finance, and utilities had risen; and saw that firms' returns on invested capital had increased. From this information, they inferred that monopoly power was rising and called for stricter antitrust enforcement. However, industry classifications identified by the Census Bureau are not antitrust markets and shifting trends in concentration do not necessarily reflect lost competition. Some markets have diminishing long-run average-cost curves, while others produce dominant firms or oligopolies due to superior efficiency or innovation. The arguments about increased concentration overlooked those critical nuances, as well as other key factors. See Maureen K. Ohlhausen, Does the U.S. Economy Lack Competition?, 1 Criterion J. on Innovation 47 (2016). Other scholars also observed these shortcomings.

If there is likely no efficiency loss because of the conduct or transaction, another legal avenue for enforcement is more appropriate and efficient. Second, the scope of the potential harm also should aid in the choice of law. Antitrust laws are focused on broader, macroeconomic harms, mainly the maintenance of efficient price discovery in the markets, whereas the consumer protection laws are preoccupied with ensuring the integrity of each specific contractual bargain. These are complementary, but discrete, enforcement goals. Third, and finally, the available remedies must be able to address effectively the potential harm. Enjoining a merger may do little to prevent a privacy violation if the parties can simply share the same consumer information under a contractual arrangement.\")</p><p>n8 That is not to say that non-pecuniary values are irrelevant to antitrust; antitrust protects the market process by which consumers express their preferences.

This reduction takes place in both the intensive margin (the average dollar amount raised per round of funding, which decreased 39%) and the extensive margin (the number of deals, which incurred a 17% average drop). GDPR's effect is particularly pronounced for young (0-3 year old) EU ventures, where an average reduction of 19% in the number of deals is observed.

If GDPR leads to fewer new ventures and less capital per venture, there could be fewer jobs as a result. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the investment reduction for young ventures could translate into a yearly loss between 3,604 to 29,819 jobs in the EU, corresponding to 4.09% to 11.20% of jobs created by 0-3 year old ventures in our sample.)</p><p>n36 See Prepared Statement of the FTC Before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law \"International Antitrust Enforcement: China and Beyond\" (June 7, 2016) (\"We have long advocated that competition law be applied with the goal of protecting competitive markets and promoting consumer welfare, and to all market participants in a non-discriminatory manner.

I am honored to offer my perspective during this critical moment in history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The data-driven digital marketplace now touches almost every facet of the human experience: in our homes, our workplaces, our schools, our hospitals, our cars, and even our relationships and our understanding of the world. The list is endless.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Around the globe, there is a growing consensus that today's tech titans operating data-intensive platforms pose a threat to innovation and to new business formation. Government studies and reports from the European Commission, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other major economies are raising more questions about whether companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are choking off competition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We cannot and should not live in a country where the corporate royalty of the economy can create market conditions that makes it nearly impossible for new businesses to get off the ground or to compete. Without meaningful competition, we will miss out on the promises of the digital economy.</p><p>As the Committee continues its investigation, it will be important for members of Congress to evaluate evidence with several things in mind, including:</p><p>(1) Data has certain economic features that are unique and unlike other assets.</p><p>(2) Most online services are not actually \"free.\" While consumers and businesses are not paying with dollars, they are paying with data.</p><p>(3) Competition is not a click away. Today's tech titans are wholly integrated throughout the digital world, such that people and businesses cannot avoid them.</p><p>Data as an Asset</p><p>Firms throughout the economy are desperate for our data. It's not just the Big Tech companies or telecommunications companies like Comcast, ATandT, and Verizon. Even the automotive industry is recognizing that collecting and monetizing personal data can be extremely lucrative. Data is clearly an economic asset, since it can produce cash flow over time. Data, however, is unlike other assets and instruments of value.</p><p>First, it is not a finite resource, like precious metals or minerals. In fact, more personal data is created every second. Our location, our searches, and our conversations can all be catalogued.</p><p>Second, data is not \"consumed\" in the traditional sense. If I use grain to make a loaf of bread, that grain cannot be used for something else. Data is different: it can be copied and shared. When one company monetizes the information that the data provides, other actors can extract value out of it, too.</p><p>Third, data gets more valuable as you collect more of it. It has increasing marginal returns. As you collect data across a larger swath of the population, you don't just glean insights on an individual person or business, you can also glean valuable insights on others that interact with them or share common characteristics.</p><p>For example, Amazon recently purchased the Whole Foods grocery chain. Amazon can now connect your purchase history online with your purchases in stores. Because the company knows even more about what you buy, it can make more accurate predictions about you. For example, Amazon can more easily predict when you're on a diet, when you're sick, when you're expecting a new baby, or a whole slew of other conditions and life events. This allows companies like Amazon to adjust offerings - and even prices - based on relevant predictions of what you want to buy and how much you're willing to pay for it.</p><p>As consumers, workers, and citizens, we do not know the extent to which our personal data is being collected by firms and third parties, so even if we wanted to, we could not choose to provide it to another company. The exclusivity of data collection has given a significant advantage to the companies that have been collecting data the longest, have the ability to collect the most types of data from the most people, or have control over a unique data set. In each of these circumstances, the inability to replicate gives data owners control of a key asset. New entrants face significant barriers to entry because they lack the insights from historical data that they can't reproduce. New companies also lack the ability to collect data on the same scale and scope that incumbents can collect it.</p><p>The unique economic features of data have considerable implications for competition. Since data-intensive digital platforms connect buyers and sellers, consumers with advertisers, riders with drivers, and other similar transaction partners, an unregulated market is likely to tip toward a handful of platforms, or even just one. As more users join on a platform, it becomes even more valuable. For example, take the case of Uber, the ride-hailing app that operates on a closed, proprietary platform. As more riders were lured to the platform, this attracted more drivers, which increased availability. Since it is clunky for riders to check many different apps, their best bet is to use the platform that everyone else is using. This is known as a network effect. Network effects are also strong when it comes to search, social media, and so many other digital services.</p><p>Paying with Data, not with Dollars</p><p>If you go to a car dealership and exchange your station wagon for a used SUV, that is a trade. You would never say you got the SUV \"for free.\" But, too often, we mislabel online services as \"free.\"</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook are not charities. They operate massively profitable behavioral advertising businesses built on extracting enormous amounts of data from users. When you watch a YouTube video or scroll through stories on Instagram, this is not the equivalent of reading a newspaper. The behavioral advertising model relies on constant collection of personal data, even while you're consuming content. These services do have a price, and you are paying for them with your data.</p><p>While the price that people pay in dollars is \"zero,\" Google and Facebook reap billions of dollars from us. In 2018, Google generated $116 billion in advertising revenue. n1 That same year, Facebook pulled in $55 billion. n2 The profit margins far exceed those in other key industries of the economy. This means that we are handing over extremely valuable assets to these companies. An economist might say that the real price of using these services should be negative - that is, they should be paying us.</p><p>The true economic value that is exchanged with digital platforms is hard for consumers and businesses to measure. In addition, consumers and businesses using these platforms have no bargaining leverage, and they participate by \"agreeing\" to complex and draconian terms of service. Digital platforms can usually change these terms at any time, granting themselves more ability to collect and use data more expansively and more intensely. This is the equivalent of a price hike.</p><p>In a competitive market, these price hikes would be hard to impose. But, in an uncompetitive market, companies can focus on blocking new entrants and limiting choice to protect their dominance and pricing power.</p><p>Competition is Not a Click Away</p><p>Twenty years ago, it seemed almost unimaginable that a few companies could dominate the web. After all, it was open and non-proprietary. With such low barriers to entry, the next innovator could offer up a better online service; competition was just a click away. In 2004, the website that would eventually become Facebook launched, and I was one of its first users. It was a clear alternative to MySpace, and importantly, this new social network offered far more privacy, since it allowed users to better control who would see their personal information.</p><p>Sadly, many investors and entrepreneurs have come to realize that this isn't really a possibility today. Competition is no longer a click away. Big Tech is now embedded throughout the digital world. These firms have integrated horizontally, vertically, diagonally - and across the web in ways so subtle, you'd need to be able to understand computer code to realize you were being tracked. These platforms have become ubiquitous and unavoidable.</p><p>Earlier this year, journalist Kashmir Hill chronicled her attempts to block Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft from her life. n3 Hill discovered that Amazon controls 23 million IP addresses, preventing her from even accessing certain government websites. n4 Her ability to communicate, engage in commercial transactions, and access basic information was sharply curtailed. If the internet were truly competitive, people could vote with their feet and select services that offer privacy and anonymity.</p><p>Much of this unavoidable surveillance is spurred by the financial incentives of online behavioral advertising, a market big tech firms also dominate. Behavioral advertising promises to target ads to the users most likely to engage with them. Advertisers pay for that engagement - the clicks, likes, video views, and sales conversions. Here, advertisers face the same conundrum as users: participate on Big Tech's terms or not at all. And like users, sitting on the sidelines comes at a high cost. Businesses put themselves at a significant disadvantage if they chose not to advertise. For example, companies that don't advertise on Google may find the link to their website buried after paid ads from their competitors or may not show up when people search for local businesses.</p><p>Absent vigorous competition in online advertising, advertisers won't have the leverage to demand transparency. This advertising model has virtually no independent oversight or accountability mechanisms. An advertiser can tune in to watch its television ad or listen to its radio ad, buy a newspaper or magazine to see its print ad, or drive by to look at its billboard ad. With contextual online advertising, advertisers can see the digital ad by visiting the website they pay to advertise on.</p><p>But the same is not true when you are, for example, paying to get women who like soccer and green shirts to watch your ad on Instagram. As an advertiser, you don't have access to data on which users watched your ad or whether they match your desired profile. Absent a proactive action off the platform like making a purchase or attending an event, advertisers can't easily verify that the engagement took place. Advertisers have few ways to determine if their ad spends match the value provided. Many wish they could independently verify that they are getting the engagement they are paying for and that they are engaging with real people, not bots and fake accounts.</p><p>This is not a theoretical problem. Last week, Facebook agreed to pay millions in a settlement with advertisers, after allegedly inflating the amount of time it said users spent watching videos by allegedly as much as 900 percent. n5 These inflated numbers didn't just harm advertisers. Many also believe that Facebook's false video metrics convinced news outlets to lay off print journalists so they could heavily invest in capitalizing on a supposedly burgeoning video audience.</p><p>Advertisers aren't alone. App developers also few choices on reaching users. As more of our digital lives go mobile, app stores are now a critical gateway to participate in society and the economy - but app stores don't look anything like an open internet. Operators of app stores impose taxes and regulations on app developers, who are often completely dependent on these stores for distribution. This raises concerns about how operators of app stores might preference their own apps over those created by competing developers.</p><p>The Committee's investigation should seek to detail the consequences of this digital dominance. I am particularly concerned that many investors are reluctant to allocate capital to innovators that seek to challenge and disrupt this dominance. Instead, investors tell me they prefer to fund companies that can eventually be sold an incumbent. This distorts digital innovation and the progress that comes along with it.</p><p>Taking Action</p><p>Last year, the Federal Trade Commission convened a series of hearings examining a range of competition and consumer protection issues in digital markets. The FTC staff has outlined next steps for these hearings, including policy outputs and deliverables.</p><p>My top priority is to ensure that our path forward is grounded in reality. In my tenure as commissioner, I have actively advocated for approaching policy and enforcement with rigorous, quantitative understanding of how these markets actually work. The Commission does its best work when it comes to the table with deep knowledge and expertise of a particular market, rather than a superficial or theoretical approach. To this end, I hope that the Commission will pursue work based on Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, n6 which allows the agency to conduct industrywide investigations and studies and making its findings available to the public.</p><p>Given its authority to prohibit unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive trade practices, the FTC is uniquely positioned to tackle the concerns associated with digital platforms. The twin goals of competition and consumer protection are inextricably linked. Most state attorneys general also have statutory authorities related to competition and consumer protection under their \"mini-FTC Acts.\"</p><p>Competition. Antitrust litigation by the FTC, Department of Justice, and state attorneys general can halt exclusionary practices and anticompetitive mergers. If firms engage in behavior for the purpose of impeding entry or stifling an upstart, antitrust law should intervene. Many dominant players in the technology industry are extremely acquisitive, gobbling up companies of all sizes. However, if these acquisitions substantially lessen competition, they are unlawful. Unfortunately, antitrust enforcement is slow and costly. In the past, high-profile cases have taken years to investigate and litigate. In today's environment, this is problematic. We need to figure out ways to act more quickly to prevent harms to innovation.</p><p>In addition, if enforcers uncover unlawful acquisitions or conduct, it is typical to seek asset divestitures as a remedy - but divestitures and spinoffs may be just one piece of the puzzle. We will also need to think carefully about remedies as they pertain to the unique characteristics of data. As such, remedies that eliminate barriers to entry and open access without sacrificing privacy will be particularly compelling.</p><p>When assessing remedies, we have to be mindful of the nuances of how data moves through the digital world. We need to be cautious when applying behavioral remedies that require significant supervision or that might be difficult to assess compliance. Considering the sophistication, scale, and scope of mass data collection, it can be difficult to enforce requirements to limit the use of data, or to give people the right to see and delete their data. Companies are collecting millions of data points at every moment and the government doesn't have the resources or the technical expertise to monitor whether data is being used solely for its intended purpose. And how would a person know if their large data has truly been deleted? Violations of these requirements are usually only detected when a large-scale disaster happens, or when problems are intermittently brought to light by journalists and whistleblowers.</p><p>In light of these challenges, I believe that remedies should not be directed at the data itself, but rather the structural incentives that are leading to the problems in the first place. We have allowed the next generation of the internet to develop as a series of walled gardens that are owned and operated for the benefit of a few dominant players. These companies decide who gets access and who doesn't, and impose taxes and regulations on participants. Behavioral data remedies do little to alter this fundamental structure or to stop privacy-related issues from happening. For example, Facebook immediately and repeatedly violated the FTC's 2012 Order on its data use and sharing practices. The recent proposed settlement gave a lot for Facebook to celebrate. Its business model remained intact, and its executives were all let off the hook. Like an unwieldy schoolyard bully who has been lightly reprimanded, the bad behavior will continue the minute the teacher's back is turned.</p><p>In our economic history, we have seen government interventions that facilitate open technology yielded enormous benefits for American consumers. For example, in 1956, the government remedied the anticompetitive conduct of American Telephone and Telegraph (ATandT) and Western Electric by ordering that the system's intellectual property be made available for public use. n7 This decision unleashed innovation that would eventually lead to the birth of the internet. More recently, the government conditioned the America Online (AOL) and Time Warner merger by requiring that the dominant AOL Instant Messenger chat platform become interoperable, spawning new competition and innovation. n8 The Microsoft antitrust case demonstrated the power of unbundling dominant operating systems from apps that sit on top of it.</p><p>We've also seen this in other industries. Decades ago, we laid the foundation for free and open capital markets by separating banking from commerce, which prevented Wall Street from discriminatory lending practices that would have distorted industries across the economy. n9 In Hollywood, the big studios were banned from owning cinemas, leading to more access to distribution. n10 Importantly, these structural separations did not require complicated oversight and micromanagement, and we can learn from them as we consider remedies for the marketplace problems of today.</p><p>Any remedies should reconsider providing government benefits to companies that continue to abuse them. This could include opening up the intellectual property rights to underlying technologies that power a marketplace. It could also include voiding certain one-sided, take-it-or-leave it contract terms that are typically enforced by our courts. These benefits provide significant value to companies, and should not continue to benefit those that break the law.</p><p>Policymakers should also look at brightline rules and outright bans wherever feasible. Complicated rules often work in favor of those that are already dominant and can pay lawyers to get around them. For example, we should consider whether companies, particularly repeat offenders or dominant players, should be allowed to collect and monetize certain data at all. Historically, we have banned some of this behavior. For example, telephone companies were not allowed to eavesdrop on our phone calls and then sell the information they gleaned. n11</p><p>Outside of litigation, the FTC can engage in competition rulemaking, defining what constitutes an unfair method of competition. n12 These types of rules don't need to place any substantive obligations on firms, but the rules can spell out what type of conduct is lawful or unlawful, creating more certainty. The rulemaking process also allows a diverse set of stakeholders to participate, rather than just a government plaintiff and a single corporate defendant. Competition authorities around the world have recognized these benefits. n13 In fact, some have already begun to draft rulemaking that addresses the growing concerns associated with digital platforms.</p><p>Consumer Protection. Competition cannot solve all problems, especially when dominant firms can cheat consumers and businesses. Unfair or deceptive practices can also be motivated by a firm's desire to maintain its monopoly or dominant position.</p><p>To halt and redress unfair or deceptive trade practices, the FTC and state attorneys general can investigate, sue, and often seek penalties for unlawful conduct. There is one particular menace in today's marketplace that warrants serious attention from policymakers and regulators: the click-through contract.</p><p>When it comes to dominant players with significant market power, consumers and businesses have no bargaining leverage in a take-it-or-leave-it contract. Fortunately, the FTC has a history of banning certain unfair contract terms. n14 New consumer protections in Australia and New Zealand also confront suspicious contract terms. Laws in some jurisdictions specify certain contract terms that are inherently suspect, while also providing a general framework for condemning new terms that may emerge. Understandably, the public has little trust in the efficacy of click-through terms of service, and we will need to evaluate whether existing agreements violate the law or need to be regulated.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Congress must reject the narrow thinking of the past that we hear too often from Washington lobbyists singing from the song sheet of monopolists and other dominant incumbents. Markets do not thrive when the government is completely absent. Our country's history has shown that we can foster innovation and create wealth with rules and laws that promote competition and eliminate conflicts of interest, rather than allowing a handful of actors to dominate and impose their own regulations on the market.</p><p>If you believe in the promise of discovery and invention to improve lives and advance human progress, you should be concerned that today's digital market may be choking off new entrants and innovation. Today's landscape is not simply a reflection of engineers and entrepreneurs, it also the result of government policies. If the federal government and the states did not pursue its case against Microsoft over twenty years ago, many of the major players in today's market would not exist. Confronting anticompetitive conduct will not mean the end of digital products and services; it will mean unlocking even greater innovation and entrepreneurship that benefits families and communities around the world with more choices and more opportunity.</p><p>n1 Alphabet Inc., Annual Report at 27 (Form 10-K) (Feb. 5, 2019).</p><p>n2 Facebook Inc., Annual Report at 44 (Form-K) (Jan. 31, 2019).</p><p>n3 Kashmir Hill, Goodbye Big Five, GIZMODO (2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five\">https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five</url>.</p><p>n4 Kashmir Hill, I Tried to Block Amazon From My Life.

It is an honor. I am heartened by your bipartisanship. I commend the detailed and focused preparation by committee staff in advanced of this hearing. If Congress is to make meaningful and appropriate laws, it must undertake these inquiries. Digital markets are com-plex field, and there is value to mapping its many dimensions and inviting different perspec-tives. This testimony reflects my own views and research carried out at Denmark's Center for Media and Information Technologies at Aalborg University. As a mother of three Danish-Ameri-can children who are European citizens, I also have a personal and academic interest in why Eu-ropean policies are failing to stimulate European-made internet innovation and reducing con-sumer trust online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The objectives of this digital markets inquiry are to (1) document competition problems in digi-tal markets, (2) examine whether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct, and (3) assess whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies, and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues. Additionally, the subcommittee seeks feedback on how and whether data either enable or deter market entry and how privacy may affect competition and antitrust enforcement.</p><p>Digitization challenges traditional antitrust analysis because of complexity and change. n1 Indeed the writings of Judge Louis Brandeis have been popularized of late to justify new-fangled anti-trust approaches to large technology companies. However, just as Brandeis was skeptical about so-called big business, he was also concerned about big government. n2 As such, it is inconsistent to advocate dismantling enterprise while growing government.</p><p>Interestingly, Brandeis' key argument against large enterprise was that it was inefficient, but that critique does not describe today's technology firms, which are extremely efficient. These companies are highly innovative, continue to increase output, and deliver increasing value to end users. It is not in their interest to behave anticompetitively--at least in an overt way. How-ever, I am concerned about their covert practices, their activities that do not in themselves rise to the level of antitrust violations but lead to conditions and settings that favor their continued dominance. Namely, I am concerned about how they influence public choices on internet policy and technology. Moreover, some large American tech firms have put Americans' safety, secu-rity, and privacy by bending to the will of the Chinese government in requiring data processing in China and with Chinese tools.</p><p>I will use the engineering concept of control points to describe this covert behavior. Just as a linchpin keeps a wheel from sliding off the axel, harnessing a control point is a powerful, effi-cient way to govern a system. As these platforms grow and gain economies of scale, the more easily they manage control points in the system, adding more capability with seemingly less ef-fort. One need not control the system if one can just manage its control point. I will describe how the companies leverage control points in technology and public policy to gain advantages in the marketplace. Moreover, I will demonstrate how regulatory interventions, however well-intentioned, such as data protection, privacy regulation, and net neutrality, have strengthened the market positions of these companies. Many well-meaning policies are promoted on the premise that they will \"level the playing field,\" but we must look at the actual effects, not just the theory.</p><p>Moreover, I am skeptical to opportunistic, election season, media-seeking calls to break up \"big tech\". I am hard-pressed to find successes from government intervention. For example, Ameri-can folklore alludes to the 19th-century railroads as justification for regulatory intervention, but the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission itself was a product of rent seeking, re-flecting the political prioritization of powerful agricultural interests over that of transport, not consumers. n3 The government intervention in Microsoft changed little; Microsoft is today the largest technology company on earth with more than $1 trillion in market capitalization. Per-haps the most successful intervention was one that never happened--IBM. New modes of com-putering are what bested Big Blue, not enlightened regulators.</p><p>Consider telecommunications. The Bell Telephone Company and the American government agreed on a regulated national monopoly to ensure \"universal service\" in 1913. Regulators were tasked with setting prices to ensure \"fairness.\" Naturally the regulator that wanted to pro-tect the entity on which its existence was predicated, so Bell earned excessive profits. However, consumers suffered unnaturally high prices and could only buy their phone from approved car-riers. Finally, the Department of Justice broke up the collusion. However, competition was ulti-mately driven by new technologies in cable and mobile wireless, not governmental interven-tion.</p><p>The airline industry followed a similar pattern. Until deregulation in 1978, airlines in America operated under a government sanctioned oligopoly, a cartel for airmail delivery, passenger routes, and transport rates. Partial deregulation of the airline industry in the US and sunset of its outdated regulation led to a 45% decline in consumer airline ticket prices from 1978 to 2008, a doubling of passengers, a quantum leap in airline productivity, and the emergence of low-cost carriers.</p><p>It's hard to see past the dominance of the large tech-platform companies today -- but if we reg-ulate them like monopolies, they will be around a lot longer than without the help of regula-tion. Today's tech giants came to prominence with better products and services that unseated their heavily regulated rivals in television, radio and print. Yet once the web firms gained critical mass, they blocked potential competitors through classic telecom rules like \"network neutral-ity\" obligations and anti-discrimination policies that were applied to the telecom operators but not to them. These rules have given the tech titans a free ride along the information highway. They force consumers to pay the full cost of their communications, rather than have it subsi-dized with advertising. Just as ads let Google and Facebook offer free services, it could lower the price of internet service. This innovation would give advertisers credible alternatives to the reigning platforms. That's why the tech giants and their globally coordinated advocates have fought vehemently against it, aborting its birth by lambasting it as \"non-neutral\". The rules were designed by the internet industry and maintained for its benefit. But such \"regulatory cap-ture\" is not abnormal. Economic history is replete with eye-popping examples of sector-specific regulations that perpetuated monopolies rather than tempered their dominance.</p><p>As we can see some 18 months after the promulgation of the European Union's exalted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Google, Facebook, and Amazon have gained market share while their fledgling ad tech rivals have lost ground. Only the largest players can afford the GDPR's costly requirements for lawyer fees, staff hires, software updates, and 45 other require-ments. Many studies suggest that European consumers are worse off from the GDPR. The EU's morass of privacy laws, regulations, directives, and disclaimers are not lessening data breaches or the proliferation of Chinese apps, which operate in brazen defiance of European rules.</p><p>Policies such as GDPR, net neutrality and other misguided regulation have strengthened Silicon Valley dominance, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will likely extend it further. If we want the reign of the platforms to end, we should accelerate the rollout of new technolo-gies and lower barriers to entry to new technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, block-chain, and so on.</p><p>Technology as a Control Point</p><p>A company's governance of control points, whether they are in the platform's network or not, can strengthen a platform. Control points are not the same as network effects, the increased value that a platform enjoys as more people use it. The governance of control points is an im-portant component of understanding the complexity of online systems. I will provide examples of control points including operating systems, developer tools, digital book pricing, third-party contracts, and the DoH, the so-called domain name server (DNS) over secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), unilateral efforts by Google and Mozilla to subsume a vital part of internet pro-tocol into their proprietary networks.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple offer platforms or digital ecosystems with a foundational architectural superstructure on which modules or applications can be added to extend the ser-vices. This co-creation among the platform owner, users, and developers tussles between gen-erative innovation and infrastructure control. n4 Some of these generative characteristics include leverage (the extent to which tools make possible a set of activities that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive otherwise), adaptability (the scope of uses tools can be put to and the ease to which they can be modified to extend this range of uses), mastery (ease to adopt tools by a broad audience), accessibility (ease of access to the tools and the information on how to use them), and transferability (degree to which the instrument can be deployed for new uses). n5</p><p>While many radio, TV, and print outlets blame online players for displacing and disrupting their revenue, online platforms have improved the experience for consumers and advertisers. They have also expanded the media market, creating entirely new channels of distribution out of ones and zeros. More broadly, online players have invested billions of dollars to attract users and to make the online experience compelling, while many brick-and-mortar retailers have failed to make the physical shopping experience more pleasant and convenient. It feels like work to drive to a mall, find a parking space, walk a long distance to a store in surroundings with offending music and lighting, and then interact with a disinterested employee.n6 Indeed, it is personalization based on personal information that makes the online experience compelling and convenient.</p><p>However, personalization is not unique to the online world. Many can remember the shop-keeper who recognized you, knew which products to recommend based on your relationship, and tailored unique offers to you based on your preferences. The difference today, of course, is that the knowledge of relationship is documented in code and strengthened with other sources of information. It was possible to do this in the past, but it was costly and time-consuming. Moreover, many forms of consumer tracking today did not exist in the past, notably mobile de-vice tracking. Indeed, online brands are attempting to build a brick-and-mortar presence with their coded knowledge. n7</p><p>Some suggest that the ability to amass data itself is a barrier to competition; however, today's innovators and entrepreneurs have multiple ways to access large databases whether free, open source projects, or via commercial databases. Indeed, there are significant costs and risks to warehouse data, and many firms find it preferable to purchase data in the market, rather than host the data themselves.</p><p>Access to data is important for machine learning. Leading financial analyst and physicist Richard Windsor explains that while media hype focuses on the killer apps of new technologies that . . .it's the smaller, simpler and deadly dull projects that are likely to see real success in the short to medium-term. . . boring things like saving money on electricity and basic au-tomation where the money is going to be made. . . Deep learning, at its heart, is a sys-tem for statistically separating characteristics of data such that when these characteris-tics occur again, they can be recognized. . . Furthermore, the algorithm needs to be shown every combination and permutation that is possible before it can be relied on with 100% accuracy. This means that the ideal task needs to have both a finite and a sta-ble dataset in order for deep learning to work well. n8</p><p>A similar concern is expressed that some platform owners have disproportionate ability to mine their own data warehouses. However, this can't be true in all cases because platforms make much of their proprietary data and capabilities available through application program interfaces (APIs). The analog example is the grocery story that creates a house brand or white label brand based upon information it has about its customers and vendors. However, not all product cate-gories are successes, and stores may focus on quality rather than price. n9</p><p>Control Point Examples in Digital Markets</p><p>The operating system (OS) is the software that supports a computer's basic functions. Operat-ing systems were originally designed as digital operating manuals; they did not collect or track user behavior for marketing purposes. Developers use operating systems to access baseline data about the workings of an application. This information is frequently called telemetry: data to monitor performance remotely, especially crashes and errors. Finding and improving defi-ciencies help improve the system through patches, updates, and successive versions. Trans-forming the operating system from a mere analytics dashboard to a commercial marketing sys-tem is part and parcel of the realization of modern smartphones. While may antitrust discus-sion focus on the monopoly of Android-enabled devices, many forget that Android replaced the Nokia smartphone with its Symbian operating system, a platform that many thought was un-breakable. With 5G, we can begin to see creative destruction as smartphones will be sup-planted by the Internet of Things.</p><p>Operating systems are the subject of considerable conflict. The Apple iOS platform ecosystem offers a rich field for research with millions of devices, over half a billion users, and millions of apps. An information systems analysis examined 4,664 technical articles published from 2007 to 2011 on the topic of contested innovation on the iOS operating system. n10 Some 30 incidents were cited as disputes between Apple and other actors over \"boundary resources,\" the inter-face between the platform and developer. These incidents emerged over time, and many are ongoing today and reflect the general nature of the rivalry over sharing resources, notably Ap-ple's rules about the language in which third-party apps must be written, how to migrate its customer base to new devices and systems, and even controversial judgments about whether some apps are politically unacceptable.</p><p>Android, by far the world's most popular operating system, has been the focus of antitrust in-vestigations abroad related to the bundling of the operating system with Google's suite of ap-plications, the legality of derivative versions of the operating system, and alleged exclusionary licensing of its operating system. The efficacy of these approaches in promoting innovation and alternatives remains to be seen, and there are some questions as to whether the EU properly applied competition law. n11</p><p>The Android OS serves as the \"brain\" of a device containing the information of the system, all the inputs and outputs of the device, notably the log of calls and messages and the bank of pho-tos, videos, contacts, and calendar. Android records the users' keystrokes, words, and viewed images. Android sees the information a user types before it is encrypted. Android sees the de-crypted message once it's received. Android sees all browsing data, the URLs entered, search terms, pages visited and specific clicked items, logins, time spent on content, file uploads and downloads, IP address, bookmarks, app user history, and more. It has location history such as the device location, coordinated with cell tower information, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.</p><p>Android's capabilities extend to data collected by sensors, webcams, microphones, and any other mobile attachments. In the earlier versions, app developers were able to access, profile, and track \"persistent\" identifiers such as the Android ID, International Mobile Equipment Iden-tity number, n12 hardware addresses, and SIM serial card number. n13 The advertising ID is the user's digital marketing fingerprint that is consistent across the apps and devices they use. With the \"advertising ID\" asset, Android can work more closely with app developers and advertisers to provide more relevant advertising to the user and monetize the experience. Android assigns unique and global advertising identifiers, more comprehensive than cookies, to devices and al-lows apps to access that unique identifier for each device running the operating system. n14 These data are collected and processed from users, both to make the systems and applications work better and to provide insights to advertisers. Data from the operating system may be combined with personal data from other systems for marketing, research and development, and so on. For these reasons, the Android operating system can be provided to the end user without an out-of-pocket cost.</p><p>Facebook offers interesting jurisdictional questions because most of its users are outside the United States, and it attempts to tailor many of its offerings to local tastes. It hosts a variety of points of control that both enable users and developers to engage and share and allow Face-book to impose discipline. Facebook hosts many competing applications in platform, such as YouTube, Twitch, games, monetary transaction, and music. These apps can be experienced without leaving Facebook. While users enjoy the experience because they like to share it with their friends, it allows Facebook to capture additional personal data that can be used for ad monetization. Given the platform's capabilities, which can allow content to go viral, Facebook is constantly managing distribution, and it is critiqued on the one hand for not immediately block-ing fake accounts or for not immediately stopping violent, terrorist content and on the other for not distributing social content widely enough. Facebook has made major investments in human and artificial intelligence for content and developer moderation, but it appears that the plat-form grows faster than its capability to manage, and the company has suffered in its earnings as a result. n15 Facebook's internal limitations and shortcomings represent opportunities for com-petitive alternatives. Hill Holliday's survey of Generation Z (those born since 1994) shows that so-called digital natives, who are estimated to comprise 40 percent of U.S. consumers by 2020 and of whom more than 90 percent use social media platforms, found that more than one-half had switched off social media for extended periods and one-third had canceled their social me-dia accounts. n16 Users cited time wasting as the reason for quitting twice as often as a concern about privacy. While service providers don't like the high rates of churn on their platforms, n17 they are indicative of a competitive market in which consumers find it easy to leave and try other platforms with different features.</p><p>Amazon's relentless focus on data has reinvented the retail experience and provides an im-portant source of competition to Google in product search. Amazon was able to incubate with a unique set of factors such as the investors who were comfortable with losses while it gained market share and profitability; the dearth of sales tax; brick-and-mortar competitors that shoul-dered many labor, environmental, and other regulations it did not; and regulatory decisions that deterred retailers from mergers that would have otherwise increased its competition. Am-azon's control points include digital book pricing, an area in which it attempted to be price maker, but a challenge from publishers has changed how prices are negotiated. n18 As a platform for third parties, Amazon faces conflicts over contract terms, alleged cannibalization with white label products, and proliferation of banned, unsafe, and mislabeled products. n19 Similar concerns have been raised around Amazon Web Services (AWS), for example that it mines the data of re-tailers for insights to improve its own ecommerce. n20 However a bad rap for AWS is boon to its competitors IBM, Oracle, Virtustream, Microsoft, CenturyLink, RackSpace, and others which can set up service level agreements to avoid such practices.</p><p>The notion of control points embraces \"co-opetition,\" n21 the idea that firms both cooperate and compete in the marketplace and suggests that firms and industries converge, develop, and cre-ate value in unexpected ways. n22 To describe this process David Teece's 1986 paper \"Profiting from Technological Innovation: Implications for Integration, Collaboration, Licensing and Public Policy\" n23 is essential. He observed that most innovations are not products themselves. They must be combined with complementary assets before they can be marketable products. Such partnerships lower barriers to entry and provide rewards to an innovator upfront.</p><p>Firms make partnerships or \"join complementary assets\" (e.g., content provider and broadband provider) to make applications known. Most applications on their own have little to no value, or will almost never be found, unless they are joined with their complementary asset. Thus, a spe-cialized asset may be an operating system that runs on a mobile phone, such as Apple iOS or Android. A co-specialized asset may be a 4G mobile network for the Apple iPhone, its comple-mentary asset. Many iPhone features cannot be realized unless the phone is connected to the appropriate 4G mobile network (e.g., Siri or Uber).</p><p>Marketing is a type of complementary asset. For many firms the cost on getting online is nomi-nal: fees of hosting, storage, and servers. Where they face major barriers may be competition from other content, applications, and services, not to mention being findable on platforms such as search engines, social platforms, and app stores. The practices of search engine optimization and app store optimization are designed to help firms overcome these intermediaries.</p><p>Further, Teece's paper attempts to predict whether the innovator will succeed. To determine who wins, one needs to examine (1) appropriability--how easy is it to leverage knowledge, ease of imitation, intellectual property, etc.--and (2) complementary assets--who owns what (generic, co-specialized, or specialized). Teece also distinguishes between invention and innova-tion (ability to do something better than the state of the art), the latter of which adds value to users and economy. This is analogous to incremental and fundamental innovation.</p><p>Teece observes that innovating firms frequently fail to win the profits of their innovation and that the owner of the intellectual property does not necessarily get the benefit. It goes instead to customers, suppliers, or competitors--the actor which has the best fit of complementary as-sets. He gives the examples of EMI having developed the CAT scanner but competitors succeed-ing to commercialize it; RC Cola having developed diet soda but both Coca-Cola and Pepsi suc-ceeding; Bowmar introducing the calculator but HP and Texas Instruments commercializing it; and Xerox developing the fundamental innovations that Apple managed to commercialize.</p><p>To overcome this, incumbent firms would be wise to get a position in the complementary asset market. Frequently it is not the firm that is first to market that wins, but rather that which is third, fourth, and so on. In any case, the need to work with complementary firms is reflected in the presence of joint ventures, coproduction agreements, cross-distribution arrangements, and technology licensing.</p><p>Teece also describes two stages of scientific evolution, the pre-paradigm stage and the para-digm stage. In the pre-paradigm stage, there are competing ideas, and designs are fluid. In the paradigm stage, designs become accepted, codified, and standardized. One design emerges as best (e.g., Model T, IBM 360, Douglas DC-3). Once design emerges, competition shifts to price away from design. Scale and capital then become important. Innovation can still occur but may be in niches. This model tends to characterize large consumer markets.</p><p>Few industries have the benefit of strong appropriabilities. Most of the time the appropriability is weak, so the innovator needs a business model to make its innovation known. In the pre-par-adigm stage, innovators need to allow their designs to \"float\" to get enough of a market test to see whether they can work. In the pre-paradigm stage, the focus is on the winning design. Pro-duction is low (few users), so it does not yet make sense to deploy specialized assets. There are no scale economies, and price is not necessarily an issue. With the move to the paradigm stage, investment becomes irreversible. Once the design becomes standardized, then the importance of complementary assets takes over.</p><p>Marketing and distribution are a key complementary asset. This was demonstrated with the PC market. Many companies made computers, but few succeeded because of the scale required to sell to companies across the US (i.e., need a large sales force, get on retail shelves, etc.). So, the strategy is to sell to the big provider (e.g., IBM). In any case, Teece concludes that strategic partnerships frequently do not work for the reasons he cites. n24</p><p>IBM's success in the PC market was related to joining the complementary assets, many of them generic. It made more sense for IBM to find them in the market than to develop them in-house. IBM's key asset relative to the generic inputs was its strong brand, which engendered credibility with customers, plus its formidable marketing and distribution network. n25</p><p>Complementary assets are not a one-size-fits-all solution; rather it requires that each actor pur-sue the relevant partnership. This contrasts to the overrated policy prescription of data porta-bility. While porting a phone number from one mobile operator to another may make sense, data from a social network do not necessarily map to an online marketplace. n26 An economic ex-periment with college students in the EU found that data portability was their least valued \"right\" of the GDPR. n27 This speaks to the lack of testing and evidence before the adoption of the GDPR and a common mistake made by policy elites to assume that users desire their preferred solutions. Instead policymakers should focus on ensuring that the marketplaces encourage in-novation and experimentation.</p><p>DoH in the Mozilla and Chrome Web Browser</p><p>Another control point is the DNS, the naming system for computers, services, or other re-sources connected to the internet or a private network. Normally, DNS is a separate service from the platform, but platforms can also exert control on points outside their network.</p><p>DNS is characterized as a feature of the decentralized and modular architecture of the internet. Many different entities provide DNS service, and it is at the forefront to fight cyberattacks, block malicious traffic, and limit the spread of child exploitation, terrorism, and other illegal ac-tivities. DNS is also the technology that allows parents to exercise controls to protect their chil-dren and families and a range of privacy-enhancing tools that are deployed today. DNS also en-ables the content delivery network industry.</p><p>One of the many privacy-enhancing technologies is encryption, techniques for secure communi-cation in the presence of third parties. Encrypted internet traffic has hit an all-time threshold of over 72 percent of all network traffic, up from 55 percent in Q3 of 2017. n28 Google has been leading the charge for encryption, and while its operating system can see the data before and after it is encrypted, it encrypts its browser traffic so that no other parties can see it.</p><p>With a simple update to their code, Google can bypass the user's local DNS and send encrypted traffic to the central Google or Mozilla server instead, as Mozilla recently announced it plans to do soon in the US. n29 While we should encourage technological efforts to improve privacy, DoH puts even more of the internet under Google's domain and dramatically changes the internet's decentralized character. Google and Mozilla n30 offer that the move is a mere default setting to which the user can opt out and that they offer parent DNS solutions and \"safe search\" op-tions. Undoubtedly, DoH makes business sense for Google and Mozilla, and some users may welcome the change. However, the furtive nature of the rollout appears to violate the spirit of the multi-stakeholder internet community. Security analysts have observed that centralizing traffic to Google's or Mozilla's DNS creates a new but needless central point of attack, breaks many parental controls, disrupts enterprise content filtering solutions, and interferes with mal-ware detection systems. Moreover, it can exacerbate challenges for law enforcement, which has hitherto relied on DNS information. However, the lucrative new opportunities for global data monetization by large platforms is likely driving the DoH effort.</p><p>AEI's Shane Tews observes:</p><p>Centralized encrypted DNS is a new model of internet business that goes beyond online advertising; it's a play by companies looking to exploit user behavior for their own mon-etary gain, cloaked as an effort to improve security and privacy. Of course, the infor-mation in these transactions can also be shared or sold with various unnamed third par-ties for predictive analytics and other purposes. n31</p><p>It is not clear whether disadvantaged parties could take legal action against Google and Mozilla for an activity that turns off their traffic in an instant, but it exemplifies that vast power that can be wielded, outside of the platforms, with a mere coding tweak.</p><p>Public Policy as a Control Point</p><p>Technology can create lock-in effects but can be overcome by innovation and design. Policy and regulation, on the other hand, are more powerful control points because they can be cemented by rule of law.</p><p>Data Protection and Privacy Regulation</p><p>A policy control point is the EU's GDPR. It stipulates that any entity in the world using a Euro-pean's data must comply with 45 specific regulations including hiring a chief privacy officer; purchasing a GDPR compliant software system; submitting annual audits and impact assess-ment to the authorities; at users' request, delivering services to users without their participa-tion; and, at moment's notice, producing, rectifying, erasing, or transferring a user's data, among other requirements. European politicians proffered that this regime would level the playing field with Big Tech and put users in control, but 18 months after its implementation, we find that largest US tech firms have increased their market share, the ad tech competitors of these firms have lost market share, many small- and medium-sized (SMEs) firms have exited, and Europeans' trust online is at the lowest point since 2006. Less than half of all applicable firms comply given the high cost, some $3 million per firm. Indeed, the data protection authori-ties are flooded with complaints, many generated by bots, and moreover most complaints fo-cus on billing issues with financial and retail providers, which are already covered under other laws. Europeans rarely exercise any of their 17 newly invented data protection \"rights.\"</p><p>Since the implementation of the GDPR, Google, Facebook, and Amazon have increased their online advertising market share in the EU. n32 Three things have happened. n33 First, the high cost of GDPR compliance is a fixed cost; large, profitable firms can absorb this, but it falls harder on SMEs. Second, many advertisers and publishers have stopped using tracking tools that compete with Google and Facebook, giving a greater share of the market to the established players. Third, users are less likely to try new platforms and tools, sticking instead with the \"devil they know\" in the incumbent players because they perceive that the larger companies have more resources to comply with the regulation.</p><p>The GDPR has affected the downstream advertising market as well. Given the scope of Google's advertising platform and its affiliates on syndicated networks, its compliance with the GDPR has caused ripple effects in ancillary markets. Independent ad exchanges noted prices plummeting 20 to 40 percent. n34 Some advertisers reported being shut out from exchanges. n35 The GDPR's complex and arcane designations for \"controllers\" and \"processors\" can ensnare third-party chipmakers, component suppliers, and software vendors that have never interfaced with end users, as European courts have ruled that any part of the internet ecosystem can be liable for data breaches. n36 One online publisher called the GDPR the \"Google Data Protection Regulation\" and explained, \"We have suddenly become even more dependent on Google, while other exchanges are hurting.\"</p><p>For those who study the empirical outcomes of regulation, the GDPR's perverse outcomes are surprising. As Nobel economist George Stigler observed more than 40 years ago, \"Regulation is acquired by industry and operated for its benefit.\" n37 There was an expectation that large fines would deter the platforms' business, that companies would be less aggressive in data collec-tion, and that a space would open for small firms, but as Politico reported, large firms with fi-nancial and regulatory resources have \"gamed\" the system. Rules that were supposed to em-power citizens have instead helped \"Big Tech.\" n38</p><p>However, disruptive innovation which would allow startups to topple the giants is probably not the goal of most European policymakers. Instead these elites likely prefer a predictable, long-lasting, and highly regulated oligopoly under government control conforms to their ordoliberal preferences. This contrasts with American notions of a free and fair marketplace in which startups have a shot for success without being unduly burdened by regulation. That fact that so many Europeans entrepreneurs come to the US to launch their business is a testament to this fact.</p><p>Some 40,000 internet startups in the US were founded in 2018 alone. n39 However, this a stagger-ing number is likely to fall with the promulgation of the CCPA, what I call the GDPR-heavy be-cause it adds 77 new regulations to enterprise, 22 more than the GDPR. The largest platforms would prefer to extend the GDPR to the US, rather than to adopt the CCPA, which has some overlapping but slightly different provisions. Indeed, Microsoft has reportedly asked US policy-makers for the GDPR to be extended. n40 When large players start asking for regulation on them-selves, their motivation is probably not to create competition in their own market.</p><p>The California Department of Justice and Office of the Attorney General recently issued a cost benefit analysis of the CCPA legislation and its own supplementary regulation. It notes the total initial compliance cost of $55 billion, 1.8 percent of California's gross domestic product in 2018, and another $16 billion in the coming decade. n41 About half of surveyed firms expect costs to run between $100,000 and $1 million, with vast majority of the fees going for legal services. The report also notes that 99 percent of California companies have fewer than 500 employees, meaning that costs will fall hardest on the firms with the least amount of resources and em-ployees. n42</p><p>Even with sophisticated modeling and economic projections, there are no scenarios in which benefits either meet or exceed costs with the CCPA. The most generous models suggest con-sumer benefit could amount to $1.6-$5.4 billion over time based on experiments in which con-sumers report willingness to pay for privacy features. Other cost benefit models suggest conser-vatively that the costs of the CCPA exceed benefits by a factor of four. n43</p><p>As such, the policy will be a drag on the economy and is likely to hasten the SME exodus from the state. For a state that bills itself as a progressive leader, California is transferring massive wealth to the privacy and plaintiff bars, key advocates for the CCPA. If the goal was to help con-sumers, then it would be better to provide rebates to customers than fees to lawyers. The re-port reiterates the findings of the GDPR with the expectation of a similar impact with the CCPA noting,</p><p>Small firms are likely to face a disproportionately higher share of compliance costs rela-tive to larger enterprises. Conventional wisdom may suggest that stronger privacy regu-lations will adversely impact large technology firms that derive most of their revenue from personal data, however evidence from the EU suggests the opposite may be true. Over a year after the introduction of the GDPR, concerns regarding its impact on larger firms appear to have been overstated, while many smaller firms have struggled to meet compliance costs. Resources explain this dichotomy as large technology companies are often several steps ahead of both competitors and regulators. n44</p><p>When startups and small players exit, existing large companies which can afford to comply will take the market share of the firms that exited. This is what happened in the EU and is what will happen in California if the CCPA is not preempted. Academic studies of other industries over time have noted that entry regulation is a barrier to entrepreneurship. n45, n46</p><p>Not only can complex regulation reduce enterprise, it tricks consumers into believe the market-place is trustworthy. Indeed \"complex regulatory frameworks create the illusion of a well-con-trolled system,\" notes a recent report of Scientific Board of the European Financial Systemic Risk Board. n47 Similar unintended consequences have been noted in other industries, particularly banking and finance as the report describes,</p><p>Excessively complex regulations contribute to increased systemic risk in several ways. First, complex regulatory frameworks create the illusion of a well-controlled system, while at the same time creating incentives for regulated entities to game the system. Second, such a framework risks missing contingencies that are not well understood, e.g. because of a lack of historical experience. An \"over-fitted\" regulatory system may not be well equipped to address \"unknown unknowns\". Third, when risks materialize, the com-bination of hard-to-understand interactions between different regulations and a wide array of regulatory tools can make policy responses convoluted and difficult to judge. It can also hamper the accountability of regulators and supervisors. Finally, excessive reg-ulatory complexity can encourage the transfer of risks to institutions outside the regula-tory perimeter, creating an environment where systemic risk is amplified more than it would have been if risks had remained within the perimeter. n48</p><p>Public policy should promote firms to use data, not punish them for improving prod-ucts and services for their customers. Indeed, the trouble with today's economy is not that there is too much use of data, but too little. A lack of \"information intensity\" is holding back the so-called other 70 percent of American economy, sectors such as transportation and health care, the latter of which consumes almost one-fifth of gross domestic product. n49 Outside of certain applications, the traditional healthcare industry is woefully inefficient; digital industries, on the other hand, are eight times more pro-ductive and innovative. If the US does not innovate these other sectors, other nations will beat us to it. China is already on track with an \"Internet Plus\" policy which supports the digitization of industries, including healthcare and government. n50</p><p>While policies such as the GDPR and CCPA claim to promote competition, they both have the effect of increasing barriers for new market entrants and reducing competi-tion. When they were founded, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft en-joyed permissionless data collection and processing innovation; the next wave of inno-vators will not. So, we can only expect to drag out the dominance of these large firms which now enjoy government-promoted protection from competition. A detailed dis-cussion of the effects of the GDPR and CCPA is submitted to the subcommittee in a separate report, as it exceeds time allotted this hearing.</p><p>Internet Regulation</p><p>Public policy is a salient control point in the marketplace, and its value is so well established that is has been enshrined by Tullock's paradox. n51 It notes that the cost of rent-seeking is small relative to the gains. n52 While the size of the public affairs budgets of the big tech companies can make for an interesting story or two in the press, a few million dollars is relatively little com-pared to their total operations, which number in the trillions of dollars. It makes good economic sense for the companies to spend a few million on public affairs to win favorable public policy, for the costs of developing fundamental innovation and associated products and services is in the billions. For more than a decade, control point subterfuge by the tech companies fooled policymakers into thinking that America's 5,441 internet service providers were a threat inter-net openness. The entire US broadband industry, some $300 billion, is still smaller than the market capitalization of any one of the internet giants. And still, many policymakers have sup-ported a distorted notion that the internet giants should be shielded from competition.</p><p>My doctoral research investigated net neutrality policy across 53 countries during the period of 2010-16 to test the hypothesis that countries that adopt hard, bright line net neutrality rules should experience an increase in locally developed mobile app development innovation in their national economy. n53 Following the net neutrality tenets, I expected to see those countries adopting rules would experience greater competition to established edge providers. However, I discovered the opposite. In fact, net neutrality in practice works to cement the market position of existing giants. In no country that has adopted hard net neutrality rules have we seen any platforms emerge to challenge Google, Facebook, or Amazon. In fact, the only places that has produced meaningful competitors to these firms are Russia and China, and these countries have no net neutrality rules at all. If we followed the net neutrality predictions, we should have seen global platforms emerge from Brazil and India, which have had hard net neutrality rules for years. Tomasso Valletti has also described the ambiguous effects of this policy. n54</p><p>Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and to a lesser degree, Apple, have lobbied hard in the US and other countries on this issue. They have succeeded to enshrine the norm that dispropor-tionately large senders of traffic pay little to nothing for the cost of networks while the end user pays the full network cost regardless of whether she visits those sites. Moreover, the policy re-stricts competition by prohibiting startups and end users the freedom to partner to tailor ser-vices to their individual wants, needs, and budgets. If it was not for the Noerr-Pennington doc-trine, which allows the industrial sector to work collectively for favorable price controls, these platforms would likely be guilty of collusion and restraint of trade.</p><p>Policy Considerations</p><p>Stop Promoting Regulation That Strengthens the Largest Players</p><p>If we are concerned about competition and market entry, we must stop making high-cost poli-cies that give Big Tech an unfair advantage. This testimony documents how many well-inten-tioned regulations delivered the opposite of their intended effect. The high cost of compliance has turned into a market barrier that only the richest companies can afford. As a result, nascent competitors have either stagnated or exited the market while the large companies gained mar-ket share. I urge Congress not to adopt the GDPR, or its US imitator, the CCPA, whose financial impacts are likely to be even more detrimental to the US than the GDPR is to Europe.</p><p>If the California law is promulgated, it will likely be challenged in court on free speech grounds and will ultimately be struck down as unconstitutional. Moreover, the CCPA threatens to tor-pedo more than two-dozen hard-fought privacy laws with existing regimes and regulators over-seeing the health and insurance sectors, to name just two industries. To keep the US from de-volving into 50 conflicting layers of privacy regulation and destroying interstate internet com-merce, Congress should preempt the CCPA with evidence-based policy instrument that comple-ment, not supplant, existing law.</p><p>Rational Privacy Protections</p><p>Evidence-based policy is a rational, linear process to make decisions based upon an evaluation of problems and possible solutions, the collection of information about the possible solutions, and the measurement and comparison of expected outcomes. Had California used an evidence-based approach, it would have conducted randomized, controlled trials to test the efficacy of the 185 provisions rather than slop together a laundry list of feel good rules, as it did over a few weeks. n55 The policy process should be informed by competing approaches with associated as-sessments before legislation is made, not after. Ideally the bill would undergo Congressional scoring and/or review by the Office of Management and Budget for additional rigor.</p><p>I appreciate the efforts of this committee, notably Ranking Member Collins, n56 to explore ra-tional, rule-of-law-based methods to protect consumers' privacy and encourage innovation without burdening small- and medium-sized enterprise. Such an approach preserves Constitu-tional rights and freedoms including interstate commerce; honors the single national market created by our founders; and protects the legal system from rent-seeking and abuse by the plaintiff bar and litigation financiers who wish to profit off the largesse of the tech industry. Most consumers never the rents of class action lawsuits, as winnings go overwhelmingly to the attorneys bringing the cases. n57</p><p>Congressman Collins' proposal n58 dovetails with the \"Privacy Bill of Rights\" presented by the 2012 Obama White House, a sound privacy framework built on the principles of individual con-trol, transparency, respect for context, security, accuracy, and accountability and strengthened enforcement at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). n59 President Obama's proposal supported using multi-stakeholder processes to develop enforceable codes of conduct through Section 5 of the FTC Act. Moreover, the Obama administration was adamant about the need for preemp-tion of state laws that would contradict the national standard. Plan architect Cameron F. Kerry describes how it would have functioned,</p><p>The bill of rights articulated seven basic principles that should be legally enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission: individual control, transparency, respect for the context in which the data was obtained, access and accuracy, focused collection, security, and accountability. These broad principles are rooted in longstanding and globally-accepted \"fair information practices principles.\" To reflect today's world of billions of devices in-terconnected through networks everywhere, though, they are intended to move away from static privacy notices and consent forms to a more dynamic framework, less fo-cused on collection and process and more on how people are protected in the ways their data is handled. Not a checklist, but a toolbox. This principles-based approach was meant to be interpreted and fleshed out through codes of conduct and case-by-case FTC enforcement--iterative evolution, much the way both common law and information technology developed. n60</p><p>Sadly, Silicon Valley thwarted this visionary plan. n61 It is likely that had the US adopted this plan in 2012, it would have beat the EU to the privacy punch and avoided much of the current state of fallout.</p><p>University of Washington Law professor Jane Winn offers a helpful overview of US information law, noting how the US focused on risk-based laws which allow innovation except where risk justifies precaution versus the EU where the bureaucracy administers unilateral control rights. n1 She explains that the US approach is an attempt to strike a balance between the public demand for protection from harm with the public demand growth and innovation, and making legisla-tion when there is a clear misuse of information to harm individuals. Citing the low rate of com-pliance of EU firms with information laws (both the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive and the GDPR), Winn explains that European governments and businesses have an \"attitude of calcu-lated indifference toward the challenge of achieving real compliance\" and reluctance to com-pete on digitization. She observes, \"American businesses are more likely than their European counterparts to try to use technology innovation as a source of competitive advantage.\"</p><p>Winn describes important historical points where consumer choice and business innovation have allowed the United States to emerge as the global leader in making digital transformation accessible to individuals and the punctuating legislation. For example in prior centuries, one of the first things European immigrants did upon arriving to the US was to borrow money for new clothes so that they could blend in with Americans. n2 \"Consumerism and the power to construct a new identity with consumer credit remain inextricably woven into the fabric of American de-mocracy,\" she writes. When Congress enacted the world's first fair information practices law to protect American consumers' power to borrow money, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, \"it was acting in response to the high level of concern among American consumers that the mi-gration of paper credit bureau records to computers might needlessly restrict their access to credit.\" If there is an \"fundamental right\" enshrined in American legislation, it is the \"right of American consumers to borrow freely to finance their present consumption...in most European countries, there is often a deep ambivalence or even hostility toward American-style consumer-ism and the culture of easy access to consumer credit that makes it possible,\" notes Winn.</p><p>A related issue in the 1970s was a deep distrust of the US government from the Vietnam War and Watergate which threatened to deter signups to the new Medicare and Medicaid pro-grams. The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare commissioned a report to determine what the federal government needed to do to restore trust, resulting in the groundbreaking 1973 HEW Report on Computers, Records and the Rights of Citizens and the subsequent Privacy Act of 1974 which contained the first mention of \"fair information privacy practices\" or FIPPS ever articulated anywhere in the world. FIPPs was \"a way to restore the necessary balance be-tween the interests of individuals in how their data is processed on the one hand, and the inter-ests of organizations and the public generally in how that data is processed on the other.\" What has allowed the Privacy Act to endure is not the notion of privacy as a fundamental right of individual control (an idea it rejects), but rather the mutual interest of the individual and the government to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the personal information with the use of FIPPS as a guide. Congress has since made many information privacy laws for specific areas, still in effect today, depending on the harm at risk with the issue at hand. n3</p><p>Winn advises a new framework of information governance that simultaneously addresses pri-vacy and disclosure in a flexible, dynamic way. Congress can borrow elements of other U.S. laws that have been very successful in other contexts, such as the way the way regulators work with voluntary, consensus standards organizations to create concrete, certifiable standards for the specific business practice in question. Unlike industry self-regulation, \"accredited\" standards are certified by the American National Standards Institute and organizations adopting these of-ficial standards must observing the due process requirements contained in a document known as \"ANSI Essential Requirements.\" ANSI standards are already employed today successfully across many industries. A key advantage compared to the EU's blanket rights approach is that standards are explicit, technical, and measurable and therefore can ensure stricter compliance.</p><p>To enable the transition for the millions of firms to which the integrated, national information framework would apply, Congress could authorize federal regulators to confer \"safe harbor\" status to organizations adopting the rigorous standards along with limited preemption for in-consistent state laws. Notably such rules allow the FTC to impose stricter rules when warranted on certain firms and industries, rather than to saddle every startup with obligations designed for a trillion-dollar platform. Most important, Winn describes why the traditional US approach to privacy has been the best avenue to deliver democracy and actual privacy on the ground, not just on the books.</p><p>Cloaking European-style data protection law in the language of fundamental rights short-circuits the democratic process of balancing the costs and benefits of different regulatory strategies. . . Having insulated themselves from democratic accountability with a fundamental rights narrative, EU institutions are now reaping a whirlwind of pop-ulist and nationalist movements across Europe that are openly hostile to European insti-tutions. . . For those who have never faced the challenge of creating and sustaining a culture of compliance, EU-style data protection law appears to be a much simpler, clearer solution to the problem of information governance than a messy, ambiguous risk-based approach. It is only when the challenges of achieving actual compliance is taken into account that the democratic character of the American risk-based model be-comes clear.</p><p>Congress is right to focus on competition in the tech sector, but it won't achieve this with from third rate platforms mandate by government fiat. Instead Congress should hasten the next technological revolution which will supplant the current incumbents. This can be done through policy that supports investments and incentives for next-generation technologies and removes the market barriers to entrepreneurship, innovation, and enterprise. Here the focus should be on fast-tracking 5G, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and security tech-nologies.</p><p>In summary rational privacy legislation could consist of (1) framework that protects Americans' Constitutional rights and freedoms for speech and commerce; (2) strengthened authority and budget for the FTC to develop risk-based privacy standards for the online economy (this would also include budget for more economists and technologists at the agency); (3) safe harbors that allow companies to migrate their operations to those standards, (4) investments and incentives for the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, and (5) consumer education and com-petency training. n62</p><p>I am heartened by the bipartisanship in Congress today with the opportunity to make a mean-ingful framework that builds on proven American success and scientific evidence. I thank the committee for this opportunity to testify, its willingness to engage a range of participants, and its openness to new ideas and frameworks. I look forward to your questions.</p><p>n1 Winn, Jane, The Governance Turn in Information Privacy Law (July 11, 2019).

This consensus is based on the recognition that corporate hegemony - that is, concentrated power exercised at scale - can be a threat to individual liberty, the free market, and independent thought in a free society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To that end, I started the Internet Accountability Project (IAP) with Mike Davis in September of 2019 to give a voice to conservatives concerned about the growing, concentrated power of Big Tech. Since founding the group last year, our concerns have only been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, the upcoming election, and the role Big Tech plays in both.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to raising awareness about the dangers of corporate power exercised at this scale, IAP has focused its efforts on three areas of policy remedy: antitrust enforcement, data privacy and ownership, and reform of Section 230 - which one pro-tech law professor has identified as Big Tech's \"implicit financial subsidy.\" n1</p><p>My remarks today will focus on the viewpoint discrimination exercised by these platforms and its downstream effects, and on Sec. 230 reform and antitrust enforcement as potential remedies to the broad and multifaceted issues that exist when corporate power is wielded without accountability against both independent thought and the free market.</p><p>I. Big Tech's Viewpoint Discrimination</p><p>As these Big Tech companies have grown, so too has their ability to filter information for billions of people around the world - that is, to control what they see, when, and what they can say.</p><p>Through its dominance of the search engine market, Google now decides how to filter information for 92 percent of the world n2 - and 87 percent of the United States. n3 One content decision by Google has enormous ramifications on what information is displayed, or what businesses are promoted. Facebook, with its nearly 3 billion active monthly users, has similar power to influence what users see and do not see.</p><p>Such decisions, when made at scale, have downstream effects on individual development of opinions and beliefs. They can single-handedly change the shape of markets - as is evidenced in the market disruptions that occur every time Google updates its core algorithm.</p><p>Conservatives feel the exercise of this power acutely. Content moderation and market power has been used by some of the major tech platforms with impunity against conservative political ads, fundraising opportunities, conservative news outlets, and even against the Twitter accounts belonging to members of this committee.</p><p>While such concerns are routinely dismissed as \"anecdotal,\" or \"unproven,\" the lack of transparency provided by these companies into their decision-making, and their promotion and amplification of algorithms, renders those claims as unverifiable as the ones they seek to invalidate. In other words, neither claim can be affirmatively proven or disproven.</p><p>As VICE News remarked after an image of Twitter's internal content moderation panels leaked, prominently displaying the phrases \"search blacklist\" and \"trends blacklist\" (emphasis added):</p><p>We can't say with 100 percent certainty how the \"Blacklist\" tags work because we don't have full visibility into Twitter's moderation mechanism. We can see its public facing policy, but not debates inside of the company, and more critically, the technical process by which accounts are suspended, banned, or prevented from appearing in search.</p><p>This opacity creates a situation where a devastating lapse in Twitter's security leads to a leaked image of an internal panel that contains the word \"Blacklist,\" which Twitter doesn't use when talking about moderation, and which sounds more sinister than it is.For years, academics, journalists, and yes, conservatives, have been demanding more transparency; these are the kinds of scandals that happen when a company's internal language is different from its carefully crafted blog posts and announcements. n4</p><p>Mark MacCarthy, a senior fellow at the Institute for Technology Law and Public Policy at Georgetown Law, has also noted that the easiest way to dispel accusations of bias is for the tech companies to allow researchers to look under the hood:</p><p>If social media companies are selectively enforcing their rules more vigorously against conservatives than against other points of view, independent researchers should be able to verify this if they have sufficient access to social media data. n5</p><p>To date, however, none of the Big Tech companies have provided regular and system wide algorithmic and content moderation transparency; though, depending on how President Trump's recent executive order on Sec. 230 is implemented, they may soon be required to do so. In the meantime, conservatives are left with case after case of what appears to be a systemic double standard applied by employees of these tech companies, whose staff are notably liberal. n6</p><p>The control that a handful of corporations have over speech has become clear during COVID-19, and the runup to the 2020 election.</p><p>Facebook has taken on \"fact-checking\" with new parameters and absurd outcomes using the notably opaque and subjective category of \"missing context.\" Already, this has been used by PolitiFact to remove digital ads from conservative groups like the American Principles Project.</p><p>Facebook recently applied this same cudgel against conservative comedian Tim Young, who wrote an opinion piece speculating on what President Obama would have done if he had been presented with a Supreme Court vacancy. Absurdly, a fact check by USA Today claimed that an opinion piece speculating about a hypothetical scenario was too dangerous to appear on Facebook or Instagram (owned by Facebook) without a warning label. n7</p><p>These platforms are also now in the medical profession, insofar as they determine what constitutes \"appropriate\" medical information for their users. Google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and other platforms have banned board-certified physicians from discussing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, n8 and positing alternative viewpoints about viral spread and how best to contain it. n9</p><p>In April, Facebook made headlines by removing content promoting anti-lockdown protests for violating social distancing guidelines in certain jurisdictions. n10 However, Facebook embraced no such pseudo-governmental enforcement role against more recent protest activities organized on their platform in violation of local ordinances. n11</p><p>Google's YouTube recently removed an interview with Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist and professor at Stanford University Medical Center and an advisor on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The interview was a data-driven discussion about the social harms of sustained lockdowns. Notably, the interview, which was broadcast in June, was not declared to be \"medical misinformation\" until after Dr. Atlas joined the White House's Coronavirus Task Force in August.</p><p>The platforms routinely cite the World Health Organization (WHO) as the arbiter of what can and cannot be said about medical science on its platform. However, the WHO has shown it can be swayed by China's Communist Party, and as recently as January confidently relayed Chinese assertions that there is \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\" of the virus. n12</p><p>Facebook has also acted as the arbiter of due process rights for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teen charged with fatally shooting two people amid the riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse's attorney says his client acted in self-defense, but Facebook has blocked all posts in praise and support of him, and taken down links to contribute to his legal defense. n13 Facebook, by its own admission one of the most powerful speech companies in the world, n14 has already declared him guilty of mass violence, and restricted the use of its platform to reflect their subjective, extralegal judgement.</p><p>Google has unprecedented power to filter information for most of the planet and seems to flex this muscle with impunity. A 2019 investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that Google \"made algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big businesses over smaller ones,\" and modified search results around subjects like abortion and immigration. n15 In June, Google demonstrated how much power it has to demonetize entire news sites for minor violations of its ad policies. n16 In July, the search engine inexplicably stopped presenting search results for several leading conservative websites. n17 Breitbart News has presented analysis suggesting conservative sites are routinely downgraded. n18</p><p>The gatekeeping role of these mega-platforms is taking on broad and opaque roles as it relates to the upcoming election. Big Tech's influence on voter behavior has already been well-documented. Center-left leaning research psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Google \"displays content to the American public that is biased in favor of one political party.\" He estimated Google's search behavior, which he tested against other search engines in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election, swung as many as 2.6 million votes to Clinton. He also estimates that Google's algorithmic filtering has \"been determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide since at least 2015.\" n19</p><p>Facebook and other tech platforms are reportedly \"war gaming\" different election outcomes, as well as meeting with government officials about \"potential threats to election integrity.\" \"Digital platforms,\" according to reports, are now as important as state and local elections agencies in \"protecting public confidence\" as it relates to \"faith in democracy.\" n20</p><p>The legality of content moderation itself is not at issue--but rather, the profound impact these actions have on the nature of free thought and expression when done at the scale at which these companies exist. A single algorithmic decision made by a private corporation, accountable to no one, changes what kind of viewpoints and information are available to billions of people around the world.</p><p>The appropriate remedy is not to suppress speech or politicize the platforms themselves, but to reform the tools these platforms use to control what we see, and to ensure that consumers have the power to engage with that process. It is also incumbent upon our antitrust enforcement agencies to ensure that whatever actions these tech companies are taking, they are not doing so with monopoly power.</p><p>II. Remedies</p><p>a. Section 230</p><p>A comprehensive approach to combating Big Tech's power will include reforms to Sec. 230, Big Tech's congressionally created liability shield. Multiple Sec. 230 reform efforts are simultaneously happening at once, but all of them share one common goal: to make the recipients of Sec. 230's benefits more transparent and accountable to their users in exchange for the statutory legal privilege they receive.</p><p>The initial intent and purpose of Section 230 was to provide a very narrow immunity designed to give platforms the freedom to filter content that is \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable\" without fear of liability.</p><p>Unfortunately, embedded in that section is a catch-all phrase, \"otherwise objectionable,\" that gives tech platforms discretion to censor anything that they deem \"otherwise objectionable.\" Such broad language lends itself in practice to arbitrariness.</p><p>The intended protections were designed to protect the \"good Samaritan\" behavior of these platforms to remove smutty content online at a time when infant tech companies needed protection from massive liability. In today's Big Tech era, it has created extraordinary legal protections for these massive companies from lawsuits that challenge their suppressive, discriminatory power over the lawful viewpoints of everyday Americans.</p><p>Conservatives are concerned with both sides of the Sec. 230's judicially bloated immunity: that which empowers tech platforms to engage in viewpoint discrimination without recourse, and the shield it gives to tech companies to ignore the harmful content that facilitates unlawful conduct. The parade of horribles is long and indefensible, and includes child pornography, revenge porn, and terrorist conduct.</p><p>As law professor Mary Graw Leary stated in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year, Sec. 230 \"was created with the goal of shielding children from objectionable content, protecting good Samaritans, and protecting a nascent internet. The internet is no longer nascent, and children are at risk of exploitation at unprecedented levels.\" n21</p><p>This latter part is, disturbingly, true. A New York Times report published in February revealed that reports of online sexual abuse grew by more than 50 percent in 2019, \"an indication that many of the world's biggest technology platforms remain infested with the illegal content.\" n22 Between 2017 and 2018, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTipline saw a 541 percent increase in videos reported containing the sexual abuse of children. n23</p><p>Some argue that it is simply the prosecutorial arm of the Department of Justice (DOJ) that needs better resourcing. However, the issue for the tech platforms is less the prosecution of offenders than it is their failure to remove the images from circulation. In one case presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee, images of one child's abuse were on more than 160,000 websites. n24 There is far more these platforms can do to target the preservation and circulation of this content.</p><p>As Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) put it in March, \"some people respond to light, others respond to heat, and I bet if we took away the 230 protection, these companies would feel both light and heat.\" n25</p><p>The DOJ recently put forward a proposal that aims to address both viewpoint bias and the harmful content which Sec. 230 enables. A summary of their proposal is as follows:</p><p>Incentivizing Online Platforms to Address Illicit Content</p><p>* The DOJ has proposed denying Sec. 230 protections to truly bad actors that \"purposely facilitate or solicit third-party content or activity that would violate federal criminal law.\"</p><p>* The DOJ's reform also carves out from a liability shield any material that includes child exploitation and sexual abuse, terrorism, and cyber-stalking.</p><p>* Also left unprotected by Sec. 230 would be any platform that had actual knowledge or notice that the third-party content violated federal criminal law or was otherwise provided with a court judgment holding that the content is unlawful in any respect.</p><p>Clarifying Federal Enforcement Capabilities to Address Unlawful Content</p><p>* The DOJ reform legislation also increases the protection of Americans by making clear that Sec. 230 does not bar civil enforcement actions brought by the federal government.</p><p>Promoting Competition</p><p>* The DOJ also would reform Sec. 230 to explicitly clarify that federal anti-trust claims are not barred by Sec. 230, which only protects against the publication of third-party speech and not liability for anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Promoting Open Discourse and Greater Transparency</p><p>* The DOJ reform proposal would specifically replace the vague \"otherwise objectionable\" language in (c)(2) with \"unlawful\" and \"promotes terrorism.\" This would focus on the core objective of Sec. 230 and remove platforms' ability to remove content arbitrarily based on subjective determinations.</p><p>* The draft legislation adds a statutory definition of \"good faith\" in order to provide more accountability and transparency and to prevent hiding behind the Sec. 230 shield regardless of intent.</p><p>* Lastly, the DOJ suggests explicitly overruling Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v Prodigy Services Co., 1995 WL 323710 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995) to clarify that a platform's removal of content does not, on its own, render the platform a publisher or speaker for all the content on its site.</p><p>Given how pervasive content curation is on online platforms, I believe Congress should consider whether this blanket immunity continues to be justified when platforms actively amplify or suppress the content of others - either through human moderators or their algorithms.</p><p>b. Antitrust</p><p>Antitrust enforcement, the subject of this committee's remit, is equipped to tackle Big Tech's anti-competitive dominance in multiple sectors of the marketplace.</p><p>This committee has heard testimony about various antitrust concerns: if and how Amazon prioritizes its products and services over those of its partners and competitors; Google's dominance in online advertising; Facebook's acquisition strategy for smaller competitors; and if and how Apple favors its own products through the App Store. You have also heard compelling testimony from small businesses about wanton and aggressive anti-competitive behavior by Big Tech giants.</p><p>Small businesses are not the only competitors impacted, however. Entire industries are at the mercy of Big Tech's power. As the National Association of Broadcasters told this committee in a statement earlier this month:</p><p>It is no answer to tell broadcasters that, if they feel disadvantaged by the policies and revenue opportunities offered by the dominant platforms, they can decline to publish their content on Google, YouTube or Facebook and forego availability via various apps or devices. Because hundreds of millions of U.S. consumers use Facebook, Google and YouTube, and own smartphones, tablets and smart speakers produced by companies like Apple and Amazon, local stations have no real choice. Beyond offering over-the-air services, broadcasters must be available on all major platforms and types of devices to remain relevant to audiences and advertisers in the digital age. As a result, TV and radio stations lack bargaining power when dealing with the digital giants that have become gatekeepers for content providers, including local media outlets, seeking to reach audiences and monetize their content online. The digital giants have clear financial incentives to keep consumers engaged with their own platforms, content and apps, and lack effective incentives to adopt policies and practices that promote or financially reward the providers of other content, including local news.</p><p>In short, the dominance of the leading digital platforms significantly and increasingly impairs broadcasters' ability to earn the ad revenues needed to support production of local news and information. n26</p><p>News publishers have also long argued that Google uses its dominance to force publishers to give up their content without adequate compensation. As the News Media Alliance put it:</p><p>In today's digital age, the tech giants' dual control over news distribution and monetization threatens the very survival of news organizations. These tech giants use secret, unpredictable algorithms to determine how and even whether content is delivered to readers. They scrape news organizations' content and use it to their own ends, without permission or remuneration for the companies that generated the content in the first place. They also suppress news organizations' brands, control their data, and refuse to recognize and support quality journalism. In effect, a couple of dominant tech platforms are acting as regulators of the digital news industry. Only these regulators are unconstrained by legislative or democratic oversight. And their primary motivation is not to serve the public interest, but rather to maximize their own advertising revenues. Indeed, two dominant platforms--Google and Facebook--now take the vast majority of U.S. online ad revenue through their online advertising services, leaving news organizations with little to reinvest in high-quality, original journalism. They capture that revenue in two ways. First, they scrape news organizations' content and display it on their own pages, where they can monetize it through ads. Second, they control the advertising technology news organizations use to sell ads on their own sites, and the platforms charge increasingly exorbitant fees for the use of those technologies. n27</p><p>While Congress cannot enforce the antitrust law itself, it has a critical role to play in performing the oversight which ensures the responsible agencies are adequately policing the market. It is critical that these agencies have both the congressional support and resources to assess the growing dominance of billion-dollar companies in the market. Many times, this involves reviewing if previous agency decisions were wisely made.</p><p>For example, William Kovacic, appointed by President George W. Bush to the Federal Trade Commission and later its chair, voted to approve Google's acquisition of the ad technology company Doubleclick. Kovacic recently told the New York Times, \"If I knew in 2007 what I know now, I would have voted to challenge the Doubleclick acquisition.\" n28</p><p>Many on the Right take issue with the use of antitrust enforcement against Big Tech firms. Their claims are generally summarized as follows:</p><p>* Antitrust is being used by conservatives as a political tool to go after Big Tech platforms they do not like.</p><p>* Antitrust cannot solve speech concerns</p><p>* Discussions of antitrust enforcement are actually proxies for updating antitrust law away from the consumer welfare standard.</p><p>I will take these claims one at a time. First, the bipartisan efforts and wide-ranging remedies under discussion make clear that there is growing awareness among legislators that Big Tech's unchecked power in specific circumstances warrants review. Big Tech isn't being singled out for its own sake; rather, specific actions - antitrust violations, viewpoint discrimination, and the facilitation of various criminal acts - are being targeted.</p><p>Second, antitrust's application to \"speech concerns\" may not be direct, but proper enforcement of the law against violations could certainly have tangential effects. Antitrust enforcement does not occur in a vacuum. Enforcing against the monolithic dominance of these companies in one sector, if warranted, could free up the market in such a way that concerns over viewpoint bias could be competed away in ways which Big Tech's market dominance now makes impossible.</p><p>Third, it is the view of myself and the Internet Accountability Project that our antitrust laws do not need to be updated; that the laws on the books are sufficient for tackling per se violations of antitrust as they exist in the tech sector. Antitrust enforcement is law enforcement. As conservatives, we do not support legal amnesty for those who violate our nation's laws - and this should extend to corporations who violate competition laws in the market.</p><p>Conservatives who rightly champion the innovation generated by a free market should be equally vigilant about maintaining its integrity. To repurpose the old adage from Ronald Reagan, \"trust, but verify.\"</p><p>As Congressman Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a member of this committee, has rightly noted:</p><p>Big isn't inherently bad and we should celebrate American success stories. However, when companies use their success as a bat to bludgeon smaller rivals, Congress must address the root causes of these inequities to ensure the American dream remains attainable for all Americans. n29</p><p>III. Conclusion</p><p>When it comes to the expansive power of Big Tech, the question really distills to one of who will rule. In America, it should not be the bureaucrats; it should not be the mob; it should not be the tech oligarchs. Rather, in America, it is the people who rule through our system of selfgovernment. \"I will not willingly cede more power to anyone, not to the state, not to General Motors, said William F Buckley in Up From Liberalism. \"I will hoard my power like a miser, resisting every effort to drain it away from me.\" n30</p><p>Conservativism follows a tradition of skepticism when it comes to concentrations of power. In 1960, Barry Goldwater wrote Conscience of a Conservative. Goldwater - America's first libertarian politician, according to Reason magazine n31 - had a prescient and applicable reminder for American conservatives today. \"Let us henceforth make war on all monopolies--whether corporate or union,\" he noted. \"The enemy of freedom is unrestrained power, and the champions of freedom will fight against the concentration of power wherever they find it.\" n32</p><p>But perhaps it is Russell Kirk, one of the founding fathers of conservative thought, who surmised the challenge most aptly: \"Our conservative task is to reconcile personal freedom with the claims of modern technology, and to try to humanize an age in which [Permanent] Things are in the saddle. n33</p><p>n1 Eric Goldman, Want to Kill Facebook and Google?

I also attach my written testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, dated March 10, 2020, which focuses specifically on the problem of self-preferencing by digital platforms and recommended solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last, I'd like to refer the Subcommittee to my written testimony previously submitted in this investigation, pursuant to the June 11, 2019 hearing \"Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 1: The Free and Diverse Press,\" which, in addition to the solutions proposed in the attached, supports the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act to ensure that the antitrust laws are not used against journalists who collectively negotiate against tech platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chairman Cicilline and Ranking Member Sensenbrenner:</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to share the views of the Open Markets Institute, joined by the undersigned, on promoting fair competition in the digital marketplace. We applaud the Subcommittee for undertaking its critically important investigation. The Subcommittee's hearings have helped immensely to educate the American public and Congress itself on the many existing and emerging threats posed by online platform monopolists. The hearings have helped to remind Americans about the fundamental role that America's anti-monopoly law plays in promoting economic prosperity and in protecting our democracy and our fundamental liberties.</p><p>The corporations that rule online markets for goods, services, information, and news are all more than 20 years old and have dominated their respective fields for more than a decade. n1 Amazon, Apple, and Google have each surpassed $1 trillion in valuation, and Facebook made $70.7 billion in revenue in 2019 on surveillance-based, hyper-targeted advertising. n2</p><p>Unfortunately, competition on merit alone does not explain the phenomenal rise of these corporations to such positions of power and control, nor does it explain the durability of their power. Individuals at each of these corporations have introduced smart ideas and products to market. But much of the success of these corporations is also due to having acquired hundreds of other companies, along with the people and services within these companies, in ways that have enabled these giants to build intricate and self-reinforcing networks of essential services. n3 Many of these acquisitions were clearly illegal under the Clayton Act's prohibition of mergers and acquisitions where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\" n4 They went through because law enforcement agencies failed to enforce the law.</p><p>This illegal monopolization through countless acquisitions, in turn, has played an integral role in powering the further rise of these giants. The platform monopolists of the 21st century have long followed the monopolist's classic playbook. They exploit their positions as providers of multiple essential services to bankrupt, supplant, or sideline rivals in every market in which they operate. They also exploit their position as gatekeepers to the marketplace to manipulate and extort businesses and individuals who simply want to sell their goods, services, and ideas to their fellow citizens. This problem is getting worse fast. The number of businesses that are not at the mercy of the platform monopolists is declining every day, as the giants continue to expand aggressively into new business lines. n5</p><p>In recent written testimony submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding digital platform self-dealing, which is when these corporations exploit their gatekeeper power to favor their own products and services over those provided by the sellers who depend on them to get to market, I detailed some of the ways that I believe these digital platforms are violating (current interpretations of) Section 2. n6</p><p>This illegal monopolization harms citizens in their capacities as entrepreneurs, innovators, creators, and employees, by reducing opportunity, driving down revenue, and driving down income. This monopolization also harms citizens in their capacity as consumers, by robbing them of choice, innovation, quality, and prices discovered through true inter-brand competition. Perhaps most importantly, this illegal monopolization harms individuals as citizens, because these corporations often use their power in ways that disrupt the free press, fair elections, and the marketplace of ideas. n7</p><p>The problem of monopolization was not inevitable. It is due, in part, to enforcers following the libertarian \"Chicago School\" philosophy to guide their understanding of both the purpose of anti-monopoly law and how to enforce the law. This philosophy overvalues economic efficiency while simultaneously ignoring many of the political harms caused by the concentration of economic power. n8</p><p>The problem is also made worse by three decades of monopoly-friendly court decisions based on this same flawed ideology. n9 These decisions have erected substantial and dangerous obstacles for Sherman Act Section 2 claims. Partly as a result of the guidance provided by this ideology, antitrust enforcers in recent years have tended to shy away from aggressive enforcement of the law in any case that relies on Sherman Act Section 2, especially in relation to Sherman Act Section 1 horizontal collusion cases, with their stronger standard of per se illegality.</p><p>Over time, this monopoly problem builds on itself. By not bringing enough Section 2 cases, antitrust enforcers have left pro-monopoly legal precedent unchallenged. n10 Over time, such wrongheaded court decisions can become erroneously perceived as settled law.</p><p>These platform monopolists provide some useful, high-quality services to some portions of the public, but that does not justify a single one of these harms.</p><p>Below, we outline our views on potential solutions according to the topics identified in your letter of March 13, 2020. With these recommended reforms, we aim to open the gates of fair competition to new innovators, restore dynamism to our economy, decrease market concentration, ensure basic rule of law for all sellers and buyers, and protect the security of our nation and our democracy.</p><p>1. Are existing laws that prohibit monopolization and monopolistic conduct adequate? Are current statutes and case law suitable to address any potentially anticompetitive conduct?</p><p>The Open Markets Institute believes that current statutes are capable of addressing the full spectrum of anti-competitive conduct by digital platforms. We believe the main reason for the radical concentration of power in these corporations is not any shortcoming in law, but the lack of political will by antitrust enforcers. We believe this lack of political will is exacerbated by the adherence of law enforcement agencies to dangerously flawed economic philosophies that largely brought us America's monopoly crisis in the first place.</p><p>In short, we believe law enforcement agencies can and should aggressively enforce the antitrust laws against platform monopolists now, without waiting for Congress to strengthen or reform these laws. Indeed, the Open Markets Institute believes that enforcers could push the law in the right direction simply by bringing more aggressive cases under existing legal standards. A good example of how this could work is United States v. Microsoft Corp. n11 because today's digital platforms are following Microsoft's monopolistic playbook.</p><p>Similarly, federal antitrust enforcers also are not fully using the tools available to combat anticompetitive conduct. The FTC has a powerful tool with Section 5 of the FTC Act, n12 which is broader than the Sherman and Clayton Acts. n13 Through Section 5, the FTC can establish rules of fair competition and overcome bad Section 2 caselaw. n14 But the agency rarely uses this authority. The FTC also has investigative and rule-making authority that it could broadly deploy. n15</p><p>One of the simplest ways for Congress to address the dangers posed by the platform monopolists is to demand that enforcers at the DOJ, FTC, FCC, and other agencies charged with keeping markets open and competitive, do their jobs aggressively. n16</p><p>That said, the Open Markets Institute also believes that antitrust jurisprudence has in certain respects become so deeply flawed that contemporary interpretations of the law bear little or no resemblance to the original intent of Congress. In other words, three decades of monopoly-friendly court decisions based upon libertarian \"Chicago School\" ideology have erected substantial and dangerous obstacles for Sherman Act Section 2 claims. n17</p><p>The Open Markets Institute therefore would welcome efforts by Congress to strengthen antitrust standards by correcting wrongly decided court decisions. Further, the Open Markets Institute would also welcome efforts by Congress to remove complexity in antitrust doctrine and make antitrust cases easier, faster, and cheaper.</p><p>Specific to the digital marketplace, the Open Markets Institute believes there is a clear hierarchy in the importance and effectiveness of particular existing anti-monopoly laws in addressing the concentration of power by the platform monopolists. As Congress considers how it can act to reduce dangerous concentrations of power and control in the digital marketplace, the Open Markets Institute encourages members to use all the following tools in the following order.</p><p>Nondiscrimination and Neutrality</p><p>Many students of complex networks say that digital online technologies result in business models and corporate structures that are monopolistic by nature, and they point to a principle called network effects. Network effects arise when the value that a user derives from a product increases based on the number of other people who use it. n18 People want to be where their friends are, for example. A social network without a user's friends isn't much use.</p><p>There is nothing new about network effects. The same was true of transportation systems such as railroads and of communications systems such as the telephone, and American citizens have developed a wide array of simple tools during the past 150 years to prevent private actors from using such essential networks to manipulate and exploit individual citizens and businesses.</p><p>The single most important federal law aimed at such network monopolies was the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) of 1887. n19 The basic aim of the ICA was to ensure that the operators of the network treated every customer the same, charging each one the same price for the same service. Such \"common carrier\" rules long predated the ICA at both the federal and state levels. But the ICA provided the first coherent federal framework and set of principles for regulating such essential services at the national level. In certain respects, it is the most important act in U.S. history for establishing the foundations for true rule of law, other than the Constitution itself.</p><p>Although the focus of this question centers on the Sherman and Clayton antitrust laws, it is impossible to understand these two laws without taking full account of the Interstate Commerce Act. The fundamental link between these legal regimes was made clear by Sen. John Sherman himself. In addition to providing a key model for the Interstate Commerce Act with his authorship of the National Telegraph Act of 1866, n20 Sherman, in his famous speech promoting the antitrust law that bears his name, made clear the fundamental importance of common carrier rules.</p><p>\"It is the right of every man to work, labor, and produce in any lawful vocation and to transport his production on equal terms and conditions and under like circumstances,\" Sherman said. n21 \"This is industrial liberty, and lies at the foundation of the equality of all rights and privileges.\" n22 In other words, Sen. Sherman himself understood that his antitrust act both stood upon and built upon the foundation of the Interstate Commerce Act, which outlaws individually tailored discriminations by corporations with a monopoly over the provision of an essential service or good.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, and other platform monopolists are all, in multiple respects, modern analogs of the communications and transportation networks of the past. Each of them provides multiple essential services. Unfortunately, up until now, such rules have never been applied to these corporations. This is what has left them free to exploit their character as gatekeepers to discriminate in the pricing and delivery of their services, in ways that empower them to manipulate and exploit individual citizens, businesses, and indeed entire realms of our national life.</p><p>Fortunately, American citizens have a variety of ways to address this huge and pressing challenge. The simplest and most straightforward way would be for the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Federal Communications Commission to assert their full authority to regulate the terms of service and pricing behaviors of these platform monopolists. This is essentially what the FCC did to Internet Service Providers in 2015 with the Open Internet Order. n23</p><p>Sen. A1 Franken made this point simply in a November 2017 article in the Guardian'. \"As tech giants become a new kind of internet gatekeeper, I believe the same basic principles of net neutrality should apply here: No one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn't. And Facebook, Google, and Amazon - like ISPs - should be 'neutral' in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platforms.\" n24</p><p>If the FTC and FCC both fail in their duty, the Department of Justice, states attorneys general, and other agencies have a variety of other tools - including the Essential Facilities Doctrine -which they can use to achieve the same basic ends. n25 Obviously, Congress always has an absolute right to impose such rules on these corporations at any time, and the Open Markets Institute strongly encourages Congress to do so if these other institutions continue to fail to complete their mission of serving the public.</p><p>Structural Separations - Vertical and Horizontal</p><p>Applying common carrier rules to the platform monopolists will resolve many of the threats these corporations now pose to American democracy and American capitalism. But to finish the job of ensuring that these corporations provide neutral and fair service to all sellers and buyers, and all writers and speakers and all readers and listeners, it is necessary to completely separate ownership of the platforms from ownership of the goods, services, information, and entertainment sold across the platforms.</p><p>Structural separation has been the general rule for most of U.S. history in cases of network monopoly and essential services. We can trace clear prohibitions on such \"vertical integration\" at the federal level back to the National Bank Act of 1863, n26 in the midst of the Civil War. Such rules were also routinely imposed in the act of chartering corporations to engage in particular lines of business. As Lina Khan has written in Separations of Platforms and Commerce, such rules were a standard part of the antitrust toolkit and have been used to carefully restrict the powers of corporations such as ATandT and Microsoft. n27</p><p>In every instance, the basic aim of such laws has been to ensure that corporate managers are not presented with conflicts of interest that might tempt them to not provide fair service to individuals and businesses that depend on these corporations to get to market.</p><p>Today, however, we see innumerable instances in which the platform monopolies have entered lines of business that put them into direct competition with the people and companies that depend on the platforms' services. Amazon, for instance, sells Amazon-produced books, movies, television shows, apparel, toys, electronics, foods, and even batteries, in addition to hundreds of other products, putting the giant corporation in direct competition against independent makers of these same products. n28 Google, meanwhile, has long pitted its own in-house versions of everything from travel services to advertising services to local business recommendations against similar services provided by independent companies. Clearly, in many such instances, the platform will have an interest in selling its own product before those of its customer/rivals.</p><p>Clearly, in all such instances, the platform has a variety of tools at hand with which to favor the sale of its own products over those of the independent companies that depend on the platforms to get to market.</p><p>These corporations have repeatedly demonstrated that they are absolutely willing to exploit their gatekeeper positions to promote their own interests over those of independent companies that depend on the platforms' services and over the interests of the public as a whole. Such selfdealing or self-preferencing has enabled these corporations to become the dominant providers of a vast and fast-growing number of goods and services.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute supports a solution that has been advanced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren: to structurally eliminate the platforms' conflicts of interest and remove both their incentives and their abilities to exclude competition. n29 Here again, the Open Markets Institute believes that existing law provides enforcers with tools that empower them to break up the platform monopolists along vertical lines in ways that would entirely eliminate all conflicts of interest. That said, action by Congress once again could yield a quicker, cleaner, and more comprehensive solution to the problem.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute also believes that enforcement agencies and Congress should immediately begin to study ways to break up the platform monopolists along horizontal lines, whenever the networked nature of the service does not make doing so difficult or impossible. The Open Markets Institute has long held that enforcers should simply reverse Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram; these acquisitions of growing rivals violated the Clayton Act's prohibition of acquisitions where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly,\" and should simply be undone. n30</p><p>The Open Markets Institute has also encouraged enforcers to consider separating one platform monopoly from another, in instances where multiple such platforms have been tied together through acquisition. Google is particularly ripe for such restructuring, and the Open Markets Institute has publicly advocated that enforcers force Google's holding company to spin off YouTube, Maps, Android, and the corporation's suite of online advertising technologies, among other monopoly platforms. Such actions have ample precedent in U.S. law. One of the most famous such actions took place in 1913, when the Wilson administration forced ATandT to sell off the Western Union telegraph service. n31</p><p>Interoperability</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has made it even clearer than before that Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other platform monopolists are, in many respects, utilities. In recent years, however, the platform monopolists have done an excellent job of characterizing any and all forms of utility regulation as being overly statist and destructive of innovation.</p><p>In fact, the American people have developed over the years a variety of ways to ensure that even essential utilities must compete in ways that force them to constantly innovate, both in terms of technology and in terms of service. One of the simplest ways to do so is to make it easy for upstart competitors to enter into direct rivalry with the incumbent utilities.</p><p>One of the most effective ways to achieve this goal has been to enforce interoperability requirements that make it easier for customers of one platform to shift their businesses to another platform. Over the years, regulators and antitrust enforcers have imposed interoperability requirements against ATandT and Microsoft, among others, opening up competition in longdistance calling, telephones, and internet browsers. n32</p><p>For the platform monopolists, interoperability would allow users to authorize networks to securely communicate with one another, much like how consumers with different email providers can send emails to one another. It would help overcome the network effects barrier to entry. For example, interoperability would allow new social media platforms to integrate with Facebook's platform, using APIs offered on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, with consumers empowered to control which data is shared and with whom. Users' control over their data is critical to prevent privacy violations.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently offered his own ideas as to how to restructure these businesses, and one of his proposals was data portability. n33 This means that users could take their Facebook data to another platform. But data portability doesn't overcome the network effects barrier for new companies to compete with Facebook, because moving data to a platform that doesn't allow communication with friends is of little use to consumers.</p><p>The key thing to remember is that such interoperability requirements alone are not sufficient to deal with any of the fundamental political threats posed by the platform monopolists. On the other hand, once we have subjected these corporations to traditional common carrier rules and restructured them to reinforce their neutrality, interoperability requirements will go a long way toward ensuring that the utilities of tomorrow must work hard to provide the innovations that will keep their customers happy.</p><p>Exclusionary Conduct</p><p>The Open Markets Institute believes that the existing anti-monopoly laws of the United States are generally adequate to the task of protecting our democracy and liberty and promoting constructive and fair competition within open markets. America's present monopoly crisis is due not to any fundamental shortcomings in existing law, but rather to a combination of extremely weak enforcement made worse by the teachings of the deeply flawed, efficiency-fetishizing ideology used to interpret the law.</p><p>In the case of the platform monopolists, the combination of common carrier rules and careful restructuring of the corporations will solve the most dangerous threats posed by these corporations, but the Open Markets Institute believes that further steps are necessary to fully eliminate exclusionary conduct. Should the agencies and courts fail to take these steps or actively oppose them, then the Open Markets Institute would strongly support action by Congress to remove complexity from anti-monopoly law and to streamline monopolization cases so that citizens can attain justice more quickly and less expensively.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute has repeatedly made clear that the easiest way to remove complexity from the law and to streamline cases is to adopt Bright Line rules for structuring markets and limiting corporate behaviors. Such Bright Line rules were standard in U.S. anti-monopoly law and enforcement from the founding until the early 1980s. A good example of how such rules work is the 1968 Merger Guidelines published by the Department of Justice. n34 These rules set out a series of strict market-share tests for challenging horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate mergers. They also rejected pro-merger arguments that hinge on theoretical increases in productive efficiency.</p><p>The Chicago School ideology imposed on American anti-monopoly law in the early 1980s intentionally overthrew this Bright Line approach and replaced it with a largely subjective system of enforcement based on impossible-to-define standards and vague and easily manipulated guidelines. This gross distortion of the expressed will of Congress has stolen from Americans their single most important weapon against concentrated economic power, in ways that have undermined democracy and that have radically reduced individual liberty.</p><p>For instance, any citizen or business seeking to vindicate the right to a fair, competitive marketplace now has to spend huge sums to hire economic experts. n35 This is true also for the government when it seeks to protect the public interest. In 2018, the FTC spent nearly $16 million on fees for testifying expert economists, despite the fact that the agency already employs some 80 economists with Ph.D.s in its own Bureau of Economists. n36 As a result, even in the most egregious of cases, monopolists' victims can rarely afford to sue for justice.</p><p>Bright Line rules would make antitrust enforcement more efficient and effective. n37 Specific to the online platform monopolists, Bright Line rules should be used to clarify outright the per se illegality of the following practices:</p><p>* Refusing to deal with customers and rivals.</p><p>* Prohibiting distributors, suppliers, or customers from doing business with rival firms.</p><p>* Penalizing purchasers who do not place a large share of their business with the firm.</p><p>* Tying the purchase of one good or service to the purchase of a separate good or service, whether done through contractual or technological means.</p><p>* Pricing below average variable cost on a significant volume of commerce.</p><p>* Most favored nation clauses.</p><p>* Using monopoly power in one market to create competitive advantage in a secondary market.</p><p>* Buying default installation or prime placement through slotting-fee agreements (such as Google's payment to Apple to set the default search engine for iOS devices to Google's product). Choice screens that present users with a range of competitive options, without those competitors having to pay to play, should replace such agreements.</p><p>Under Bright Line rules, a platform monopolist would be allowed to overcome the presumption of illegality under only very limited circumstances. To rebut this presumption, the firm should have to show that the practice is needed to introduce a new product or service and that a less restrictive alternative is not available.</p><p>As the Open Markets Institute made clear in recently filed comments on the FTC's proposed vertical merger guidelines, Bright Line rules should also clearly apply to vertical mergers. Here too, the Department of Justice's 1968 Merger Guidelines are a model for using clear rules to protect decentralized market structures in the digital economy. Congress should use the 1968 Merger Guidelines as a template for legislation that strengthens enforcement against vertical acquisitions by the platform monopolists.</p><p>Congress should also remove court-imposed obstacles to anti-monopoly enforcement, and Appendix A lists court decisions that should be the highest priority for legislative repeal.</p><p>2. Are existing laws that prohibit anti-competitive transactions adequate? Are current statutes and case law sufficient to address potentially anti-competitive vertical and conglomerate mergers, data acquisitions, or acquisitions of potential competitors?</p><p>As we made clear above, the Open Markets Institute believes that current statutes are capable of addressing the full spectrum of anti-competitive conduct by digital platforms. And we believe that law enforcement agencies can and should aggressively enforce the antitrust laws against platform monopolists now, without waiting for Congress to strengthen or reform these laws</p><p>Of course, traditional case-by-case enforcement of the law will prove to be very time-consuming, and it is increasingly clear that the concentration of power and control in the hands of the platform monopolists grows more extreme and dangerous by the day. n38</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting worldwide economic crisis have resulted in a sudden, sharp further consolidation of economic power and control by Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The essential nature of their communications, transportation, distribution services, and physical capacities has become only more obvious. And the corporations have in some respects become only more aggressive in exploiting this power to serve their private interests, which include the concentration of even more economic and political power than they now enjoy.</p><p>Recently, the Open Markets Institute called on Congress, the executive branch, and the courts to immediately impose a complete ban on all acquisitions by any corporation with more than $100 million in annual revenue and by any financial institution or equity fund with more than $100 million in capitalization, for the duration of the economic crisis set into motion by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Open Markets Institute believes that such a ban is needed to prevent a wholesale concentration of additional power by corporations that already dominate or largely dominate their industries, especially in ways that may significantly worsen the crisis that now threatens America's health, social, and economic systems.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has simply sped up processes that were already well under way, especially in the digital marketplace. That's why, even before the pandemic, the Open Markets Institute had already called for the FTC to impose a temporary ban on all acquisitions by Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. n39 The Open Markets Institute recommends that such a ban be lifted only when the FTC certifies to Congress that it has fully investigated platform monopolists' exclusionary and predatory conduct and has brought the weight of the antitrust laws to bear in suing to stop such conduct in court.</p><p>One particularly strong reason for such a ban on takeovers by Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon is the danger posed by platform monopolists' acquisitions of nascent competitors. n40 The platform monopolists have repeatedly - almost systematically - acquired the companies that posed competitive threats to them, while these rivals were still in their infancy. Often the platforms have exploited their control of underlying essential infrastructures both to identify such threatening upstarts and to strong-arm them into selling out. Because of their small size, such deals rarely even attract the notice of antitrust enforcers.</p><p>Another reason for such a ban is that the measures for evaluating mergers dictated by the Chicago School ideology - price and output - are of little use in assessing digital platforms' acquisitions of nascent competitors. Consumers often pay for digital services with data, not dollars. Unfortunately, like so many other antitrust principles intended to promote open markets, antitrust law's potential competition doctrine has been rendered toothless by overly burdensome legal standards introduced in recent decades. Here again, absent a coherent effort by enforcers to address this problem, Congress should create a structural presumption against the acquisition of competitive threats, in the spirit of the 1968 Merger Guidelines. n41</p><p>Should Congress choose to make such a ban temporary, it should also require the platform monopolists - once the ban has been lifted - to ensure that the acquired assets never engage in any form of discrimination on price or terms and are completely and perpetually interoperable.</p><p>In addition, should Congress choose to make such a ban temporary, it should also require that the platform monopolists notify the FTC and DOJ of all acquisitions regardless of size. The legislation should require the FTC and DOJ to subject all such acquisitions to second requests and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment. The legislation should require enforcers to evaluate every acquisition by Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon based on the data that the acquisition would allow the platforms to collect, even if the acquisition target does not collect data. The legislation should ban any mergers that would allow a platform monopolist to acquire data or algorithmic machine learning that would either fortify the monopolist's market power or create entry barriers for competition.</p><p>In any such legislation, Congress should also require that, if the FTC or DOJ approve any acquisition by a platform monopolist, each agency must issue an in-depth statement to the public detailing the following: the scope of their investigation, any competitive concerns the agency encountered or that were raised by third parties, why those concerns did not lead to a merger block, how the acquisition will impact privacy, whether the acquisition will enhance the platform monopolists' ability to acquire additional data or will transfer data or algorithmic machine learning to the platform monopolist, and how any such data acquisition will erect barriers to competitive entry or impact competition among existing market participants.</p><p>3. Is the institutional structure of antitrust enforcement--including the current levels of appropriations to the antitrust agencies, existing agency authorities, congressional oversight of enforcement, and current statutes and case law-- adequate to promote the robust enforcement of the antitrust laws?</p><p>The Open Markets Institute believes there are a number of problems with the structure and behavior of antitrust agencies, with current levels of appropriations, with current levels of oversight, and with how we compartmentalize the discussions and authorities for the regulation of our digital marketplace. We also believe that Congress should move swiftly to make it easier for citizens to organize against the power of the platform monopolists.</p><p>The Role of Economics</p><p>Until the early 1980s, economics played a relatively minor role in the enforcement of antitrust laws. In large part, this was because comparisons of the relative efficiencies of different market structures were rarely needed in a regime characterized by Bright Line rules that aimed to protect particular political and social outcomes.</p><p>Beginning in the early 1980s, however, the Reagan administration, in tandem with introducing the flawed Chicago School ideology to competition policy, radically increased the role that economists played in determining what constitutes a just outcome in the enforcement of antitrust law. This included doubling the number of economists within the division by 1986, to nearly three economists for every 10 lawyers. And it included the decision to elevate the division's chief economist to the role of deputy assistant attorney general.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute believes that these changes played a major role in subverting the ability of the agencies to enforce U.S. antitrust law according to the original will of the American people as expressed through Congress. We further believe that Congress should now entirely reassess the role of economics within competition policy and reassess the relative levels of funding for economics within the agencies.</p><p>Appropriations</p><p>The Open Markets Institute calls on both federal and state legislators to allocate more resources to state attorneys general for the enforcement of antitrust laws. n42 The American people have long promoted competition among agencies in the enforcement of the law, to ensure effective checks and balances in economic regulation. One way the American people achieved this in antitrust was through the Clayton Antitrust Act, which ensures that every state in the United States has antitrust authorities equal to those of the federal government. n43</p><p>In recent years, the wisdom of these actions has been made clear repeatedly. States attorneys general have time and again proven to be more aggressive in antitrust enforcement than the FTC or DOJ. Unfortunately, most states do not have sufficient staff members to pursue nearly as many cases as they would like. Bigger states such as New York have about a dozen antitrust lawyers. But many states only have one or even one-half of an antitrust enforcer. Congress should allocate funding for state enforcers to increase their teams and resources so they can enforce antitrust laws against digital platforms, which have tremendous amounts of funds available for their defenses.</p><p>Oversight</p><p>The Open Markets Institute believes that Congress, in its oversight capacity, must require greater reporting and transparency from the FTC about its investigative and enforcement efforts regarding platform monopolists. Congress should hold the FTC accountable for weak enforcement, such as the FTC's recent fines against Facebook and YouTube for repeated consent decree violations. Fines alone are not enough, because they don't change platform monopolists' destructive business models and anti-competitive practices. Google has handed over more than $9 billion to the European Commission since 2017 for antitrust violations, but Google has not fundamentally changed the ways that it excludes competition.</p><p>Congress should also pressure the FTC to use its 6(b) authority to study targeted advertising, disinformation, election interference, the monopolization of digital ad revenue by digital platforms, and other harms related to platform monopolies. n44</p><p>Privacy</p><p>The Open Markets Institute believes that it is vital to promote greater coordination between enforcers of anti-monopoly law and privacy law. As we made clear in a letter last year, the Open Markets Institute believes that privacy law cannot be fully effective until it is buttressed by anti-monopoly law. n45 As we also made clear, we believe that certain anti-monopoly policies -especially common carrier rules - can help to reduce many privacy concerns. n46</p><p>In the digital marketplace, privacy and monopoly are intricately related. n47 Meaningful privacy reforms would, for instance, undercut Facebook's and Google's dominance because comprehensive tracking of users is required to support the platforms' targeted digital advertising business models, and privacy reforms would undercut Amazon's dominance because it uses data to disadvantage its competitors. n48 Massive data collection allows tech giants to strengthen their monopoly power and erect barriers to competitive entry.</p><p>Facebook, for example, has used its control of data to try to shut out rivals. Leaked internal Facebook documents revealed that CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally kept a list of strategic competitors, who were not permitted to access the Facebook Graph API n49 Such behavior amounts to a discriminatory refusal to deal, which violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act under current legal standards. If a monopoly refuses to offer a service to a competitor that it offers to others, or if a monopoly has done business with the competitor and then stops for anticompetitive reasons, such behavior amounts to illegal monopolization.</p><p>In another leaked document, a Facebook employee suggested cutting off a competitor's access to Facebook's API and using privacy as a pretense to justify the move. n50 Facebook seems to define privacy as keeping consumers' data out of others companies' hands. Individuals, as consumers and as citizens, also need privacy protection from Facebook itself.</p><p>The most invasive forms of surveillance should be prohibited outright. As journalist David Dayen wrote in an article for The New Republic, \"the U.S. can take one simple, legal step to roll back this dystopian nightmare: ban targeted advertising.\" n51 We support such a ban. At a minimum, microtargeted advertising should be banned for several months before elections. n52</p><p>Another way to protect privacy is through stronger antitrust enforcement against exclusionary conduct and illegal mergers that fortify monopoly power. Monopoly power allows platform monopolists to abuse consumers' privacy without losing their business to competitors because consumers have nowhere else to go. n53 Consumers pay monopoly rents of data and receive a lower-quality product, since privacy is a dimension of quality. Monopoly power also allows platforms to keep consumers in the dark about the ways that the platforms abuse consumers' privacy, and greater competition could help shed light on Big Tech's privacy violations. For example, the privacy-protecting search engine DuckDuckGo, in a bid for consumers' business, provides education through its newsletter on the ways that Google and other companies violate privacy.</p><p>Immunity for Illegal Behavior</p><p>The Open Markets Institute believes that Congress should reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, n54 which at present gives the platform monopolists far-reaching legal immunity for actions that other corporations must police against. Section 230 was first enacted nearly a quarter of a century ago as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. n55 It grants broad immunity to \"interactive computer services\" from lawsuits seeking to hold the services liable for information published by an \"information content providers.\" n56</p><p>One example of an unintended consequence of Section 230 is that dominant platforms remain legally unaccountable for the libel, fake news, fraudulent content, bots, and hate speech flowing across their platforms. At the same time, however, these firms are uniquely and unfairly able to profit from the spread of such content, because they sell advertising next to it. But these platforms are in competition for advertising revenues with traditional publishers, who do not have Section 230 immunity. In addition to reforming Section 230, another possible solution to these imbalanced terms of competition would be to prohibit entities enjoying Section 230 immunity from selling advertising.</p><p>The online world and the offline world are no longer separate. Giving a carte blanche to internet actors to violate offline laws means that we live in a lawless society.</p><p>For instance, broadcasters and journalists are held to legal standards for political ads. Facebook, too, should be held to those same standards, or it should be prevented from selling those ads entirely. Similarly, wiretapping or reading someone else's mail is illegal, and, in 12 states, so is recording someone without their consent. Similar surveillance by platform monopolists should be illegal. Similarly, fair housing laws prohibit unlawful discrimination in advertising, yet even after Facebook promised to stop this practice, a ProPublica investigation found that the discrimination persisted. Discrimination by algorithm should be just as illegal as discrimination by any other means.</p><p>Removing Obstacles to Private Antitrust Enforcement</p><p>The Open Markets Institute also calls on Congress to make it easier for citizens to bring class action lawsuits. The American people developed class action lawsuits, in ways that supplement government enforcement, to help deter corporations from abusing their power. In recent years, however, courts have used the constructs of antitrust injury and antitrust standing to erect many procedural obstacles that limit who can sue under the antitrust laws and under what circumstances they can sue. n57 These obstacles clearly flaunt the intent of Congress. Procedural barriers to private class actions, including the widespread use of clauses that require people harmed by monopolization to seek arbitration instead of suing in court, should also be eliminated. n58</p><p>Protections for Concerted Activity and Cooperation Among Workers, Professionals, Small Firms, and Consumers</p><p>Along with controlling and reducing platform dominance, permitting the powerless to build power is a pillar of American democracy. Workers, professionals, small businesses, and consumers must have the right to band together to challenge concentrated economic power that has not been addressed by the law enforcement agencies. As a first step, federal antitrust enforcers must abandon all efforts to interfere with the right of independent actors to freely associate, including efforts to bargain collectively and organize boycotts.</p><p>To ensure that this freedom of association is durable and not subject to abrupt changes in prosecutorial discretion, Congress should enact a statutory right for workers, professionals, small businesses, and consumers to act in concert. It has an existing model on which to draw: the 1922 Capper-Volstead Act that protects cooperation among farmers and ranchers. n59 Congress should generalize the Capper-Volstead Act to cover workers, professionals, and small businesses (as defined by assets or revenue). A general Capper-Volstead Act would protect the right to engage in coordinated activity and establish public oversight of this concerted action.</p><p>As the history of cooperation among farmers shows, such action can be the basis for democratizing key sections of the economy. In the near term, cooperation among individually powerless actors can reduce inequality in the marketplace and yield fairer terms of trade with large corporations. In the medium and long term, collective action can serve as the foundation of democratically owned and operated enterprises that directly compete against investor-owned corporations.</p><p>In the interim, medium-sized and even large businesses should also be permitted to engage in limited forms of collective action when confronting dominant platforms. Toward this end, the Open Markets Institute supports the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act proposed by Rep. Cicilline. Until platforms' dominance is tamed, this measure is necessary to rebalance gross disparities in bargaining power. n60 The exemption is carefully circumscribed and structured in a way so that newspapers and other media outlets can engage in collective action for only certain ends and for only a limited time.</p><p>To conclude, our economy, businesses small and large, and consumers would all benefit from immediate action to rein in anti-competitive conduct and acquisitions by platform monopolists. Consumers benefit from the choice, innovation, and quality that robust competition brings. Consumers are also citizens who benefit from the free flow of speech. They are the employees of companies that will benefit when platform extraction ceases. And they are entrepreneurs who deserve an opportunity to compete in the digital marketplace based on merit.</p><p>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide input on these important issues.

DOUG COLLINS (R-GA.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: The Committee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses, at any time. We welcome everyone to today's hearing, Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 5, Competitors in the Digital Economy. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. </p><p>It's a pleasure to be here at the University of Colorado Law School for today's hearing, the fifth in the subcommittee's series on online platforms and market power and this subcommittee's first field hearing in more than a decade. </p><p>In July, the subcommittee received testimony from executives representing the four dominant online platforms; Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, along with a panel of leading experts about the effective market power in the digital economy on innovation and entrepreneurship. </p><p>Through both that hearing and other parts of the subcommittee's investigation, it has become clear these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online. </p><p>But Stacy Mitchell, the Director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, testified and I quote, \"A growing share of our commerce now flows through a handful of digital platforms. These powerful gatekeepers not only control market access but also directly compete with the businesses that depend on them.\" End quote. </p><p>It is apparent that the dominant platforms are increasingly using their gatekeeper power in abusive and coercive ways. Because these platforms function as bottlenecks for online commerce, they're able to set the terms and conditions of competition, giving them immense power to pick winners or losers in the online economy. </p><p>It is far too common to hear horror stories from startups and other small businesses about how dominant platforms abrupt changes have destroyed their business. A single sudden change from an algorithm, a software update, or new product design can be disastrous for the millions of companies that depend on these platforms to get to market. </p><p>And because these platforms actively compete with the very business they rely on, that rely on them, what may be portrayed as an innocent change could very well be a deliberate strategy to crush any existing, or potential competition. Companies across the online ecosystem, both large and small, have found themselves dependent on the arbitrary whim of these platform giants, one algorithm tweak away from ruin. </p><p>In many cases, there's little notice, or any real recourse for the companies that are disadvantaged by the platforms conduct. Because their decisions are, largely, unaccountable, opaque and result in sweeping consequences, the dominant platforms effectively serve as private regulators. </p><p>Dominant platforms could also use their gatekeeper power to dictate anticompetitive, take it or leave it, contract terms. Startups and small businesses have had to sign away certain basic rights, or even hand over valuable data to a competitor, as the price of accessing their customers through the platform. Such coercive terms of doing business would, undoubtedly, be absent in a competitive marketplace. </p><p>For locally owned businesses that are the economic lifeblood of their communities, as both job creators and engines of prosperity, this gatekeeper power and how the platforms are exercising it is of tremendous concern. </p><p>Many small businesses are forced to run on dominant platforms to advertise, or sell their products and services online. In many cases, they do not have an alternative. </p><p>Earlier this week, my staff spoke with an online seller, whose entire economic livelihood and his family's health, has been jeopardized by one of the dominant platform's sudden arbitrary and reckless decision to suspend his business and block access to his inventory. Not only does this dynamic threaten ongoing competition, but it also has lasting effects as a powerful disincentive for new entrants to try and compete with powerful incumbents. </p><p>As Patrick Spence, the CEO of Sonos, will testify today, this shuttering of competition online dries up the venture capital new companies need to develop the next inventions and to bring them to market. Binging capital firms are well aware of the kill zone that surrounds startups that pass within striking distance of the dominant platforms. They stay away from those investments. End quote. </p><p>Today, we will hear from the CEOs, founders and senior executives of several dynamic and innovative companies that must confront this economic nightmare. Each of the innovative companies represented here, today, Sonos, Popsockets, Tile and Basecamp, are American success stories. I applaud them for their courage to share their testimony, in the face of potential retaliation by the dominant platforms. </p><p>We've been in touch with a number of companies with similar perspectives that, understandably, will not testify, due to this very real concern. </p><p>With that, I want to thank the esteemed panel of witnesses for joining us, today. We also want to thank subcommittee vice chair, Congressman Neguse, who represents Boulder, Colorado, and advocates strongly of the field hearing be in his district. I also want to thank Dean Jim Anaya and all the hard-working professors and professional staff at Colorado Law who assisted us in having this hearing, today, and thank them for hosting. </p><p>And I, particularly, want to welcome and thank Congressman Ken Buck from Colorado, who is an esteemed member of the subcommittee and has been very active in this investigation and a representative of Colorado's fourth Congressional District. </p><p>And I'd now like to recognize him for the purposes of making an opening statement. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. chairman. And I very much appreciate you holding this hearing in God's country and joining us, here in God's country, for the hearing. And I'm very appreciative that my friends, Congressman Neguse and Congressman Perlmutter have left the swamp with me, last night, on a plane to get here. And we are here safely and working on this important issue. </p><p>Today, as we continue our oversight of the state of competition in the tech center, our focus is shifting from looking at how larger digital platforms operate, to hearing what it is like to complete with these platforms. </p><p>Each of our panelists represent companies that are in the arena, innovating and competing, daily, to deliver value to customers. They have real skin in the game and we look forward to learning from their unique perspectives. </p><p>To begin, I want to review the principles that I think Congress should focus on in our inquiry. First, innovation in competition and the tech center have produced enormous value for consumers. We should not forget about those benefits, as we consider the current state of competition in the tech center. </p><p>Second, any legislative proposals that emerge from our inquiry should be consistent with maintaining a free and competitive marketplace. Proposals to construct broad new regulatory regimes must be viewed with caution. Experience has shown that burdensome regulations often miss the mark. </p><p>Regulations often come too late to resolve anything and this approach is often less efficient than the free market. Regulators are often not nimble enough to keep pace with a dynamic marketplace so that the regulatory regime has the effect of entrenching incumbents, rather than encouraging competition. </p><p>Third, big is not necessarily bad. Antitrust laws do not exist to punish success, but to promote competition. Congress should help foster an atmosphere where ideas flourish and startups can innovate, fairly compete, grow and succeed. </p><p>With these principles in mind, over the past few years, we have seen the largest platforms continue to expand and increase their market power. The increased concentration and market power of a small group of companies has raised concerns from a diverse array of constituencies about how that power is being used. </p><p>This includes domestic and international regulators and enforcement authorities, small, medium and large companies and consumers. Our task, during these hearings, has been to evaluate whether true antitrust harms are occurring in the tech center. And if so, whether the existing antitrust laws are adequate to address these harms. </p><p>To understand these complex questions, we have invited a diverse panel of market participants, companies that compete directly with the large platforms. They rely on the services of the large platforms and in some cases, both compete with and rely on the large platforms. </p><p>Companies that both compete with and rely on the largest digital platforms have become more and more common, especially as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have continued to expand in the broader and more diverse business lines.  </p><p>We know that many tech companies rely on the infrastructure services provided by large platform companies, in order to serve their customers while, simultaneously, having to directly compete with the platform companies. </p><p>To demonstrate, consider the hypothetical company, A, that competes with one of Google's products but also relies on a different Google product to run its business, while relatedly, Company B, relies on Amazon, or Apple's platform for its success and then Amazon or Apple launches a new product that competes directly with company B. </p><p>In these circumstances, the question arises of where the line sits between fierce and healthy competition and anticompetitive conduct. Do the large platforms use their market power in one business line to harm competitors in another business line? And if that does occur, how do we determine whether the allegedly harmful conduct was motivated solely by a desire to improve the product, or whether there was anti-competitive motive. </p><p>I hope that our panel can discuss these and other related questions, today. Each of our panelists has significant experience competing in the digital economy and they have a unique perspective to offer us, today. </p><p>I look forward to learning from them, so that we can better understand what competing with, or relying on the largest platforms, looks like in the real world. </p><p>I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Buck. Before I introduce our panel of witnesses, we are also joined by the distinguished representative from the seventh congressional district, Mr. Perlmutter, who serves both on the financial services, the rules committee and science and technology, and has been involved in this area, in a number of different ways. And I'd ask unanimous consent of the committee to allow Mr. Perlmutter to participate, in full, in this hearing. </p><p>Without objection, it is so ordered. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's witnesses. Our first witness is Patrick Spence, the Chief Executive Officer at Sonos. Mr. Spence joined Sonos in 2012, as their Chief Commercial Officer and has played a central role in the development and launch of some of the company's most successful products. </p><p>Before starting at Sonos, Mr. Spence got more than 14 years at IM-BlackBerry in a variety of roles, ultimately becoming Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. He was named one of Canada's top 40, under 40, in 2007. Mr. Spence received an honors degree from Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario. </p><p>Our second witness is David Barnett. He's Founder and CEO of Popsocket, LLC. Before founding Popsockets, Mr. Burnett was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Colorado, Boulder, specializing in the philosophy of language. He developed an interesting entrepreneurship and began designing products to prevent earbud cords from dangling. </p><p>In the process of developing the specialized iPhone case, funded through a successful kick-starter campaign, Mr. Barnett stumbled upon the pop grip. It has gone on to become Popsockets' flagship product and one of the most popular mobile device attachments on the market.  </p><p>In 2015, Mr. Barnett left the University of Colorado to focus full-time on running Popsockets. Mr. Barnett received his BA in Philosophy from Emery University, his BA in Physics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and his PhD in Philosophy from New York University. </p><p>Our third witness is David Heinemeier Hansson. Mr. Hansson is the Chief Technology Officer and Cofounder of Basecamp, LLC, a project management and communications software used by hundreds of organizations, like Shopify, NASA and University of Miami. He is also the creator of Ruby on Rails, an open source web framework, used by programmers at GitHub, Airbnb, Kickstarter and Goodreads. </p><p>Mr. Hansson is also the author of multiple books about successful business management, including, It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work, and the New York Times, best seller, Rework. Mr. Hansson received his bachelor's degree from the Copenhagen Business School. </p><p>The last witness on our first panel is Kirsten Daru, Vice President and General Counsel at Tile. Prior to joining Tile, in 2019, Ms. Daru served as the Chief Privacy Officer at Electronic Arts, at Electronic Arts. There, she led all elements of EA's eternal data privacy compliance, employee data privacy training and litigation involving consumer claims. </p><p>She was also the lead attorney for all international privacy matters. She started her legal career, as an attorney at Reed Smith, LLP. Ms. Daru received her BA from the University of California, Davis and her J.D. from the University of San Francisco, School of Law. </p><p>We welcome all of our very distinguished witnesses and, really, thank you for participating in today's hearing. Now, if you would please rise, I will begin by swearing you in. </p><p>Please raise your right hand. Do you swear, or affirm under penalty of perjury, that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct, to the best of your knowledge, information and belief, so help you God? </p><p>UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>CICILLINE: Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated. Please know that each of your written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. Accordingly, I ask that you summarize your testimony in five minutes.  </p><p>To help you stay within that time, there's a timing light on your table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude. It's actually here. When the light turns red, it signals your five minutes have expired and we'd like you to conclude. </p><p>And we'll begin, Mr. Spence, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>SPENCE: That you. I'd like to thank Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and distinguished members of this committee, for the opportunity to appear here, today. </p><p>It is my privilege to lead a company that is a classic American success story. Sonos was founded in Santa Barbara, California, in 2002, by a handful of entrepreneurs that wanted to make it easier and better to be able to listen to great music, throughout your home. </p><p>Today, we employ over 1,500 people and our products have been welcomed into more than 9 million homes. </p><p>We are a classic innovation and growth starting. We've grown our customer base, our product portfolio and our revenue, every year, since our founding, almost 20 years ago. </p><p>In mid-2018, we enjoyed another right of passage of many American success stories; we became a public company on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The scope and scale of our innovation is reflected in our portfolio of over 750 patents, a number that continues to grow, every year, as we invest heavily in new innovation. </p><p>We believe that, if we keep working hard to make great new products, we'll win new customers and they'll come back and buy more products. </p><p>I welcome this committee's invitation to testify because I'm concerned that the market conditions that allowed us to innovate and thrive, over the past two decades, are being endangered by the rise of a small group of dominant companies with unprecedented power.  </p><p>We believe that this committee needs to act urgently to reign in the power of these dominant companies, in order to support the market conditions for the next big ideas to emerge and to create a fair playing field for new emerging innovative companies. </p><p>Today, I would like to focus in on three trends, in particular. The first trend is how these dominant companies are using their power in one market to conquer, or destroy adjacent markets, especially markets that may one day present a challenge to their current dominance. </p><p>Voice technology has transformed smart speakers into the latest gateway to the Internet. They connect you to the music you love and to many of the most important services on the Internet, from e-commerce to search. </p><p>For Google and Amazon, specifically, the development of the smart speaker development, the one in which we invented and operate, presents both a threat and an opportunity; the threat that, if other companies were to be successful in the smart speaker market, they might stand between these dominant companies and customers. </p><p>The opportunity for these companies is to dominate, yet another important consumer market and more critical, to use smart speakers to collect vast amounts of consumer data, which can be monetized on their already dominant platforms. </p><p>These dominant firms have seized this opportunity. They have flooded the market with dramatically priced subsidized products, giving them a way at steep discounts, or even for free. Indeed, there are records stating that the products, themselves, are money losers. Now, they control roughly 85 percent of the U.S. smart speaker market. </p><p>This is terrible for the innovative dynamic created by fair competition because it hamstrings those companies that have better products that cannot afford to be sold at a loss. And in the long-term, prices are sure to go up, once these dominant companies have driven the other companies out of the market and reduced competition. </p><p>The second issue is that these dominant companies are exploiting their role as essential business partners and to tilt the playing field in favor of their own products and services. These companies have such dominance and breadth, across a variety of markets, they become essential business partners for every company. Our relationships with them, at times, are productive and mutually beneficial, as these firms also value access to our large and growing customer base. </p><p>But these dominant companies have a huge amount of power. Gaining access to their platforms and integrating their services are becoming more and more of a take it or leave it proposition, with demands such as early and technically detailed access to our future products, sharing proprietary business data, including sales forecasts and waiving essential contracts will rights. </p><p>These companies have grown so far as demanding that we suppress our inventions, in order to work with them. The most recent example of this is Google's refusal to allow us to use multiple voice assistants on our products, simultaneously.  </p><p>And the third important issue is the practice of efficient infringement. These dominant companies disregard inventions and patents because they're so powerful and they are doing a cost benefit analysis of infringing now and paying later, once they've achieved dominance and moved past the point where they have to worry about competition in that market. </p><p>They are exploiting today's system and enforcement to extend their dominance from one market to the next and a recently filed patent infringement case against Google, illustrates our point. We have provided more details in our written testimony. </p><p>We believe in competition and have competed and won through innovation and hard work against much larger companies to get to where we are, today. However, we are in a moment now, and I say this with 20 years in the consumer technology industry, where today's dominant companies have so much power across such a broad array of markets and continue to leverage that power to expand into new markets, that we need to rethink existing laws and policies to determine if they are still achieving the spirit, in which they were set out. </p><p>We believe that independent companies in a system which fosters new startups have never been more important to the future of innovation because fair competition breeds creativity and progress and makes America better for everyone, not just dominant and powerful few. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Spence. Mr. Barnett, you are now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>BARNETT: Sure. First, thank you, Honorable Chairman and the other members of the committee for having me. You ready? </p><p>So, I'll tell you, first, the story of Popsockets and then, some challenges that we've had with Amazon. </p><p>Popsockets started about six years ago in my garage, just west of where we're sitting, right here, when I was a philosophy professor at the University of Colorado. </p><p>I launched the business around our flagship product, which is a, well, I had it on my phone but a grip and a stand for phones. So, that's how it started. We now have a full family of products around this product. </p><p>In these six years, we've grown to about 270 employees. There's thousands of people, around the world, whose livelihoods depend now on Popsockets, indirectly, through different businesses.  </p><p>We've sold over 165 million units of this product. And I feel lucky to have realized one version of the American dream, in part, by participating in America's free market economy and being able to transact with millions of Americans and thousands of companies, in order to create this   success. </p><p>So, today, I want to talk about two challenges that we've had with Amazon, one involving counterfeits, the other involving bullying, or strong-arming. </p><p>So, we started our direct relationship with Amazon about a year and a half into business. So, the middle of 2016, we started selling products to Amazon. Amazon, in turn, would sell our products on the market place. It was immensely successful. Within five months, Amazon became our largest customer and we became one of Amazon's most significant players in the mobile electronics accessory category. </p><p>We were, Popsockets was the number three search term, at some point, on Amazon. So, we had immense success. But despite the success, we never felt like we had a gentleman partnership with Amazon. So, the problem of counterfeits, is the first problem I'll talk about. We had enormous amounts of fake products that were taking our sales, creating bad customer experiences.  </p><p>And of course, it was illegal. So, illegal activity, on behalf of those selling them. And when Amazon was the seller, Amazon was clearly engaged in this illegal activity. And multiple times, we discovered that Amazon, itself, had sourced counterfeit product and was selling it, alongside our own product. </p><p>For a year and a half, we requested that Amazon take some action, some serious action and just require evidence from sellers that they were selling authentic product. After a year and a half, finally, in exchange for about $1.8 million of retail marketing funds, which my team deemed ineffective, Amazon agreed to work with their brand registry department to require this evidence. And things then changed, dramatically. </p><p>So, that problem, largely, went away. There was another problem of knockoffs, products not using the Popsockets name, that took a lot longer to go away. At one point, we were reporting 1,000 listings, a day, of fakes--every day, 1,000 different listing of fakes that were eating away at our revenue and really, harming our brand, too. </p><p>Next, I want to turn to bullying, the lack of a symmetrical partnership. The way Amazon works is, you know, we signed an agreement together. So, there's what's in the written record of the agreement. Everything looks good. We decide on a sale price to Amazon. Then, what happens, in fact, is that Amazon decides what price they want to sell it to the consumer for. And after they do this, often lowering the price, they come back to us and demand funding for their lost margin, when they lower their price. </p><p>There's nothing in our agreement that says we are required to pay for this. And yet, they say we need this, we expect this. The bullying begins. We decided to end our relationship with Amazon, over this. </p><p>This was one reason we cited, when we gave to Amazon, the response was, no, you're not leaving the relationship. I found that unbelievable that they would tell us that we were going to continue the relationship, after we told them that bullying was the main reason we were leaving. </p><p>We left, anyway. They proceeded to remove the listings of our authorized reseller, all of the listings on Amazon, preventing unauthorized resellers from selling. They refused to clarify the language, around their policy that they cited in doing this; caused great harm to our company. </p><p>And you know, while bullying is not technically illegal, when there's bullying by an extremely successful company, with all these partners that continue to do business with it, one has to ask, how is it that such a successful business maintains partnerships with so many companies, while bullying them? It's because of the power asymmetry, of course, that companies tolerate this. They have to tolerate it. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Barnett. Mr. Hansson, you're now recognized, for five minutes, for your opening. </p><p>HANSSON: Thank you and thank you for the invitation to provide testimony, here. </p><p>My name is David Heinemeier Hansson and I'm the CTO and cofounder of Basecamp, a small Internet company from Chicago that sells project management and team collaboration software. </p><p>When we launched our main service, back in 2004, the Internet provided a largely free, fair and open marketplace. We could reach customers and provide them with our software, without having to ask any technology company for permission, or pay them for the privilege. </p><p>Today, this is practically, no longer true. The Internet has been colonized by a handful of big tech companies that wield their monopoly power, without restraint. This power allows them to bully, extort, or should they please, even destroy our business, unless we accept their often onerous, exploitative and ever-changing terms and conditions. </p><p>These big tech companies control the customers, who are able to find us online where the customers can access our software, using their mobile devices and define the questionable ethics of what a competitive marketing campaign must look like. </p><p>A small company like ours simply has no real agency to resist, or reject, the rules set by big tech and added to consumers the promise that the Internet was going to cut out the middleman has been broken. </p><p>We are all left to accept that these companies can and do alter the deal, any deal, however they please. And whenever they do, our only recourse is to pray that they do not alter it any further. </p><p>Let's start with Google. Their monopoly in Internet search is near-total and their multibillion-dollar bribes to browser makers like Apple, ensure no fair competition will ever have a chance to emerge. Google uses this monopoly to extort businesses like ours to pay for the privilege that consumers who search for our trademarked brand name can find us because if we don't, they will sell our brand name, as misdirection to our competitors. </p><p>Google feigns interest in recognizing trademark law by banning the use of trademark terms in app copy, but puts the ownership enforcement on victims and does nothing to stop repeat offenders. Unless, of course, the trademark terms are belonging to Google, itself. Then, enforcement is swift and automatic. You will find no competitor apps for any of Google's own important properties. </p><p>Google would never have been able to capture a monopoly in search by acting like this, from the start, misdirecting consumers, blanketing search results with ads and shaking down small businesses. In the absence of meaningful regulation, they will continue to extract absurd monopoly rents, while driving browser makers to ensure nothing changes. </p><p>Apple, too, enjoys the sports of monopoly pricing power. With the app store, they own one of the only two mobile application stores that matter. The other belongs to Google. This cozy duopoly has allowed Apple to keep fees on payment processing for application makers like ours, exorbitantly high, where as a competitive market like that for credit card processing is only able to sustain, around a 2 percent be from merchants, Apple, along with Google, has been able to charge an outrageous 30 percent, for years on end. </p><p>Apple may claim that they do more than payment processing for this fee, such as hosting applications, or providing discovery but the company undercuts this argument by giving the services away for free to application makers who do not charge for their applications. </p><p>But worse still, is the draconian restrictions and merciless retribution that Apple brings to bear on application makers who dare to decline using Apple's payment services. Even a mere link to an external webpage that explains how to sign up for service that doesn't use Apple's payment system, can get your application rejected, or removed from the app store. </p><p>Every application maker using Apple's app store lives in fear that their next update is denied, or their application is entirely removed. All it takes is being assigned to the wrong review clerk who chooses to interpret the often vague and confusing rules different than the last. Then, you'll be stuck in an appeals process that would make Kupka (SP) blush. </p><p>Finally, Facebook's industrial scale back of everyone's personal data has created an app targeting machine so devastatingly effective that the company, together with, guess who--Google--is currently capturing, virtually, all growth in Internet advertisement. </p><p>I quote a report in my written testimony that put that capture between Facebook and Google at 99 percent, in 2016. Not even Putin would dare brag of an approval rating that high. </p><p>Facebook is able to maintain this iron grip on the collection of personal data by continuing to buy any promising competitor. The acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp should never have been approved by regulators and need to be urgently undone. This creates a marketplace for companies that wish not to partake of the wholesale violation of consumer privacy is at a great disadvantage. If you choose not to take advantage of this terrifying and devastatingly effective app machine, your competitor surely will. </p><p>This has been but a brief taste of what it's like to live as a small tech company in a digital world owned and operated by big tech. And I didn't even touch on the misery that is to attempt direct head on competition with any of these conglomerates. But at some point, all companies will be competing against big tech, simply because big tech is bent on expanding, until it does absolutely everything. </p><p>The aforementioned companies already do payment processing, credit card issuing, music distribution, TV producing, advertising networks, mapmaking, (INAUDIBLE) services, alarm systems, cameras, computers, medical devices and about a billion other things. </p><p>Help us, Congress. You are our only hope. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, very much. I think you very much. Now, I recognize Ms. Dura, for five minutes for your opening statement. </p><p>DARU: I would like to thank Chairman Cicilline, and the members of the subcommittee for convening this hearing and to Vice Chair Neguse, for hosting. </p><p>My name is Kirsten Daru and I'm the Chief Privacy Officer and General Counsel of Tile. Tile helps people find lost items. Our devices work with our Tile app, which is available on iOS and android to help people their wallet, purse, keys, you name it. We also embed our technology into third-party products like headphones and laptops. </p><p>Tile is a small company. We only have about 100 employees. But we have over 180 patent assets and much of our success can be attributed to our ability to collaborate with a wide, diverse group of tech partners. That includes Hewlett-Packard, Google, Amazon and importantly, Apple, who we've partnered with, since about 2013. </p><p>But last April, things began to change. Last April, reports came out that Apple was developing a competing Tile like device. And shortly thereafter, they told us that they weren't going to carry us in their retail stores, anymore. </p><p>But don't get me wrong, Tile welcomes competition. But it has to be fair competition. And in the weeks and months that followed those initial reports, Apple exploited its market power to advance its own interests, at our expense. And I'll explain. </p><p>So, first, Apple's FindMy app competes with Tile. Importantly, FindMy is installed, natively, on Apple hardware, to the exclusion of all competing apps and it cannot be deleted. Not so with Tile. </p><p>Also, with iOS 13, which released last September, Apple made it more difficult for our customers to enable their Tile devices, by burying the required permissions deep within the consumer setting. But not so for FindMy. FindMy's location settings are activated by a single selection, during operating system installation. </p><p>And then, once our customers figure out how to enable our devices, also is iOS 13, Apple started surfacing these reminders and prompts to our customers to encourage them to turn it off. But Apple does not serve any reminders for its customers to turn off FindMy location permissions. </p><p>Also, in its latest iPhones, Apple included a new, nonproprietary technology. It's kind of like Wildfire Bluetooth. It's called UWB, Ultra-Wide Band. Again, it's nonproprietary. It's one of those things that you most, that would ordinarily be opened up to all third parties to use. But it is similar to Bluetooth, but whereas Bluetooth can tell you that an item is in a room, UWB can tell you, exactly where it is in that room. </p><p>Reports surfaced that Apple's competing Tile hardware product use UWB to enhance the experience of its customers but again, by contrast, Apple's not enabling Tile to use that technology for the benefit of its customers. </p><p>All of these examples demonstrate that Apple is acting as a gatekeeper of third-party access to permissions and technology, in ways that favors its own interests. Keep in mind that Apple owns the entire commercial iOS ecosystem. They own the hardware. They on the software. They own the app store and the retail stores. That gives Apple access to competitively sensitive information, including who our customers are, our retail margins, our subscription take rates. </p><p>And Apple's control over the ecosystem enables it to make changes to the OS, with no meaningful advance consultation, or notice to competitors, to enable us to evaluate, or prepare for impact. </p><p>It's like playing a soccer game. You might be the best team in the league. You are playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league. And they can change the rules of the game in their own favor, at any time. That's the field, on which we are competing with Apple. That's the field on which America is competing with Apple. </p><p>And it doesn't leave much incentive for entrepreneurs, or investors, to bring new innovations to bear in America. </p><p>The functioning of a robust, healthy app ecosystem is dependent on open platforms that do not favor the owner. It's our hope and preference to work with Apple to resolve our concerns. But in the meantime, we ask Congress to continue to explore how Apple's exploitation of its market power to advance its own interests is used to hinder competition and limit customer choice. </p><p>I'd like to, again, thank you for your time and I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you very much, Ms. Dura. We'll now begin questioning, under the five-minute rule. I'm going to recognize, first, for five minutes. And I am just letting my colleagues know, I'm going to devote five minutes to each of the panelists, so we'll have multiple rounds. </p><p>You're free, obviously, to do it any way you like. But I think these require kind of more in-depth discussion. So, I'll begin with you, Mr. Spence. Thank you for your testimony. </p><p>In your written testimony, you describe how Google and Amazon have essential business partners. As you know, their dominance across markets, from voice assistants and operating systems, to music services and cloud computing, means that, and I'm quoting you, \"They like basic infrastructure.\" End quote. </p><p>You note that this dominance enables the platforms to issue take it or leave it demands. Can you describe what some of those demands involve and what they been? </p><p>SPENCE: Thanks for the question, Mr. Chairman. It's around things like our future products. So, understanding what products we are going to be making in the future, if we want access to their services. </p><p>So, they'll look for that, which is really, at the end of the day, the most important thing inside a company like ours is trying to keep confidential the products and the new innovations that we're working on. So, getting access to those, getting access to the kind of volumes that we think we'll do. </p><p>As we go through that, try to understand, as well, just the general direction of where the company is going, making sure that we are willing to engage in marketing funding for the products, as well, on the platform would be another example, as we go through that. </p><p>So, yeah, that's probably kind of a good feel for the kind of things. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. In a set of questions that I sent to Google, as part of this investigation, last year, I asked the company whether it ever requires that third parties, seeking to access Google's services, give Google access to their proprietary data. </p><p>Google responded that it is likely entered into those types of contracts but that any such contractual terms are, and I quote, \"The product of good faith negotiations by sophisticated parties.\" End quote. </p><p>Does that sound accurate to you? Is it the case, as Google suggests, that these contractual terms are just the product of regular business dealings? </p><p>SPENCE: Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. I've been in consumer technology for 20 years. I think there are times where you're having negotiations with companies and it's on a bear basis, in terms of where you are. </p><p>I think, as I've indicated, there's such a dominant power that exists, with these companies, that when Google, or companies like that, are asking for these things, you really, even for a company of our size, feel that you have no choice but to provide them to the companies. </p><p>CICILLINE: One remarkable thing about these companies is how integrated they are, across many different business lines. Sonos may be negotiating with Amazon, or Google, over their voices systems services, while also being dependent on Amazon's retail platform, or Google search. Is there a reason to think these platforms do, at the very least, or they could, use their dominance in one market to apply pressure in a distinct market? </p><p>SPENCE: Absolutely. I think that is the, you know, the risk that is here. And I think it's very fair assumption to think that they would, even with best efforts, right, and in terms of that, is that information inside companies, the larger and larger they get, it's easy in this day and age for that information to go in many different directions. </p><p>And so, as we provide information to these companies, it's certainly my concern that it can be shared, across groups and it can be used to, in effect, compete with us, down the line. </p><p>CICILLINE: So, as an example, could Google demote you in search rankings, if it didn't like how negotiations over voice assistants were going? And how would something like that affect your business? </p><p>SPENCE: That would be something that would dramatically impact our business. As David had mentioned, we've had to buy our brand name on Google, just to make sure that we are at the top of the rankings in Google search. </p><p>But these companies have the power to be able to move you down the rankings, put tags on your products, do all sorts of things that would tilt the playing field. </p><p>CICILLINE: And Mr. Spence, in your testimony you explain that Google has sought to block an innovative service by Sonos that would have allowed consumers to utilize multiple voice assistants on a single Sonos speaker. Can you tell us more about Google's role in blocking this service and the effect of this decision on your product and on consumers and how is Google able to make that demand and who benefited from the outcome? </p><p>SPENCE: So, probably the best way to think about what it is that we want to do is like on your computer, today, you can choose to use one search engine. You could use Google, or you could use DuckDuckGo. We want to give customers the ability to access, either Amazon's Alexa service, or Google's Google assistant voice service on a Sonos speaker. </p><p>And we've developed the technology which enables that which is new, innovative and the best thing for customers because it's choice. And we'd be happy to put other voice assistants on there, as so customers so deem it. </p><p>We developed that. We had it ready. We showed it to Google and Amazon. To Amazon's credit, they said, okay, this makes sense. Amazon has led, recently, the voice interoperability initiative to try and, you know drive customer choice. </p><p>Google has said, if you are going to do that, Google assistant will not be available on the Sonos platform. So, you will not have access to Google assistant, if that is what you, if that's the way you want to run this. </p><p>And so, they haven't allowed us and we can't offer that, today, which is, in my opinion, really reducing freedom of choice for customers. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you very much. I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Buck, for five minutes. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I wanted to mention something that I didn't mention in my opening statement. And that is, I think there is a great bipartisanship in examination of this. And hearing each of the individuals testify, today, I think it is clear that there is abuse in the marketplace and there is a need for action. </p><p>The question I have for each of you, really, is, I hear the problem. I don't hear the solution. And I am a small government person. And I am concerned about the government interfering in the marketplace because it may, ultimately, interfere with your ability to produce the products in the free marketplace that you want to produce them. </p><p>I first want to say, Mr. Hansson, thank you for addressing the way you did. That's the way I'd like to dress. I don't want to wear a tie, either, and you, sort of, have the image of a tech person, a tech executive in my mind. So, when I grow up, I want to be just like you.   </p><p>HANSSON: I'm happy to play the part. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Mr. Spence, I heard you talk about Google and how they created a competitive product. Would you advocate that the government, or regulators, in some way, prevent a Google from creating a competitive product? </p><p>We competed, we've competed, you know, in the market against many great companies, Bose, Sony, you know, many, many companies. I think the difference in the case, here, is that these companies are leveraging their power in one market to, you know, go into new markets, where there's predatory pricing.  </p><p>And they're doing it to uphold their dominance in other markets. And so, I don't know what the answer is, in that particular case, but they're doing that and they're infringing the intellectual property invention of a smaller company, like ours, in those cases. </p><p>And so, I think--I think we're in a unique position where--I'm with you in terms of small government--but I think the whole spirit of trying to encourage small companies, encourage new innovations and new startups is at risk, given how dominant these companies are. </p><p>I would argue that we have not seen anything like this before, in the level of dominance; at least in my 20 years of experience. And so, I think there may be some-- </p><p>BUCK: --Certainly seen it in other areas. We've certainly seen the Rockefellers and, certainly, seen dominance in steel and dominance in other products. </p><p>So, what I hear you saying, and I want to make sure that I hear it, correctly. You aren't opposed to large companies, Bose, Google, others, creating a competitive product. What you are opposed to is that competitive product, the pricing structure of that competitive product is something you believe is predatory, is--is, they are selling it below cost, or below, at least, market value because they want to knock the competitors out of the market and they're using they're platform to do that. </p><p>SPENCE: That is correct. </p><p>BUCK: And do the anti-trust laws now cover that? Are we looking at a situation where we need to adapt anti-trust laws to high tech, or are we looking at a situation where we need to give the federal government more resources to enforce the laws that exist? </p><p>SPENCE: I do not have the depth of understanding of anti-trust laws, necessarily. But I would say-- </p><p>BUCK: --Neither do I and I'm on the committee. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SPENCE: What I would say is, my understanding of the spirit that is such that it would address these kinds of behaviors. So, to me, I'm not sure if it's enforcement for the laws, but I would think that this level of power, with this few firms, we should have rules in place which allow--allow the Congress to act, or for their to be remedies that are put in place. And I don't, I just don't see it happening, today. </p><p>BUCK: So, I guess I'm still struggling. I want to figure out, do you have--is there a way for us to receive information about the predatory pricing? Obviously, we don't know how much it cost Google. They are such a large company. They may have some benefits, in terms of the size of the company and producing something that they can do more efficiently than a smaller company. I don't know. </p><p>But what evidence is there that they are selling something at a price that is below the cost, in order to be predatory? </p><p>SPENCE: There are some industry analysts that do this kind of work to understand the cost profile. We, obviously, understand the cost profile, given the industry we're in. So, in looking at that, we're quite confident there's been, you know, there's been executives that have made comments from these companies that say, you know, that they're doing it for other strategic purposes, really, to get their other services into peoples' home and lock those in. </p><p>So, that information is available. And I think, from, I would say, as well, unbiased third parties, right, because that's where I imagine you, probably, want to get it from and that is available. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you very much for your time. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Neguse for five minutes. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First and foremost, thank you for hosting this hearing, here in Colorado and in the 2nd congressional district, in particular, which is a hub, nationally, for ingenuity and technology innovation. </p><p>And so, it's a pleasure to be able to welcome you here. And of course, very grateful to my colleagues, Mr. Perlmutter and Mr. Buck for joining, as well. And want to give our regards to Mr. Sensenbrenner, the ranking member, who I understand had planned to attend but, unfortunately, could not, due to a storm in the Midwest. </p><p>This hearing couldn't be more important, couldn't be more timely. And so, I appreciate the witnesses, each of you, for coming forward today, and offering your testimony. </p><p>The presence of research institutions, like CU, Boulder, and Colorado State University, access to a healthy venture capitals community, home to startup incubators and the ability of local government to read the team leads, really has turned Colorado, in particular, into an entrepreneurial and a tech powerhouse, like no other. And so, it's no surprise that Boulder and Fort Collins rank in the top ten of America's most innovative tech hubs. And I'm proud to represent both of those cities. </p><p>And of course, would be remiss, if I didn't start off my remarks on that front. I also want to say thank you to the University of Colorado for hosting this field hearing. This is the second that we've been able to hold in the last year, here in the second congressional district. And I'm very grateful to everyone here at the University of Colorado and the law school, in particular, for their generosity and graciousness in hosting us. </p><p>I want to focus my questions on two topics. The first is data and targeted Internet advertising and I reviewed the written testimony of each of the witnesses. And Mr. Hansson, in particular, I found your written testimony very compelling. There's a line, I don't believe you said it, during your oral testimony, but I will read it here, where you say, quote, \"Facebook's targeting capability is crushingly effectively--crushingly effective and therefore, truly terrifying.\" </p><p>And I found that to be a very compelling sentence. Targeted ads really are one of society's most destructive trends. They have led to an explosion of fake news and misinformation and it requires us to question, whether it's possible to have free and fair elections on social media platforms, like Facebook, not only allow, but encourage the mass propagation of misleading information and then, supply the tools to micro target that information to its users. </p><p>So, I wonder if you can provide some more detail on your company's experience with Facebook and the use of targeted advertising tools? I understand that you are a Facebook free company. I think it's the way that it's, the moniker that's, is that you don't use that Facebook advertising, anymore.  </p><p>That was a conscious choice that your company made. So, maybe you could expound a little bit about how you got there. </p><p>HANSSON: Absolutely, thank you Congressman. In 2017, we ran a series of marketing campaign tests on different platforms. We ran some on Facebook; we ran some on Google. We ran other platforms. </p><p>It was very clear, in all of those tests, that Facebook was, by far and away, the most effective way to market because of the immense amount of personal data that they have. So, we could target our ads to just an astonishing degree. </p><p>And no other advertising platform was able to compete. And this is why Google, who also has the same sort of capabilities of targeting and Facebook is able to capture 99 percent of all growth in Internet advertisement. And that's what's stated in that report from 2016. </p><p>Because they simply have a devastatingly effective machine. But when you think about why that machine is so effective, what is it that underpins it, how is it that they are able to outcompete everyone else. It is all based on a fundamental violation of privacy for people that they've been able to capture so many data points, through so many sources, that people are neither aware of is happening, or would consent to if they knew. </p><p>All these data sources, things like purchasing records, the fact that both Facebook and Google can track you, everything you do on the Internet, pretty much, because they have their little like buttons and they have their Google sign-ins on so many sites. The fact that Google controls things through search and Facebook controls the main avenue that people get news, through the newsfeed. </p><p>They just have so much data. No one can compete against that trove of data. And in fact, it shouldn't have been allowed to gather that data, in the first place. If they didn't have all that data, if there had been regulations in place to prevent them from gathering all this data, then they wouldn't have been able to capture 99 percent of the growth. </p><p>So, I think that this is where we need to start with the original sin, that they are able and allowed to capture this data, without consent, without informing consumers and, therefore, they are as effective as they are. </p><p>NEGUSE: How has it impacted your business becoming a Facebook free? </p><p>HANSSON: Yes, so this is the other part of it. If you look at that system and say, I want no part of it, I do not want to be part of a violation of privacy on this mass scale. And you opt out, as we've chosen to do, you've essentially cut yourself off from the main effective way of reaching people online that other companies will use. </p><p>So, our competitors, who have no qualms about using this machine, they will outcompete us, when it comes to ads. They can buy cheaper ads that reach more people and is more effective in its conversion and we are, thus, at a great disadvantage in the competitive marketplace, when we choose not to do so. </p><p>So, this is why the pressure is so high. It's like a person whose dilemma. If the other company chooses to do it, you are pretty much forced to do it, too, even if you don't want to. </p><p>CICILLINE: The chair now recognizes the other gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Perlmutter, for five minutes. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: Thank you, Mr. Chair and thanks to the University and panelists. Thank you for your testimony, and quite frankly, your courage to be here, today, because when you take on, you know, dominant players, you know, whether it's Amazon, Google, Apple, or Facebook, you know, you've got to have a little trepidation. I think somebody used that term in their testimony. </p><p>But I can tell you, our family is a customer of pretty much everything that you all are selling, although, my daughter is the one that uses Shopify, that has the backstop in your software. </p><p>So, I just want to thank you for the products that you sell and that you've designed and innovated. </p><p>The thing that I really am bothered with, and I'll start with you, Professor, is the bullying piece. And I think Mr. Hansson, you used extort. And Ms. Daru, you didn't use it but the word squeeze came to mind, in what's happening to Tile. </p><p>So, how in the world can Google or, I think it was Google who was problematic for you, Mr. Barnett. </p><p>UNKNOWN: It was Amazon. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: Pardon me, Amazon, ignore the contract that you entered into and just say, sorry, you know, that was our contract but you've got to lower your price. </p><p>BARNETT: With coercive tactics, basically. And these are tactics that are mainly executed by phone. It's one of the strangest relationships I've ever had with a retailer, as with Amazon. But most of our discussions are by phone. They feel very scripted. They don't feel authentic. By the way, I hear the same--what I describe--I hear from lots of other manufacturers brands, who deal with Amazon. </p><p>So, what's on record is agreement that appears to be negotiated in good faith, the terms of the agreement. It's all there. And then, what happens in practice, is that there are frequent phone calls. </p><p>And on the phone calls, we get, I don't know, what I might call bullying with a smile. Very friendly people that we deal with who say, hey, by the way, we dropped the price X product, last week. We need you to pay for it. </p><p>And I think to myself, well, that's odd. It's not in our agreement that we're going to pay for it. So, why do you need us to. And we expect you to pay for. </p><p>So, there's some pushback. And I say, well, it's not in our agreement. Why would you expect that? That's strange. It's not in the agreement. The response is, well, if we don't yet it-and then the threats come. </p><p>If we don't get it, we're going to source product from the gray market. So, one of your resellers, who's not-- </p><p>PERLMUTTER: --Did they say that to you? </p><p>BARNETT: Yeah, sure. Their response is, if you don't, on the phone, sure. Response is, if you don't fund this, what we're going to need to do is, we're going to need to give more competitive pricing, and we're going to go one of your resellers, who's not authorized to sell to us. And we're going to start sourcing it. And we'll find it. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: So, then your only recourse was to terminate the contract? </p><p>BARNETT: Well, that's one of the things they say. Another threat might be, you know, we've got too much inventory on our hands. So, we're going to ship it all back to you. You're going to pay for all the fees. There's an expense to shipping this back to you. So, we're going to end up charging you all of those dollars. So, really, we need the money. Let's have it. </p><p>And also, you know, maybe we need to end the partnership, is another threat. And if we end the partnership, that puts us in a pretty tough position, given Amazon's dominance in the online marketplace. So, this is tiring. I mean, it's tiring, week after week, saying no, no, no, being subjected to this sort of bullying. </p><p>And we eventually, yes, decided to end our partnership. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: Let me turn to Mr. Hansson and Ms. Daru So, in connection with your company's, you provide all sorts of information to Apple, to Google, to whatever, and then, what do they--how do they use that information against you? I mean, don't they have a conflict of interest of some kind? </p><p>DARU: Thank you for your question. I would think so. And I want to be clear that it's not that we are giving access, necessarily, to Apple. But by virtue of Apple's ownership of the entire iOS ecosystem, they get access to a lot of competitively sensitive information, like, who our customers are, what other kinds of apps they use, the demographics of people who might be looking for Tile like apps in ways that we can't. </p><p>They have access to our retail margins they share and our profits. They know who's picking up our subscription. And unfortunately, it's really difficult for us to know, exactly, how they're using it. But they certainly have access to it. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: I think my time is about to expire so, I'll yield back to the chair. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentleman. I'd like, now, to turn to you, Mr. Barnett. During the subcommittee's hearing, again, in the course of this investigation in July, Amazon's associate general counsel, Nate Sutton, denied that Amazon wields market power in online retail, testifying that the retail industry is full of competitors to Amazon, including companies like Walmart, eBay, Target, Safeway, Wayfair and Krueger, as well as Ali Baba and Rakuten. </p><p>Mr. Sutton also claimed that sellers have numerous options, when considering where to sell their products. And so, my question for you is, for businesses like Popsockets, could the company's Amazon listed serve as reasonable alternatives to selling on Amazon? </p><p>BARNETT: Sure. I can give you some actual numbers. We sell on the Walmart platform. Our sales on the Walmart platform are about 1/38 of the sales that we had on Amazon, back when we had this relationship with Amazon; 1/38. </p><p>So, and Target, it's even less. So, I don't know what it is but-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --So, those aren't reasonable alternatives? </p><p>BARNETT: These are small fractions. If you back up, what they are saying, you know, in saying is, in a way, true, it's just irrelevant. If you back up and look at this, I think it's easiest to look at it, as if it's a different country that we're looking at and ask this question. Suppose you discover, of some country, say it's Costa Rica, and you discover that they have this marketplace, there are lots of marketplaces. But most of them are really tiny. They have one big marketplace where almost everybody goes to trade. And they trade goods and people want to exchange goods. </p><p>And then, you learn it's privately run. And then you learn that the company, or person running this marketplace dictates the terms of the transactions, dictates ultimately, directly or indirectly, the prices in these transactions, which indirectly, dictates how much money companies have, for individuals for innovation, for research. </p><p>There's a private company running this marketplace. That would be pretty alarming and that might be an instance where you say, government should probably get involved here. </p><p>CICILLINE: In his 2019 annual letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos wrote that third-party sales on Amazon are soaring, thanks to the services that Amazon provides to merchants. And he wrote, and I quote, \"We helped independent sellers compete against our first party business, by investing in and offering them the very best-selling tools we could imagine and build.\" </p><p>Mr. Sutton, at the hearing said, and I quote, \"We know sellers have other ways to reach customers. So, we invest in them, support them and make continuous efforts to improve their experience, including spending significant resources to root out bad actors and prevent fraudulent abuse that harms, both sellers and customers. End quote. </p><p>Given your experience, do you agree with Amazon's statement, suggesting that it seeks to act in the best interest of independent sellers? </p><p>BARNETT: I disagree with that. Jeff Bezos, I think, when he makes this statement, I'm not sure that he can genuinely, you know, believe his statement. </p><p>So, in our own case, we're not allowed to sell on that marketplace. Popsockets has been banned from selling in that marketplace because Amazon retail has chosen to have this transaction with us and many other companies. </p><p>That's the language they use, that we are one of the chosen ones to be coerced, basically, into a certain relationship. And then, as far as helping these small sellers, you can do your own survey and see what they say. I doubt if any of them will be willing to come testify because their livelihood depends on it. </p><p>And they will tell you about retaliatory practices. So, they/'re used to it. </p><p>CICILLINE: And thank you again, for your courage in being here. In your written testimony, you describe your relationship with Amazon as one where they, and I quote, \"regularly dress up requests as demands, using language that a parent uses with a child when more generally, it's someone in a position of power uses with someone of inferior power.\" </p><p>Is it your experience that Amazon acts, as though it, basically, is able to dictate the terms of your dealings? What does this look like and why do you think Amazon is able to get away with taking this approach in its dealing with sellers? </p><p>BARNETT: The answer is yes. So, throughout the relationship, strangely, it's by phone, this all happens. But that is the language. It's a language of one party being in power, over another party that's powerless. </p><p>We need this, we expect this, even though it's not in our written agreement. I think, in my experience, the greatest event that highlighted this attitude at Amazon, was when we said, hey, we said it very nicely, too. We said, we are unhappy with a few things. We are going to experiment with another model. There's an asymmetry in the relationship. You know, we didn't call them bullies, or anything. It was very friendly. </p><p>Their response was, no, you're not going to do that. You're not going to leave us. That was the actual response. </p><p>CICILLINE: I want to just get in one more question. You stated that you feel Amazon has retaliated against Popsockets for speaking out on Amazon's policies. Can you tell us more about this situation and what kind of retaliation you experienced, after terminating the relationship with Amazon retail? Did Popsockets experience any challenges with Amazon representatives? And do you think your experience has been unique? I mean, I think this is really important for us to understand. </p><p>BARNETT: Sure. So, we needed to interact with various departments at Amazon, after we ended our relationship with them, our direct relationship of selling to this retail team. And my team reported to me that they were just getting stonewalled with each department, the example I gave in my testimony was trying to get hundreds of thousands of dollars that Amazon owed us for incorrect chargebacks. </p><p>They just refused to communicate with us, any more. So, communication just stop, department after department, and oddly, we were given the same reason. </p><p>So, we got one, and only one sentence back by all of them. It said, researching issues in partnership. And then, nothing. They wouldn't respond. </p><p>So, we had that experience. And I'm losing my thought on the second experience we had. It's not coming to me. </p><p>CICILLINE: Okay, we're out, some time. Right now, I now recognize Mr. Buck, for five minutes. </p><p>BARNETT: Sure. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Barnett, you said you had a PhD in philosophy? </p><p>BARNETT: Yes. </p><p>BUCK: I took a philosophy class, once. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I didn't do so well, so I went into political science. But I think you're really smart. And I always wanted to be smart. And you invented something and I, it's what I love about innovation and, I mean, I always wanted to invent the pet rock. Do you remember that? </p><p>UNKNOWN: That'd be great. </p><p>BUCK: A lot of the folks up here are too young to remember pet rocks but they served absolutely no purpose but people bought them like crazy. And it had all, everything to do with marketing, and nothing to do with function. And I always thought that was amazing. </p><p>But where do you go, if you don't go to Amazon? So, you go to newspapers. Less and less people read newspapers. You go to billboards. You go to, but where do you go? It seems like Amazon is so dominant, that there is no alternative to Amazon. </p><p>BARNETT: Sure. I think, I think Amazon will rightly respond to you by saying, there are plenty alternatives. In the Costa Rica hypothetical example I gave, there are plenty of alternatives. They're just tiny, right. And some companies can afford to live outside the large marketplace, the hypothetical one in Costa Rica that I described and still survive on these tiny, you know, much smaller opportunities, a string of them. </p><p>And that's what Amazon will respond. We are one of those companies who has survived the turbulence with Amazon. So, we pulled out. We're still alive. We've lost quite a bit of money. So, just last year-- </p><p>BUCK: -- I want to get into a little philosophy with you here. </p><p>BARNETT: Sure. </p><p>BUCK: What made America great? And I'm not getting into make America great. I'm just, what made America great? In my mind, it's the ability for you to compete fairly with somebody else who has another product. And then, you create the next innovation. And that's how you compete. </p><p>You don't compete with somebody, or you can't innovate if they are, in a business world, and I know there are people in this world that don't like the word profit, but you can't compete, unless you're making a profit. </p><p>BARNETT: That's exactly right. </p><p>BUCK: And then, if there is a company, if there is a country that stifles your ability to make a profit, we will see less and less innovation in this country. And as we see less, and this is getting really philosophical, as we see less and less innovation in this country, we will not be a dominant player in the world because we don't manufacture at a lower cost. We innovate at a higher rate. Agree? </p><p>BARNETT: I fully agree and that's why I, if you ask me whether I like small government, or big government, I'll tell you I like exactly the right size government. </p><p>So, I want to know what can government do, in each instance. And if government can take action that will help protect innovation, without doing a greater harm, government should do that. </p><p>BUCK: Okay, so, let me ask a question. </p><p>BARNETT: There is a harm here. I researched it, we have $10 million less to innovate, this year. With $10 million, we could double our innovation team. We have 30 people innovating all sorts of products. We could have 60 people. We could double the source of innovative products. </p><p>BUCK: Let me ask you a question. We have time on this. I just want to get to this one point. What is the size of your lobbying budget? </p><p>BARNETT: Zero. </p><p>BUCK: Mr. Spence. </p><p>SPENCE: Zero. </p><p>BUCK: Mr. Hansson. </p><p>HANSSON: Zero. </p><p>BUCK: Ms. Dura. </p><p>DURA: Nothing budgeted. </p><p>BUCK: So, what's the size of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple? </p><p>You may not know. And you don't have to answer because you are under oath. So, let me just tell you something. </p><p>Part of what we're dealing with here, is the reality that they walk into our offices and they tell us their side of the story. And we very rarely hear the other side of the story. And somehow, part of this solution has to be that public policymakers, elected, appointed, have to have access to that kind of information. </p><p>So, I thank you for being here. And I also would encourage you to make sure that, you know, we are accessible. We are trying our best to make sure that we continue to create the environment for your kinds of companies. So, thank you. And I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentleman. And I would-- think the gentlemen's comments are really important ones. And that's the reason, or at least one of the reasons this investigation was launched because we really wanted to understand the marketplace. And that's why the testimony from these four witnesses, which I'm afraid, represent just a small number of examples of what we know is a very pervasive and large problem. </p><p>So, there again, grateful for you being here. And with that, I recognize Mr. Neguse, for five minutes. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I couldn't agree more. And I think my good friend, Mr. Buck, makes a very salient point. And it's the impetus for why we're here today, to be able to hear directly from you all. </p><p>I've been trying, the second point, the second, sort of, piece of this that I wanted to discuss was some of the issues Mr. Hansson and Ms. Daru, that you all alluded to, with respect to Apple. </p><p>In trying to come up with the right analogy for the fundamental issue that is bedeviling us here, which is the distinction of being both, a marketplace operator and a seller of one's products. </p><p>Neither of your respective companies are marketplace operators. But you do sell products. And you do a good job at that. </p><p>If one thinks of the traditional way in which we purchase a product in the marketplace, to walk into a Target, today, or a Walgreens, or a Walmart, and look for a flashlight. You may find any number of different companies that have created different versions of a flashlight, right. </p><p>And they all, there is a profit motive there. And they are able to sustain their businesses by innovating and improving upon the products that they created. There is no fear that the store, the place in which they are purchasing this product, is going to take the information that comes with this product, create their own version of it and, essentially, operate it to the point that it blocks out any other product in that--in that category, right. </p><p>And of course, that's not the case with Apple, and some of these digital behemoths because the app store, and the flashlight is actually a great example, right, because you, prior to Apple creating the flashlight function on the phone, there were, my understanding, and any number of apps that were quite successful in providing that service. </p><p>And of course, once Apple has decided to, essentially, do the same, it renders all of those apps superfluous and unnecessary. And I think, Ms. Daru, part of what made your testimony so compelling, and your written testimony, in particular, is the information that you are providing, as a company, to Apple that, in turn, can be leveraged, eventually, to extinguish your invention. </p><p>And I guess I'm curious, if you can kind of expound greater detail about the type of information that you have to provide to Apple, in order to ensure that your app is accepted into the app store. Because I don't know that the average consumer understands that level of detail. I think most folks assume that, when you go into the app store, that it is a fairly basic transaction between Apple and a company like yours, where you are, essentially, placed into their marketplace. And that doesn't strike me that that's the case. </p><p>DARU: Thank you for your question. And you know, Tile doesn't provide data, you know, per se, to Apple. But again, by virtue of their ownership of the entirety of the iOS commercial ecosystem, they necessarily have access to that type of information. </p><p>So, like, who our customers are, what our retail margins are, our subscription take rates. They are able to, they have wholesale access to that information. And on top of that, you know, we're seeing other actions by Apple, again, to further its own interest and put companies like Tile at a disadvantage. </p><p>They put their computing app out front and center, in front of their consumers. Tile is in the app store with all the other third parties. There's is installed, natively, on the iPhones. </p><p>They can, they basically make rules about how the platform should operate, who and under what circumstances, who should have access to permissions. And then, they exempt themselves from all those rules. </p><p>You know, they give themselves access to technology, like UWB, but they deny access to companies who, legitimately, could use it to innovate for their own customers. </p><p>You know, they make changes to the operating system in ways that drain our engineering resources and make it difficult for us to innovate. </p><p>And so, for all of those reasons, the, you know, it's clear that Apple is exploiting its market power and dominance to be at an advantage in the marketplace. </p><p>NEGUSE: Mr. Hansson. </p><p>HANSSON: I think I see the even more important point is the economic point. To sell software on the app store, you have to agree that Apple takes 30 percent. What businesses just have an extra 30 percent margin to compete against someone who will charge themselves zero percent margin? </p><p>If Apple has a service, a competing service in the app store, they have a 30 percent market advantage, right from the get-go. That's on top of all the other advantages they have, in terms of information, setting the rules, and so forth, just on prices alone. </p><p>It's completely outrageous that they can charge 30 percent. But that rate has stayed constant in the 10 your years the app store has existed. Meanwhile, we get-- </p><p>NEGUSE: --And that rate is standard, that it's at 30 percent, across the board. </p><p>HANSSON: That rate is standard and you don't get to negotiate, you don't get to--so, they make some tiny concessions around long-term subscriptions, recently. But they're inconsequential. </p><p>On the same hand, we have a credit card d processing system that we use on the open Internet where we, every week, get compensations with processors who want our business. And they're all competing. And they're--we can do it 10 basis points cheaper than the other guy. </p><p>And the rates are 1.8 percent, or 2 percent. That's what a competitive market looks like. An uncompetitive market is what it looks like on the Apple store, 30 percent, 10 years going. No matter how much revenue that Apple is processing through the app stores, they face no competition and they have such an unfair advantage. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Perlmutter, for five minutes. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: And I think all of us are up here on this panel listening to Mr. Buck and Mr. Cicilline and Mr. Neguse, we're all on the same page. </p><p>And so, I want to start with you, Mr. Spence. In your testimony, you say, \"Dominant platforms are able to develop copy cat products by analyzing sells metrics on their platforms and combining them with rich data profiles of their customers. </p><p>These copy cat products are then, sold at cost, or lower, with no intent to reap a profit. They also can use remarkably similar trade dress and marketing campaigns.\" </p><p>Can you expand on that, a little bit? </p><p>SPENCE: Sure. So, we, you know, written testimony, as well, provided some examples of advertisements from some of these dominant platforms that look remarkably similar to ones that we had, you know, a year or two before that, even with the same dress, using some of the same iconography. All of it. </p><p>And they understand who has bought, you know, our products, other competitors' products. And they can address these people in a way that we can't and at an advantage that we can't. </p><p>And so, the advantages are like nothing we've ever seen before. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: So, talk to me about the rich data profiles. I mean, everybody's touched on that a little bit. Talk to me about that. </p><p>SPENCE: Well, thank about how dominant these companies are, across how many dimensions, at this point. </p><p>The mobile operating system, the cloud services, the search, the marketplace of e-commerce. The list goes on and on, in terms of the breadth of information that they have that they can share back and forth to, really, understand and draw a picture of almost, anything, right. </p><p>They see something that may be exploding on the cloud services, right. And they see applications, or things, or areas of interest there. They see something that might be of interest and really exploding like Popsockets on their e-commerce front end. </p><p>These are areas, just by nature, I think, of the companies now that we see that then there appears to be a trend, where those become markets that then they move into, right. </p><p>If there's any market that is getting traction and is of interest, you see these companies moving into those markets. It's almost like the fear of missing out, right. And I think it's a fear that, at the end of the day, this is a market that may threaten their dominance of the other markets. </p><p>And so, we're in this incredible cycle where every new market that you see pop up, you see these dominant firms begin to participate. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: Alright, last, and this sort of goes to my comment about, you know, everybody sitting there as, you guys, I just appreciate your testimony and willingness to come and share this. </p><p>So, you say in your testimony, Sonos is strong enough and successful enough to say what goes largely unsaid but remains very much on the minds of countless tech entrepreneurs. Can you elaborate a little bit about why, you know, you have 1500 employees and Ms. Daru's company has 100? I mean, why do you feel like you have a little bit of an advantage in that respect, to share today? </p><p>SPENCE: We are in a--we started early enough, you know, so almost 20 years ago. And we, when it was unfashionable, focused on profitable growth, not just growth at all costs, and we are in the fortunate position where, I think, we're strong enough, financially. I'm taking a risk here, no doubt. </p><p>We work closely with all of these dominant companies, right. So, I think I am taking a risk. But I feel that this is a big enough issue that people need to speak out. And I feel like it's important that these issues come to the forefront because we have a responsibility to speak for those that can't. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: And last thing. And I know we have somebody from the attorney general's office here in the audience, today, from the Office of Consumer Protection. But I had suggested to him that that consumer protection also be businesses, such as yours, when it comes to these dominant platforms, that it isn't just Mrs. McGillicuddy living down the street but it is, you know, Basecamp or Tile, or Sonos, or Popsockets. </p><p>And with that, I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentleman. I now recognize myself, for five minutes. Mr. Hansson, your written testimony states that Google has a monopoly in search. But in its response to questions I sent the company, last year, Google wrote that it faces, and I quote, \"robust competition from other sites on the Internet with intense competitive pressure on us to ensure users find what they are searching for.\" End quote. </p><p>What is your response to Google's statement that it faces intense competition in search? </p><p>HANSON: I think that statement relies on the fact of expanding the market so broad and so wide that everything is competition. It's like, when Facebook said that they face intense competition from things like sleep, right. There's, we have a limited amount of intention in the day, if we could make people sleep two hours less. That's two hours more they can spend looking at app and Facebook. </p><p>Google is doing the same thing by, essentially, saying that things like people searching for a product on Etsy. That's a kind of search and that's, also, in our domain. No, it's not. </p><p>If you search the Internet, Google is it. We have the statistics. We see where our leads come from, when they come to our marketing site. They all come from Google. No other search engine that matters has any marketer that matters, at all. </p><p>About 40 percent, which is a low number for our industry, 40 percent of all our marketing leads come from Google. And no other search engine provides us much as 1 percent. They have complete dominance. </p><p>We could lose our listing in DuckDuckGo and we wouldn't even be able to tell. If we lose our listing in Google, and we make a lot of business. </p><p>CICILLINE: Well, and in fact, at a subcommittee hearing, Google said and I'm again, I'm quoting, \"When consumers search for information search for information, they can choose among Amazon, Yelp, Microsoft, Travelocity, and many other companies like these that consistently report strong user growth. If you don't want to use Google, there are many other information providers available.\" End quote. </p><p>And as you just mentioned, the search, with respect to places like Yahoo, Microsoft's Bing, or DuckDuckGo, rarely pass even 1 percent. So-- </p><p>HANSSON: And also, just to that example. If consumers hear about Basecamp, they want to find Basecamp on the Internet. Can they go to Travelocity to search for Basecamp? Are they going to find Basecamp in the travel listings there? No, they are not. There's only one place where you're going to find businesses that are online, today, and that's Google. That's why they have this tremendous power. And none of these other platforms matter, in that regard. </p><p>CICILLINE: And you noted in your testimony that Google is erecting toll booths everywhere. What are some examples of these toll booths and you stated it was not always like this and that Google has introduced these toll booths, over time? Why do you believe Google is imposing these toll booths and what are the implications? </p><p>HANSSON: Yes. It used to be that Google cared very much about the user experience. They would, endlessly, give interviews about every little pixel mattering and how it was just so important to provide fast service, so people could find what they were looking for. </p><p>Today, if a consumer goes to Google, on their mobile device and search for Basecamp, the first thing that they will find is whoever bought that trademark term, which is usually one of our competitors. </p><p>Their goal, consumers are not finding what they're looking for. They're not being presented with what they're actually looking for. They're being presented with an app. And that's the tollbooth that they are erecting. </p><p>It didn't used to be like this. You used to be able to search on Google for what you were looking for and you would find it because Google has a great search engine. </p><p>The problem is, they've replaced that search engine with an app engine, instead. So now, they serve up ads first and they dominate. You ask anyone who's in Google's listings, does it matter where you are on page 3? No, it doesn't. No one goes to page 3. Everyone goes to page 1 and they look at the first results. </p><p>So, we tried very hard and have spent 20 years building a good reputation, such that we would be the number one organic search term for Basecamp. It's just that that doesn't matter, anymore. </p><p>Your organic search term does that matter, anymore. The only thing that matters is whether you buy the advertisement. We can pay off that, essentially, by buying ads on our own name. Why would we do that? Customers already know that looking for Basecamp, they go to Google to find us, to find Basecamp, and now, we have to pay Google to buy apps for our own names, such that competitors are misdirecting them. </p><p>It's a complete shakedown. And it should not be allowed. </p><p>CICILLINE: And two more questions. One is, you testified that your company has, undoubtedly, given up growth to competitors because we've refrained from pursuing targeted ads. Do you think a new startup to establish itself has the option to not work with Facebook, or Google and survive? </p><p>And then finally, you also mention that Apple has retaliated against Basecamp for informing consumers that they can sign up online, rather than through the app. Can you tell us more about this situation, how it's affected Basecamp and how this policy affects users? </p><p>HANSSON: Sure. To the first question, I think the main thing here, just like with Sonos, is we were founded early enough that we were able to build up a brand name, prior to these conglomerates having complete domination, as they do, today. </p><p>So, we have some brand equity that we continue to rely on but it's being diminished. And if you were to start today, you would not have this opportunity. You would, absolutely, have to pay these platforms, enable to allow consumers to find you and build your reputation. </p><p>So, I think the game is very different, now. And that's the tragedy that we've seen. We started a business. We were able to grow it and make it successful because it was a free, fair and open marketplace. It no longer is, today, and now, we're facing a brand-new threat. </p><p>In terms of the retaliation, we have one example where our application does not use Apple's payment services. We refuse to pay the 30 percent fee, find it completely outrageous. So, we have to go through all these contortions to, essentially, tell users, when they find our app in the app store, that we are not using Apple's payment services, that we're using something else. </p><p>Except Apple forbids you, in the terms of the agreement, to say anything of the sort. You cannot mention that you're using an external third-party payment processor. And if Apple finds any evidence of that, anywhere, they will deny your application. </p><p>For a long time, for over a year, we had a small link in the help section, deeply buried within the app, that would lead you to an external help site that would talk about the fact that you could purchase a subscription to Basecamp. For the longest time, no one at Apple cared. </p><p>One time, we submit an update to our application, a particularly enterprising reviewer finds that five page, third deep, denies our update. Now, we're no longer able to provide buff fixes, security patches, or anything else for our update, until we remove that. </p><p>So, we get completely bullied out of having any way of telling customers how they can, actually, buy our product. And you see this, I submitted in my written testimony, a screenshot of what Netflix--Netflix, one of the other big giants. They can't even tell their customers how to pay for the product, when they're on the app store. It's outrageous. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you very much. I recognize Mr. Buck, for five minutes. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Spence, I want to clarify something with you. I'm sorry, Mr. Barnett. You said that you can't buy Popsocket on Amazon, any more. </p><p>BARNETT: I did not say that. </p><p>BUCK: Oh, okay, you can't sell. </p><p>BARNETT: So, just to clarify the relationship. We quit selling to Amazon. Amazon was then reselling. So, it would say, sold by Amazon. There are plenty of other, there were plenty of other sellers. </p><p>BUCK: We can still buy it on Amazon. </p><p>BARNETT: In addition, we are now testing a relationship with that same team at Amazon. So, as of, in the last 30 days, you will see product sold by this Amazon team that we broke up with, you know, over a year ago. </p><p>So, you may even see products sold by that team, too. </p><p>BUCK: Okay. Mr. Hansson, I want to visit with you about something because I think there are two issues here that most of us agree on. There are a lot of things that we don't agree on. </p><p>There are two things that we are talking about, today. One is competitiveness and the other is privacy. And we haven't touched on privacy. And I want to ask you to shorten your answers a little bit for me, if you can. But one of the things that bothers me is, when I buy something online, somebody now knows a little piece of information about me. </p><p>And when I buy enough things online, they know a whole lot of information about me. And they use that information to target me. </p><p>If there were 30 online vendors, they would each know a little bit about me. When there is one online vendor, like, or one search engine like a Google, that company now has a privacy, they have my private information, as well as an interest in marketing. </p><p>And I want to, if you could, and I know you don't have the philosophy degree. But I just want, if you could, tell me a little bit about what your concerns are, in terms of Americans and really, people all across the globe, giving up that private information and how it is impacting the marketplace. </p><p>HANSSON: I think that's a great question. I think, actually, as a, personally, as a consumer, it's the question that stresses me out the most, the fact that we are forced to give up our privacy to interact with the modern world. </p><p>You cannot opt out of this data collection. If you want to use the Internet, this is being done to you. You simply have no power. There's some good initiatives going on. The CCPB, the CCPA in California, and the GDPR in Europe, that's starting to address this that companies, the platforms are not supposed to be able to just collect everything about you, without your knowledge and, essentially, collecting these dossiers that they can use to target you because we are all susceptible to advertisement. </p><p>Anyone who says otherwise, is simply uneducated. If you know enough about a person, if you know all their weaknesses and their fears and their aspirations, you can sell them so far more effectively, all sorts of things that they may not have bought, otherwise. And perhaps, they shouldn't have pursued them, in the first place. </p><p>The example I give in my written testimony is the fact that a woman who is pregnant, Apple, or sorry, not Apple, Google or Facebook may well know, before her family does because they can purchase things like a sales record from CVS that, maybe, there was a pregnancy test bought, or the fact that she searched on Google about becoming a new mother. </p><p>And they can use that data to then sell that to advertisers, who want to reach pregnant mothers. That's not a piece of information that they volunteered. They didn't sign up to say, oh, I would like to receive advertisement on this private fact about my life. And have at it. </p><p>This is just something that's being done to them. And we need to provide consumers with protection so things aren't done to them, so that they aren't being used against their better judgment. </p><p>BUCK: And that was the short version. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, I want to go, sort of, one step beyond that with you. And what's the answer to that? Is there, is there a limit to how much, how big we should let a company aggregate that kind of information? Now, I've got to tell you, my concern is that, I don't really care if they tell 15 T-shirt companies that I'm out looking for a T-shirt, or 15 cowboy boot companies that I'm out looking for cowboy boots. </p><p>I'm concerned more about the ability of governments, the ability of police forces, the ability of people that would use that information for nefarious purposes, to get that information. It's one thing to entice me into buying ice cream when I'm on a diet. It's another thing when you are trying to use that information in ways that I, explicitly, don't want that information used. </p><p>And so, what's the answer there? How do we have great search engines but not just one? </p><p>HANSSON: I think the number one issue here, is simply to ban companies from collecting this information, in the first place. And then, the reason they are collecting this information is such that they can sell you targeted advertisement. </p><p>If it was no longer allowed to target advertisement, based on personal data, they would have no interest in collecting all this data. This data is solely being collected for the purpose of creating these ad engines. </p><p>So, if you, essentially, say to Google, for example, you can simply place advertisement, based on my search term. When I search for a new car in Chicago, resellers of cars in Chicago, they can advertise. But they can't advertise on the fact that I owned a Toyota six years ago, or that I was in an accident and I might be more susceptible to an advertisement for Volvo, or something else like that. </p><p>Ban the right of companies to use personal information for data targets, for advertising targeting. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. The gentlemen's time expired. I recognize Mr. Neguse, for five minutes. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also want to say a thank you to our Attorney General and Congressman Perlmutter. Referenced this earlier, we had a chance to visit with him this morning. And he's been a national leader on these issues and on the antitrust front, working in tandem with the attorneys general from any other number of states. And we appreciate his leadership on that front. </p><p>I guess, you know, as we get closer to the end of this hearing, Mr. Buck asked this question, I think, at the very beginning. I think it's fitting that we end on it, as well, which is to say, the goal of this committee at the conclusion of its investigation, the hope is that we would have a number of different statutory recommendations that we could make to the Congress to change the law, strengthen the law in antitrust. </p><p>And also, potentially, some regulatory recommendations, ways in which the agencies that are charged with addressing these issues can act in a more muscular way, the FTC and others. </p><p>I am curious, as to whether, and this is a question to all four of you. As you sit here, today, what recommendations would you make? What steps do you think Congress should take, whether that's specific legislation do you think we ought to pursue? Or, as I mentioned, perhaps on the regulatory front, steps that we should encourage, incentivize, there? And you know, Mr. Hansson, you referenced this with respect to privacy, just now, in terms of one step, perhaps, that we could take. </p><p>But we want to give each of you a chance to answer that question. We'll start with you. </p><p>SPENCE: Thank you for the question. And I do need to correct the record on one thing. We have just--we are now spending $10,000, a month, on lobbying, which I would much rather be putting into research and development. But it is a direct impact of the situation we're in, today. </p><p>The, you know, as I think about where I hope this committee is looking, I'm not, you know, I'm not educated enough to understand, necessarily, all the anti-trust laws, as I mentioned before. But I would say, looking at leveraging market dominance in one category, to be able to dominate another category is something that has to be, you know, thought through, right. </p><p>How is that--is that the spirit of the kind of world that we want to live in, at the end of the day? And I think the other big issue is this notion of, is of efficient infringement, as it's called, where these dominant companies can infringe the intellectual property and invention of other companies.  </p><p>And they do it, calculating the fact that, if they have to pay down the road, if that's enforced, later on, they'll pay the fee. And by that point, the competition will be out of it and they'll be so dominant, that is a rounding error, at the end of the day. </p><p>And so, swift action on that front and material action is something that I think would help. </p><p>BARNETT: So, I raised two issues, one around the counterfeits and fakes on the Amazon marketplace, the other around bullying. As for counterfeits and fakes, we don't have the resources to fight Amazon. We didn't sue Amazon. We never will sue Amazon. </p><p>We spent $7 million, last year, in legal battles against tiny players, I mean, really tiny players. Imagine what it would cost to fight Amazon. We could use some help. It would be great if the government, at some level, stepped in and said, massive companies that are, you know, systematically, violating intellectual property rights of small players are targets for the government. And the government needs to step in. That's one thing with the fakes.  </p><p>And then, second would be bullying. But there's two pieces to it. There's Amazon as a bully, as a retailer. And Amazon as a bully, running a marketplace and dictating the terms of the marketplace. And they're connected. But it might be a good idea to separate these two out and say, Amazon, let's break it into two companies; one, if you want to sell on this marketplace, great. That's one company. If you want to run a marketplace, great, but you're going to run it, according to certain rules, where, especially, if this is going to take 45 percent of the online revenue, then there's going to be certain rules to ensure a certain fairness and to ensure that players can play fairly on this and dictate the terms that they want. </p><p>And if you want to take a fair profit, great. We'll reward you for developing this great marketplace, right. </p><p>HANSSON: I think, actually, there's a lot of history, here. The last time a single company was so dominant in technology, in particular, was Microsoft in the 90s. and there was very direct enforcement of the fact that they were using their monopoly in the Windows operating systems to extend that monopoly to browsers and cutting off the air supply to Netscape. </p><p>The government, DOJ had an anti-trust investigation, concluded that Microsoft was in violation of anti-trust laws and tried to do things about it. And even if that intervention was not, ultimately, completely successful, it was still successful. </p><p>Microsoft did not go from having a monopoly in the Windows operating system to having a monopoly of the internet, which was the stakes, at the time. And we can, absolutely, do something at the same time. The fact that Google has a monopoly in search is a problem in and of itself that should be tackled. </p><p>This is simply too important of a resource for consumers, for businesses, that they can run it like they just so please. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman is expired. But if the last witness wants to give a quick answer. </p><p>DARU: Sure. So, we talked about a few things that the impact on Tile, specifically, as a result of Apple's anti-competitive conduct. And things like, you know, throwing new requirements at us, out of left field, like this new Apple ID requirement that we have to now engineer into our products, rather than innovate. </p><p>They are, you know, raising the prices of their, or the cost of their rivals by engaging in aggressive advertising practices. You know, all in all, that amounts to damage to Tile, damage to competition and, ultimately, damage to consumers. </p><p>And, ultimately, and we're just one company. And so, what we encourage is to continue explore, you know, all of the different ways that Apple has engaged in this anti-competitive conduct, so that we can shed light on what the best ways of addressing it is. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. Mr. Perlmutter. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: Just a couple questions. And Mr. Chairman, thank you. And to my colleagues from Colorado for letting me sit in on this, today, because it's very, this is very interesting and, obviously, it affects everybody, every day. </p><p>And even if you get a couple more hours sleep, you know, most of the waking hours that we all have. So, you know, part of what we're doing is, I'd say, the last really successful measure was breaking up Ma Bell, okay, in which, ultimately, resulted in a lot of innovation but then, consolidation again, which is where we are. </p><p>And these companies are having their cake and eating it, too. They provide the service but then, they provide a competing product. But they've got so much more information, now, you're at a terrible disadvantage. </p><p>So, there's a new product out there. Mr. Hansson, you were sitting there, this morning, when I brought it up. So, I serve on the Financial Services Committee. So, the banking committee, real estate, all that sort of stuff. We had Mr. Zuckerberg come testify to us about an effort under way at Facebook to create a new digital currency and to create, in effect, a banking system that's not going to be regulated as a bank in Switzerland, kind of with some partners called Calibra, and the currency being Libra. </p><p>You know, you had it, you talked about make Kupka blush. And then, you have sort of a fear and loathing common in your testimony. It says, back then, we--there was excitement about the likes of Google and Facebook and the better tools and services they provided us. Today, the excitement is primarily replaced by a mixture of fear and loathing. </p><p>So, in the context I brought you, of Facebook with all of its information and its ability to, unbelievably target information, what's your reaction to them, potentially, becoming the biggest bank on the planet. </p><p>HANSSON: That would be a catastrophe. And I think the fact that they already have so much data about everyone, if we add in all our purchasing data, on top, everywhere how you spent your money and how much money you have, no single company should have access to this much data. </p><p>Second of all, why would we need another thing that's unregulated, that they can control? Like we already have problems, just dealing with all the issues they created in society, as it is, today. We need to deal with these issues, first, before they, sort of, venture off and try to undermine currencies of sovereign countries. </p><p>PERLMUTTER: And with that, I just appreciate everybody and their testimony, today. And thank you for, you know, and thanks to my colleagues for letting me participate in this. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Perlmutter, for being part of this. I'm going to, now, recognize myself for the last five minutes. And then, I know Mr. Buck is going to make some closing comments, as well. </p><p>I want to turn now to you, Ms. Daru. Your written testimony notes that Apple is a major distribution channel for Tiles products but that Apple has introduced services, such as FindMy, that you spoke about, that now, directly competes with Tiles business. Apple argues that FindMy is not a real competitor to Tiles products because it does not use background data. How would you respond to that claim? </p><p>DARU: Thanks for the question. FindMy, as its name suggests, is a location-based funding service. So is Tile. And FindMy helps people find their Apple devices. Tile can do that, too. </p><p>And ultimately, you know, Apple renders FindMy as a native installation in all their phones. And it's a feature in every one of their phones. And they sell those phones. So, they certainly are in the business of location-based finding services. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. You described how Apple has made several changes that make it more difficult for customers to use Tile. For example, Apple now sends Tile users frequent prompts requiring that they repeatedly confirm they've granted Tile access to their location data. </p><p>Apple has publicly said that it makes these types of changes to promote user privacy. Is there a reason to think that these changes, which might hurt Tile, are actually good for customers and can you describe what else is different in the new iOS, at it relates to the Tile app? </p><p>DARU: Thanks for your question. No, the changes that they've made are not good for privacy, or for consumers. And you think about it, these changes that they have made, they actually don't make any information more private. </p><p>The vulnerabilities that existed before, still exist. Any bad actors that are out there are still, probably acting badly. But what these changes did, is they added friction, they added confusion, added annoyance to the customers of Tile, who got confused wondering why they were getting all of these constant reminders, wondering if it should imply that Tile should not be trusted. </p><p>And at the same time, didn't apply the same mode of transparency to its own services. And I think that this is a really prime example of Apple using privacy as a shield to advance its best interest. </p><p>CICILLINE: Privacy and data protection have been recurring themes in our investigation and our committee is, also, concerned with the use of privacy as a shield for anti-competitive conduct. You mentioned in your written testimony that Apple has justified the recent iOS changes, in part, to enhanced consumer privacy. Can you discuss how Tile uses, stores, or monetizes sensitive user date. </p><p>DARU: Absolutely. Thank you for the question. Privacy is of the utmost importance to Tile, especially, given the nature of our business. Importantly, Tile only exists to help people find what matters most, to relieve a really large pain point in people's lives. </p><p>They say that people spend, at least, 365 days of their life looking for lost items. And that's what we're trying to solve. Trust is of paramount importance. Importantly, also, is that, Tile doesn't have any ancillary businesses that could use this data that's collected in a way that doesn't comport with reasonable expectations. </p><p>We don't have an ancillary advertising business. We don't even have revenue generating advertising in our products and services. Our only revenues come from selling our devises and our subscription revenues. </p><p>CICILLINE: So, you don't use store monetized sensitive user data, at all? </p><p>DARU: We store, we do not monetize or sell sensitive user data. We store some data for a very limited amount of time, only to provide the service operator business and enhance user experiences. </p><p>CICILLINE: Okay. And my final question is, your written testimony notes that Apple's control of the iPhone ecosystem gives it access to competitively sensitive information. Do you believe Apple's access to this information raises anti-competition concerns? </p><p>DARU: I absolutely--I absolutely do. So, in addition to the examples I gave earlier, for instance, when they were carrying us in their retail stores, we would even give them prototypes of our to be released products. And absolutely, they have power and they've shown the proclivity to use that power to their competitive advantage. So, absolutely, yeah. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. I just, before that light turns red, my time is up. I'm just to ask all of you, quickly, to answer yes or not. Do you think that you have been able to, successfully, launch your companies and the products you've described to this committee in today's internet environment? </p><p>Mr. Spence. </p><p>SPENCE: No. </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Barnett. </p><p>BARNETT: Yes. </p><p>HANSSON: Maybe. </p><p>CICILLINE: Maybe. </p><p>DARU: Impossible for me to speculate. </p><p>HANSSON: Qualify what you mean. We could stay in business. But we wouldn't enjoy anywhere the degree of success we have today. </p><p>CICILLINE: Alright, I'm going to now yield to Mr. Buck. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Daru, I want to end with you the way I started with Mr. Spence. I'm wondering about the answer, the solution. And I hear Apple creating a product and pushing you out of the marketplace with the creation of that--you can really find my wallet, by the way. </p><p>DARU: Absolutely, we can, yeah. </p><p>BUCK: I'm way past 365 days, already, in my lifetime. So, what is the answer to--should Apple not be allowed to create competitive products? Should Apple be restricted in its pricing or the way it regulates products in the apps store? What would you like to see, if--and I would trust the Chairman, absolutely, with this? You know, he could just pound that gavel and say, tomorrow, this the way it's going to be. </p><p>How--what would you like to see? </p><p>DARU: So, when it comes to Apple, I would start with, we need equal transparency and visibility on their platform. We need equal access to permissions. We need equal access to critical technology. We need advance notice of changes to the OS, that have a meaningful impact on our business and we need rules that are applied, consistently, across the board, to everyone in the ecosystem, including Apple. </p><p>Like I said, we're one company and have had a significant impact by the anti-competitive practices of Apple. I wish I had all the answers. But I'm here in support of Congress's continual exploration of these anti-competitive practices to better shed light and highlight how we can address these inequities because, ultimately, the future of competition in the United States depends on it. </p><p>BUCK: So, you're alright with Apple creating a competitive product. It's the way that they distinguish or discriminate between the two products that is the problem. </p><p>DARU: So, it's two things. Absolutely, we welcome fair competition but it has to be fair. You know, we're seeing time and again, Apple using its dominant market power and engaging in practices that put us at a competitive disadvantage.  </p><p>For instance, engaging in these aggressive advertising practices, putting ads online that look like Tile ads for people who are searching for Tile. Diverting them to the app store, raising our cost at the most critical times of the year. </p><p>You know, they're engaging in these practices that, ultimately, put us at a very--at a competitive disadvantage. And it's those types of unfair practices that we need to curb. </p><p>BUCK: I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Well, I want to first, say thank you, again, to the University of Colorado, Boulder, for hosting us. Thank you to the four extraordinary witnesses that we have just heard from. You have demonstrated tremendous courage in being here, today, and describing economic retaliation some of you have already experienced. </p><p>And so, I want you to be certain to share with us that we do not expect that you will suffer any economic retaliation for coming forward and testifying before Congress. But if you do in any way, it would be of tremendous interest to this committee. </p><p>I think, you know, Mr. Buck raised a question of what's being spent by some of the big, large digital platforms in lobbying their interests. And there's not a corresponding lobby for innovators and entrepreneurs and small businesses. That responsibility falls to all of us. It's our responsibility to make sure that the marketplace is working, that it's promoting competition, that it's protecting innovation, it's protecting small business and entrepreneurs. </p><p>And that's the focus of this investigation, to figure out how we get this marketplace working and what are the consequences that are being experienced by entrepreneurs and innovators and small business and consumers, as a result of this tremendous market concentration. </p><p>So, you have contributed, significantly, to our work. I thank my colleagues for traveling back home and traveling to the hearing because it has added to what, as Mr. Buck said, has been a very bipartisan effort to really understand Congress's role in, both modernizing the anti-trust statues and making sure anti-trust reinforcement is working properly and that the resources are available to be successful. </p><p>And so, again, with deep thanks from the entire committee, this concludes today's hearing. And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witness or additional materials for the record, </p><p>Without objection, the hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1P-XXH1-F15W-H01T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Welcome everyone, to the third in our series of hearings, investigating competitions and digital markets. This one, on the role of data and privacy in competition. I now recognize myself, for an opening statement. I should state the obvious, I am not the chairman of the subcommittee I'm the chairman of the full committee, the chairman of the subcommittee will be here in a few minutes. </p><p>Digital technology has provided Americans with a remarkable array of services. It is never been easier to share news and information, to publish content, and to communicate with loved ones. All at a moment's notice. But as with technological revolutions, in the past, this transformation has upended the balance of power across our economy. </p><p>It is important for Congress to study and understand how these imbalances are affecting Americans. What is causing these asymmetries of power? And, whether these new and growing inequalities are compatible with our democratic values. The committee's ongoing oversight and competition of digital markets is a key part of this process. </p><p>Today's hearing will examine the role that data plays in creating and maintaining inequalities of power and how this affects competition. As previous hearings have shown, a growing share of commerce and communications is now controlled by a small number of companies. Because these platforms are in essence large intermediaries, they are perfectly positioned to closely track each transaction in communication that passes through their channels. </p><p>While intermediaries have long collected information on the economic activity that flows through their platforms. The large firms of the digital economy have unprecedented ability to track and surveil users across the Internet. This data collection includes information not only about a person shopping and reading habits but also about the time that they wake up and go to sleep, their precise location each hour of the day and the content of their most private communications. Because several of these platforms derive the vast majority of their revenue through digital advertising these firms also have an incentive to collect as much information as possible, so that they can target consumers with precision. </p><p>This drove of personal information can also be used by companies in even more nefarious ways to discriminate based on the user's race, gender, or income or otherwise to intrude on personal privacy. In light of these trends, there are at least two questions that I hope will be addressed in today's hearing. </p><p>First, how are digital technologies and the constant data collection they enable affecting competition? Is there something unique about digital markets that enable firms to acquire and maintain market power in novel ways? </p><p>In digital markets maximizing data collection can provide a company with a significant competitive advantage. A large and constantly growing set of user data allows firms both to improve existing products and services and to expand into new lines of business often with a competitive edge. </p><p>Frequently, the most dominant companies in the digital economy are those that have captured the most data from as many sources as possible. In recent years, scholars have described this dynamic as leading to a 'winner take all' market, where the first company to establish a competitive lead, wins the market. Crushing any potential competition. </p><p>In other words, competitors of digital markets have a strong incentive to collect as much information on users as possible. As quickly as possible. As part of a long-term strategy to compete in the marketplace and to achieve market dominance. This raises serious questions about whether it is good for society for unrelenting data collection to be the key dimension on which companies are looking to outcompete one another. </p><p>The fact that several major digital platforms make most of their profits by selling targeted advertisements, heightens those incentives. The second question that I hope will be addressed in today's hearing is how data collection increases the number of ways that the dominant companies can abuse their market power. Does the collection and use of data enable new forms of conduct that lawmakers and regulators should recognize as anti-competitive? </p><p>For example, platforms that service intermediaries for commerce have critical insight into their rivals' business models. A dynamic that raises significant competition concerns. With these issues in mind, I look forward to hearing from our esteemed panel of witnesses today. I yield back the balance of my time. And, I now recognize for his opening statement, the distinguished ranking member, and the former chairman of the committee, Mr. Sensenbrenner, of Wisconsin. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today we continue our oversight of the state of competition in the tech sector. To date, our primary focus has concerned large online platforms. The specific topics we address today, the roles that data and data privacy play in competition and the ways in which we can better protect the privacy of consumers online data, largely consume the same platforms. </p><p>Data is in many ways the life flow of the internet. Numerous issues are swirling around the use of this data. For example, these include allegations that; one, platform needs for very large accumulations of data can operate as a barrier to market entry by new platforms. Two, platforms holding large databases can leverage that data to compete unfairly with third-party competitors that are dependent upon their platforms. Three, incumbent platforms have pursued mergers with emerging competitors in order to kill off competition for data acquisition and market shares. </p><p>It is my hope are hearing can help us determine fact from fiction when it comes to these allegations. As I have stressed before, antitrust laws do not exist to punish success but to foster it. Congress in antitrust enforcement agencies need to be careful not to overreach, to extend or apply antitrust laws in ways that end up punishing success, suppressing innovation, and ultimately limiting consumer welfare. This applies not just to issues concerning competition for data but also applies to issues concerning privacy. If we are going to address data and consumer's data privacy through legislation. We must get it right. </p><p>I do not say this in a vacuum. Governments outside of the United States and Europe have already begun to lay down laws to address these issues. The most prominent example today is the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Following in its footsteps has been California's recently passed, California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA, which is substantially modeled on the GDPR. </p><p>In testimony offered before the Senate judiciary committee in March by one of us--by one of our witnesses here today Dr. Roslyn Layton, constituted a powerful indictment of the GDPR. However well-intentioned the GDPR has already producing substantial collateral damage to consumer welfare, innovation, and the health of the digital economy. It is likely that this CCPA will have the same effects. </p><p>All of these effects are avoidable. It is imperative that we in the United States identify and put in place a better means of protecting consumer's privacy online. I hope our witnesses today can help us work our way through these important issues. And before yielding back, let me ask unanimous consent to insert in the record a number of statements and submissions to the record that I have received. One from the Mercatus Center of George Mason University. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Second, a joint statement by the national CTA--CTIA and U.S. Telecom. </p><p>CICILLINE: No objection. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: A letter that has been sent to the chairman and myself, from epic.org. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: A letter for the record from Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of NetChoice. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: And I now yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman for yielding me back. And I thank the chairman of the full committee for opening the hearing. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. In June, this committee launched a historic bipartisan investigation into the state of competition in the digital marketplace. The purpose of this investigation is to document anticompetitive conduct online. To examine whether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct and to assess whether our antitrust laws and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these problems. </p><p>Since launching the investigation the committee has held a series of bipartisan hearings, briefings, and member roundtables as part of this top to bottom review. Most recently, we have requested documents, communications, and information relevant to the investigation from the four dominant platforms. </p><p>On Monday, the committee received the first tranche of responses to the request. Tens of thousands of documents and we expect to receive and review additional materials as part of this request in the weeks ahead. We will also continue to hold hearings and roundtables and conduct oversight to ensure that the goals of the investigation are met. </p><p>As I have said before, this work is essential to the committees' legislative of mandating constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of our antitrust laws and competition policies to ensure that they are working. Congress, not the courts, agencies, or private companies enacted the antitrust laws. And Congress must be responsible for determining whether the current laws or enforcement levels are keeping up with the digital markets. </p><p>We have much work ahead of us, but I am immensely proud of the efforts of my colleagues Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins and Sensenbrenner, along with their dedicated staff and I, look forward to continuing this important bipartisan work together. </p><p>Today's hearing is an important opportunity to advance our understanding of the key component of competition online. The role of data and privacy. Over the past year, several leading international competition authorities and antitrust experts have published groundbreaking reports that are focused on this issue. As these reports have noted, data is at the heart of competition online. </p><p>For example, an exhaustive report by the Australian competition and consumer commission concluded that and I quote, \"that the breadth and depth of user data collected by the incumbent digital platforms provides them with a strong competitive advantage creating barriers to rivals entering and expanding and relevant markets and allowing the incumbent digital platform to expand into adjacent markets.\" </p><p>The United Kingdom's digital competition experts panel, which was chaired by Professor Jason Furman, one of our esteemed witnesses today, similarly reported that large troves of data, when combined with network effects, may tip markets in favor of a single dominant platform killing off competition. Data also plays an important role in the ability of startups to attract venture capital to compete with dominant firms in these markets. </p><p>As part of a broader review of competition in the digital economy a panel of experts led by Professor Fiona Scott Morton for the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago, reported that investors often evaluate startups based on their access to data. As they explained and I quote, \"a new entrance starved of data, quantitatively and qualitatively speaking relative to a tech giant, is at a significant competitive disadvantage and investors will be on--be unlikely to invest when they view the data deficit as insurmountable.\" </p><p>This is real consequences for entrepreneurs and startups that get locked out of the market and never get a chance to compete on the merits to offer new and innovative services. There is also broad agreement among anti-trust experts that data can be abused by platforms for anti-competitive purposes. In some instances, these tactics have created an innovation kill zone around dominant firms. </p><p>Whether it is Facebook's use of ANOVA to spy on its competitors, Amazon's ability to identify and clone popular products being sold in its marketplace or the weaponization of API to block competitors, we know that the abuse of data has serious ramifications for competition. This hearing also presents an opportunity, an important opportunity, to examine the role of privacy and antitrust enforcement and competition online. </p><p>There is a growing consensus among enforces in the United States and abroad that privacy is an important dimension of competition online. While many online services claim to be free, we know that people pay in the form of their personal information and their attention which are both critical for online advertising revenue. In a statement submitted for the record for today's hearing Dena Schwinzervan (SP), notes that market consolidation allows dominant platforms to harm consumers and I quote, \"by not--not by escalating prices, but rather by diminishing quality by eroding privacy terms\". </p><p>Furthermore, as the UK's digital competition expert panel has also reported the misuse of data and harm to privacies not only an indicator of low quality caused by lack of competition, but it also could be used to cement a firm's dominance in the market as well. In other words, in a market that has vibrant competition firms have strong incentives to respond to consumer demand by improving the privacy safeguards for their products. </p><p>But, without competition incumbents have no incentive to deliver users privacy. I recently had the pleasure of discussing this with Shoshana Zuboff, at the Harvard School of Business, who has recently written about the rise of surveillance capitalism. A point that she made that struck me is that the pattern of automating consumer behavior for more clicks and better predictions is itself a market externality. There is no consumer demand for this service. </p><p>Americans do not want to have their information systematically mined. Just so they can be shown another advertisement or nudged toward a political candidate. But in many cases, there is no escape from the surveillance because there is no alternative. People are stuck with bad options are no options at all. Which is evidence, of a market failure. </p><p>Furthermore, companies that want to compete by offering services and products that do not rely on user surveillance are disadvantaged by this business model, which in turn reinforces the market dominance of the dominant firms. It is increasingly clear that the relationship between competition and privacy is not either-or. They are mutually enforcing concepts that must be at the forefront as we consider proposals to restore the Internet to its full promise. </p><p>And I approached today's hearing with these concerns in mind. Before closing, I would like to take one moment to thank Commissioner Vestager, of the European Commission and Chairman Rod Sims of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for their statement submitted for today's hearing. Chairman Sims was originally scheduled to testify at this hearing but due to an unfortunate change in our schedule, he was unable to attend today. Nevertheless, I want to thank him and his team for all of their hard work in advance of this hearing, on this issue. </p><p>And now, it is my pleasure, to introduce today's witnesses for today's hearing. Our first witnesses the Honorable Rohit Chopra, the Democratic Commission at the Federal Trade Commissions since 2018. Before joining the FTC, Commissioner Chopra was instrumental in establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He worked on the agency's implementation team after the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2010, and became the CFPB's first Student Loan Ombudsman. </p><p>He went on to serve as the assistant director of the CFPB and made significant inroads towards addressing the student loan crisis in the United States. He was nominated by President Trump to serve as an FTC Commissioner on February 28, 2018 and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on April 26, 2018. Commissioner Chopra received his B.A. from Harvard University and his MBA from the University of Pennsylvania. </p><p>Our second witness, Mr. Tommaso Valletti has been a professor of economics at the Imperial College of London since 2007. Before that, he served as a chief competition economist for the European Commission for three years, where he focused extensively on competition and digital markets. He has served as a professor of economics and management at the University of Rome where he still serves as a visiting professor of economics. </p><p>Professor Valletti is also currently a research fellow at the Center for Economic Policy Research and at the Mannheim Center for Competition and Innovation, he received both his master's and Ph.D. from the London School of Economics. In addition to his work as an economist Professor Valletti also received his flute diploma from the Conservatorio di Musica in Torino. Italiano Forenza(PH). </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Our third witness, is Jason Furman. That was an applause, no? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Our third witness is Jason Furman, a professor of the practice of economic policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. Before joining the Kennedy School's faculty in 2017, Professor Furman served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during President Obama's second term from 2009 until 2013. Professor Furman was an assistant to the president and principal deputy director of the National Economic Council. He currently serves as a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics as well as advisor on digital market units for the UK government. Professor Furman received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard University as well as his master's in science from the London School of Economics. </p><p>Our final witness on the panel is Roslyn Layton. Dr. Layton is currently a visiting scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. She also serves as a visiting researcher at Aalborg University, as a vice president of Strand Consult and Copenhagen before her tenure with AEI, Dr. Layton worked as the director of  Search Agency Services at IBM Coremetrics, she has published dozens of times in numerous publications including; Forbes, The U.S. News &amp; World Report and The Hill, and served as--on President Trump's transition team in 2016, helping to establish his Federal Communications Commission. Dr. Layton received her B.A. from American University, her MBA from Rotterdam School of Management, and her Ph.D. from Aalborg University. </p><p>Welcome, all of these incredibly distinguished witnesses on our first panel. Thank you for participating in today's hearing and now if you would please rise, I will begin by swearing you in. Please raise your right hands. Do you swear or affirm, under penalty of perjury, that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and beliefs so help you, God? Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated. </p><p>Please note that each of your written statements will be entered through the record and its entirety. Accordingly, I ask you to summarize your testimony in five minutes to help you stay within that time there is a timing light on your table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals your five minutes have expired. Commissioner Chopra, you may begin. </p><p>CHOPRA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the subcommittee. My name is Rohit Chopra and I serve as a federal trade commissioner. Oversight from Congress is a pillar of sound transparent government and I have been honored to testify many, many times before members of Congress, including before Chairman Elijah Cummings whose energy and passion will be missed by so many of us. </p><p>Today's topic could not be more important or timely as it seems almost daily, we learn of problems stemming from the lack of competition. To this end, I think, we need to focus on four ways that companies undercut competition; concentration, conflicts of interest, contracts, and capture. Market power is concentrated with a few giants in so many industries. Conflicts of interest allow these dominant firms to sometimes rig the market in their favor, at the expense of upstarts and new businesses that fairly compete. One-sided, take it or leave it contracts and online terms of service impose self-serving regulations on consumers and small businesses. </p><p>And, all too often the government is too captured by those incumbents who use their power to dictate their preferred policies. In my testimony I discuss how competition in the technology market is structured around data, a valuable asset with very unique economic features we need to take into account. Our personal data is powering the profits and dominance of tech companies that offer basic services like email, search, or photo-sharing that are not truly free. </p><p>Fortunately, many of my colleagues around the world are also pushing forward. Reports from regulators in Australia, the United Kingdom, the European Union, are must-reads for this committee and everyone concerned about the future of our digital economy. In the United States as you know, our efforts are a work in progress and I agree that we need to take a fresh look at our policies and guidance. And, as we do, it is important that the Federal Trade Commission conduct a rigorous review of quantitative market data and an analysis of the financial incentives driving market-distorting behavior. Since joining the commission, I've argued that the FTC should be using our authority under Section 6B of our act, to get the data we need to effectively police these markets and report our findings to you and the public. When it comes to enforcement, I am more optimistic. Now that scores of states attorneys general both Republican and Democrat are teaming up to investigate anti-competitive conduct in the digital econo</p><p>my. </p><p>In this moment it is an--it is all hands-on deck and I stay in constant communication with them. Decades ago, our state AG's played a pivotal role in ending Microsoft's chokehold over the future of the internet. Without that action, there would likely be no Google, no Facebook, and no Amazon. While the FTC's recent settlements with Facebook and Google's YouTube included fines that made for great headlines, they did little to fix the core problems that fueled these companies' data abuses. </p><p>Big fines are not big penalties for the world's biggest companies. Otherwise, we have seen time and again when a company can simply pay a fine from its ill-gotten gains. This isn't a penalty; this is an incentive. As Congress federal antitrust enforcers and state attorneys general, all pursue their investigations we will need to pursue remedies that reduce concentration, eliminate conflicts of interest, rescind abusive contract terms against small businesses and consumers, and limit capture. </p><p>For example, recent scholarship has revealed the antitrust actions that separated lines of business or required interoperability of standards or ordered more patents available for public use after the anticompetitive conduct all led to massive innovation, small business entry, and economic growth. These are useful tools in the toolbox for policymakers and enforcers to consider when looking to both remedy and prevent harm. </p><p>In conclusion, while some believe that lax enforcement and absentee government are the ingredients of innovation, history teaches us it's the opposite. Without a vigilant and active government promoting competition, markets cannot thrive. Sometimes that means providing corporations with benefits like; limited liability, license, contracts, and other opportunities. But free and fair markets won't work without meaningful consequences for lawbreakers. And, inaction is a price we simply cannot afford to pay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Commissioner, I now recognize Dr. Valletti for five minutes. </p><p>VALLETTI: Mr. Chairman, ranking member and members of this subcommittee, good morning and thank you very much for inviting me. My name is Tommaso Valletti, and I am professor of economics at Imperial College in London. Between September '16 and August '19, I was the chief competition economist of the European Commission. In that role, I led the economic analysis of several cases involving digital platforms, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and others. </p><p>Today, I would like to make four points. My first point is obviously about data. Some commentators have argued that data is the new oil, others have gone to the opposite extreme by claiming data is as common as water, as air.  These sweeping generalizations are not very useful. It is self-evident that data is key to digital platforms and also only a few gatekeepers are in a position to control the tracking and linking of behaviors across platforms, online services, and websites. </p><p>They can combine several data sites and create super profiles of individuals. This is the market for individual attention where the nonexistent has to be conducted. As an example, if we open, all of us, in this very moment our Facebook accounts, if you have one, if we just looked at the ads popping up, you would see totally different ads. This is completely different from traditional media, that would be individual ads. Unfortunately, the debate over the practical importance of data is not helped by the lack of published empirical status in the field of competition economics. </p><p>The large digital players have not made any data available to independent researchers ever. I know already the scenic covered bottle to this, paraphrasing Mozart, that one could say come on, Cosi Fan Tutte, they are all like that. This would not be true. I can think of telecoms, of pharma, of airlines. I could immediately name several datasets that often anonymize that would be available to independent researchers to analyze competition in those sectors. It really is paradoxical and also literal from the state of economy which is sitting on unprecedented amounts of data. </p><p>My second point concerns the extent to which enforcers should consider privacy concerns under competition law. My answer is yes. Privacy is of the core of the economics digital platforms and competition is shaped around it. Competition generally speaking takes place along several dimensions', privacy being only one of them. </p><p>Quality, choice, innovation are also important aspects for competition and for consumers. In fact, when--when dealing with digital platforms it does not make sense to focus the analysis on privacy as privacy has been set at zero by choice. The business model is to give something away for free in order to monetize other related markets. Advertising in particular hence quality will often be very irrelevant focus of competition. </p><p>Lack of competition conversely will lead to reduced quality. In this case, at a reduction in privacy protection. My third point is that privacy degradation can lead to real consumer harm. This can arise in different ways. Data breach, identity theft, but also consumer profiling that is not done in the interests of consumers. Part of the problem is that the digital encumbers have the ability to impose terms of service that are not well understood but still accepted by consumers because of a lack of alternatives. This is already an indication of market power. </p><p>Was it actually read lengthy and obscure privacy terms? What do they mean? Think of common phrases like, we may collect your information for marketing purposes, or we may share your data with trusted businesses. Consumers see the instant benefits of clicking yes but cannot assess the implications of giving away their data that are bundled by design to the service. </p><p>These practices, increasing formation of the symmetries then undermined the role played by consumers and by competition. My last calm--my last point in my conclusion to all of this is that anti-trust cases involving data privacy can be run. Low quality can be seen in competition long terms as an exploitative conduct, in Europe this is captured by the canon law, in other jurisdictions, it is not, like in the U.S., it is not. </p><p>Still, it would be wrong to ignore exploitative conduct. Data, privacy, and competition are not separable. Diminish competition on privacy should be considered in any assessment, of the state of competition and of market power of all main platforms. Lower data protection can also lead to a standard of integrity of exclusionary behavior. Here the chain goes from dominance, but privacy terms, you get a data advantage compared to rivals, monies being made, this money can be used to exclude competitors or to leverage into neighboring markets. </p><p>Actually, time with other digital products can further enforce the data advantage of the dominant incumbent by cross-linking the data collected across services creating quite a vicious circle. These are conducts that could, in my opinion, my personal opinion, should be investigated. Thank you for your time and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Dr. Valletti, and I now recognize Dr. Fuhrman for five minutes. </p><p>FURMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ranking members and members of the committee. My name is Jason Furman and I am a professor of the practice of economic policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. I recently chaired the UK Digital Competition Expert Panel which produced a report, Unlocking Digital Competition. </p><p>One of our recommendations was that the UK establish a digital markets unit and I'm currently serving as an unpaid advisor to the UK government as they move forward with accepting that recommendation that my panel made. Today, of course, I'm testifying, with my own views and ideas, drawing on the report that we did. I thank you for your kind comments about it. I want to make four points in my testimony. </p><p>The first is that the major digital platforms are highly concentrated, and that concentration is likely to persist. It is due to a combination of factors, economies of scale and scope, the way that data can serve as a barrier to entry, behavioral biases on the part of consumers who don't shift the way we think they should, the importance of access to capital and brands. Many of those individually are present in many markets, but the combination of them and the extremes of all of them is unique to the digital platforms and makes it very difficult to have competition in the market. </p><p>The question of whether there can be competition for the market is a more speculative one but there's a number of reasons including the persistence of the major platforms to believe that that competition for the market will be difficult absent policy changes. </p><p>My second point, which was covered by Tommaso, is that this has cost to consumers. The services aren't free, consumers might have been compensated, they're paying in the form of data, they're losing out on quality and variety, and the lack of competition stunts innovation. The question is what we should do about this. </p><p>Some of the reasons why you have only a few platforms is because the benefits that consumers get from scale and scope. You want to preserve the ability to consumers to have those benefits. Some of the reason though is because of unfair competition and because of what's not organic growth due to efficiency, but mergers that have been improved often without very much scrutiny. So the key to policy is to preserve the good while enabling as much competition because competition is the source of innovation unless the private sector drive that innovation. </p><p>To that end, my third point is that merger enforcement needs to be more robust in the digital sector. Much of the growth we've seen has not been organic growth due to efficiency but has been acquisitions. There have been essentially no errors in blocking an acquisition that would have been beneficial to consumers but there probably have been errors in allowing acquisitions to go forward that have ultimately harmed consumers. </p><p>An approach should include more sources for the DOJ Antitrust Division and the FTC that they have the technical expertise to deal with this. The merger analysis can't just focus on short-run static effects, but also on potential commet--competition innovation, and take very seriously data as a barrier to entry. And third, the increasingly high bar for blocking mergers probably needs to be addressed in a legislative manner with some form of shifting the burden of proof. </p><p>Finally, my fourth point is that even with all of that merger enforcement that won't be sufficient to deal with, you know, the, you know, the horses that have already left the barn, antitrust scrutiny can help but it can also be slow, it can have a hard time addressing, you know, behavioral remedies. And that's why I proposed in the UK and I think it would make sense in the United States, the establishment of a digital markets unit. </p><p>I'm agnostic about whether this is a new body or whether it's an existing body. Like the FTC, what's important is the functions. The first would be a code of conduct to ensure no anti-competitive conduct that was backed up by enforcement authority. The second function would be systems with open standards and data mobility which would enable more entry and competition. And the third function would be a greater degree of data openness and I think with this approach, we could avoid some of the more extreme market disruptive steps, ensure consumers get all the benefits of fair competition but also enable new entrants to compete--enter the market and even deliver further benefits above and beyond what we've seen today. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Dr. Furman. I recognize Dr. Layton for five minutes. </p><p>LAYTON: Good morning and thank you Chairman Nadler, Chairman Cicilline, and Ranking Member Sensenbrenner. I'm honored to join these distinguished panelists today and to contribute to this important inquiry on data and privacy. And I also want to recognize and thank the committee staffers for all their work to prepare for this hearing. And this testimony represents my own views. </p><p>As Professor Valletti lays out, we know very little about the economics of privacy, the number and severity of privacy violations, the quantification of harm, and how many violations regulation would deter. Without these key points of information, it's ill-advised to build a command-and-control regulatory gene--regime which presumes that regulators are in the know. </p><p>The best numbers that I have come from Sasha Romanovski at RAND, who estimates that there are a few hundred information privacy violations per year, which is actually a small number given the size of the digital economy. Given the good policy, information is not available. Regulatory advocates look for other arguments to justify their preferred approach such as competition. Now, many well-intentioned policies are promoted on this premise that they will level the playing field but we must look at the actual effects, not just the theory and argumentation, however compelling it may be. </p><p>My testimony introduces the engineering concept of control points just as a lynchpin keeps a wheel from sliding off an axle, harnessing a control point is a powerful efficient way to govern a system. Now, Commissioner Chopra suggests that there's a corporate royalty controlling our economy. Well similarly, there's a regulatory royalty controlling our politics. The conventional wisdom that the regulation follows market failure. The reality is that regulation follows market success. </p><p>It's no surprise that antitrust authorities around the world and across the U.S. are looking at the American tech sector because that's where the money is. This is a source of political power because it brings revenue to various states through litigation fees and we can see the activities of state attorneys general who wish to make national policy by using the bully pulpit of their state. Fortunately, Congress can temper the self-interested actors so that no one state can dictate the commercial terms of our national economy. </p><p>I am extremely grateful that this Congress is considering updating the privacy framework for the digital age. We can learn a lot from the European Union, which has had a two-decade natural experiment in regulating the tech economy. The long-term trends and outcomes are clear by looking at the European Commission digital scoreboard and the Eurostat surveys. While large enterprise moves along, small and medium sized companies have a hard time growing. They don't invest in information technology and they transact little across borders. After 18 months of the GDPR in effect, we can see that the largest advertising platforms have gained market share while their fledgling ad tech rivals have lost ground. </p><p>GDPR imposes a set of fixed cross across all enterprises. Only the largest players can afford the costly requirements of lawyer's fees, chief privacy officers, audits impact assessments, software updates and so on. Less than half of all companies can comply with these regulations that cost $3 million per firm and one fifth of companies will never comply, and consumers are no better off, online trust is at its lowest point since 2006. </p><p>In contrast, the United States welcomed 40,000 new Internet start-ups last year alone. We have been fortunate to have a single national market from our founding and a 220-year tradition of carefully constructed bottom-up privacy rules that were democratically decided and based upon real-world harms. </p><p>The CCPA with its 77 regulations on enterprise has 22 more obligations than the GDPR. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis prepared by the California Department of Justice suggests the costs exceed benefits by a factor of 14. It notes $70 billion in start-up and running costs for compliance. Most of these costs go to privacy lawyers and consultants. The consumer benefits are estimated generously at a mere $5 billion. Now, it's hard to see what's progressive about giving a windfall to the privacy bar at the expense of consumers and small business. </p><p>These are companies with 500 employees or less. They make up 99 percent of the California businesses. These are the companies who are going to bear the brunt of regulations which are dreamed up by the regulatory royalty in a mere month. Now, the appeal to justify this regulation on hu--Human Rights is part of an attempt to avoid the forthright discussion about the costs. </p><p>Now in closing, there's a right way and there's a wrong way to do privacy protection; GDPR and CCPA are the wrong way. Good regulation should cost little to implement, it should be easy to understand. I appreciate that this committee is considering alternatives. If we're concerned about competition, we should stop adopting rules that unwittingly strengthen the largest players. In the end, I'm optimistic because the market we're talking about today is maybe a third of our national economy. The other 70 percent of our economy is where our opportunities are. That is where the data revolution has not come. That is where we have the opportunities to grow, where we can transform lagging industries in--in--in health and transportation. </p><p>So the important part is if we want these kind of new companies to emerge, we have to and we want to replace the status quo, we have to make sure that we don't kill it in the cradle by regulation that stops the innovator at the gate. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Dr. Layton. and I will now proceed under the five-minute rule. I now recognize the chair of the full committee, Mr. Nadler, for five minutes. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Valletti, over the last 10 years, the five largest tech platforms have acquired over 400 companies globally without any real challenge from antitrust enforcers. Professor, is there any evidence to suggest that this two-factor exemption from antitrust scrutiny was a mistake? </p><p>VALLETTI: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>NADLER: Please use your microphone. </p><p>VALLETTI: Sorry, this is my personal opinion of course. I do think that there has been a sort of antitrust immunity in general in the tech sector for--for far too long. Of--Google, Facebook, have acquired hundreds of companies as you said and very few have been vetted. There are some technical reasons sometimes. For instance, you notify some mergers only there are above a certain threshold and the threshold is dictated on the turnover of companies in the past three years when it comes to digital platform but also pharmaceutical companies, these turnovers are not yet there and so you don't have the tools to intervene. But yes, I am--I do think we have severely under enforced in the merger area, which means not necessarily that those mergers were bad but we should have investigated them for sure. </p><p>NADLER: Mr. Chopra could you comment on the same question? </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, I actually wonder quite a bit what would our world look like if Google had not bought YouTube or Amazon had not bought Zappos or many of these acquisitions that many believe could grow on their own to be their own big giant? And I agree that under enforcement can really kill innovation and kill entry because when it's harder and harder to break in, that's just bad for small business and it's bad for all of us. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you. Professor Valletti, what should antitrust and forces be doing to ensure that dominant platforms are not swallowing up actual and potential competitors? </p><p>VALLETTI: The simplest answer is run cases or open cases and investigate. The point is that you--I already know there is the response that some entrepreneurs want to be bought. This is the next strategy, they want to cash on their own innovation. My point is not that this shouldn't happen but simply that dominant company should not be allowed to buy those. They can be bought by someone else. </p><p>So what can be done is to (INAUDIBLE) cases, open use financial valuation, run through internal documents. The--the chairman before mentioned Onavo spyware that Facebook was using to buy the--some--some--some rival. So there is a lot of things that we can do to improve. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you. And you've also argued that the dominant platform can use its privacy policy to entrench it's dominance. Can you explain how that strategy works? </p><p>VALLETTI: So there are different ways. One way it could be for instance, a company which is dominant, it doesn't have alternatives, that's why it is dominant because you cannot--you cannot find alternatives. So this dominant company, and you need the service, will ask you to sign up for whatever they ask you. You don't see through the terms, you don't know what your data going, you don't know what's going to happen with your data, your data are going to be used monetize somewhere else, maybe even with yourself in a--in a fu--in a future period, in the present period with I don't know. If it is something genetic, it will be even some your--your offsprings. </p><p>So money is--is--is going to be made from this hyper targeted advertising. Once you have money, you can do lots of strategies to preserve your dominance. </p><p>NADLER: Okay can you explain why you view privacy as an appropriate factor to consider in the competition law? </p><p>VALLETTI: Yes, because the locus of competition is multi-faceted. It can be prices, it can be innovation, it can be quality. And since consumers seem to care about privacy, I would say this is one of the primary things that a healthy competitive market should actually give; a healthy privacy to individuals. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you. Professor Furman, in your view is big data creating entry barriers that prevent entrepreneurs from raising capital and breaking into technology markets. </p><p>FURMAN: Yes, I think big data is creating entry barriers and if you tried to guess what the next industry is going to be, we've had a succession from IBM to Microsoft to Google, etc. The next is likely to be AI, machine learning, and the company's best poised to take advantage of that are the ones that are the large incumbents now. So the wave-- </p><p>NADLER: They are largely because they have the data. </p><p>FURMAN: --because they have the data, exactly, which is what's needed for this next stage in the economy. </p><p>NADLER: And that may lead to my next question which is why is data still a barrier to entry even though it's none rivalrous? </p><p>FURMAN: It's non rivalrous but there are companies that keep that data and keep that data to themselves. They have economies of scale, there's things you can do once you have large amounts of data that are even much, much more than you could do with a medium or a small amount of data. And I think a lot of that is a function of public policy choices we've made about what data is and is not open. </p><p>NADLER: To compete with them, a new entrant would have to assemble its own data starting from way back? </p><p>FURMAN: Yes, they would, congressman. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you very much. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. Votes have been called. We're going to have the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Buck, be recognized for five minutes then we'll adjourn with the indulgence of the witnesses and come back immediately after votes, and we apologize for the interruption. Mr. Buck. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, and I want to thank the chair of the committee and the chair of the subcommittee for holding this hearing and I really appreciate this opportunity. Dr. Layton, a--a couple quick questions and--and I'm going to go real basic because that's about my understanding of this area. </p><p>If I am sitting in front of my desktop and I want to go to the U.S. House of Representatives website, I type in something on my browser, U.S. House. Up pops the area, I click on that and a resolver, I want to make sure my friends understand I use the word resolver not revolver, I'm not trying to get into a gun debate here; but a resolver then takes me to the website that I'm looking for. And my understanding is that recently we have had a change in that to add encryption to the area. Can you explain why the change was necessary and where we're going with that? </p><p>LAYTON: So I think the issue that you're talking about is the DNS over HTTP protocol. It's a new standard being proposed by Google and Mozilla. Just let me frame this--this issue, I've discussed it in my testimony. But I think that it's a great example of where we have a challenge with our privacy regulation between the--the person's right to privacy and the public's right to know. </p><p>So we've seen from GDPR and other things like this that a number of valuable resources that we've had on the internet for law enforcement, for copyright protections, for--for--for a person--for public information, they have been masked and clouded because of techniques taken on by regulation. </p><p>But in this particular case where you're looking at what's called the DOH, that D-O-H, is that in an effort to encrypt the traffic which people want to do to protect their privacy, it is changing the architecture of the internet which used to be very distributed and modular. So a--a number of--of parties would perform this redirect task that you talked about-- </p><p>BUCK: When you--when you say a number of parties, we're talking about tens of thousands? </p><p>LAYTON: --tens of thousands CDNs. And--and they're very important because individuals can put certain settings and preferences, whether they want to block malicious content and--and also law enforcement uses these things to find various criminals and so on. But all of that would be subsumed into--it would be all of that information that number of parties used today would be lost. </p><p>Now, the reason it's--is done because Google and Mozilla want to be able to get marketing data in that process and pull that control point as I described into their own network where normally, it would reside outside of their network. So this is just a coding tweak that can upset that entire balance that we've built up to date over all these decades. </p><p>BUCK: So would we no longer have tens of thousands of providers in this particular area? </p><p>LAYTON: I think it would eliminate the CDN industry overnight, I mean just by one mere coding tweak. So it's quite staggering how much a simple click like that can--or not a click but a coding tweak can change it. Now, there's some users who may like it, who they want to have I want my whole experience to be in Google, fair enough. But the other--for all of those-- </p><p>BUCK: They have that choice now, don't they? </p><p>LAYTON: Well they have the default now, you're absolutely right. You can choose Save Search, you can choose these different settings. But what we're putting making worse-off are all of the law enforcement parents, families, who are trying to set up permissions to protect their own privacy and their own, you know, their own preferences. </p><p>BUCK: Okay. And--and how many--do we have any idea how many of these providers there will be in the future? Will it just be three or four will it--will we once again-- </p><p>LAYTON: Well, I mean, the sort of--I mean, you can imagine, you could have a kind of world where, you know, Google con--consumes the Internet just because of the way that things are coded. I mean, more and more things could be encrypted. 70 percent of the internet is encrypted today largely because consumers want to have, you know, more privacy. But prior to encryption, the large platforms can look at the data that's there and they are able to use that to get the marketing information. </p><p>So I don't have the number of how many DNS resolvers are available today, but there would be many fewer. It is one of the services offered by ISPs, it's offered by a number of other--other parties out there. </p><p>BUCK: Mr. Chopra, any--any thoughts on that? </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, Congressman Buck, I think you're raising some important questions about who gets to decide this. If it's just when we just have one or two browsers that dominate the market and can make coding tweaks maybe for self-serving purposes, that's something we have to be wary of. Conflicts of interests with this level of market power have to be top of mind because it's not just about our economy. Like--like Dr. Layton said, it raises questions about how do we protect children, how do we enforce our laws. And to me, I think these types of regulations should be decided by Congress, not necessarily a company with a conflict of interest. </p><p>BUCK: Okay. Thank you very much for your time and I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. The chair will now recognize the gentleman from Georgia who's anxious to ask questions before the break. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you and I thank the witnesses for being here today, especially Mr. Valletti--Dr. Valletti, long journey, thank you. Many big--big tech companies have touted their data portability as the reason they can't be anti-competitive but few if any are truly interoperable. Professor Furman, interoperability is different from portability. Isn't it? </p><p>FURMAN: Yes it is. It enables you to operate multi-home operate on multiple systems simultaneously. </p><p>JOHNSON: And would you agree that one of them promote more competition than the other? </p><p>FURMAN: Yes. I think the technical details about how these--we--I use the word systems with open standards and data mobility. There's ways to do that that really enables switching and multihoming and ways to do it that frustrate the ability to do that. </p><p>JOHNSON: How can interoperability promote competition? </p><p>FURMAN: It enables consumers to have more choices, to switch more easily, to use multiple services. It also enables new entrants to come in and build on a lot of the things and networks that you've already accumulated on the incumbents. </p><p>JOHNSON: And doctor, what would it look like to have a social media platform be truly interoperable and do you believe that that can happen without government intervention. </p><p>FURMAN: I'll give you an example of one that is truly interoperable right now which is email. If email had been invented by a single company, it would have had its own protocols and you could only email other people who use that same company's email and you couldn't use people that use different email systems. I don't worry when I email someone about what company they're on, whether they're on the email system or not. That's a true form of interoperability that enables more choice and more competition. </p><p>JOHNSON: That's a great example. Commissioner Chopra, one could argue that privacy violations and other monopolistic behavior is incentivized by the ad based model. Meaning that more data a company has, the more data that a company has, the more company a data can collect and the more dominant it can become. Can you speak to some of the compounding problems with the ad-based model? </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, one of the objections I had to the FTC's settlement with Facebook for the company's early and repeated violations of a law enforcement order was their desire to maintain their dominance by collecting more and more and more data because guess what, it gets more valuable as you get more. I talked about this on my testimony and we need to start thinking not just about ticky-tack privacy rules but what's the reason why companies invade our privacy. And one of the--those reasons is the behavioral advertising model which is not an ad we all get, but it's an ad targeted at one person and it's often manipulative. </p><p>And so, we have to think about how these businesses are incentivized and structured if we want to get to the root cause of massive surveillance in our economy today. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you and Mr. Chairman, I will, in the interest of time yield back so that my other colleagues will have an opportunity. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman for your yield back. I want to recognize Mr. Buck for unanimous consent request before we recess. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent. I have two letters entered the record addressing the issues associated with centralizing domain name systems; the first from CTIA and CTA and U.S. Telecom and the second from 20 different child advocacy groups. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection and the committee will stand in recess and re--come back into session immediately after votes. I thank the witnesses for their indulgence. </p><p>(RECESS)</p><p>We welcome back our witnesses. I now recognize the gentlelady from Washington State with Ms. Jayapal. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for your very, very informative testimony. You've all touched on this but a common refrain that we hear from tech companies is during the course of this committee's investigation but also just on my own so I have many of them in my district is that they--they can't possibly be violating antitrust laws. And the primary argument is that it's because many other products are either cheap or free and therefore, consumers are inherently benefiting. </p><p>Now, you all have in different ways talked about this. To me, the big question of course is it's free really free? And consumers I think, it's increasingly clear are paying for the products that they use, they're paying in data, they're paying in privacy that they give up, and often don't know that they're giving up. And then of course, the big tech companies then use that data to build these massive empires of information about consumers which then give them a spectacular advantage over newcomer businesses, allow these companies to scrutinize every aspect of people's lives, create and sell the products that have the best chance of being successful and the marketplace is almost a bulletproof advantage. </p><p>Dr. Valletti, you mentioned the acquisitions and the history of acquisitions. As of 2018, Facebook had made 67 unchallenged acquisitions, Amazon had made 97 unchallenged acquisitions, and Google had made 214 mostly unchallenged acquisitions and you presided over the EC's--EU's investigation of Google, Amazon, and Facebook. </p><p>Two questions; what kinds of access do these companies have to information about consumers as a result of those acquisitions? And then, you talked about the --the thresholds being one of the potential problems for why investigations aren't opened. Do--do the thresholds of investigation need to change if we are to challenge some of these acquisitions? </p><p>VALLETTI: Thank you very much for the question, congresswoman. Do the thresholds have to change? I'm very pragmatic; to the extent that people have the powers to look into those acquisitions, that's fine by me, whatever is the--is the--the method. And even in favoring facts of change, it'll be the structural presumption. </p><p>When it comes to very strategic platform with such a humongous market power, I would wonder whether instead of asking the--the authorities to prove that there is something anti-competitive, and then they could rebut with efficiencies to change it and say, you guys are--are--are--are not gonna merge with anybody unless you prove to us that this is going to create efficiency. So I would change a little bit about the burd--the burden of proof. </p><p>In terms of investigations we ran, I cannot disclose information about any case but my understanding of those cases is that some of the claims we hear, a lot of times, the competition is one click away, there is all of these fantastic options available. I didn't see that in the data at all, I didn't see anybody going and clicking on search results on page two. I saw everybody being stuck with the defaults and the prey in the--in the installation, so I saw a lot of stickiness. </p><p>The fact that some one of us may actually make other choices, doesn't represent the average consumer there. So it's ironic that somebody come from--from--from academia, the ivory tower has to tell these companies, look, there's the difference between theory and practice. In theory, that they can do that but in practice, consumers never actually act on those choices, they just follow default. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you. Commissioner Chopra, several of the dominant platform serve both as critical gatekeepers while also competing with the businesses that are dependent on those platforms. Amazon for example runs a third-party marketplace but then, it has its own private label goods and both in committee and when I met with them recently, they really testified that this dual structure doesn't pose any conflicts of interest, and say that it's common for retailers to offer private label products alongside third-party products. What do you say to that and what--what's your response to that? </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, I think we hear these analogies of comparing it to grocery store cereals and the white label cereal and it just doesn't work. I am so worried when I hear from investors and venture capitalists who say, I'm not even going to fund a business that needs to distribute through these platforms, because guess what, as soon as it takes off it will be copied and all the business will be steered elsewhere, and that worries me for all of those small firms who want to enter. So we need to look deeply and that's why I mentioned sections 6B of the FTC Act to scrutinize big picture. </p><p>Of course, individual companies we will look if there's anti-competitive conduct, we have to go after it and fix it. But writ large across these markets, we all need to understand how this works so that we can figure out how to maintain our economy that is vibrant and thriving. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And related to that--just--my time is expired, but related to that, what are the tools that the FTC is not using that you could be using? </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, there are so many things that Congress has equipped us with and one of the pieces that I hope we will use much more aggressively and thoughtfully is competition rulemaking. It doesn't need to put any burden on any company but it can clarify the law about what's legal and what's not, so that we don't have to spend millions of dollars on paid economists and litigators that slow down decisions and ultimately may have--harm a lot a lot of people in the process and we need to resuscitate the use of that tool. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you very much. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentlelady. I now recognize Mr. Armstrong for five minutes. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, I appreciate it. </p><p>CICILLINE: Walk into the room and we immediately take you Mr. Armstrong. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Yeah, I'm just--Ms. Layton, I--I--I just want to talk a little bit about data Portability and you say that it's overrated. Can you just explain that a little bit? </p><p>LAYTON: So I think that we have the premise of number portability we know from the telecom world when you have, you know, you're going to go from one mobile carrier to another, you want to take your phone number, that's fine. But I think when you look at the internet world where you have multiple kinds of platforms. So if you have search--so--social network data that doesn't--from Facebook, it doesn't necessarily map to Amazon. </p><p>So there's--there's--the data is not really valuable to another platform. The--the bigger thing I think is something that's come up in this hearing. I think we're over rating the value of data overall because as a person who worked in the analytics industry, I had interfaced with, you know, 2000 companies, that--they actually after time that the data degrades. And if you are an innovator, it's less interesting for you to get a platform's data. Your--if you're going to innovate, you want to do something new and different. </p><p>So data portability is kind of the answer to heal all ills, I think is overrated. I've also seen this in some of the economist studies of, you know, in GDPR as well is that users also don't value data portability. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And--and I think that's, you know, and I've said that too, the basic framework is you should have control over your own data. But I since I've been here, I've learned way more about this than before I became a member of Congress is part of the reason--I mean, it's fairly complicated as to what is there and I think that's part of the reason like when you say consumers don't really necessarily see this as a benefit, is it because they don't understand what it is or because of how you said it? </p><p>LAYTON: Well, for one thing, there are switching cost. I mean, I think that's a fair point that other panelists have raised. But the I guess what I'd say is the value to having, you know, if we think that we should have five major search engines and five, you know, that this is somehow that makes a competitive, what we--what makes competition in this industry is new technology, doing something better and different more efficiently. And--and so, where I think we should focus on is that the innovators look at the other parts of the economy where the opportunities are. There are green fields. In fact, it's not like the way that it is today, will be this way forever. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And then, I guess when we talk about data portability, we're talking about it moving, right? I mean, in some form and in other areas, there's an entire market niche of whether it's insurance, litigation, bills of lading, free on board, those types of issues. So when you're dealing with this data portability, is--has anybody looked at the liability shift as we move from one person to the other? </p><p>Because there's a breach which is, I mean, part of the privacy concern is breach of data and it usually ends up with a credit card company or a bank. But if it's portable, I mean, more than one person is handling that data as it moves from whether it's Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook to somebody else. </p><p>LAYTON: Yeah, that's it--that is a fair point. I'm-- </p><p>FURMAN: If I may just--just-- </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Yeah, and then--and then my question is along with that portability portion is the cost of compliance not for large companies who quite frankly, we've seen this and I want to ask you a question about a Dodd-Frank analogy before I'm done. I mean, larger companies aren't necessarily scared of regulation, what they want is regulatory certainty. Smaller companies that employ four or five people, when you're dealing with data portability now have a compliance cost associated with that. </p><p>Well, while we're trying to regulate this we have to be very concerned that we don't regulate--we don't have the inverse effect where we could the cost of the cost of regulation makes it prohibitive. </p><p>VALLETTI: Sorry, I also want to jump in on this since it's been mentioned a few times, there's a European experience with the GDPR and the--the Californian solution now. Let me clarify first that this is very new, so having empirical evidence is a long shot because it's just been happening for a short period. GDPR also, let's remind ourselves, it's been in--introduced because there is a fundamental principle of privacy that individuals want to ensure. So anytime, you--we do a cost-benefit analogy, surely you want to see the impact on--on firms but also there--there is a benefit that we get if GDPR or whatever privacy regulation is enforced properly. </p><p>And the second point is that I'm very skeptical when I hear some of these numbers which are typically coming from, you know, institution which are funded by Google, Facebook. The European evidence is that Google and Facebook lost after the--on the advertising side after the introduction of GD--GDPR. So the track--it is a cost of compliance but whether it's only the small firms that are (INAUDIBLE), the narrative that you hear is from the big guys, not from the small guys. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well except, I want to bring an analogy back and I'm just going to ask Mr. Chopra this. So I go talk, we don't have big banks we don't have with the exception of some national companies, big business in North Dakota. I mean, we are a small business state. The single biggest thing I've heard and this has been long before I've been here in the decade or that 11 years since Dodd-Frank was introduced is in our realm, to regulate what we do think we're really bad actors and they were Dakota Community Bank is caught up in that. So are there any lessons we can learn from how we did Dodd-Frank when we do this so in our quest to do whatever it is we don't sweep up the little guys in regulation? </p><p>I mean, if you have 37 compliance officers on the fifth floor and you go to 40, it's not the end of the world. If you have two employees and you have to go to five employees, you may no longer have a local bank, so. </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah, one thing I would really urge you to think about is complicated rules, they actually benefit those who have a lot of lawyers and lobbyists to get around it and lobby for exemptions. I--in my testimony, I talked about the importance of bright-line rules and even bans. Because, you know what, when I--I have had those same conversations with community bankers. </p><p>They will say if I'm banned from doing it fine because they--that's really easy to understand. But if it's so complicated, guess what? The largest banks in the world, they find their way in and get their exemptions. They win and the small guys lose and that's not a system or a country I want to live in. </p><p>FURMAN: Chairman, I don't know if this time for me to add to that because we're in very negative time. </p><p>CICILLINE: No, no it's only--as long as Mr. Armstrong is interested. </p><p>FURMAN: Yeah, congressman, I think you make a very important point and I think you're absolutely right about worrying about the small businesses. I think sometimes in regulation, it's tricky because there's a trade-off. It's something that might be harmful for any sized business to do, you make the rule it's easier for the large one to comply than the small one and you end entrenching the incumbents. </p><p>In this area about competition, you can make sure that doesn't happen because if you're talking about rules a code of conduct as I've proposed for a digital markets unit to do, but you can't keep people off your platform, you have to let them on other platforms, you can't prioritize your own products. Those rules would only apply to companies that I would just designate as having strategic market status, only applied the very largest companies. </p><p>If you're a small company and you want to prioritize your own products, you want to keep people off your platform, you want to make rules about what other platforms they go, you can do any of that. We're only worried about if you have some bottleneck power abusing it. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Dr. Furman I now-- </p><p>ARMSTRONG: I have a unanimous and gets consent just to--to put Ranking Member Collins statement into the record. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. I now recognize the distinguished gentlelady from the state of Florida, Ms. Demings for five minutes. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much to the distinguished gentleman from Colorado. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all of you for being with us today. thank you for your patience as we went to cast our votes. I want to start with Mr. Chopra. </p><p>In several of your statements and dissent, you've argued that the core problem that leads to dominant platforms--that leads dominant platforms to engage in serial privacy violations is their business model which relies on monetizing use of data and incentives Facebook--incentivizes Facebook and Google for example to engage in constant surveillance. What problems do you see with the behavioral advertisements business model? </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, I think we're seeing more and more evidence that behavioral advertising, again that is advertising to a demographic of one, exposes us to a whole lot of risks including manipulation and shenanigans in our democracy. It is very, very profitable though. Facebook earned $55 billion in revenue, Google even more. The advertising business is big and I'm concerned that that behavioral advertising model is inconsistent with how we have thought about immunity online. Right now, we give broad immunities under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. I support that immunity but I don't know if it's consistent with this behavioral ad model and surveillance. </p><p>DEMINGS: So Mr. Chopra, what do you see as the solution? What--what role can come--how can Congress play a greater role in dealing with this problem? </p><p>CHOPRA: Part--part of it obviously is through better privacy protection. I'll just speak about how I looked at the Facebook order violations, the repeated and early violations of that order. That settlement not only completely let executives off the hook and they paid a small fine and their stock went up, there's no substantive limitations on their use or sharing of data and for repeat offenders, there needs to be some bans on this type of behavior because if they're going to break the law, we have to look at the economic incentive that is driving it. </p><p>DEMINGS: I think you said earlier that when you have billions and billions of dollars, five billion in a settlement is like--it's not much incentive to change your behavior. Is that? </p><p>CHOPRA: That's right. When you--when these big--these big fines are not big penalties for big companies, then I worry it's not a penalty, it's an incentive. I also want to urge Congress to think about how do we beef up individual liability. In FTC's Facebook settlement, we did not depose Mr. Zuckerberg or Ms. Sandberg, but guess what? They got full immunity in the settlement. And if the court approves that, what kind of standard are we setting and I just think that's fundamentally wrong. </p><p>DEMINGS: Dr. Valletti, I want to ask you about that but some have argued that heightened concern about digital monopolies is misguided given that companies like IBM, Yahoo, MySpace and Blackberry were all once viewed as dominant but ultimately were taken over by new firms. And I knew we kind of talked a little bit without naming the specific companies early. But could you just kind of--do you agree with that view or what's your feelings about that? </p><p>VALLETTI: It's almost an act of faith. Do we believe in dynamic competition? Sure, as a principle but then I see the empirical evidence when it comes to some selected platforms and I've in mind search, have in mind social networks, have in mind perhaps electronic marketplaces, this dominance has been going on for almost a decade. And so, is that long enough for to ever worry, I think yes, I mean in the long run, we're all dead, but I hope we will fix some problems before we are dead. </p><p>DEMINGS: Well, thank you for that bit of hope and sunshine. In light of your--I'm going to move on to Dr. Furman. In your view, how readily available is highly quality data to new entrants? If an entrepreneur wants to launch a new search engine for example, what challenges can he or she expect to face in light of Google's existing dominance? And I know we have kind of talked about this face, you know, protecting privacy competition but I just want to make sure it's clear to not just the people in Congress but to the listening public as well who's directly being impacted by the decisions made. </p><p>FURMAN: Yes, Congresswoman. Google has a very good algorithm, Google also has a huge amount of data about how consumers search to train that algorithm. A bright kid in a garage could come up with a good algorithm but they wouldn't have anything like that type of data in order to make it work nearly as well as Google works today. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you and Mr. Chair, if I could just--I'd also like to hear from Ms. Layton. Just any response to either of the questions that I ask that you would just like to respond to. </p><p>LAYTON: Well, thank you. I appreciate that opportunity. I would agree with Dr. Furman that when we look at artificial intelligence, that this is a green field. He's absolutely correct that the scientists sitting in the garage or in the--in the lab could come up with a life-changing or transformative kind of algorithm. I am--in contrast to the other panelists, I don't believe the data is a bottleneck because of having been working in the industry that the data that you collected degrades over time. So if you're a new innovator, you will look for the spaces where you can--there are opportunities. </p><p>It's less interesting to look in the past. You want to look to the future to say how would I--where could be a place where I would add value in the future? Healthcare it's one of the most inefficient industries, it takes up one-fifth of our of our GDP. That is where we need to have data to make it more efficient and lower the cost. So what I would like us to do is to look forward. I don't want us to adopt regulations that deter today's scientists from making tomorrow's innovations because they have to have all these permissions and releases from everyone. </p><p>Now, they may not look at personal data, there's other areas where there's no personal data involved. You know, qa--quantum computing, asy--astronomy and so on and they may go in those fields. But probably the biggest area where we can create the benefit is on human health. And so for example, in Iceland, they have this amazing registry of genomic data that--that was collected up for many decades. GDPR is putting all of that up--up in the air. Can we--can you find the cancer treatments, can you look at a lot of the new innovations? We don't know now because that was not collected under the GDPR environment. </p><p>So there again is that--that's a--but it's--that--that's a question that I would have. So health is an area where we need to see are we putting the bottleneck on the innovation. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>Commissioner Chopra, one of the questions that we are grappling with in this investigation is whether or not our--our antitrust agencies like the FTC have fallen short as an effective sort of cop on the beat in this digital marketplace and whether or not that is due to insufficient legal authority, whether it's due to weak leadership or as I like to refer to it, the need for enthusiastic and creative leadership. Is it part--partly results of regulatory capture? </p><p>But what is your view, what should we be thinking about as we look at this sort of insufficient--sort of inadequate enforcement of ours to trust agencies particularly FTC, what do you see as the source of that? </p><p>CHOPRA: Mr. Chairman, one of the things I reflect on a lot is how did the FTC miss much of the subprime mortgage crisis that originated in the non-bank sector? The FTC was really the only cop on the beat there and--and--and we saw what happened. So one of the things I think I took away from what I've learned on that is number one, we need to use the tools we have much more energetically. Two, we need to be much more analytical and not think in the world of theoretical economic models but real evidence and look at how markets actually work. </p><p>So of course, we--we can use more authority we can use more resources but the number one thing we need to do is energetically use the tools we have. And for you to think about, and Dr. Valletti mentioned this too, should we be thinking about changing presumptions? Should the--the largest firms on the planet, should it's--should the burden beyond them to show why their merger or their roll-up of tons of--of companies is in--in that interest. </p><p>So there's ways you can change the way courts are acting and I urge you to do that, but I also urge you to conduct oversight that makes sure agencies are using every tool you have equipped us with. </p><p>CICILLINE: Great. In February, commissioner, you gave remarks to a conference at the University of Colorado where you said, I quote, \"competition enforcement actions like the Bell Labs consent decree created the conditions for scores of start-ups to innovate and flourish. While we often focus on the cost of action and regulation, we should also be asking ourselves about the cost of inaction.\" </p><p>Do you believe in forces or lawmakers should be considering remedies like the one imposed on Bell Labs particularly since a lot of the focus of this investigation has been the impact of this market concentration on innovation start-ups, kind of the opportunity to make the next space for the next great technology platform? </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah, I appreciate that. One of your areas of inquiry in the investigation is whether spin-offs or divestiture of--of firms may be useful, you know, we--some colloquially call it breaking up. But there are many other remedies we need to think hard about. Should we be opening up intellectual property that has been abused by dominant firms and how much could that incubate in new activity? There are many--there's all sorts of history about how we have pursued this and the benefits from it. Can we look to separate lines of business to end those conflicts of interest and create more economic activity? </p><p>So we--we should work with you on all of that but the discussion must be bigger than breakups but of course breakups are--must be in the toolkit as well. </p><p>CICILLINE: I'm going to stay with you commissioner because we're going to do a second round because I obviously got questions for the other witnesses. But I want to transition to some of the recent privacy settlements at the FTC that I could--have criticized publicly. You recently dissented along with Commissioner Slaughter in the FTC settlement with Facebook. You stated that the settlement gives Facebook a lot to celebrate which was similar to what I said. </p><p>Can you explain what your concerns are with the settlement? I know that you said in part that the $5 billion settlement was insufficient because it didn't address Facebook surveillance and manipulation based business model which is what incentivize Facebook to engage in order vie--to gauge the violations in the first place. What do you think the effective remedies would be like? What was your criticism of that and what do you think the effective remedies would look like? </p><p>CHOPRA: So--so I think of this in--in multiple bucket first we should start with that this is a case of a recidivism, repeat offender. So it's not just a first-time oops, and in my view of the evidence it was clear that there was multiple early violations and there was knowledge of--of those. I--I think of it number one, where is the individual accountability? The officers and directors who called the shots to violate the law so that they could put money in their own pocket. </p><p>Without individual liability, you will not see the level of deterrence you need and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in our courts bind officers and directors to federal enforcement orders. Two, what is the actual conduct relief that goes at the court economic incentives? And to me, there should have been some real thought on actually banning some of the worst data collection use and sharing practices. And we have to think--of course monetary relief is important but the you but U.S.--but U.S. consumers did not get a penny of that. So I'm not sure that headlined $5 billion is going to do much. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you commissioner, my time is up. I now recognize the gentleman from--oh I'm sorry, gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Scanlon. </p><p>SCANLON: I want to thank all our witnesses for joining us today and for your testimony. You know, consumer privacy is an important issue for all of us both as individuals and as representatives for our constituents. But the way that data is collected and used by the large platforms, obviously, impacts the ability of consumers to maintain their privacy and the options they have to make informed decisions about their online activity. </p><p>Dr. Valletti, I wondered if you could expand a little bit on the third point that you made regarding privacy degradation leading to an objective detriment to consumers and--and I think you said that imposing terms of service with weak privacy protection that is not well understood but is accepted by consumers because of a lack of alternatives, it has to do with market power. Can you just talk about that a little bit and any perceived remedies that you might suggest? </p><p>VALLETTI: So on objective consumer harm, I--as I have written in my written piece, it can be, you know, risk of data breach identity theft. But interesting also, could--a consumer profiling which is not done in the interest of a consumer for instance, discrimination, scoring or being shown more expensive results. </p><p>So if you are in this moment, your dishwashers breaks down and you're going to type dishwasher repair in my area, you're going to be shown one most--most likely, one result with a nice graphic interface because there is a real-time auction that most likely Google will be doing and who are they going to select? The one that pays the most because they get--they get--they get a fee. </p><p>We have lost--we have lost the original function of the internet to offer us choices because as I said, behaviorally speaking, consumers don't go to page two, to page three and they don't involve--you just are hooked up. these devices are meant to keep us online as possible so they learn about us and then we buy whatever is the thing which is offered to us and there is a an underlying auction happening for you. And there's only one platform that will know for that. </p><p>Of course, if you're looking for a car, that's a choice that would take much longer--much longer--longer kind of period and so it's a--it's--it's a bit different. And for--for rec--for remedies, the--the most important thing I would start from is really try to think carefully about privacy. So having privacy regulations which is done in the interest of--of American people and its American institutions that should--should come up with a solution. </p><p>CHOPRA: Congresswoman, with your permission, I've just one point. When Facebook started, there was another social media platform called MySpace. </p><p>SCANLON: I remember. </p><p>CHOPRA: And one of the--one of the reasons that Facebook was able to unseat MySpace was partially on privacy and control of data that you will be able to control who sees your information. We should want firms to compete on privacy. These changes to Terms of Service hidden in the fine print where they can collect more and more data and unilaterally impose these terms, that is a price hike we are paying with our data and that valuable data and more competition will also be critical to how we think about protecting privacy. </p><p>SCANLON: I'm wondering in other context we've seen that you can change the dynamic by having an opt-in rather than an opt-out. Is there any possibility of doing something like that in this sphere? So for example, opting--having to opt out of a savings plan rather than opting in. </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, we do know behavioral defaults are our highly influential and typically right now, companies get to take everything from you and you have to figure out a way to opt out. It's like kind of like a full-time job with all the websites you have. So shifting the burden to companies I think would be a great way to really reduce the burden on all of us. And actually, if consumers want to share their data proactively and really want to renew that, let them tell that company and give them permission. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay, I've also had conversations with my kids and--and other constituents about the power over consumer data, putting that back in the hands of consumers. And the example that they like to talk to me about is moving your music library possibly from Apple to Spotify. Mr. Furman, can you talk about the idea of implementing data portability and--and whether that's something that we should be exploring? </p><p>FURMAN: Yes, I think absolutely, you should be exploring that. And it's not just downloading your data, it's really being able to pour it and move it over in a simple and transparent manner. The companies are making some progress in doing this through steps like the digital transfer project. I think in part they're making that progress because they think regulation is coming and they're responding to it. And to do this is not just simply passing a law and say, you have to do it, you have to roll up your sleeves a little bit and go use case through use case, figure out how to balance the different concerns but if you can do that, create a lot of value for consumers and more competition. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay, thank you. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentlelady. I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think Mr.--the chairman actually does has a MySpace account. so Ms.--Dr. Layton, you--you seemed like you wanted to respond to that question so I'll just give you a little chance. </p><p>LAYTON: Well, thank you for that and I just wanted to say, Ms. Scanlon, on the point, to let me piggyback on--on Dr. Valletti, he does have a paper looking at the prices for auctions, I think it's very interesting. I'm a person who I manage ten search engine marketers and have experience in this and I think there's a fallacy to think that just because the ad appears at the top of the page and Google search, that it's the highest bid. </p><p>Frequently, the best ad--that is the lowest paid bid because what is driving the price is very much the quality of the ad. It's how well it's written, whether the landing page where the ad goes to is relevant. So what Google is actually rewarding is the quality of advertising and also in it's--it brings an interesting case, a plumbing service wants to create an ad. </p><p>Well, that is also an issue of who amongst the plumbing industry is organized to invest in Google? You have, you know, and it could be there's also reflects that the competition of the plumbing side. And the other part is if you're the consumer, you want to have the information, that ad format actually gives you a lot of things to look at. So I only say that is that it isn't the--the--is not a fact that the highest top level ads pay the most. </p><p>In some fields like asbestos, those keywords could be worth $5,000 a click. The--the plaintiff bar, they're very clever around using that. But there's many other areas that are not used at all and the clicks could be a--a cent. So it's hard to generalize that you have to actually have to look at the data. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And then I'm going to move into something a little different because in your Senate testimony, you stated that GDPR has a risk identifying with respect to convicted felons successfully removing information from crimes and search engines. And your footnote on that stated that the finished Court decision concluded the right to be forgotten provides convicted murderers the right to have a publicly available information removed from Google listings. </p><p>And I'm going to--before I let you answer this for a second, I want to say I support ban the Box, I think it's fantastic I have some thoughts on that when we're done but we also have a First Amendment. So let's take First Amendment issues aside and just can you expound on that a little bit? </p><p>LAYTON: So again, you know, we--we don't translate the GDPR perfectly to the United States for--for those particular reasons but we can and also right to be forgotten has been pushed back by the European courts. But this issue about people being able to expunge data that they don't like, well, you know, maybe it's a nice idea in theory but it--we have in the United States, we have a respect for the public's right to know. </p><p>So for example, what--what you've seen in the European Union are dirty politicians who have that articles about them. They get removed from the media, they get removed from the Google searches; murderers, child predators, you know, all these terrible characters are able to weaponize the GDPR for those reasons. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I think that's one of the things with Ban the Box. We need to understand as members of Congress is that still only gets you past the first stage. And you can ban anything from Google, you can bend it from a Facebook search, but I can tell you my private investigator would find it in three seconds. So if you go into the second stage of an interview and you're doing work for the federal government, you have to have a certain Insurance designation. </p><p>Any--any kind of--as simple as a hazmat commercial driver's license. These are good concepts but I think sometimes we use the available--availability of information as a scapegoat. What we really need--if we're serious about this and I think if you're 19 and have a non-violent felony on your record, the world we live in now compared to two generations ago is so different, you can never outrun that conviction, you just simply can't. If it happened in Dickinson, North Dakota in 1970, you could move to Madison, Wisconsin and start your life over because nobody from Madison, Wisconsin was going to drive at the Stark County Courthouse and look up records. But we use this availability information a little bit as a scapegoat because like I said, any job you're applying for that has any kind of insurance issue, regulatory issue, framework issue is going to find it anyway. </p><p>So we need to address the fact like with companies, with insurance companies say listen, we--we support this from a congressional level and there's broad bipartisan support. We also have to change insurance culture and hiring culture and allowing those things to happen and the fact that it's not--not a Google--doesn't hit on a Google search, it doesn't mean it's not going to exist. </p><p>LAYTON: I agree. </p><p>VALLETTI: Just--I think we are mixing a few things here. One thing is, you know, GDPR, one thing is right to be forgotten. The firt--the first step is for you to understand what you interpret as privacy. These are boundary between your private self and the outside world. What do you think you want to share only with your family, with your community with your friends or not even with them. When it comes to digital space, this idea that there is notice in choice that we have borrowed from other industries is not out there any longer. So these boundaries are so blurred that you must look into that, you must have a recognition of the problem. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I agree with that because when we were talking about opt-in and opt-out, shortly after there was some congressional testimonies before I was here, you started seeing these windows pop up on your social media platform and yes and no. and whenever I talked to a high school or college age group of kids after that happened, I would ask them, did any of you check no? and not as-- </p><p>VALLETTI: Sometimes, you can check no. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: --not a--yeah, but not a sing--I mean, not a single hand goes up. So how people define privacy in the next generation is also something that is changing dramatically. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. I recognize myself for five minutes. I just want to build upon that point that Commissioner Chopra made about this notion of consent would be, you know, trying to find out what you're consenting to would be a full-time job. And I think as it turns out, even if you devoted your time to it as a full-time job, you still would run into the situation which you have these sort of take-it-or-leave-it contracts were basically if you don't agree to a certain amount of collection, you just don't get the service. </p><p>So, you know, the consumer--the user in this context doesn't really have the power even if you devoted full time to navigating and trying to--and you wonder why we don't create the kind of consent we require in most other context. If its medical consent, if it's consent to with drug a not guilty plea and enter a plea in a court, it's the knowing consent, it's actually the person knowing what they're consenting to and affirmatively consenting and why we have allowed the kind of complete turning on its head where everyone is presumed to consent to the total collection of everything about them, unless they can find some way to object to. It's kind of curious. So I think is a really important area for us to look at. </p><p>Dr. Valletti, I want to just turn to you for a moment. Google has two billion users on Android and Facebook has over two and a half billion users. And what we hear very often is that, you know, these services are very popular and people really have no problem with the kind of corporate surveillance in these loose privacy controls and isn't the--the fact that these numbers are so great evidence that there's not really a problem, that the popularity of these services proves that we really don't need to worry about this. What--what do you say to that argument? </p><p>VALLETTI: The services are very popular. It's evident there are very good services, but nobody cares. One of the point I make in my--my written piece is also that consumers are not put in a--in a position to understand what the cost might be because they cannot make comparisons, they don't see where the data is going, we don't know whether something is coming back against, because they just don't know and they cannot make comparisons because there is a lack of competition. </p><p>Going back to your original remark, you are probably aware that earlier this year, Germany had a case against Facebook and this is an appeal in a court now. But they exactly said that--that the consent that the--the customers want to be on Facebook, had to give also to cross link data with WhatsApp and Instagram which belong to the same a company. They said you didn't tell them what you--what we are going to do you cannot do it unless you inform them in some appropriate way. And if you do not--if they don't consent--you cannot deny access to the service to Facebook because you don't need that concern--that--that consent to supply the primary service. </p><p>CICILLINE: Right, thank you. In July, as part of this investigation Google testified before this subcommittee that it poses--it faces and I quote \"formidable competition around the world.\" Google stated that users can choose from a menu of search providers including Bing, DuckDuckGo and Yahoo. </p><p>Dr. Valletti, in light of your work of the European Commission, do you agree that there is intense competition in online search, whether it be in Europe or in the United States? </p><p>VALLETTI: That's a general statement. It's a very general statement. So I will be more precise when it comes to say general search, this competition is not there in--in Europe 93 percent of European searches are done by a once search engine and this possibility that consumer have to--to do something else to change the default, to change the preinstall menu, all these behavioral biases we already mentioned several times, they are there they are clear in the data I do see people actually speaking on all the time and never changing the default. </p><p>CICILLINE: Dr. Furman, I--I have a couple questions to you. So you can respond to that quickly. </p><p>FURMAN: --that's--what--one quick point to add, you wouldn't, Google wouldn't pay so much money to be the default search engine on things like iOS if it was really easy for consumers to switch. </p><p>CICILLINE: Right. And so, Dr. Furman, what role do you think information asymmetries play and how we should understand digital markets. Corporations routinely have more information than regulators and the public but digital platforms seem to enjoy an astronomical advantage. How should this affect antitrust enforcement and competition policy if at all? </p><p>FURMAN: First of all, I think the enforcers need more resources. The CMA in the UK has actually created a digital unit with excellent staff in terms of data analytics and the like. And we also need to design policies around data openness that reduce some of that asymmetry between some of the big platforms, their competitors and the public and--and regulators. </p><p>CICILLINE: I think many of you have made this point. Competition and privacy can be compliments such that more competition can incentivize firms to provide users with more privacy. But they can also be at odds such as that encouraging interoperability and data portability could expose user data to a broader set of corporations. So how should enforces and policy makers particularly Congress strike this balance. </p><p>FURMAN: I think the answer to that is going to be on a case-by-case basis. First of all, as you said, a lot of cases they really are complements, a lot of cases only one of them is implicated, the other one barely is. But you need to have both objectives. You can't just think about privacy completely ignore competition and you can't just think about competition and completely ignore privacy. That's part of why you would want to establish a unit of body regulator something that would have both of those objectives. </p><p>CICILLINE: I'd want to know if any of you had wanted to respond to any of what I've asked. Okay, good. </p><p>CHOPRA: Mr. Chairman, which I would just add that when there's so few dominant players, that opens up more abuses of privacy and I'm worried that our economy in this sphere is just drifting toward the Chinese model where there's just massive amount of information on people collected without their consent and can be used to manipulate. And I--I just reject this argument that if we want to compete with China, we need to have our companies look like them. The beauty of our country is when new entrants come in and challenge the dominant ones. I--I just don't want that system. </p><p>CICILLINE: I agree. At this time, I'd ask unanimous consent that the following statements be introduced in the record or written statement from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair, Rod Sims, discussing his investigation into the digital platforms. Without objection. A written statement from Dina Srinivasan, discussing the intersection of competition and privacy, without objection. </p><p>A letter from Consumer Reports detailing their priorities and examined data and privacy in competition. Objection. Written statement from Murray Stuckey (SP) and Ariel (SP), the digital platform economy's effects on antitrust and privacy policy without objection and a statement from the European Union Commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, with her expertise on the digital economy. Without objection. </p><p>And with that, I will conclude the hearing with gratitude for our extraordinary witnesses and thank you for being here today and for contributing significantly to our ongoing investigation. And with that, the committee's adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB9-DP61-F15W-H02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

DOUG COLLINS (R-GA.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: The subcommittee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recess of the committee at any time. We welcome everyone to today's hearing on Diagnosing the Problem, Exploring the Effects of Consolidation and Anti-Competitive Conduct in Healthcare Markets. </p><p>I want to thank our witnesses for being here. And I also want to say that it is our first meeting of this subcommittee and I particularly want to acknowledge the presence of the Ranking Member, Jim Sensenbrenner, who I look forward to continuing to work with, who has done a lot of important work in this--the jurisdiction of this subcommittee and will bring great wisdom to our collective effort.  </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: If you say so. </p><p>CICILLINE: Yes, absolutely, without objection. Our healthcare system is in a state of crisis. The cost of prescription medicine has increased by 200 percent over the past decade. Americans spend roughly $1,200 on average on prescription drugs every year, which is more than people in any other country. </p><p>The average cost of a hospital stay for a child with cancer is $40,000. The price for many types of organ transplants and post-operation treatment is more than a million dollars. Even a short ambulance ride to the hospital without medical care may cost patients thousands of dollars. These outrageous, unsustainable and immoral costs are ruining lives. Prices are skyrocketing and people dying or bankrupted as a result.  </p><p>Kaiser Health reports that a quarter of Americans cannot afford their medicine while many, and I quote, \"Cancer patients are delaying care, cutting their pills in half or skipping drug treatment entirely\" end quote. Despite decades of rising costs, the United States ranks dead last in health outcomes among other high-income countries.  </p><p>And for too many Americans, it is a dark reality that the life of a loved one depends on whether or not they can raise enough money on a crowd funding platform to pay for treatment before it's too late. Faced with no other options, Americans are left to plead to strangers for help to keep their loved ones alive. This must end.  </p><p>The American people deserve a government that is in their corner fighting for them to take on drug profiteering and other barriers to affordable healthcare. Ending this moral crisis is a stop priority of mine as chairman of the Anti-trust subcommittee and a top priority for House democrats to keep our promise to work for the people and to make healthcare affordable for everyone. </p><p>Our competition system is the backbone of promising--of promoting open and fair markets. This competition is absolutely essential in the healthcare markets. For drug prices, the entry of generic drug competitors can reduce the cost of branded drugs significantly. In hospital and health insurance markets, consolidation threatens the quality and affordability of care. But, in too many cases, effectively anti-trust enforcement takes far too long to deliver meaningful results to people in need. </p><p>For example, some branded drug companies have abused safety protocols to thwart agencies--to thwart generics and to preserve their monopoly power for more than a decade. As Professor Robin Feldman has noted, even months of delay could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in additional monopoly revenues as the generic sits on the sideline.  </p><p>While this anti-competitive conduct should violate the anti-trust laws, even successful cases are often too time consuming to provide effective relief as the Federal Trade Commission testified before the subcommittee last Congress. And that's why I've introduced the CREATES Act with Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and Collins to end these delay tactics.  </p><p>The CREATES Act establishes a tailored path for generic drug manufacturers to bring low-cost drugs to market. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will result in nearly $4 billion in federal savings, along with an additional $5.4 billion in savings for consumers according to private estimates. It's also imperative that we examine, address other anti-competitive tactics that lead to higher drug prices.  </p><p>Last week the FTC settled a complaint against a drug company for paying off its competitor to keep out of the marketplace. According to a 2010 report by the Commission, this type of conduct also called a pay for delay settlement, costs about $3.5 billion per year in the form of higher drug prices. But this settlement occurred nearly 7 years after the Supreme Court's landmark decision and Actavis where it held that these settlements risk significantly anti-competitive effects and more than ten years after the FTC originally filed this complaint.  </p><p>It is unacceptable that it took a full decade to address this abuse of our patent system. Moreover, this egregious behavior is still taking place today. As Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School noted in his testimony before the subcommittee last Congress, corporations continue to engage in pay for delay settlements in the wake of Actavis decision driving up the cost of prescription drugs.  </p><p>I look forward to working with Chairman Nadler and Senators Klobuchar and Grassley on legislation to confront and reverse this problem. In closing, today's hearing is an important opportunity to examine other competitive threats that raise costs, lower quality and reduce choice in healthcare markets. It is my hope that our discussion today can focus on continuing our work to diagnose the problems associated with consolidation and anti-competitive conduct in healthcare markets, as well as finding solutions to provide a better deal for hardworking Americans on prescription drugs and other healthcare costs. </p><p>I thank our extraordinarily esteemed members--who are witnesses today for appearing before the subcommittee. And it is now my great pleasure to recognize the Ranking Member of the subcommittee, Mr. Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.  </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank you and extend a warm welcome to all my colleagues, our witnesses and the audience members. It's a pleasure to begin the subcommittee's proceedings for this term of Congress. And I look forward to working with Chairman Cicilline to accomplish as much as we can together to meet the needs of the American people.   </p><p>Today's hearing focuses on the issues of vital importance. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Americans' spending on healthcare now accounts for 17.8 percent of the United States' GDP, that's over $3.6 trillion or over $10,000 per person. These astronomical costs are the result of many factors. Lurking always is the misguided Obamacare legislation, sold as a mean that protects patients and make healthcare affordable. It has produced just the opposite, rising costs, loss of doctors and insurance policies and increasingly monopolized hospital and insurance markets in states and counties all across the nation.  </p><p>Today's hearing offers us a chance to focus on some of the other important factors in the healthcare cost problems. These include obstacles to patients' access to low cost generic drugs, anti-competitive practices engaged by pharmacy benefit managers and rising consolidation in hospital and insurance markets.  </p><p>To help tackle the first of these problems, Chairman Cicilline and I have introduced in the first weeks of this Congress, the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act, a mouthful, also known as the CREATES Act. Our bill is strong and bipartisan legislation that will defer branded pharmaceutical companies from manipulating test sample availability to block cheaper generic alternatives from obtaining FDA approval and entering the marketplace.  </p><p>The CREATES Act will lead to lower cost for patients by assuring that they have faster access to safe and effective FDA approved generic drugs. The CBO has estimated that our bill would produce a multi-billion dollar decrease in the federal deficit. Savings to consumers and private insurers will likely be greater than that amount.  </p><p>I look forward to hearing the witnesses' testimony on the CREATES Act and other important issues the subcommittee will examine today. And I would like unanimous consent to insert into the record at this point a statement by the National Community Pharmacists Association statement for the record. And also, Pharma's statement to the House of Representatives on the topic of this hearing today.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you to the Ranking Member. And, now, it is my pleasure to recognize the Chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, for his opening statement. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Judiciary Committee has a strong tradition of bipartisan efforts to promote competition in healthcare markets. Particularly with respect to helping to make prescription drugs and other healthcare services more affordable through the full benefits of competition. Over the past several years the subcommittee has held numerous hearings in this area, examining the topics of consolidation in the market for health insurance, competition in the drug supply chain and anti-competitive practices by prescription drug companies. </p><p>It is essential that we continue this important work through today's hearing and throughout this congress as we seek to provide meaningful relief to Americans who struggle every day with the high cost of medicine, insurance premiums and hospital bills.  </p><p>Today, one quarter of Americans report that it is difficult to afford their medicine, one quarter. Exorbitant medical bills is one of the major causes of why Americans seek bankruptcy relief. It is painfully clear that the soaring cost of healthcare are bad for the health and wellbeing of American families. It is unacceptable that seniors cannot afford the arthritis medication they need to perform everyday tasks such as buttoning their coats or opening a jar without excruciating pain.  </p><p>It is unacceptable that hundreds of thousands of cancer patients are reportedly delaying lifesaving care, cutting their pills in half or skipping drug treatment entirely because of high drug prices. And it is unacceptable that those suffering from diabetes have to worry about the life-threatening consequences of not able to--being able to afford insulin because of its unaffordable costs.  </p><p>Last week, when confronted with the facts surrounding skyrocketing prescription drug prices, the executives of seven major drug manufacturers responded by pointing fingers somewhere else, including insurers and pharmacy benefits managers. But, as many experts have noted, including some of the witnesses who will testify here today, the lack of competition in healthcare markets is one of the primary causes of escalating costs.  </p><p>In fact, the CEOs of some major drug companies acknowledge that--acknowledge that competition plays a key role in driving down prices. For example, one testified just last week that, quote, \"competition is a key component to reducing costs\" close quote. But, frankly, we didn't need him to tell us that, Louis Brandeis told us that a long time ago.  </p><p>The significance of competition from lower priced generic drugs in particular cannot be overstated. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the first generic competitor's product is typically offered at a price 20 percent to 30 percent below the branded product's price. Subsequent generic entry creates greater price competition with price drops reaching 85 percent or more off the brand price. Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office reported in 2010 that the retail price of a generic is 75 percent lower on average, 75 percent, than the retail price of a brand name drug.  </p><p>In response to the threat of generic entry, which, of course, threatens the ability of branded drug companies to charge monopoly prices, these companies, or some of them, have engaged in numerous anti-competitive tactics. This committee has been and will continue to be active in stopping drug companies from reaping monopoly profits at the expense of the health of working American families.  </p><p>For example, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of HR 965, the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or the CREATES Act. This bipartisan legislation introduced last month by subcommittee Chairman Cicilline and Ranking Member Sensenbrenner seeks to remove an obstacle to generic competition by making it easier for generic drug companies to obtain the samples they need to enter the marketplace.  </p><p>Another concern involves so-called pay for delay settlements, which occur when a branded drug firm pays a potential generic competitor to abandon a patent challenge and thereby delay entering the market with a lower cost generic product. These agreements can be a win for both drug companies. The brand name drug company gets to keep its monopoly and the generic gets paid off with a portion of the monopoly profits. But, consumers lose.  </p><p>According to an FDC study, pay for delay agreements are estimated to cost American consumers $3.5 billion per year, $35 billion over the decade from 2010 to 2020. That is why I plan to introduce bipartisan legislation this Congress to help end pay for delay settlements. As we all know, a lack of competition and anti-competitive conduct is not just limited to the pharmaceutical marketplace. These problems show up in hospital markets as well.  </p><p>For example, it is well documented that hospital mergers can lead to higher prices and lower quality of care. Hospital consolidation also results in fewer options for patients. This is especially harmful for expecting mothers or women seeking reproductive health services who depend on a full range of options for care. And maybe faced by a regional hospital that doesn't give full--a full range of options.  </p><p>I hope that our discussion today will continue our bipartisan work to diagnose the problems associated with consolidation and anti-competitive conduct in healthcare markets, as well as break new ground on confronting the harmful effects of hospital consolidation.  </p><p>According to that, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. I thank them for their participation. And I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. Now I'm pleased to recognize the Ranking Member of the full committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins, for his opening statement.  </p><p>COLLINS: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline and Ranking Member--Member Sensenbrenner for holding this hearing. I'd also like to thank both of you for the works on the CREATES Act and I believe this legislation is a good starting point. And I look forward to continuing to work with both of you to ultimately get this bill signed into law this term.  </p><p>Over the past decade, consolidation across healthcare and prescription drug markets have been rapidly increasing. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the pharmacy benefit manager marketplace. PBM's in theory should bring down the costs for consumers. However, they're not doing that. They're only three major PBM companies and they control 85 percent of the marketplace, which yields each company a great deal of power. And these companies have consolidated horizontally, as well as vertically as they go forward and they have merged vertically with major pharmacies and health insurers. That means patients' insurers has financial incentives to push the patients toward their pharmacies.  </p><p>This consolidation has enabled PBMs to engage in anti-competitive behavior by targeting competing pharmacies with unfair audits and unreimbursement. These audits provide PBMs with the pharmacies' acquisition costs and patient data. PBMs then use this data to steer patients to their own pharmacies and reimburse competitive pharmacies at a much lower rate. This results in PBMs lining their own wallets. It harms community pharmacists who have decided--have to decide between losing money and filling a prescription or losing customers to big box pharmacies owned by PBMs.  </p><p>If you look at Ohio, CVS and OptumRx charged that state more than $400 million more than they paid out to pharmacies. It is just amazing to me that we will continue to turn an eye and not have the discussion. If we wanted to lower drug costs in this country right now, start with the PBM's, start right where they're at. I've been talking about this for six years. I just laid it out. They're going full throttle trying to kill independent pharmacists and pharmacies in our communities. They offer little more than anecdotal evidences of saving money. In fact, when others have actually--states such as Texas and companies such as Caterpillar and others have actually went away from their PBM system, they saved money. PBMs, it's just amazing, have immense control over patient formularies, allowing them to push patients to high cost medications because these medications give the PBM higher rebates.  </p><p>As a result, PBM's increase patient co-pays and incentivize manufacturers to increase drug costs to pay PBM's higher rebate demands. So, PBM's are actually costing patients money. PBM's role as intermediaries also allows them to extract rebates and price concessions for competing pharmacies and manufacturers without passing them on to the patients. </p><p>You know what's really interesting about them? I've been talking about this six years. I've never had a PBM come in and deny what I'm saying, never. They just don't like the way I talk about them. They don't care that their practices are bad. They just don't like that I call them for it. It's amazing. This lack of transparency and the price concessions are often withheld from patients and payers and increasing PBM profits while following--failing to decrease to drug costs.  </p><p>I recently introduced a legislation called the Fair Pricing Act with Representative Gonzales from Texas--a democrat from Texas and also Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana. This legislation will require PBM's to pass pharmacy rebates and price concessions on to patients at the point of sale. That will save patients an estimated $9.2 billion over the next 10 years. Key provisions for my legislation are also included in the proposed rule from the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.   </p><p>Additionally, states across the country, including my home state of Georgia, have realized this lack of transparency in the marketplace. And legislators are passing laws requiring transparency for PBM's regarding the rebates price concession they're receiving from pharmacies and manufacturers. These laws aim to ensure that patients are receiving and seeing the savings PBM's claim to be offering and negotiated on their behalf.  </p><p>I do want to--Mr. Chairman, about another issue that is dear, especially in Georgia, and that's hospital consolidation that the full committee chairman also talked about in rural communities. These communities often already have few options for quality care, so a hospital consolidation is increased over the past ten years rural communities, like my own, have been hurt the most.  </p><p>At times these mergers and acquisitions can help rural communities by keeping facilities open. But they often--they result in full or partial closures and shifting patients from nearby facilities to those hours away. This doesn't benefit patients. Instead it hurts them because they're unable to receive the lifesaving treatment they need. In some areas of my state we have seen mergers limit emergency care, increase patient travel time by hours. Imagine if a woman has--was in difficult labor, but had to travel hours to a healthcare facility. These changes can literally mean the difference in life and death. </p><p>I've also seen hospitals acquire other pharmacy and physician practices in their area to steer patients away from their competitors. I'm concerned that these practices will result in fewer options for patients, higher costs and a lower quality of care. I want to commend this subcommittee for reviewing the consolidation to anti-competitive practices across the healthcare marketplace. And I'm looking forward to working with the chairman on others on this across the aisle to find real solutions because we must decrease the cost of our healthcare and prescription drugs while increasing patients' access to the best care possible. And that means taking a look at everything on the table. And it is time the pharmacy benefit managers realize your time of terrorizing this marketplace is over.  </p><p>And with that, I yield back, chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Collins. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's witnesses.  </p><p>Our first witness on today's panel is Dr. Fiona Scott Morton, the Theodore Nierenberg Professor of Economics at Yale University School of Management. Dr. Scott Morton is a nationally recognized as a leading scholar on issues of competition and has published articles that range widely across industries and leading economic journals. From 2011 to 2012 she served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economics at the Anti-Trust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice where she helped enforce the nation's anti-trust laws. Dr. Scott Morton received her BA from Yale and her PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Welcome. </p><p>Our next witness is Michael Kades, the Director of Markets and Competition Policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Prior to joining Equitable Growth, Mr. Kades served as the Anti-trust counsel for Senator Amy Klobuchar. And before that, as an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission for 20 years. His work on anti-competitive pharmaceutical patent settlements led to the commission's victory before the Supreme Court in FTC vs. Actavis. During his time at the commission he was also an attorney advisor to Chairman Jon Leibowitz and the Deputy Trial Counsel. Prior to working at the commission, Mr. Kades clerked for the Honorable John Reynolds at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin and is a graduate of Yale University and the University of Wisconsin Law School. </p><p>Our third witness is Dr. Martin Gaynor, the E.J. Barone Professor of Economics and Health Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Dr. Gaynor is widely recognized as a leading scholar on competition and, in particular, the study of consolidation and market power within hospital markets and healthcare systems. Dr. Gaynor previously served as the Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Economics and is a research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He received his BA from the University of California San Diego and his PhD in Economics from Northwestern University.  </p><p>Our final witness at today's hearing is Dr. Craig Garthwaite, the Herman Smith Research Professor in Hospital and Health Service and the Director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Dr. Garthwaite's research examines the effects of government policies with a focus on health and biopharmaceutical sectors. He's appeared as a guest on various television and radio shows, such as MPR Marketplace. And has appeared in journals like the American Economic Review and Health Affairs. Dr. Garthwaite received his BA and Masters in Public Policy from the University of Michigan and his PhD in Economics from the University of Maryland.  </p><p>So, we welcome all of the distinguished witnesses and thank them very much for participating in today's hearing. Now, if you would please rise, I will begin our hearing by administering the oath and swearing you in. </p><p>Please raise your right hands. Do you swear our affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you're about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information and belief, so help you God? </p><p>The record should reflect that the witnesses answered in the affirmative. You may be seated. Thank you very much.  </p><p>Please note that each of your written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety.  Accordingly, I ask that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. To help you stay within that time, there's a timing light on your table. When the light switches from green to yellow you have about a minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red it signals that your five minutes has expired and I would ask you to please conclude.  </p><p>And we'll begin with Dr. Scott Morton. If you'd just hit the button so we can--okay. </p><p>MORTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to testify. Today in the United States we are choosing to use the private sector to provide healthcare without establishing enough rules to ensure competition. The result is that we have providers who are profit seeking and without the restraint imposed by competition.  </p><p>My belief is that we--if we do not fix this that the ever-increasing costs are going to lead to a different kind of a solution, which is just price regulation by the government. That's not my preferred solution. I think markets would be much better. But, they have to be working markets. It's not obvious that price regulation would be worse than unrestrained private monopolies, which is what we are faced with today. </p><p>As you'll hear from the other members on my table, is that we have good news. High prices in many areas of pharmaceutical and medical care are imminently fixable. It is not rocket science what we're gonna tell you. There's a great of evidence about how to bring down these prices.  </p><p>The bad news is that the providers, whose prices will come down should they face vigorous competition, are going to lobby for any--against any changes in the law and historically have been very successful at doing that. For the conservatives in the room, if you claim to like markets and you like market solutions over government, this is what you're going to hear today. I think all of us want markets, but we want working markets, ones that enable competition.  </p><p>I have two main points to discuss from my testimony. The first is the area of biologics and physician administered drugs. This is the area with the most growth currently. These are very high-priced products. They're growing very quickly, both in terms of price and in terms of quantity. We procure these drugs primarily through the Part B program, as well as on the commercial side. This is run quite differently from Part D. Part D, like dog, okay, that's the one where we outsource to private insurance companies who have a formulary. And they bargain and get low prices. Part B, like boy, that's the one where we do nothing. We allow the manufacturer to announce a price and then the government pays that, okay? So, it's not really very surprising that it's only 18 percent of GDP we spend on healthcare. It probably should be more.  </p><p>So, why--what's the restraint? Well, the manufacturer does have to sell on the commercial marketplace and as prices get higher that gets difficult. But, there is no restraint on the government side. So, this is something that Congress should fix. We should be procuring Part B drugs in a way that's competitive. One way to do that would be to change the system of J Codes. Currently if there's a branded product that's a biologic and biosimilars enter each of those manufacturers gets their own reference price, their own J Code.  </p><p>So, if the brand costs $1,000 and the biosimilar cost $600, a doctor that dispenses the biosimilar gets paid $600, plus a markup and the one that chooses the brand gets paid $1,000 plus a markup. If we had one payment for all the drugs that are the same, all the same molecule, then the branded drug would have to come down or else the doctors would all pick the biosimilar because they would be being reimbursed at $600. They would not choose to buy a $1,000 drug.  </p><p>That same principle works in other areas. We, for a brief while, had a least cost alternative in the area of prostate drugs. That caused doctors to go out and actually seek the lowest cost therapy in that class. And the result of that was such good competition that the brands in question sued the government and--over the fact that the government, the CMS, did not have the authority to procure drugs in that competitive a manner. And they won.  </p><p>So, it would be useful if Congress would enable the government to procure drugs in that cost-effective manner. </p><p>My second point is about consumer out of pocket costs. These have gotten very high with the popularity of high deductible plans. When you have an out of pocket cost that's based on the list price of the drug this generates kind of negative insurance. You buy insurance and instead of paying market price for the drug, let's say $300, you pay list price for the drug, $600. So, you're getting the opposite of what insurance is supposed to do, which is to smooth these financial shocks when you get sick. </p><p>The HHS solution, which makes consumers' out of pocket cost depend on the net price. I think something like that is a good idea. It could either be the true net price. It could be some well-defined average to make the net price continue to be confidential, which is very important for getting low prices in general or it could just be below, equal to or below the net price. So, that a plan could choose to have a $50 out of pocket cost and we would never know what the net price was. And that would also be fine.  </p><p>The important thing about this solution that HHS has come up with is that it does--it's going to restrain competition between manufacturers. I believe this is why manufacturers are in favor of this rule because it's not going to intensify price competition. It's gonna lessen price competition.  </p><p>Why? Because there won't be able to be performance-based rebates where a plan says I will deliver you a high market share from drug A to drug B. and drug B says okay, if you deliver that high market share I'm willing to sell to you at a low price. We don't know until the end of the year if the market share gets delivered and, therefore, what the price should be. </p><p>So, there needs to be built in to whatever the safe harbor is, the ability for the plan to negotiate that way with the manufacturer, get extract a really low price. And then--sorry, I'll stop. And then deliver that to the patient. So, that's key. </p><p>CICILLINE: Great, thank you so much, doctor. I'll now recognize doctor--Mr. Kades for five minutes. </p><p>KADES: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline and Ranking Members Sensenbrenner and full committee--oh, Mr. Nadler stepped out. So, I guess I'll start with Ranking Member, Sensenbrenner, just for the record-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Mr. Kades, sir, could you just pull your microphone closer to you so folks can hear it. Yeah. </p><p>KADES: So, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, I just want to state for the record I was born and raised in Beloit, Wisconsin, fairly close to your fifth district. And when you've said Wisconsin, you've said it all.  </p><p>It is an honor to testify before this subcommittee on competition and prescription drug prices. This issue is vital to the healthcare system and effects all Americans. I am Michael Kades, the Director of Market and Competition Policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. We seek to advance evidence-based ideas and policies that promote strong, stable and broad-based economic growth. </p><p>The exploitation of monopoly power is the kind of inequality that is at the core of the most important challenges that our economy and nation face. Prescription drug costs are, and continue to be, a burden. In 2017 the United States spent $333 billion on prescription drugs. That's over $2,600 per family. Three out of ten Americans are not taking prescription as directed because of costs. So, this isn't just about money, it's about people's health and wellbeing.  </p><p>No silver bullet exists to ensuring prescription medicine is affordable. It requires a broad range of policies. But, increased competition should be part of the answer. Stopping anti-competitive conduct will both lower prices and promote innovation. For 20 years at the Federal Trade Commission I was on the front lines of what has been and continues to be a never-ending struggle to protect competition in pharmaceutical markets.  </p><p>I litigated and investigated dozens of pharmaceutical anti-trust matters and I'm here to tell you the system is broken. The incentives of anti-competitive activity in these markets is substantial. For example, delaying competition on a blockbuster drug for just a year can mean hundreds of million, if not billions of dollars in additional profit. The anti-trust laws should stand a bulwark against anti-competitive conduct. Unfortunately, courts have stripped those laws of their potency, narrowing the scope of the law an imposing ever higher burdens of proof.  </p><p>Easy cases have become hard and hard cases escape condemnation. Companies have been bold and to push the limits of business conduct because the rewards are great and the risks are minimal. Even if they get caught, the penalties are low.  </p><p>The result, consumers pay hundreds, if not thousands of dollars more each month for their prescriptions. I want to focus on three practical policies that would help focus competition in the pharmaceutical markets, which this committee can work on this year. </p><p>First, pass the CREATES Act. Chairman and Ranking Member Cicilline--Sensenbrenner, Nadler and Collins, this bill--this obviously bipartisan, but which is also a bicameral supported bill, could stop one of the most egregious strategies that limits competition. </p><p>Sometimes it's hard to explain. I like to put it down into one simple phrase, no samples, no competition. This is gonna break that chain and you will save billions of dollars for the government and American citizens. </p><p>Second, pass legislation to stop branded companies paying generic companies not to compete in the marketplace. What is called a pay for delay patent settlement. Despite the Supreme Court's clear signal that these deals can be anti-competitive, the FTC is expends substantial resources challenging clear anti-trust violations.  </p><p>Chairman Cicilline, you refer to the Activist case, which just got settled. When that case was filed my daughter was learning how to read. She's coming from her spring break--spring break of her first year of college. That's how long it took to get a resolution of that case. That's too long. </p><p>Enacting a law with clear standards, such as the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act would deter this practice and free up limited resources to attack other anti-competitive conduct.  </p><p>Third, made bad actors pay a real penalty. The key to deterring anti-competitive conduct is that when somebody violates the law they shouldn't benefit from it. In the anti-trust--in the world of anti-trust lawyers, we call this disgorgement. You make them give up their profits.  But, even in this area, the federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals just last week, ignoring 35 years of precedent, clipped the ability of the FTC to obtain this type of--this type of relief.  </p><p>This Congress should modify the Federal Trade Commission Act to clarify explicitly that the FTC can obtain this type of relief. It's critical to deterring highly probable--profitable, I'm sorry, anti-competitive conduct.  </p><p>Thank you and I look forward to listen to your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Kades. I recognize Dr. Gaynor for five minutes. </p><p>GAYNOR: Thank you. Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and members of the subcommittee, thank you for holding a hearing on this vitally important topic and for giving me the opportunity to testify in front of you today. </p><p>The focus of my testimony is on healthcare, hospitals, doctors, insurers, which collectively account for almost 60 percent of all of U.S. healthcare spending. Over the next few minutes I'll briefly summarize for the committee the basic facts about healthcare markets, the considerable research evidence on competition in healthcare and my views on steps that can be taken to help make these markets work for the benefit of consumers. </p><p>Healthcare is a very large and important sector of our economy. Not only is it almost one-fifth of the entire economy, there's a critical impact on our health and well-being. Our healthcare system is based on markets. That system is only going to work as well as the markets that underpin it. Unfortunately, these markets do not function as well as they could or should.  </p><p>Prices are high and rising. There are egregious pricing practices. Quality is suboptimal and the sector is sluggish and unresponsive. In contrast to the innovation and dynamism that characterize much of the rest of our economy. </p><p>Lack of competition has a lot to do with these problems. There has been a great deal of consolidation in healthcare. There've been nearly 1,600 hospital mergers in the past 20 years. The result is the majority of local areas are now dominated by one large powerful healthcare system, such as Pittsburg, my home by University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; Boston by Partners; San Francisco Bay area by Sutter. </p><p>The same is true of health insurance markets. The two largest insurers have 70 percent of the market and over one half of all local insurance markets. Physician services markets have also become increasingly more concentrated. Two thirds of specialist physician markets are concentrated and 29 percent for primary care physicians.  </p><p>Moreover, there were nearly 31,000 physician practice acquisitions by hospitals from 2008 to 2012. And about a third, at least a third, of all doctors are now in hospital owned practices. This massive consolidation in healthcare has not delivered for Americans. It has not given us better care or enhanced efficiency. On the contrary, extensive research evidence shows us that consolidation between close competitors results in higher prices and patient quality of care suffers from lack of competition.  </p><p>Moreover, competition effects the form of payment. Hospitals with fewer competitors negotiate more favorable forms of payment and reject those they dislike. This poses a serious challenge for payment reform. Hospital mergers can also harm competition and labor markets. They can depress wages, distort hiring decisions and harm incentives for investment in human capital.  </p><p>Recent evidence shows impacts of hospital mergers consistent with these concerns. There are also concerns about anti-competitive conduct. Firms who've acquired market power want to keep it. Some dominant health systems have been using restrictive contracts with insurers to try and hamper the free flow of patients to competitors thereby harming competition and enhancing their market power.  </p><p>There are extensive reports of health systems engaging in data blocking, impeding the flow of patient information to providers outside the system. This has the potential to harm competition by making it more difficult for patients to switch providers. Now, that most hospital markets are dominated by one large health system there is considerable potential for this kind of conduct seriously harming competition. All of this is causing serious harm to patients and to the healthcare system as a whole.  </p><p>Policies are needed to support and promote competition in healthcare markets. These include ending policies that unintentionally incentivize consolidation. Ending policies that impede new competitors and impede competition. Focusing and strengthening anti-trust enforcement, particular giving the DOJ and FTC resources so that not only can they do more enforcement in existing areas, but can proactively invest to address new and developing issues. Permit the FTC to enforce against anti-competitive conduct by not for profits. Permit the FTC to use its Section 6B authority to study the insurance industry. Require simple reporting of small transactions that fall below the Hart-Scott-Rodino reporting requirements so the enforcement agencies can track physician practice mergers, they currently can't, and hospital acquisitions of physician practices.  </p><p>Study vertical aspects of hospital physician acquisitions and develop theory and evidence on competitive impacts. Study anti-competitive conduct and develop theories and evidence. And, last, consider legislation to alter the anti-trust laws specifically changing the standard plaintiffs have to meet and changing criteria to be met for presumption of harm to competition. </p><p>Thank you very much. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Dr. Gaynor. I now recognize Dr. Garthwaite for five minutes. </p><p>GARTHWAITE: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline and Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and members of the committee for holding a hearing examining the role of competition in healthcare. I'm here today to talk about why markets can work in healthcare with a particular focus on the pharmaceutical sector. I've prepared a longer written statement outlining more specific details that I've submitted to the committee. </p><p>Unlike most other developed countries, the United States primarily relies on lightly regulated and private markets for the provision of healthcare services. This choice makes sense because private firms respond to market incentives and create products and services that maximize welfare, either by lowering cost or by increasing quality. In this way the profit seeking motives of private firms benefit society in ways that even the most benevolent government entities cannot.  </p><p>Optimal healthcare policy then harnesses these market forces while maintaining no illusions about the motivations of the firms we employ to efficiently provide these goods and services. However, relying on the private market for the provision of such a vital set of goods and services requires recognizing two key facts. First, healthcare markets, like any other markets, can fail. And, second, all markets require vigilant protection of the structures and institutions that support robust and vigorous competition.  </p><p>Complicating matters is the uniquely public private nature of the U.S. healthcare system where even government financed social insurance and medical services are increasing the domain of private firms reacting to these market incentives. I think the benefit of the markets are clear, I fear there are a number of areas where a combination of both market structure and poorly developed regulations limit the ability of the market to deliver its most efficient outcome.  </p><p>There are many areas of healthcare where this is true, which other witnesses have already testified to. Today I'll concentrate my remarks on pharmaceutical markets, a sector that generates meaningful value, but all too often attracts the eye of policy makers and the general public.  </p><p>It's not surprising that such negative attention is focused on pharm--on the pharmaceutical sector. Certainly, some of this is a result of bad actors by some industry participants. But, poor behavior is hardly unique to this sector. Far more is about the simple fact that the products are sold for many multiples of marginal costs. However, claims that these prices solely represent corporate greed ignore the vital societal tradeoff where we accept limited access to drugs from high prices today in order to provide incentives for the development of new and innovative products in the future. </p><p>That said, our goal is not to give firms unlimited profits. But instead to provide a time limited period of increased market power in order to encourage innovative firms to make the necessary investments. During this time period of exclusivity, we want to ensure that firms offering therapeutic substitutes still compete for patients. And, therefore, the greatest profits go to the firms that have the most uniquely valuable products.  </p><p>Following exclusivity, welfare is then maximized by a robust and competitive generic market. Today I'll briefly highlight some specific proposals I believe sensibly address these concerns. The first set of proposals are for generic markets. First, as Mr. Kades said, Congress should immediately pass the CREATES Act in order to facilitate the availability of necessary product samples for potential generic entrance. Second, Congress should authorize regulators to investigate the abuse of citizen petitions, which artificially delay the entry of generic competitors.  </p><p>Third, Congress should create a new form of generic exclusivity targeting molecules with small patient populations. Markets that are too small to attract multiple competitors allow incumbent firms to set prices as natural monopolists. This was most apparent in the case of Martin Shkreli in Turing pharmaceuticals, but this practice is now widespread across many firms.  </p><p>The FDA should create an RFP process where firms can apply to be the sole supplier of these small markets at a fixed margin over production costs.  </p><p>The next proposals are for the branded market where policies should facilitate robust competition between therapeutic substitutes. This competition currently takes the forms of rebates negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs. While confidential rebates have become a much-maligned part of the system, they're actually a vital component that results in large discounts. When rebates are confidential firms are more willing to give large discounts in the first place and less able to tacitly collude on high prices.  </p><p>That said, there are some improvements that can be made to the rebate system and I'd highlight two particular suggestions. First, we must provide a means of passing along the rebates to consumers at the point of sale. A way that supports competition and confidentiality while restoring the insurance benefit to these sick patients. This can be accomplished by basing cost sharing, not on the list price of the drug, but on some other discounted price such as the average cost across payers for the molecule.  </p><p>Second, we must provide the structure to ensure that PBM's act as good agents for their payers. Currently many policy makers are worried this is not occurring. In particular they're worried that PBM's are capturing an inappropriately large amount of the discounts that are provided by the manufacturers. In order to improve competition, I propose, along with Dr. Scott Morton, that we increase the amount of information payers have about the money flowing between PBMs and manufacturers.  </p><p>For example, Congress could ban payments directly between PBMs and manufacturers and require all discounts and fees be paid first to the final payer. Payers and PBMs could then negotiate about a deficient distribution of that surplus.  </p><p>While I understand the temptation to abandon markets in the favor of our greatest use of government purchasing power and regulated prices, such policies are short-sided and they ultimately throw the baby out with the bathwater. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, doctor. Thank you to all of our witnesses for your opening statements. We will now proceed under the five-minute rule with questions. And I'll begin by recognizing the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank the witnesses for your appearance today. Drug place prices are rising every day and the burden is being felt most acutely at the lowest level, the consumer. Yes, this problem is complex and unwieldy and with a variety of competing interests. And it seems that these competing interests threaten any incentive to keep costs down. Lack of competition in the market is driving prices up and every day Americans are paying a higher and higher amount for lifesaving medications. </p><p>Mrs. Morton, do you believe that the American government is utilizing our anti-trust protections in the drug pricing chain properly? </p><p>MORTON: No.  </p><p>JOHNSON: Why do you think anti-trust enforcement has weakened? </p><p>MORTON: That's a--the answer to that is probably longer than we have time today. but, Mr. Kades' remarks about the CREATES Act, about defending pay for delay, citizens petitions, blocking of biosimilar entry in various ways, all of these are potentially anti-competitive behavior that the FTC could go after. But, the FTC is limited by the courts' negative views of anti-trust enforcement, the limits of the FTC on non-profits and other--other areas that are highlighted in his testimony. I think Congress could fix many of those things.    </p><p>JOHNSON: So, more laws and more regulations would be the fix? </p><p>MORTON: I think more laws making it clear what the anti-trust law is supposed to capture and giving the FTC authority to go after those cases.  </p><p>JOHNSON: Now, it wasn't the Affordable Care Act passage that caused this dilemma, is it? </p><p>MORTON: No.  </p><p>JOHNSON: And, in fact, the tens of millions of people who were brought into the healthcare system upon passage of the Affordable Care Act that is not the cause of these--of consolidation in the insurance the hospital industries and in the--in terms of the high cost of prescription drugs, is that correct? </p><p>MORTON: To the best of my knowledge, that is correct. </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, let me ask you this question about prescription drugs. Federal law prohibits itself from negotiating with drug manufacturers over the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare Part D enrollees. Would removing this handcuff result in lower cost for Medicare Part D employees and the Medicare program? </p><p>MORTON: Medicare Part D is run as an outsourced, privatized program where insurance companies negotiate with drug manufacturers.  </p><p>JOHNSON: And incentive-- </p><p>MORTON: --So they--they do pretty well. They have a formulary. They can walk away. I think it's very difficult for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to walk away from a drug manufacturer and say I'm sorry, Drug A will not be available to anybody--any of America's seniors. That's a hard thing to say. It's not very credible. Whereas an individual insurance company can say oh, we're gonna put Drug A low, you know, on a high tier with a high copay and Drug B is gonna be our preferred drug.  </p><p>So, I think Part D works pretty well. It's Part B that's really not good. </p><p>JOHNSON: Do you think the handcuffs on Part B should be removed? </p><p>MORTON: Correct. </p><p>JOHNSON: And that would lower costs for the 15 percent of consumers enrolled in that program? </p><p>MORTON: Well, we all pay the taxes for it.  </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, you're right about that. Well, let me ask you this question also. With respect to consolidation in the health insurance industry, would passage of legislation that allowed for what's known as the public option, passage of that legislation, would it result in a competition that would lower prices for consumers? </p><p>MORTON: The public option has a lot of different definitions. But, certainly anything we can do to make the Affordable Care Act marketplaces more competitive with more choices for consumers, that would be a great help. And it would lead to lower prices. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you. So, the constant attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act, which enabled tens of millions of people to have access to this system don't do anything to cut the consolidation in the hospital and insurance industries or the rise in prescription drug prices. Do you all agree with that? Yes, yes, yes and yes.  </p><p>MORTON: Yes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay. We'll let the record show everybody agrees with that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And with that, I will yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Johnson. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Sensenbrenner, for five minutes. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have some questions for Dr. Gaynor. First, you note in your written testimony that Americans who live in rural areas are vulnerable to harms from hospital consolidation and anti-competitive behavior. My home state of Wisconsin has been particularly affected by rural hospital mergers with 19 mergers taking place between 2005 and 2016. Why does this happen more in rural areas than in urban areas? </p><p>GAYNOR: Thanks for your question, Member Sensenbrenner. I don't know that I can answer why it's happening more frequently in rural than urban areas at this point in time. But, I'm happy to consider it further and submit an answer in written testimony. Nonetheless, there are quite a few mergers that are happening across the board, not just--not just in rural areas. And there are lots of things that are driving those mergers. As we all know, there's a merger wave in the U.S. economy happening that is affecting what's happening in healthcare.  </p><p>There are motives on the part of merging parties to enhance their negotiating positions by merging and eliminating or harming competition. There's sometimes a game of musical chairs that happens where they see everybody else merging and they don't want to be the last one left standing when the music stops.  </p><p>Nonetheless, Americans that live in rural areas are particularly vulnerable because if there's only one provider or dominant provider it's very difficult for them to go elsewhere. And so, they can be particularly harmed by the mergers that enhance or create market power in the areas that they live.  </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Okay, second question, in your written testimony you explained that some states have regulations that unintentionally make it difficult for new care providers to enter the market. And that the negative impacts of these laws can particularly effect residents of rural areas. Can you tell me what kind of state regulations or laws make it difficult for new hospitals or other providers that offer healthcare services? And, again, why does this happen more often in rural areas than in urban areas. </p><p>GAYNOR: Thanks again for your question, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner. So, there are a number of examples of this. There are a set of laws called certificate of need laws, about 26 states in the union still have certificate of need laws. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: We had them in Wisconsin and repealed them. </p><p>GAYNOR: Yes, yes, Pennsylvania, for example, had such law at sunset about '95 or '96, but about half of all states still have them. And that requires review and approval by a regulatory commission to create a new facility or expand a new facility, whether it's a hospital, an ambulatory surgery center, that sort of thing. Another--another area that's particularly important has to do with the decisions of state licensing boards about what sorts of entities are allowed to practice and provide healthcare. Telehealth is one example of that where state licensing boards have discretion over the provision of telehealth. They scope a practice for nurses is another area. What nurses are allowed to do and not do, what sort of supervision is required. And last, but not least, independent pharmacists are also subject to these regulations. </p><p>Now, the regulations are statewide, but why might they affect folks in rural areas particularly more? Well, Telehealth is easy to see. If you live an area where there are not a lot of providers physically the ability to obtain care through Telehealth for some kinds of services can greatly expand the opportunities for care.  </p><p>If nurses can do more, if pharmacists are allowed to do more, that expands the supply of healthcare professionals. And so creates more--more opportunities, more care and more competition in those areas. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you very much. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Sensenbrenner. The chair now recognizes the distinguished gentlelady from Washington State, Ms. Jayapal, for five minutes. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you so much for having this hearing. Thank you all for your testimony today. I think it's important that we remind people that might be watching what we're talking about, which undergirds everything you've said, which is that today in the United States we spend about 18 percent of our GDP on healthcare, which is double what every other major industrialized country, almost double, what every other major industrialized country in the world spends on healthcare. And you might think, if you were listening to this, that that means we have great outcomes. But, in fact, the United States is worst of our peer countries on maternal mortality, that's moms that die in childbirth. We are worst in terms of infant mortality, that's kids that die when they're young. And we are worst in terms of life expectancy. We have the lowest life expectancy.  </p><p>And so, this is a marketplace that truly is broken. And I think you all have raised important considerations. I wanted to point out that this is also a marketplace where the top five private health insurance companies bring in annual profit of $90 billion a year. The top pharmaceutical companies bring in $75 billion a year. And this is as people are dying because they can't afford insulin or cancer treatments. And so, I have introduced our Medicare for All bill here in the House and have 106 distinguished original cosponsors.  </p><p>And so, I wanted to just turn, Professor Gaynor, to you first. You are an expert on competition and anti-trust policy and particularly in the healthcare markets, as was evident from your testimony. And you stated that the U.S. healthcare system is functioning at a subpar level, which has resulted in this egregious pricing that we see and the poor quality of care. And you attribute that largely due to the lack of competition caused by a highly consolidated healthcare market. </p><p>So, can you just explain in the simplest terms why this consolidation is occurring? Why are all these firms merging? And what's driving that? </p><p>GAYNOR: Representative Jayapal, thank you for your question. There are multiple reasons. So, one reason that consolidation occurs is very simple. The consolidating firms one (INAUDIBLE) and negotiating power, get higher prices and have higher profits. And sometimes the executives of these firms actually admit that in public. That's rather rare. Usually the lawyers are none too pleased. But, for example, Toby Cosgrove, a very, very accomplished CEO, former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal in 2012 and said as much. That's exactly why we do those things.  </p><p>So, that is one reason. And though there are others, I think that's important. Another reason has to do with sort of a, not a virtuous, but a vicious cycle in which consolidation can happen on one side of the market and then the providers or the insurers on the other side feel that their negotiating position has been harmed so they consolidate in order to try and shore that up. And this can go back and forth and back and forth. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Right. </p><p>GAYNOR: In a vicious cycle. As I said previously, there can also be musical chairs-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --I'm gonna--I'm so sorry.  </p><p>GAYNOR: No, no, that's fine. </p><p>JAYAPAL: I want to ask you a couple of other questions. </p><p>GAYNOR: Of course. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And I'm gonna run out of time. </p><p>GAYNOR: Yeah, we go on for some time. </p><p>JAYAPAL: But, really important, I just want to emphasize, so merging is happening because when you merge you have greater negotiating power, which means you can drive up prices and profit, really simply.  </p><p>So, do you believe that the goal of the healthcare system should be to serve patients and improve health and not to increase profits? </p><p>GAYNOR: Absolutely. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Okay, great. And is this increasing concentration in our healthcare markets targeted at improving patient outcomes at that primary goal of getting better patient outcomes, better healthcare and making care more affordable? </p><p>GAYNOR: No.  </p><p>JAYAPAL: So, who is paying for the rapidly increasing prices that we are seeing from these hospital and healthcare consolidations? Is it--is it just patients? Who's paying for that? </p><p>GAYNOR: Ultimately actually it's all of us. When we have prices go up in healthcare we don't see it directly the same way if, say, there's a merger of grocery stores or paper suppliers or that kind of thing. But, nonetheless, it comes back to all of our wallets. For example, just a simple statistics, over the past 20 years worker contributions to health insurance have risen by 239 percent. Over that period wages rose by 68 percent. So, what happens when prices go up, costs go up to health insurance companies. Health insurance premiums are 80 percent to 90 percent or greater medical expenses. So, health insurance premiums go up. What happens? Well, employers pay higher health insurance premiums. Their healthcare costs go up. They're not going to alter total compensation to workers. I'm only worth a certain amount to Carnegie Mellon University. Although you're free to tell my Dean I'm not getting paid enough. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>JAYAPAL: So, wages go down because basically any-- </p><p>GAYNOR: --And-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --any money that's in the system is going to pay for these increases. </p><p>GAYNOR: --Something has to give. The employer's faced with higher healthcare costs. What happens? Wages fall or they don't rise as much as they otherwise would, workers pay more of health insurance contributions are benefits are cut. In some cases, in the past anyhow, workers lose the coverage entirely. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you so much. I think it's important that everybody understands that small businesses and employers and people, patients, are footing the bill and they are already paying these enormous costs. Thank you, Dr. Gaynor. I yield back.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gaetz, for five minutes. </p><p>GAETZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by praising your leadership and thanking you for this important subcommittee. And while I know the important work of the full Judiciary Committee has been flavored a bit partisan, at times as I look at the work you've done on lower prescription drug prices, taking on the accesses of big tech. I think that this subcommittee is poised for some major bipartisan successes. And I thank you for your efforts.  </p><p>Specifically, as it relates to the subject matter before us here, you know, I am hopeful that the substance of the CREATES Act will ultimately be marked-up in committee. And I'm also hopeful that some of the PBM transparency issues that we've discussed are able to be fully--fully exposed. I also want to praise Florida's governor Ron DeSantis. Right now, one of the major challenges we face in Florida is the rising costs of prescription drugs creates a massive cost structure on our corrections systems. And there is currently a real opportunity for Florida and other states to import drugs from foreign markets and then to be able to lower costs substantially. That is allowed under current law in Florida. We are currently working toward that with President Trump. And so, I would implore President Trump to look favorably on Governor DeSantis's request. And that other states might be able to unlock the potential of lower drug prices. </p><p>But, Mr. Chairman, as we are gathered here talking about the anti-competitive practices in medicine it is really noteworthy to me that one of the most anti-competitive things that occurs is the heavy hand of the federal government constraining access to medical cannabis. And as we look at the types of prescription drugs that are--that are sought to deal with opioids in particular, we continue to see evidence, substantial evidence, in fact, according to the National Academy of Sciences, that cannabis is helpful in dealing with chronic pain, treatment of chemotherapy and vomiting, multiple sclerosis symptoms. And so, it is my sincere hope with all of the energy and passion among my democrat colleagues on the Judiciary Committee that in looking at prescription drug use, prescription drug abuse and prescription drug cost that we unlock the potential of medical cannabis and that we get the government out of the way so that it is not impairing the relationship between physicians and patients. </p><p>I wanted to take a moment to ask, Mr. Garthwaite, in this broader discussion we're having about consolidation. What role does the federal government have in spurring consolidation through excessive regulation of the health marketplace? And by that I mean as the federal government becomes more and more involved in what qualifies for drawdowns to states and the provision of healthcare, does that excessive regulation and the compliance cost it drives, does that--is that a contributing factor in your review of maybe a consolidation incentive? </p><p>GARTHWAITE: I think part of what you're getting at, so there is some fixed costs of dealing with regulations and compliance. I think at the state of the, sort of, landscape at this point, most of these firms are big enough that they--they're able to cover to that fixed costs. And I would agree with Dr. Gaynor that a lot of this is not about it being driven by federal regulation. It's being driven by either attempts to seek higher prices or attempts to coordinate care.  </p><p>GAETZ: And, Dr. Gaynor, would you reflect on the role that PBM's have in the health of the prescription drug marketplace? </p><p>GAYNOR: I--I wasn't asked to prepare testimony on that topic, but I am happy to reflect on it and submit a written response to your question. </p><p>GAETZ: Great, thank you. Those are my questions, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you very much. And I now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Demings, for five minutes. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our witnesses for being here with us today as we discuss this very, very important topic. You know, I'm reminded of a quote from Dr. King who said of all of the injustices and there are many that exist, the lack of healthcare is the most inhumane. So, this is a critical subject to all of our districts and our communities. My colleague, the ranking member, talked about the merger--the number of mergers that have occurred in rural areas. And I know, Dr. Gaynor, you mentioned that it's not just occurring in rural areas, but across our nation.  </p><p>But, I do believe that in rural areas, the effects can be much more devastating because the lack of access, quality of care, access to services, all of those dynamics. And so, could you just please talk about the extra harm, if you will, that mergers do or have the affects, the negative impact that they have on rural communities? </p><p>GAYNOR: Representative Demings, thank for your--thanks for your question, yes. well, because folks in rural communities live much farther from other healthcare providers, hospitals, doctors, nurses, et cetera, if there are mergers in rural areas that leave them with few alternatives, their next best alternative can often be miles and miles away. And, of course, for some kinds of care, it's either very difficult or impossible for people to travel, emergency care, obstetric delivery. But, even if they are willing to travel it's a long way. And so, that imposes real costs on them and that means that if there are providers in the area they have much more ability to have prices be higher. They're under much less pressure to do better, to have better quality, provide better service, better access, better community benefits. So, I think that those of us in America who live in rural areas are particularly vulnerable to these kinds of harms. </p><p>DEMINGS: Could you also talk about what type of positions, in terms of employees, when hospital mergers occur who--what type of employee or hospital worker is really the most vulnerable in that environment? </p><p>GAYNOR: Well, it's the folks who have skills as workers that are most specific to working in a hospital because if they're best alternative is to working in a given hospital and now there's a merger and the next hospital over is no longer available to move to because they're now one firm, then they don't have such great alternatives. If they're workers who have very general skills, if you're a food service worker in a hospital you might not prefer to work somewhere else, but you could go and work at another company and be a food service worker there. </p><p>So, when a hospital merger happens, the hospitals can't squeeze your wages or your working conditions too much. But, if you're a--if you're an OR nurse where else are you gonna go? You may be able to go elsewhere, but it won't be as good a job.  </p><p>DEMINGS: And finally, Dr. Morton, would you just, again, please describe for me what is the connection between a lack of competition and the rising costs of healthcare? </p><p>MORTON: Lack of competition means that providers of various kinds, drugs, devices, hospitals, doctors, don't have to compete with one another for the business of patients. And competition generates both lower prices and also more innovation and more quality, more choice for all the--all the consumers of healthcare.  </p><p>When we don't have competition, we have higher prices and lower quality. And that just hurts everybody, both the patients and the taxpayers. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentlelady for yielding back. I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong, for five minutes. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I guess my first question is for Dr. Gaynor, just so we have--and North Dakota has been a little different since 2010. We have had an actual boom in our economy. So, prior to that we were suffering the same type of problems the rest of rural America was facing. But, what we've noticed is lack of workforce shortage. We have one of the most--we probably have, if not the best, one of the best rural hospitals in the country because it's brand new and it's fantastic. But, we're having trouble staffing it.  </p><p>And so, when we're talking about these consolidations in rural areas, and we've seen it. They move into the--yes we have urban areas in North Dakota. And they move into the more urban areas. But, are these motive--I mean, these aren't all motivated by anti-competitive behavior. I mean factors such as worker shortage, nurse shortage, provider shortage, resources and financing are part of this equation, aren't they? </p><p>GAYNOR: So, as I said, there are multiple, multiple motives for mergers and acquisition. I don't know that labor market issues are a primary driver. I haven't heard, heard that. There can be incentives, these usually happen more in acquisitions than in mergers, where a smaller hospital wants to be acquired by a larger hospital that has more--more resources, particularly if that hospital is struggling. Then you can certainly see that. But, I'm not aware of labor market issues as being a motive driving these mergers and acquisitions.  </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Maybe it's just unique to our geography. Well, and but part of that we've talked about licensing and state licensing. And states are all very good at putting up their own white picket fences and ensuring that a nursing degree--or a nursing license in Minnesota doesn't apply in North Dakota. And we--and we work on those at the state level a lot. And I think a lot of different states are starting to see that the worlds becoming a much smaller place.  </p><p>So, when these consolidations happen, whether they happen for a--make economic sense, are there any policies here--and I guess this question would kind of be for everyone, that we can do at the federal level that promotes access, whether it's urgent care centers or things in more rural areas? I know they're starting to do strep tests at pharmacies in rural areas in our district. And before we get into cross--cross--crossing pharmacists with doctors or nurses, but I mean just to continue to provide some semblance of access in rural America, question mark. </p><p>GAYNOR: Well, yeah, I think there are a number of things. One, I mentioned previously is making sure that--that licensing is tailored very specifically to the purpose of protecting the public and doesn't overstep those bounds. So, that--so that nurses and pharmacists, for example, are permitted to do the things that they have been trained to do and qualified to do. And that creates more access right off--right off the board. And so, I think that's a--that's a principle. Now, that's state level. But, the federal government can try to work with states, try and provide information and support to states in this area. And I think that can actually make an important difference. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Does anybody else have any (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>MORTON: I would agree. I think occupational licensing is often used as a barrier by incumbent licensed people to keep out others. And if you have a shortage of a certain medical worker it's not like human bodies are different as between North Dakota and South Dakota and any other state. So, it might be reasonable to imagine that the requirements for being a nurse or a doctor are the same across states. And if we had fewer difference, workers could move more easily. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir?  </p><p>GARTHWAITE: Yeah, I also note that sort of we're seeing private firms start to address this as well. So, some of the motivation behind some of the vertical integration we're seeing in healthcare. And this committee had a nice hearing on CVSAetna as a merger, but some of the motivation behind that is about finding new sites of care, maybe finding ways we can treat chronic conditions at retail settings, be it a--or be it a CVS, you know, Walmart is thinking about these things as well. Those will provide more access for care in places that aren't the traditional general acute care hospital or a doctor's office, which can often struggle to be a standalone business in a rural area given the lack of demand. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you. And I think that's important because the economy is a--I mean it's not unique to the medical profession. We are seeing more--I mean more and more of this happen in rural areas as we continue to move out.  </p><p>GAYNOR: Just one--one last thought and this has already been addressed in part by Congress, and that's what are called site neutral payments for Medicare. I think you're familiar with those, the payment for the same kind of service and levered by the same kind of professional can be many multiples if it's dubbed in a hospital and that creates some distortions that may--may favor those things and then actually end up penalizing people in rural areas. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you. I yield back my negative 15 seconds. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank you and now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Scanlon--no-- </p><p>SCANLON: Pennsylvania. </p><p>CICILLINE: Pennsylvania.  </p><p>SCANLON: I didn't move, yes.  </p><p>CICILLINE: There's a lot of Florida down on that end. My apologies, Pennsylvania, for five minutes. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you. So, there are few questions that came up or a few topics that came up more frequently when I was running last fall then about affordable healthcare. And in that sector the biggest question I kept getting is what can we do about prescription drug prices over and over. So, it's a priority for my constituents and, therefore, a priority for me. And in addition to being very worried about this, they are also really smart. So, they fed me specific questions. So, Professor Scott Morton, the question of evergreening of patents.  </p><p>So, as I understand that that is sort of tweaking patents to extend the amount of time that there's proprietary rights, can you speak to that and how that impacts the prices of drugs? </p><p>MORTON: Yes, this is a tactic whereby let's say there's a drug that's twice a day and the manufacturer invents a once a day version and patents that or maybe even takes 50 milligram and makes a 60 milligram tablet and patents that. And then releases that new product on the market and, in some cases, removes the old product that's about to be generic and therefore much less expensive. This situation could be really helped with a couple of policies. </p><p>So, one is generally strengthening the anti-trust laws and allowing the FTC to go after behavior that it feels is anti-competitive. But, another one is reforming the incentives of the PBM. The PBM should want everybody to take that generic drug because it's cheaper and not steer them to the more expensive one. And when we have perverse incentives that latter thing can happen. </p><p>In general, however, we don't want to get into the business of saying is this innovation good or not, but rather subject it to the market test. Once a day could be a super valuable innovation. And if it has to compete head to head with twice a day, we'll find out. If in--if, however, the launch of the once a day is accompanied by the pulling away of the twice a day, we don't have head to head competition anymore. That's a situation where it looks like the manufacturer didn't think their once a day was going to win. And that's why they took away the twice a day. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay, thank you for that. Mr. Kades, in 2013 the Supreme Court held in FTC vs. Actavis, Actavis, that pay for delay settlements, which occur when a branded drug company pays a potential generic competitor to delay entering the market with a lower cost generic likely violates the anti-trust laws, absent a justification. Can you comment on whether that decision is sufficient or insufficient to address the pay for delay settlements and, you know, is there something we can do about that? </p><p>KADES: Yes, thank you for the question, Representative Scanlon. So, at one level the Supreme Court decision was good because until that time courts were taking the position that a patent holder could pay any amount of money to secure the agreement of the generic to not manufacture its drug. And because the brand makes so much more than the generic these were very common. And so, once the court said you can do this, agreements went up. The Supreme Court, in principal, the rule, makes sense. The problem is that the--it is a--it is not--the lines aren't clear and there's been lots of litigation. I think, you know, what I said in my opening statement there was a case that settled just last year and it was filed back in 2006. </p><p>So, what you're having to happen is that the government is spending lots of resources to prove that paying your potential competitor not to compete is a problem. And we live in a world of limited resources. So, as other people have talked about other things, whether it be the rebates and the PBM's or other things, the product hopping, the government can't even get to those cases because they're basically left having to prove these basic ideas that we all should agree are anti-competitive. </p><p>SCANLON: I know one suggestion to address this is to establish a presumption that these pay for delay settlements are anti-competitive. Do you think that's a good idea or are there are other legislative fixes that you would suggest? </p><p>KADES: I think that is an excellent idea. When you look at both the economic theory behind what happens in a pay for delay settlement and we actually have evidence that they--empirical evidence that these types of agreements delay entry, then you should start with the proposition that if someone's paying a potential competitor in the settlement we should presume it's harmful and make them come forward if it's not. Instead, we have it the reverse, which makes no sense given what we know about theory and the empirics. </p><p>SCANLON: Any other suggestions in that pay for delay arena for legislative fixes?  </p><p>KADES: So, I think part of this is making sure it's sort of complimentary. These are incredibly enticing deals. So, in one of the cases I worked on the company paid $60 million and managed to protect close to a billion dollars. And another one after the company paid off four generic competitors boasted we got six years and $4 billion that nobody expected. So, you have to have a really strong penalty provision. If all the government can do is say oh, you broke the law. Promise us you won't do it again, that's not gonna be effective. And there's gonna be no reason for companies to settle. You have to be able to--the government has to be able to go in and say no, no, no you don't get to keep the money because you earned it by breaking the law.  </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentlelady has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse, for five minutes. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank the panel for being here with us today, for your testimony. I also want to thank my colleague from Wisconsin for raising the important issue regarding rural areas in particular where this is very pernicious, certainly in my district. I represent a variety of counties, Summit County, Eagle County, mountain communities, more rural in nature where this a big problem. And the affect is very pronounced. </p><p>I wanted--so, Dr. Gaynor, I want to call out one particular finding, which I think is fairly intuitive, but your data certainly supports it from your written testimony here. I'll quote, \"one of our key findings is that hospitals that have fewer potential competitors nearby have substantially higher prices.\" For example, monopoly hospitals prices are on average 12 percent higher than hospitals with three or more potential competitors nearby. That--that's a very important fact worth repeating. And one of the recommendations you make and Dr. Morton makes as well that I find to believe--or I believe is particularly compelling, is around non-profit hospitals, which is a big part of a discussion that often gets left out.  </p><p>And I think part of it is because there is a misperception about the nature of non-profit hospital entities in some cases. I am sure members of the panel serve on non-profits boards, Dr. Gaynor, you've recreated the Healthcare Cost Institute. I am curious; I imagine that the CEO of the Healthcare Cost Institute does not have a private jet, would I be right in saying that? </p><p>GAYNOR: Well, I'm not longer on the board, but I would be extraordinarily chagrinned were that the case. </p><p>NEGUSE: All right. They're not making tens of millions of dollars, right? </p><p>GAYNOR: No. </p><p>NEGUSE: Dr. Kades, I hope I pronounced that right, Kades, is that? </p><p>KADES: Kades. </p><p>NEGUSE: Kades, yes, sir. And you, of course, are the director of a non-profit entity, the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, is that right?  </p><p>KADES: I actually am the Director of the Competition Policy; the Washington Center for Equitable Growth is a much bigger organization. </p><p>NEGUSE: Okay. Well, I trust that the director that entity is probably not flying around on a private jet and making tens of millions of dollars either.  </p><p>KADES: I think that's a fair assumption.  </p><p>NEGUSE: And so, here's my point, right. The Wall Street Journal, this relatively recent, the last two years, as of December 13--December 30, 2016 tax filings as of that date prepared kind of a summary. And you have a variety of hospital executives at various large non-profit hospital systems, Ascension in St. Louis, $17 million in annual compensation; Northwell Health, $10 million; Highmark Health, $9.8 million; Mercy Health in Wisconsin, $8 million compensation package. Variety, right, you can encourage folks who are watching to just Google, you know, non-profit health CEO and private jet or private chef or any variety of other compensation packages that are attached to folks who are working in those industries. </p><p>And I think what we have kind of lost sight of, right, is that the charity aspect and obligation at a non-profit hospital has, right, embedded in its purpose as an entity. The FTC in 1999 there's a report, go on to the website. I was 15 years old in 1999. This is a long time ago. There's a report titled Competitive Effects of Not-For-Profit Hospital Mergers. And I'll quote from it. It says, \"Mergers involving not-for-profit hospitals are a legitimate focus of anti-trust concerns.\" And yet, here we sit 20 years later and the FTC has no power to essentially engage in this important area.  </p><p>And so, I'd like to give Dr. Gaynor and Dr. Morton, perhaps, an opportunity to kind of talk about this because I think it's a pretty simple change in the law that we could make, that Congress could make, that would really open this up. Again, a lot of not-for-profit hospitals are doing incredible work, good work. But, there's a case to be made for the FTC to have expanded authority in this regard. Care to comment? </p><p>GAYNOR: Yes, thank you, Representative. So, I agree 100 percent. Just to be clear, the FTC does have the authority to pursue mergers under the Clayton Act. What they do not currently have the authority to do is pursue anti-competitive conduct--  </p><p>NEGUSE: --Correct. </p><p>GAYNOR: --by non-profits under the FTC Act. So, I agree. I think that needs to be revisited and revised so that both our anti-trust enforcement agencies are using all the tools in the anti-trust arsenal to address the pressing issues in this sector. And, let me say, again, yes, most hospitals in the U.S. are technically non-profit. But, the numbers you gave out are eloquent testimony to the fact that this is big business. Once upon a time they were charities. But, that was a long time ago. </p><p>When healthcare is one-fifth of our entire economy. When UPMC has a $10 billion revenue company, the largest private employer in the State of Pennsylvania. And that's replicated over and over and over again, they're no longer charities. They are big businesses. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired. I thank you. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. McBath, for five minutes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, once again, to reiterate as many of my colleagues have today, I just want to thank each of you for coming and sharing your testimony with us today. And I'd just like to thank you for being here because this is--this is something that's extremely important to me because it has touched me personally. I'm a two-time breast cancer survivor. And I understand what it's like to have your life completely turned upside down overnight.  </p><p>Having that diagnosis once was, I can tell you, just you go into a crisis mode. But, to have it a second time reeks even more havoc than it did the first time. And the stress of the financial burdens that--that follow are just--weigh so heavily, not only on the individual that has been diagnosed, but also the entire family.  </p><p>Now, I had the benefit of being in a breast cancer study that allowed me to have discounted treatment, as well as, you know, pharmaceuticals. So, I realized that I was very fortunate in that regard. Even though I was fortunate to have very good health insurance. I worked for a major corporation, major company. I worked for Delta Airlines. I was under a really good group health insurance program. I still worried about my medical bills and my needs and how what--how would my family be so adversely affected by this--by this health crisis.  </p><p>And so, even though I had good benefits. I could not even imagine what it would--what it would be like for a family that didn't have the ability to have the kind of healthcare that I had the fortune of having. Now, I want to say that my story is absolutely not unique. It's stories like this that we hear every single day from Americans across the country. </p><p>And just this week I heard from a family, a woman within my own district in Georgia, who told me that she spends $1,500 a month on diabetic supplies for her daughter who has Type 1 diabetes. Now, and that's more than her monthly mortgage. So, Dr. Scott and Morton--Dr. Scott Morton and Mr. Kades, could you speak very candidly to what should be done to bring down prescription drug prices, those costs while also supporting innovation and research, which is so sorely needed.  </p><p>MORTON: I would say that in my written testimony I describe a way that you could cap out of pocket prices, which is, I think, the most harmful thing that consumers and patients are experiencing now and combine that with a ban on kickbacks by the pharmaceutical company in the form of coupons, financial aid, wrap around services and so on. This would leave patients protected and then enable competition because without being able to incentivize the patient the manufacturer would have to sell its drug to the PBM. And then it would have to compete with other drugs in order to sell this drug through the PBM.  </p><p>So, the key in restraining prices that patients pay out of pocket is to do it in a way that enables as much competition as possible so that you keep the prices paid by the insurer low because, of course, we all pay premiums. So, that's the other way in which this is very expensive, not just out of pocket costs.  </p><p>So, the two sides need to go together. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. </p><p>KADES: Thank you for the question. So, I'm gonna come at this from my experience as an anti-trust lawyer and what can we do? What's wrong with this marketplace in terms of anti-competitive conduct? Right, and the issue here is a branded company makes--makes a pile of revenue that's--sorry, money and they are insulated from price competition generally until there's a generic. And that one--just having a generic totally changes, you know, prices go down. They lose most of their sales.  </p><p>And so, there's a real incentive to do anything possible to delay that date. And so, that can be you pay your competitor not to compete, which we were talking about. It can be the product hopping stuff that--the conduct that Fiona was talking about. And right now the anti-trust laws have been so weakened that we can't stop this conduct.  </p><p>But, the good news is if we strengthen those laws or pass things like the CREATES Act, it will make it harder to prevent competition. But, it really shouldn't have any impact on innovation because these are all types of strategies that are just about sort of--about obtaining anti-competitive rents. It's not about innovation. So, this is a really--injecting competition into the marketplace gets you the benefit of lower cost without generally--without undermining incentives to innovate. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you so much. I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentlelady. And now recognize myself for five minutes. Again, thank you to the witnesses. I want to begin broadly talking about competition. I'm very concerned about the rising tide of economic concentration throughout our economy and the really crippling effects on economic opportunity, innovation and equality. Earlier this week, Professor John Kwoka of Northeastern University testified before the Senate Anti-trust Subcommittee and he said concentration has been steadily rising and competition declining in a great many sectors of the economy raising legitimate concerns about increasing market power in large swaths of the U.S. economy. </p><p>Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton Administration similarly noted, and I quote, \"America has a monopoly problem. America used to have anti-trust laws that stopped corporations from monopolizing markets and often broke up the biggest culprits, but anti-trust has faded. The result has been hidden upward redistributions of money and power from the majority of the Americans to corporate executives of, and major investors in, huge concentrations of economic power,\" end quote.  </p><p>So, Dr. Scott Morton, I'd like to start with you. In your written testimony you identified a lack of competition as a reason why U.S. healthcare costs are rising so fast. And that anti-trust enforcement has been weakened in the United States for a variety of reasons. What are, in your view, the primary reasons that enforcement has so weakened? </p><p>MORTON: The primary long-run reason is that we were all influenced by the Chicago school in the '70s that believed things like monopolies are inherently transitory and all the monopolies will price at marginal cost and courts make bad decisions and these kind of presumptions that we now know after 40 years of studying the economics' literature are false. They weren't true to begin with and we now are much more sure of that.  </p><p>In addition, we also see the evidence in front of us, which is rising markups, lower labor share, higher profit share, all the different evidence that you pointed to. So, it's clear that the pendulum has swung past the ideal point by quite a bit and we need to turn it around. But, because courts now interpret the anti-trust laws in this way, I think it's up to Congress to instruct the courts that actually Congress would like it done a different way.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, doctor. And that leads to my question--my next question to Mr. Kades, who just in the end of your testimony just a moment, you talked about the weakening of the anti-trust enforcement. And wondering whether you have suggestions of the kind of legislation we should be contemplating that would really strengthen anti-trust enforcement. </p><p>KADES: Thank you, chairman, for the question. Yes, one of the sort of subtleties about why anti-trust is weak is we've made it just hard and expensive for the--to prove an anti-trust case, whether it be a government or private plaintiff. So, we know how to fix that. The way to fix that is to you create presumptions where we're confident that--that the conduct is likely to be anti-competitive. And there's lots of economic evidence about certain types of mergers that we can be comfortable are likely to be anti-competitive, certain types of conduct. I mean, in many ways the CREATES Act is--it's not an anti-trust law, but it sort of takes that idea that where you have conduct that you are confident is not justified. You need to make it easy to prove.  </p><p>And so, that's what I would say, more presumptions to address the--based on the empirical evidence of where we know things are likely to be problematic.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. And, Dr. Gaynor, do we have--or do the anti-trust agencies have enough resources to do the work that we expect them to do? And if not, what would you recommend in terms of additional resources, there are other things you should recommend--that you would recommend that would help improve merger and anti-monopoly enforcement. </p><p>GAYNOR: Chairman Cicilline, thanks for your question. First, I just want to say I agree with my colleagues, Dr. Scott Morton and Mr. Kades. And I think those are important issues to be addressed. But, you turn to the other side, rightly so, suppose we--we do the kinds of things that my colleagues have suggested, which I agree with 100 percent. The agencies will need more resources to do more. It's that simple. Over the past seven to 10 years or so merger filings have risen by about 57 percent and appropriations and inflation adjusted terms have fallen by 12 percent. The number of staff is either constant and declining in the Bureau of Competition, Bureau of Economics at the Federal Trade Commission. As a consequence, what happens is the agencies are faced with an extraordinarily difficult choice between how much to do based on what's coming in over the transom, which is coming out of a--of a power hose, given the rise in merger activity and trying to stay abreast of new developments. They desperately need the resources, additional resources, to do that. </p><p>CICILLINE: I'm just gonna squeeze in one last question, over the past several years Sarah Kliff, a reporter for Vox has documented the outrageous practice of surprise billing in hospitals. And as she's reported the price of ordinary drugs that could be cheaply purchased at a local pharmacy, such as generic eye drops or pregnancy tests, often cost hundreds of dollars and additionally, patients often painstakingly choose to receive care in hospitals that are covered by their insurance only to find out that the emergency room doctor who treated them was not covered by their insurance. As a result they received surprise bills that can cost tens of thousands of dollars. And I'm just wondering, starting with you, Dr. Gaynor, is--obviously, this is further evidence that our current system is fundamentally broken. And I'd also like Dr. Scott Morton to reflect on that. </p><p>GAYNOR: Right, 100 percent. I mean this is unacceptable and can't be allowed to continue. And, moreover, this is sort of thing undermines markets. People think they're making a responsible choice by going to an in network hospital and then they get socked with this astronomical bill they had no way to prevent. Why should they shop? Why should they buy insurance policies that ask them to do that? So, it's going to undermine the market and there are some relatively simple remedies for that. Fiona Scott Morton and Zack Cooper have proposed one. So, I'll yield to her because she's the one who can talk about it. </p><p>CICILLINE: And I--I'm thanking my ranking member for indulgence of one minute. I don't want to abuse my power in my first meeting. But, if it's okay Dr. Scott Morton to just-- </p><p>MORTON: --Yeah, so this is a really bad problem.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. </p><p>MORTON: And it just comes from the fact that we have quite a regulated system and sometimes there's a loophole. And then financial players can go in there and say look, there's a business model. I insert these doctors into a hospital, pull them out of network and double the charges or triple them. So, what our proposed solution is, is that hospitals need to sell the bundle. They need to sell all the care you get in the emergency department. The hospital can go out and organize the doctors. They could employ them. They could contract with a group. But then at least when you arrive at the in-network hospital everything you're getting in the ED is in network. </p><p>CICILLINE: Terrific. Thank you, again, to our witnesses. This concludes today's hearing. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record. The hearing is adjourned.  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-0B91-JDPT-T18P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

DOUG COLLINS (R-GA.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: The chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee, at any time. We welcome everyone to our first hearing on online platforms and market power, focusing on the free and diverse press. </p><p>I now recognize myself for an opening statement. In recent years, there's' been a cascade of competition problems on the internet. Concentration in the digital advertising market has pushed local journalism to the verge of extinction. </p><p>The combination of predatory acquisitions, of growing innovation kill zone and high network effects and switching cost appear to have undermined entrepreneurship and startup rates. </p><p>And the sheer dominance of some platforms has resulted in worse products and significantly less choice, leaving people without a competitive alternative to services and harvest their data, manipulate their behavior and monetize their attention.   </p><p>In response to these trends, the committee announced, last week, that we will conduct a bipartisan investigation into competition in the online market place. The purpose of this investigation is to document anti-competitive conduct online, examine whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct and assess whether our competition system and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these problems. </p><p>Over the coming months, we will conduct a top to bottom review of online markets, through a series of hearings on these topics, request information that is relevant to the investigation and engage in a series of discussions with key stakeholders and policy experts. </p><p>This is the first significant antitrust investigation undertaken by Congress in decades. In the past, these investigations, which included studies of monopoly power in the airline industry, banking, oil, and Ma Bell, led Congress to consider whether it needed to make changes to our laws and agencies. </p><p>I strongly believe that this investigation is long overdue. This Subcommittee has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of our antitrust laws and competition system to ensure that they are properly working. </p><p>Congress, not the courts, agencies, or private companies, enacted the antitrust laws. And Congress must be responsible for determining whether they are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy. </p><p>Today's hearing is the first step in this process for examining these trends. </p><p>The free and diverse press is the backbone of our vibrant democracy. As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in 1927, those who won our independence believed that public discussion is a political duty, that the greatest threat to freedom is an uninformed citizenry, and that the freedom of thought and speech are indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.  </p><p>But over the past decade, the news industry has been in a state of economic freefall. From 2006 to 2017, advertising revenue has fallen from $49 billion to $15.6 billion, resulting in mass layoffs, or newspapers folding, altogether. This year alone, roughly 2,900 reporters and other news staff have already lost their jobs. </p><p>These massive cuts are happening to traditional news companies and online news sources alike. For example, earlier this year, the Cleveland Plain Dealer announced another round of layoffs, due to advertising losses, reducing its staff by 80 percent from employment levels, just seven years ago. </p><p>Buzzfeed and The Huffington Post have also announced significant layoffs. These are online publishers that have never relied on revenue from classified sections or subscriptions and are designed to appeal to readers on social media sites and mobile devices. </p><p>This raises a critical question-if online news publishers can't survive, then who can? </p><p>During this same time--same period, online platforms that are gateways to news online have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.  </p><p>Since 2007, Google has acquired several of its competitors in the online advertising market, resulting in significant concentration and a complete lack of transparency in this market. </p><p>And since 2011, another dominant online platform, Facebook, has acquired two of its rivals, Instagram and WhatsApp, in an effort to corner the market for social media services and advertising on these services. </p><p>Facebook now controls a user base of 2.7 billion people worldwide, the largest communications platform in human history. It soon plans to combine its products into a single platform, a move critics have suggested Facebook is making to thwart antitrust enforcement. </p><p>As Australia's competition authority noted in its preliminary report on digital platforms, both Google and Facebook have substantial market power in a number of markets that is unlikely to erode, over time, through new competitive threats. </p><p>There have also been numerous reports of these platforms engaging in anti-competitive conduct, such as favoring their own products, or discriminating against rivals, that has gone unchecked by Congress and unchallenged by antitrust enforcers in the United States. </p><p>These trends strongly suggest that the decline of the news industry is not the inevitable result of the arrival of the Internet, but is instead a direct consequence of enforcement choices that have created a market structure where a small number of platforms are capturing the value created by journalists and publishers. </p><p>This has affected news publishers in two key ways. </p><p>First, news publishers rely on Google and Facebook for the vast majority of traffic online. Even minor changes to the platforms' algorithms can have significant effects on the news industry, overall. Furthermore, as a result of this immense concentration of economic power, news publishers and local news, in particular, have little bargaining power with the online platforms, exacerbating the economic crisis for trustworthy news. </p><p>Second, these platforms have a dominant position in the advertising market. Last year, Facebook and Google amassed more than $60 billion from online advertising, the majority of all online ad revenue, while controlling 90 percent of the growth in this market. As David Chavern, the President of the News Media Alliance, who will testify today, this dynamic has resulted in an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism. </p><p>In response, I have introduced the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, with Ranking Member Collins, to give news publishers an even playing field to collectively negotiate with dominant platforms to improve the quality, accuracy, attribution, and interoperability of news online. </p><p>While I do not view this legislation as a substitute for more meaningful competition online, or antitrust scrutiny, it is clear that we must do something in the short term to save trustworthy journalism before it's lost, forever. This bill is a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health. </p><p>Whether it's an online publisher or local newspapers, we cannot have a democracy, without a free and diverse press. Our country will not survive, if we do not have shared facts, if corruption is not exposed and rooted out at all levels of government, and if power is not held to account. This is the very reason the press is called the Fourth Estate. </p><p>I view today's hearing as an opportunity to continue the conversation on how to address this crisis. Both I and the Ranking Member are open to exploring ways to strengthen the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, and my hope is that today's hearing will serve as the starting point in this discussion. </p><p>I thank our panel of extraordinary experts for participating at today's hearing, and I look forward to hearing your testimony. </p><p>At this time, I yield to Mr. Armstrong for his opening statement. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: I don't know where the button is, over here. So, no, I appreciate that. And at this time, I'd ask unanimous consent to enter Congressman Sensenbrenner's statement into the record. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection, so ordered. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And the best thing I can do for all of you is give you as much time, as possible. So, with that, I'll yield. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the Chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, for his opening statement. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding today's hearing. And before I deliver my statement, let me apologize that I'm going to have to leave, afterwards. We have a slight resolution on the floor I have to deal with. </p><p>Over the course of the last 200 years, Congress has routinely passed laws to protect and advance a free and diverse press. Whatever new technologies have transformed how Americans produce and share news, be it the telegraph, the radio, the telephone, or broadcast television, Congress has sought to ensure that these new markets were structured to facilitate the free flow of information and to protect the independence and financial viability of the press. </p><p>Today, as the Internet becomes the dominant platform for accessing news, and as this platform grows more and more concentrated, in the hands of just two major companies, the news media, once again, face serious threats and congressional action, once again, may be required. </p><p>As avenues for accessing have news narrowed in recent years, advertising revenue, which is the primary means of support for most news publishers, has steadily declined, as well. </p><p>And as revenue has fallen, so, too, has the number of journalists whose work can be supported by news publications. Local news outlets have been the most severely affected by this trend, with nearly 2,000 local news publishers ceasing operations, since 2007. </p><p>In fact, the majority of counties in the United States no longer have a publisher of local news, at all. Hundreds of other publishers have been forced to consolidate, or shrink their operations. </p><p>This journalism crisis is also a democracy crisis. As sources of trustworthy news disappear, American civic life suffers. The majority of local newspapers and television stations no longer even assign a reporter to cover state and local government matters. </p><p>With a less informed citizenry, communities without quality local news, generally, see lower rates of voter turnout. And cities where newspapers shut down have even seen their borrowing costs rise, suggesting, according to one study, that diminished transparency may enable governments to engage in riskier and more inefficient, or perhaps, more corrupt financing arrangements. </p><p>Where there are a number of causes of this multi-decade decline in the news industry, including reduced print circulation and reduced revenue from classified advertisements, one of the major concerns that has emerged, in recent years, is the power of a small number of gatekeepers over the news and information that citizens see. </p><p>Today, the vast majority of Americans consume the news online and two online platforms have immense control over how Americans access their news sources. </p><p>A single algorithm change by one of these private corporations can entirely distort what information the public shares and consumes and what revenue the publisher receives. Moreover, these same platforms dominate the online advertising market. </p><p>They account for nearly all of the growth in this market in recent years. No single factor has led to this immense concentration of control but it is incumbent upon Congress to understand the sources of this problem and to address it, urgently. </p><p>The American tradition has long recognized that preserving an open marketplace of ideas is vital to safeguarding the First Amendment and vital to a democratic form of government. </p><p>The antitrust and anti-monopoly laws have been a primary way that lawmakers and regulators have policed the problem of overly concentrated markets. When Congress enacted the antitrust laws, it was with the purpose of protecting economic opportunity and political equality. </p><p>Senator John Sherman, the author of the Sherman Antitrust Act, referred to the first antitrust law as a bill of rights and a charter of liberty. Overly concentrated--and he didn't regard it as simply a question of economic efficiency, or reducing prices--overly concentrated markets concentrate economic and political power and stifle competition. It is important to keep these broad goals of reducing concentration and promoting competition in mind, as we examine how online platforms impact a free and diverse media. </p><p>As the judge reviewing the consent to agree breaking up AT&amp;T wrote, quote, \"In promoting diversity in sources of information, the values underlying the first amendment coincide with the policy of the antitrust laws.\" Close quote. </p><p>Congress also has a constitutional duty to ensure that markets are structured in a way that is compatible with our democratic values. While new technologies may up end how news and information are shared, it is vital that we maintain open and competitive markets, which will best foster a robust independent press. </p><p>With this in mind, I welcome today's hearing as the beginning of the committee's investigation of competition in digital markets and I look forward to hearing from our panel of experts. And I thank the chairman, and I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the chairman for yielding back. The chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the full committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins, for his opening statement. </p><p>COLLINS: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline and thanks for holding this hearing, today. I am glad that you and I have found some commonality in this and look forward to working together. </p><p>This is the first of many hearings and oversight activity of the subcommittee expects to hold over the coming months, on the important antitrust and competition issues in the tech sector. </p><p>I firmly support this initiative. The conversations we will have in our committee are critical, as Congress evaluates the depth, breadth and importance of these tech issues and whether any amendments to the antitrust laws are needed. </p><p>The public understanding of these issues and the evolving role of tech in the daily lives of the American people are equally important, as we have these discussions. </p><p>If we do identify needs for new legislation, it is important we keep two principles in mind. First, like the existing antitrust laws, new legislation be consistent in keeping the free market free. Proposals to construct broad new regulatory regimes should be viewed with caution. Experience shows that regulatory solutions often miss the mark, solve problems less efficiently than free markets and can create new opportunities for anticompetitive companies to suppress competition, through rent seeking. </p><p>That is especially true when regulation attempts to take on evolving problems in fast-moving markets like tech. I speak from experience, here. I have worked through these, before. And we have to make sure that we're not looking for an immediate solution to the soreness in our foot and recognize that we've got a problem with our leg. We need to make sure we're working this through. </p><p>Secondly, big is not necessarily bad. Companies that offer new innovations, better solutions and more consumer benefit at lower prices often become big to the benefit of society, shockingly. </p><p>Proposals to break up big companies, just because they are big, risk throwing out the baby with the bath water. And any discussion that simply moves to that discussion first, is not the right way to move. </p><p>It is because I embrace these principles that I'm excited to have joined Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline in the introduction of the Journalism Competitive Competition and Preservation Act. This bill takes head on the problem of local and other news organizations disappearing from the public square, as news consumption moves increasingly online. </p><p>A vibrant press has been critical to the success of our democracy, since the founding of the Republic. In the old days, press organizations were able to thrive, based on their subscription and advertising revenues. But as the news consumption has moved to the Internet, traditional subscriptions are speedily drying up and online advertising revenues are increasingly becoming dominated by online platforms. </p><p>As a result, news organizations, across the country, are rapidly losing their economic lifeblood and disappearing from the public square. If individual news outlets could count on being able to negotiate fair attribution and advertising revenue agreements with the online platforms, the bleeding could be stopped. </p><p>The problem, however, is that smaller news organizations don't stand a fair negotiating chance, when they try to negotiate deals with a platform giant. These giants stand as a bottleneck, a classic antitrust problem but consumers--between consumers and the producers of news content. </p><p>Journalism Competition Preservation Act seeks to solve this problem simply by allowing news publications to take--take the platforms bottleneck together. Specifically, the bill allows the publications four years, in which they can collectively negotiate with the platforms, without fearing antitrust enforcement against that activity. </p><p>In other words, the bill allows news publications to take on an antitrust problem, without worrying that their antitrust laws, themselves, will stand in the way. It does not propose any new regulatory structures. It does not threaten to break up any company. It does promise to simply and effectively solve the problem. </p><p>Today's hearing provides an excellent opportunity to examine this bill and in other issues related to journalism and online environment. </p><p>These issues include matters as diverse as booming tech mergers and acquisitions to the mushrooming problem of online outlets that freeze viewpoints out of the online public square. </p><p>As we begin this, for all that are here, and many of you are here, representing a large diverse group, I've met with many of you, over the years. </p><p>Understand, from my position, as I have stated clearly, the principles that I have laid out. And as we go forward in this, anything that happens should be done when everyone comes to the table, everyone has a chance to share their opinion. Everyone has a chance to offer what may or may not be good legislative solutions. </p><p>It is up to this body to hear honestly from the people and the companies involved. If we take everybody at face value, it is the American people, at the end of the day, that will benefit. </p><p>We, I promise from my perspective and our side, will not rush to judgment. We encourage either side to not rush to judgment and companies to participate in a positive solution. When this body does that, we have seen great things happen. When we do not, we end up with more problems than we began to initiate. </p><p>With that, I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman for yielding back. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's witnesses. Our first witness is David Chavern, the President and CEO of the News Media Alliance, where he has been, since 2015. Mr. Chavern spent 10 years at the United States Chamber of Commerce in a number of executive roles, including Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief of Staff. </p><p>He's a member of the Board of Directors of Transamerica Insurance and serves on the Board of Trustees at the University of Pittsburg, his alma mater. Mr. Chavern received his Bachelor of Arts from the community of Pittsburg, his MBA from Georgetown University and his J.D. from Villanova's University School of Law. </p><p>Our second witness is the President and CEO of Public Knowledge, Gene Kimmelman. Before his time at Public Knowledge, Mr. Kimmelman served as the Director of the Internet Free Human Rights Project at the New America Foundation and as the Chief Counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice, antitrust division. He has also served as Chief Counsel on the staff of the Director for the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as the legislative director with Consumer Federation of America. </p><p>Mr. Kimmelman currently serves as an adjunct professor at Georgetown Washington University School of Law, a Senior Fellow at the Silicon Flatiron Center for Law, Technology and Entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado and on the boards of the International Media Support and Global Partners Digital. </p><p>He received his BA from a spectacular University, Brown University in Providence Rhode Island and his J.D. from the University of Virginia. </p><p>Our third witness is Sally Hubbard, the Director of Enforcement Strategy at the Open Markets Institute. Prior to her time with Open Markets, Ms. Hubbard was the senior editor of Antitrust Enforcement and Regulation of Tech Platforms at the Capital Forum. </p><p>She has also spent seven years as the Assistant Attorney General at the New York state office of the Attorney General's Antitrust Bureau. Ms. Hubbard earned her Bachelor of Arts at the college of William and Mary and her J.D. at New York University School of Law. </p><p>Our fourth witness on the panel is Matthew Schruers, the Vice President of Law and Policy at the Computer and Communications Industry Association. As Vice President, he advises Internet and technology companies on matters, including Internet law, intellectual property, competition and trade. </p><p>Additionally, he is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, the Georgetown Graduate School and the American University, Washington College of Law. </p><p>Mr. Schruers received his BA from Duke University and his J.D. from the University of Virginia Law School. </p><p>Our fifth witness is David Pitofsky, Executive President and General Counsel at News Corp, the son of the Dean of the Georgetown Law School when I attended it. Prior to joining News Corp, Mr. Pitofsky was a partner at Goodwin Procter, LLP, where he focused on white collar defense and securities litigation and enforcement. He's also served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, where he was the Deputy Chief of the criminal division. </p><p>Mr. Pitofsky is a member of the executive committee of the Federal Bar Council and an officer of the Federal Bar Foundation. He received his BA from the University of Michigan and his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center. </p><p>It is now my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from Georgia for our final introduction, Mr. Collins. </p><p>COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this is an interesting thing for my--from being a member of Congress now, be introducing a member of the press from my home state, which I am pleased to do. </p><p>It is an honor and privilege to welcome Kevin Riley, to Capitol Hill today. Kevin serves as the Editor of the Atlanta Journal Constitution in my home state of Georgia. Those of you from Georgia know the AJC is one of the best in the business. </p><p>Even though it is located in Atlanta, I would argue it is where the entire state of Georgia goes to get their news. </p><p>Kevin has served as Editor for nearly 10 years now, and has worked in the news industry for nearly 40. In 2001, the Newspaper Association of America named Riley one of the industry's 20, Under 40, up in commerce. And he is well known as an effective, collaborative and innovative leader. </p><p>But you know, sometimes, the resume needs to say a little more. So, we asked one of his reporters, Greg Bluestein of the AJC, that works for Kevin, to describe how he would describe his boss. I think it's very telling. </p><p>Kevin is the type of editor who encourages the reporters to experiment and try new things by doing it, himself. Shortly after the AJC unveiled a personal journey feature, he wrote a masterful story about a World War II veteran returning to the French battlefield, for the first time, since the fight, helping to unlock a 69-year-old mystery in the process. </p><p>And when we started getting deeply involved in the podcast, Kevin headlined a season of the breakdown show, focusing on the murders of two young Atlantans. As we in the newspaper industry face more demands to tell stories in different ways, Kevin has been our forefront of going on TV and radio to share our work. He goes on to say, I'm not just sucking up by saying this, Kevin is a perfect example of the case to lead. </p><p>And I think another one of your reporters, Tamar Hallerman, is here, as well, and probably would say the same thing. </p><p>The perfect cases lead by example and I can't think of a better complement. Earlier this year, before we even introduced the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, Kevin called to explain how this critical--critical this bill is for the AJC for communities across Georgia and for the entire newspaper industry. </p><p>Local journalism is a core part of every community in Georgia and nationwide. It is an honor to have a member of our local media here, today. </p><p>I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: And thank the gentleman. We welcome all of our very distinguished witnesses and thank you for participating in today's hearing. Now, if you would please rise, I will begin by swearing you in. </p><p>Please raise your right hands. Do you swear, or affirm, under penalty of perjury, that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct, to the best of your knowledge, information and beliefs, so help you God. </p><p>Thank you. Let the record reflect that the witnesses answered in the affirmative. You may be seated. </p><p>Please note that each of your written statements will be entered into the record, in its entirety Accordingly, I ask that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. And to help you stay within that time, there's a timing light on the table.  </p><p>When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals your five minutes have expired. </p><p>Mr. Chavern, you may begin. You are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>CHAVERN: Thank you. Chairman, Cicilline, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, Representative Armstrong and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to participate in today's hearing. </p><p>My name is David Chavern and I'm the President and CEO of the News Media Alliance, a nonprofit trade association, representing over 2,000 publishers, across the United States. </p><p>Our members include some of the largest news organizations, covering events around the globe, as well as local publishers, focusing on the issues that impact communities and the daily lives of citizens in every state and congressional district. </p><p>The news media has played a key role in our democracy, since its founding. The mission has been to enrich society's understanding and foster public discourse that is vital to a healthy democracy. And over the years, the news media has fulfilled that mission, extremely well.  </p><p>We are, also, an industry that has fully embraced a digital future. Publishers offer a wide array of innovative and compelling online experiences, sustained by truly great journalism. And my membership includes a number of digital only news publishers. </p><p>But the rise of digital news distribution has, also, introduced new and, potentially, existential threats to the news industry, specifically, the immergence of dominant tech platforms, as intermediaries between publishers and their audiences. </p><p>Online platforms serve an important purpose. Today, 93 percent of Americans get, at least, some of their news online. These platforms help users find great journalism. And in doing so, they have contributed to the enormous growth in news audiences, over the past two decades. </p><p>In the same way the digital platforms are critical for online news, online news is critical for the digital platforms. The public demand for quality journalism is massive and growing. And that has driven deep engagement with Facebook and Google. A study we released, yesterday, estimates that news content generated some $4.7 for Google, in 2018. </p><p>The platforms and news organizations mutual reliance would not be a problem, if not for the fact that the concentration among the platforms means that a small number of companies now exercise an extreme level of control, over the news. And in fact, a couple of dominant firms act as regulators of the news industry. Only these regulators are not constrained by legislative, or democratic oversight. </p><p>The result has been to siphon revenue away from news publishers. This trend is clear and, if you compare the growth in Google's total advertising revenue to the decline in the news industries ad revenue, in 2004, Google's U.S. revenue was $2.1 billion., while the newspaper industry accounted for $48 billion in advertising revenue. </p><p>In 2017, in contrast, Google's U.S. revenue had increased over 25 times to $52.4 billion, while the newspaper industry's ad revenue had fallen 65 percent, to $16.4 billion. </p><p>The effect of this revenue decline in publishers has been terrible and they have been forced to cut back on their investments in journalism. That is the reason why newsroom employment has fallen, nearly a quarter, over the last decade. </p><p>One question might be asked is, if the platforms are on unbalanced having such a negative impact on the news media, then why don't publishers do something about it? </p><p>The answer is, they cannot, at least under the existing antitrust laws. News publishers face a collective action problem. No publisher, on its own, can stand up to the tech giants. The risk of demotion, or exclusion from the platforms, is simply too great. </p><p>And the antitrust laws prevent news organizations from acting collectively. So, the result is that publishers are forced to accept whatever terms and restrictions are imposed on them. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, introduced by Chairman Cicilline and Ranking Member Collins, is an innovative, market-oriented solution to this collective action problem.  </p><p>Markets work best when both parties have some leverage to ask for better terms and to, credibly, withdraw from negotiations, if the other side's demands are unreasonable. </p><p>Our goal is, actually, to find a way to work, sustainably, with the online platforms to give Americans the best journalism possible. </p><p>Present trends in the news business simply cannot continue. Without some action to give news publishers a voice in their future, we will all experience the effects of deep financial stress in this industry and the loss of great important journalism in communities, across the country. </p><p>It is not too much to say that the very fabric of our civic society is at risk. And this is not a problem that will be solved by private charity from individuals, or even the big platforms, themselves. What we need are sustainable business relationships that return value to the great important journalists, who create the news content on which we all depend. </p><p>Again, thank you very much for having me here, today. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chavern. Mr. Kimmelman, you are now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, on behalf of Public Knowledge, I appreciate the invitation to testify today. </p><p>Your opening statements across the--across the board highlight what I think are the natural economic tendencies of what has happened in the digital marketplace. We have enormous sum cost in platforms that then return scale economies and scope economies to decline with in cost. It is, these are network affect industries. It's not new to our economy-this is a new form of it. </p><p>And what we see is a tendency towards a few companies dominating in that space, the natural economics of the space. </p><p>They've also highlighted the concern about gatekeeper rules and bottlenecks. And we have a history of this, of concern about this. And the history includes all of the media, including the newspapers for abusive power, when we've had too much concentration, too few players in the marketplace, too few independent voices that stifle the marketplace of ideas. </p><p>So, we've had these problems in the past with previous technologies, we are having them again, now. In some instances, antitrust has been the right tool to address them. In some instances, Congress has stepped in with other policy solutions. I urge you to consider all of that. </p><p>We have massive power here in the marketplace of ideas and it stems, both on the technology side and on the content and distribution side. I think all of its needs to be looked at. </p><p>It's important to fight against concentrated power and dominance, at all levels of the distribution chain and to maximize competitive market forces, particularly, when they involve the marketplace of ideas. Clearly, we need strong enforcement of the antitrust laws and we need to consider new laws. </p><p>I appreciate the committee stepping into begin this detailed study. But it's important that, as we attempt to stop these abuses where we find them, that we don't create new monopoly power, just to take on dominance. </p><p>It's critical to tackle dominance head on and not create more monopoly. The digital marketplace, as we all know, has totally transformed our lives. It has destroyed all kinds of brick and mortar players, industries, companies. And that includes classified and display ads in the print business. It's much broader than just news, news as being important. </p><p>What I'm afraid we need to confront is the money from that old model, from that business model will never come back. It is gone. I think journalism needs to consider a new business model and we should do everything we can with public policy tools to help. </p><p>The digital age will require new forms of creative financing, in order to get local news and fight misinformation in the marketplace. Public support will be necessary. </p><p>I urge you to consider creating some kind of public service duty of care to deliver trustworthy information, not subsidizing companies, or industries but instead, promoting fact checking information accuracy services that deliver value and that can be supported to protect local media and news, in particular. </p><p>In the digital platform space, I think what's most important is to look at those natural economic tendencies towards tipping towards dominance, creating barriers to entry that make it very difficult to foster competition and innovation in the market and examine whether anyone is putting their thumb on the scale, either in violation of the antitrust laws, or otherwise, principles of fairness in our society. </p><p>That's why your inquiry is important and I commend your effort to look, carefully, both at what the problems are and what the possible solution should be. Consumers themselves, are actually reinforcing the problem. We are on the negative side lazy but mostly, just complacent to do what's simple. That reinforces the power of those who have our attention, in the first place, and can find ways to make it very attractive for us not to consider competitive options, new options, better news, as opposed to just salacious information. </p><p>It's important that we look at all policy tools that are available to address these concerns. Antitrust can do something to try to improve enforcement but where you have dominance in markets, a few players that'll entry, often you need broader policy tools. I urge you to consider nondiscrimination, interoperability where there's bottleneck problems. We've done this in telecommunications, before. We've done it in the cable industry. This would not be a first for Congress. </p><p>Now is the time to consider it for digital platforms. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Kimmelman. The chair now recognizes Ms. Hubbard for her opening statement for five minutes. </p><p>HUBBARD: Chairman Cicilline and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to speak with you, today. </p><p>In my view as a former antitrust enforcer, the starving of journalism and the disinformation crisis are both in good part, monopoly problems. I've been writing about antitrust in tech platforms, since the summer of 2016, when I noticed that the tech giants, Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, were all doing the same types of things that Microsoft had been sued for, nearly 20 years earlier. </p><p>They were leveraging their market power to make fair competition impossible. These tech giants are gatekeepers that also compete against companies that must get through their gates to reach users. News publishers must get through Facebook and Google's gates. due to the two platforms' concentrated control over the flow of information. </p><p>But Facebook and Google compete against news publishers for user attention, data and ad dollars. They are controlling the game and playing it, too. </p><p>Publishers never had a fair shot, nor do they have bargaining power against the platforms. The platforms can cut them off with a simple tweak of their algorithms. Facebook and Google exploit their middleman positions to divert ad revenue away from publishers and into their own pockets. </p><p>And the platforms can hyper target users, based on their 360-degree views of what the users read, think and do, thanks to their ability to track users, across millions of websites, and even off-line. </p><p>Last year, Facebook and Google accounted for approximately 85 percent of the growth of the more than $150 billion digital ad market in the U.S. and the EU, according to Digital Content Next, which is a main trade association for publishers. </p><p>As for disinformation, Facebook and YouTube program their algorithms to prioritize engagement, which amplifies propaganda. Through surveillance, Facebook and Google learn what messages people are susceptible to, whether ads or propaganda. Then, they rinse out these manipulation machines to others, for huge profit. </p><p>The scale of the manipulation is massive because of Facebook and Google's dominance. And the platforms lack competitive pressure to fix the disinformation problem because the closest substitute for Facebook users is Instagram, which Facebook owns.  Users need to be able to vote with their feet and switch to alternatives.  </p><p>To their credit, Facebook and Google started on their path to dominance with innovation. But their monopoly power is not purely the result of competing on the merit. Facebook has repeatedly acquired rivals, including Instagram and WhatsApp. And Google's acquisition cemented its market power, throughout the ad ecosystem, as it bought up the digital ad market, spoke by spoke, including Applied Semantics, AdMob and DoubleClick. </p><p>Together, Facebook and Google have bought 150 companies, in just the last six years. Google, alone, has about nearly 250 companies. Thus far, antitrust enforcers have not stood in their way, nor have they stopped Facebook and Google from leveraging their monopoly power to exclude competition. </p><p>Week antitrust enforcement set the stage for these platforms to extract the fruits of publishers' labor. Much of monopolies are extracting wealth, across most sectors of our economy. Monopolies are putting the American dream at risk, as people, including journalists, are not rewarded for their efforts. </p><p>Beginning immediately, antitrust enforcers should prevent Facebook and Google from acquiring competitive threats and companies that fortify their monopoly power. They should unwind anti-competitive deals and divest subsidiaries to open up competition and they should sue to stop exclusionary practices. </p><p>Antitrust enforcement, alone, won't solve everything discussed here, today, but we won't be able to solve anything, unless we weaken monopolies' power. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition. </p><p>News is social good that is essential to hold power account. It was a journalist named Ida Tarbell that took down the most notorious monopoly in U.S. history, Standard Oil. </p><p>News deserves special production like it's had, throughout American history through non-discrimination and interoperability rules. </p><p>We also need rules to curb invasive data collection by default and to give citizens ownership of their data. The good news is we've been here before, as Gene pointed out. We have--these are not new challenges. We have stood up to powerful tech monopolists. Each time, we were better for it. We unleash new waves of innovation. </p><p>We've restored our markets and removed gatekeepers. But if we don't act now to change the structure of our markets, Titans will continue to control speech. Journalism will continue to whether and so will our democracy. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Ms. Hubbard. The chair now recognizes Mr. Schruers for five minutes. </p><p>SCHRUERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. On behalf of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, an association of technology, Internet and communications firms, I appreciate the opportunity to appear, today. </p><p>Let me begin by acknowledging that success bring scrutiny. Digital technology and the Internet has revolutionized the U.S. economy and the global economy. The industry leaders are names recognized around the world-some of the most prominent brands we know. </p><p>We welcome an evidenced driven conversation and examination of this transformation and the firms that are leading it. </p><p>But declining newspaper prospects are an independent phenomenon. Firms that date at the oldest from the 90s did not start this trend in the 80s, although, technology has challenged some news publishers' business models, in part, by ushering in extensive new competition, globalizing the advertising market and disrupting the dominant local advertising position that many publishers once had. </p><p>Because journalism is important to any democracy, we share the goal of ensuring that it continues. Digital services play an important role in doing that. And in fact, digital services provide benefits to three separate constituencies-users, news producers, and advertisers. </p><p>We know users attribute thousands of dollars in value to free of charge online services and turn to them for answers, entertainment, education, connection and communication and commerce. </p><p>These services also provide users with access to a range of news content, across multiple devices and formats in a way that enables participation, which surveys tell us, increase civic engagement and interest in news producers' content. </p><p>News producers, in turn, receive 10 billion viewers, a month, from digital services, traffic which they can monetize with digital tools. </p><p>Many publishers have embraced the Internet using technology to better engage their audiences. Numerous digital native news outlets have appeared and the Bureau of Labor statistics estimates that 13,000 employees worked in these digitally enabled newsrooms in 2017. </p><p>Digital services also enable and benefit advertisers. As the saying goes, an advertiser knows half his ad budget is wasted. He just doesn't know which half. With technology, advertisers can now figure out where their budget is best optimized and where their money actually is, in fact, wasted and direct funds, accordingly. </p><p>This is increasingly important for small firms who now have a global reach, regardless of the size of a business. So, how does antitrust law fit into this? </p><p>U.S. antitrust law focuses on maximizing consumer welfare. Enforcement seeks lower prices, higher quality, more innovation. </p><p>Separate policy goals are usually pursued elsewhere, through legislative means. And this ensures consistent in a political application of the law. </p><p>Law doesn't punish success. Instead, it applies additional obligations, when successful firms possess market power in a defined market. These markets aren't defined ad hoc by arbitrary line drawing. We use economics. We see if consumers respond to changes in prices, even factors like competition and substitutes. </p><p>Enforcers then assess whether a firm can unilaterally of these prices, or decrease quality. </p><p>I note that some digital firms are sometimes subjectively identified as say, being in the search, or social media market. But this is not necessarily a relevant market. Economic analysis, which show us the news publishers and digital services fight fiercely for add dollars. And indeed, that's one reason why we're here, today. </p><p>This intense intermedium competition is generally healthy. And undermining it with antitrust exemptions is unlikely to achieve the goal we all share. </p><p>Competitors collude prices will be higher, quality will decrease and innovation will slow. And the U.S. experience with antitrust exemptions for newspapers, specifically, is not encouraging. For the Internet, when broadcast threatened papers, which led to the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, we tried this. And it's widely regarded as having been unsuccessful. </p><p>Some argue the MPA actually fostered press monopolies. </p><p>So, in conclusion, let me remind us all that the Antitrust Modernization Commission of 2007 looked at many of these issues and considered them at length. They, as well as antitrust enforcers from both parties, have criticized antitrust exemptions.  </p><p>That being said, we do share the objective of promoting diverse, robust economically sustainable news production. Proposed alternatives, which are discussed in our testimony, include tax incentives and deductions, grants new nonprofit categories. All of these options deserve consideration and CCI welcomes the opportunity to participate in that conversation. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Schruers. Mr. Pitofsky is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>PITOFSKY: Chairman Cicilline, members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to speak with you, today. </p><p>My name is David Pitofsky and I'm the General Counsel of News Corp, the proud home of news publishers, like the Wall Street Journal and Harper Collins book publishers. </p><p>I'm here, today, because the marketplace for news is broken. Healthy markets incentivize risk, investment and effort, by rewarding companies that develop superior products. Unfortunately, in the news business, free riding by dominant online platforms, which aggregate and then re-serve our content, has led to a lion's share of online advertising dollars, generated off the back of news, going to the platforms. </p><p>Many in Silicon Valley dismiss the press as old media, failing to evolve, in the face of online competition. But this is wrong. We're not losing business to an innovator who has found a better or more efficient way to report and investigate the news. We are losing business because the dominant platforms deploy our news content to target our audiences to then turn around and sell that audience to the same advertisers, we're trying to serve. </p><p>The erosion of advertising revenue undercuts our ability to invest in high quality journalism. Meanwhile, the platforms have little, if any, commitment to accuracy or reliability. For them, a news article is valuable, if viral, not if verified. </p><p>To address these challenges, we need meaningful dialogue. It is, therefore, dispiriting when the platforms claim that their products only help consumers and publishers, ignoring the mounting facts clearly showing the harms they have inflicted on the news industry. </p><p>The fact is, news publishers have been busy innovating online, expanding our reach to digital audiences, while the dominant platforms have benefited from our innovation and premium content. </p><p>In part, this is made easier by the platforms' control over the Internet ad tech space. They control the tech infrastructure, the data and the tools used to sell and service ads online. And at the same time, they also compete against news publishers for those same add dollars. </p><p>News publishers have no good options to respond to these challenges. Any publisher that tried to withhold its content from a platform, as part of a negotiating strategy, would starve itself of reader traffic. In contrast, losing one publisher would not harm the platforms, at all, since they would have ample alternative sources for news content. </p><p>To escape this prisoner's dilemma, news organizations need to act collectively. But this is prohibited by antitrust law. So, what is the solution? </p><p>First, we need more dynamic and modernized antitrust enforcement. We are hopeful that invigorated, reinvigorated antitrust is on the horizon. After a generation of obsession with price effects, without adequate consideration of the other aspects of consumer and social welfare, including quality, innovation and choice, some very recent encouraging signs of re-examination have occurred. </p><p>Second, and in the meantime, news publishers need a fighting chance. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act is well designed to help restore the proper balance between content generators and distributors on the Internet. This bipartisan legislation is narrowly tailored, both in scope and duration. </p><p>I'd like to close by sharing a quote from my late father, Robert Pitofsky, who you mentioned earlier, Mr. Chairman. He was a giant in the antitrust law, in academia, in private practice and in government, where his service culminated in his term as chairman of the FTC from 1995 to 2001. </p><p>He recognized the need for antitrust regulators to give a higher degree of scrutiny to competition matters, implicating first amendment concerns, because of the implications for democratic values. </p><p>In a November, 2000, newspaper article on the topic, he was quoted as saying, antitrust is more than economics and I do believe that, if you have issues in the newspaper business, in book publishing, news, generally, entertainment, I think you want to be more careful and thorough in your investigation than if the same problems arose in cosmetics, or lumber or coal mining. </p><p>In a similar law review article from 1979, that has been happily rediscovered, he wrote, quote, \"It is bad history, bad policy and bad law to exclude certain political values in interpreting the antitrust laws.\" Close quote. </p><p>Informed by history, policy and political values, the antitrust laws should protect the pillars, both of our economy and our democracy. And there is no industry more central to our democracy than the news media. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Pitofsky. Mr. Riley is recognized for five minutes for his opening statement. </p><p>RILEY: Chairman Cicilline, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here, today. </p><p>I'm Kevin Riley, the editor of the Atlanta Journal Constitution. </p><p>A few years ago, journalists at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution established that 80 doctors in Georgia had sexually abused patients, including patients under anesthesia. And those doctors were still licensed. </p><p>The newspaper investigated and found a nationwide problem. Hundreds of doctors were abusing patients and getting away with it. The investigation prompted reforms. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. </p><p>And of equal importance, readers of that investigation told us that's what they want from their newspaper, that kind of coverage. </p><p>The victims of those doctors called our reporters and thanked them for telling their stories. </p><p>About a year before that story, dozens of educators in the Atlanta public schools had been found guilty of altering students standardized test scores in the largest cheating scandal in the nation's history. The convictions, culminated a years long journalistic effort by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. </p><p>AJC reporters had noticed that student scores on George's standardized test showed extraordinary improvement. They analyzed the scores. The improvements, in some schools, defied statistical possibility. </p><p>The reporting triggered a state investigation that found system wide cheating in 44 Atlanta public schools; 178 teachers and administrators participated. The test cheating inflated the scores of thousands of students, giving the false impression of progress. It cheated those students. </p><p>The story would never have been uncovered, without the AJC. Educators would never have faced justice. The system would not have been fixed. And most important of all, students wouldn't have been offered the chance to gain the knowledge that they had been denied. </p><p>No other news organization in Atlanta has the capacity for such deep reporting. No other organization could have withstood the relentless pressure to back off, unleashed by the school district and the business community. No other news organization would have stuck with the story for five years. </p><p>This kind of investigative reporting is hard. It's upsetting. It's important. It has real impact and we are proud of it. But newspapers do other important stories, too. I was reminded of one, last week, as I prepared for this testimony. </p><p>Let me tell you about the woman Congressman Collins mentioned. Her name is Shirley Sessions. She's the widow of a world war two veteran. They lived in Carrollton, Georgia. She spent decades trying to unearth the story behind her reticent husband's service. I've been able, myself, to discover many details about her husband's time in combat and I'd written about it. </p><p>After her husband died, Mrs. Sessions still hungered to know more about his service. She was so enthralled that she journeyed to France for a reunion of her husband's military unit. I joined her, bearing witness while a widow paid an inspiring tribute to her husband. </p><p>And the story I wrote about it brought AJC readers along on her emotional journey. She literally retraced the steps of that young private, the man who would later be her husband, through combat in tiny French towns, during World War II. </p><p>It was the unknown story of a local hero and one that only the Atlanta Journal Constitution could tell. It would be lost to history, without us. Mrs. Sessions sent me a text, as I prepared for this testimony. She said in part, your stories have become a touchstone in my life. I watched the coverage of D-Day, cried a lot but am more grateful than ever. </p><p>We invested a lot of time, money and effort in these stories I mentioned. That's what newspapers do. We use our resources to tell our community stories, the good ones and the hard ones. Telling them makes our community better. </p><p>I share these examples because they illustrate the everyday challenge faced by local journalists. We must be vigilant to tell important, well reported and thoughtful stories. We must care that they get wide distribution. That's our job and crucial to our communities. </p><p>We are accountable to people like Ms. Shirley and her neighbors in Carrollton, Georgia. </p><p>Almost always, the debate about media and tech is framed within a discussion of international news brands. But the greatest peril for our nation lurks at the local level, where a regional or community newspaper must cope with fast changing technological and financial matters. </p><p>We're the ones who are concerned with our communities, their government and their well-being. Our staffs live in our community. They have a big stake in informing the public. </p><p>Social media and technology companies have enormous influence on the distribution and availability of news. But we should be worried about losing newspapers, the fountainheads within the local news ecosystem. </p><p>It is worth considering stories that would go untold. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Riley. We will now proceed, under the five-minute rule, with questions. And we'll begin with the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, witnesses, for being here, today. And I'd like to extend a, particularly, warm welcome to the editor of my hometown paper, Mr. Riley, from the AJC. </p><p>The purpose of this hearing is to face an important problem, head on, the media from local newspapers to major publishers to online innovators is dying. </p><p>This is in some part, because of a shift in how we consume our news but it's also because of the mass availability of information on digital platforms. </p><p>While the news media's market presence is increasing, their revenue is decreasing. This is untenable. No business can prosper this way and no reasonable investor would want to get involved. We cannot continue to rely on the good grace of concentrated wealth to do the right thing. </p><p>A free market approach is applied to the duopolistic online platform gateway and its relationship to a free and diverse press is not working. </p><p>Moreover, it poses a direct and pressing threat to our Republic and, therefore, to our freedom. Something must be done to level the playing field and I'm looking forward to talking with all of you about potential solutions to this problem and I thank the chair for hosting this very important hearing. </p><p>Lastly, I will note that a free press, or that free press content, has a cost. And that price is profoundly expensive and could price freedom out of the fragile marketplace for freedom. </p><p>Mr. Riley, according to a recent Pew study, Americans have shifted from traditional media sources for local news to the television and Internet. Interesting local print news, in particular, has declined, resulting in massive downsizing at newspapers. In fact, newsroom staff declined by 45 percent, from 2008 to 2017. </p><p>How has the AJC worked to overcome this challenge? </p><p>RILEY: Well, thank you for that question, Congressman Johnson. And I think that one important point to make about the statistics that you cite, in terms of preference of news sources is this. </p><p>We are typical, I think, of most newspapers of our size and in a market similar to ours in this way. </p><p>Our audience has never been larger, than it is now. When you combine the people we have who read the printed newspaper and that audience that we can garner online, in our markets, we have more people reading the Atlanta Journal Constitution, than at any other point in our history. </p><p>The challenge, here, is sort of simple, which is in what kind of world do you grow your audience, reach a bigger market and somehow face even greater financial challenges than you did before. </p><p>Something's out of whack in that equation and it's just counterintuitive to how American business works where, when you invest and you succeed, you reap the benefits of that investment. That's the missing piece for newspapers. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you. What are your projections for the AJC and how has the digital platform presence--well, you've explained that? Let me move to my next question. </p><p>Mr. Chavern, how many local papers does your organization represent? </p><p>CHAVERN: Approximately 2,000, Sir. </p><p>JOHNSON: Is there any requirement in that local newspapers be prioritized on digital platforms? </p><p>CHAVERN: Prioritized in terms of the search, sir? </p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, in any respect. </p><p>CHAVERN: Yeah, there--there's no requirement that they be prioritized. But he digital audience, as was noted, is exploding, across the board. </p><p>JOHNSON: Mr. Pitofsky, one of the major issues in market dominance, today, is the ability to use individual's data in targeted advertising. How do you--how do the online giants control user data and why is it such a powerful phenomenon? </p><p>PITOFSKY: Thank you, Congressman. Advertising has changed profoundly, so that rather than reaching an audience, advertisers are now reaching individuals and to the degree that they are able to get more and more detailed data about those individuals, they can't send them targeted data. </p><p>So, the more data a company has, the more it can segment the market, the more it can deliver targeted ads. And the dominant platforms are light years ahead of other competitors, in terms of the amount of their data, thus, their dominance in the digital ad space. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Collins, for five minutes. </p><p>COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chavern, one of the interesting things and I've been asked this question a good deal, since we actually introduced it. And I think it's, but I think it's vitally important because sometimes we can put things out there but at the end of the day, if it's not actually a workable solution, then simply we're just talking about things and generating a lot of, you know, basically hype that doesn't actually end up in solving something. </p><p>I'm not a member of Congress who believes that we ought to just, you know, simply throw ideas out there but actually find ideas that could actually work. So, the question that has come up a great deal about this is, how can we be sure that any agreement that the news publications negotiate with these online platforms, under what we're proposing into this legislation, will be adequate and flexible enough to endure for a long time in this quickly evolving market. </p><p>I believe it's more than just right this minute. How does it play out, 10, 15 years down the road? </p><p>CHAVERN: Well, thank you, Representative. Obviously, there's never going to be guarantees about infinite solutions. But I think what there is a real chance for us to develop an enduring partnership with the platforms. Again, at the end of the day, the platforms, I view them as a solution, a potential solution for news and journalism, rather than a problem. </p><p>And I think the issues are well understood and pretty well defined. We have issues about revenue. We have issues about data. We have issues about algorithms and our brand. </p><p>But these are all things that I think are solvable, achievable and that I'm confident that we could develop a solution that would greatly support journalism for some significant period of time. </p><p>I don't think this is one of those issues that's not solvable. I think it's eminently solvable. </p><p>COLLINS: Would you also agree that this is an issue that both parties really, in a lot of ways, need each other, that this is not really one upset at the other and the other upset? You know, that there's not mutually exclusive positions here, that the online platforms need the local content spoken of by others and at the same point in time, the online and the local also need, you know, to have this, you know, this divergent technology, disruptive technology that it's been good in many, many ways. Do you see that as a symbiotic kind of relationship that should be, instead of an adversarial relationship? </p><p>CHAVERN: Yeah, absolutely. These are amazing, wonderful distribution platforms that, by the way, have allowed us to grow our digital audience larger than it's ever been, in terms of any audience. </p><p>And they need good content to engage their users and we need access to those users. It's just, in this world, where we can't act, collectively. That means that we have this problem of any one publisher really doesn't get a say in how its content is distributed to those users. </p><p>COLLINS: One of the things that we came up with last year in this committee worked, and my friend, Hakeem Jeffries, and I worked this for a long time, and that was the Music Modernization Act, which actually had a very similar kind of issue where you had the content owner in the disruptive technology, which has been great for many segments.  </p><p>But there was a disconnect because of many of our rules and many of the things going forward, where the content, and I think this is something that I've emphasized in this committee for years is, is that spark, that original idea, that content which both tech platforms have and also the local platforms do, as well. </p><p>It's something worth protecting. You can't, sort of, kill the goose with the golden egg. You can't go and say the one producing the content is bad and we're just going to keep taking, keep taking, keep taking because one of these days, they're not going to exist, anymore. </p><p>My hometown paper that I've grown up with for years, it was a seven day a week paper had, you know, just 20 years ago, had, you know, 25,000, 35,000, it's down, to now, only a five day a week paper. It could possibly, unfortunately, may go further. </p><p>Most of the district, my district, is a one paper, per county. But yet, at the same time, we do have Internet. We do have broadband issues. That's because of a very terrible carrier. But there are some other issues that we have there. </p><p>But as we look at that, you know, we need to make sure that both are involved in this. And I think that's the concern that I have. I think, as we go further in this process, knowing that there is the online capability, knowing what we've heard, so far. And this, I want this to be understood. And unfortunately, I've had to do a lot of interviews where it came at me, as if this was an adversary. These hold hearings are adversarial. Not really. They're just simply saying, from my perspective, what do we need to do in a perspective now? </p><p>I appreciate all the witnesses here, giving this directive, because when we engage, people win. When we start talking about this, we win. And I think that's the biggest win, you know, we have, going forward here. </p><p>With that, Mr. Chairman, again, thanks for this and thanks for the partnership on this bill. And let's look forward to continue to work together. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentleman for yielding back. I now recognize the gentlelady from Washington, Ms. Jayapal, for five minutes. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here. My--I represent a district that includes Seattle and, you know, we used to have a number of papers in Seattle. We are down to one, now. And so, and I'm also somebody who read the morning paper, like, the actual paper for a very long time. </p><p>But digital technology is amazing. And I'm continually astounded by the proliferation of information that feels like it's at our fingertips. I watched my child grow up immersed in the digital world. They know no other world. And they have access to a breadth of information that I think could never have been imagined, several decades ago. </p><p>My district is a hub of innovation. We have a lot of the tech companies are right there in the district. And there are these exciting new ways that I think we're finding to use technology and share information. </p><p>However, I will tell you that many of my constituents who work for those very tech companies want us to make sure that we are utilizing that technology with appropriate regulations. A very small number of companies exert a great deal of control over what news and information each of us sees when we go online, or we use our phones. </p><p>And those companies do have sophisticated systems that track what we do, where we're located, what we're interested in. It never ceases to amaze me, if I go to a shopping site, and I plug in something. And then, the very next day, I have five of that same thing constantly coming back at me to see if I'll buy it. </p><p>So, we know that our information is being monetized, that these companies are selling access to our attention to advertisers and using their own proprietary algorithms to determine what information articles we see and what we don't see. </p><p>And it's easy to forget that, when we do a very quick Google search for news about a particular topic, or we click on an article in our Facebook face, feed. It's easy to forget that, when we go online, or into our phones looking for good information, we are actually being controlled by those corporations and the algorithms that are being used. </p><p>So, Ms. Hubbard, let me start with you. You are an assistant attorney general for New York states antitrust division. You've also worked as a journalist. Which online platforms would you say are most impacting the public's access to trustworthy sources of journalism and why? </p><p>HUBBARD: Thank you for the question, Congresswoman. I think, in terms of disinformation, the platforms that are having the most impact our Facebook and YouTube. And that's because of their business models, which are to prioritize engagement, engaging content because of the human nature that, in a survival instinct, we tend to tune in two things that make us fearful, or angry. </p><p>And so, by reward has an engagement, these platforms are actually prioritizing disinformation, as well. It serves their profit motives to keep people on the platforms, as long as possible, to show them ads and collect their data. </p><p>And because they don't have any competition, they are free to pursue these destructive business models, without having any competitive constraint. They've also lacked regulation. Normally, corporations are not permitted to just pursue profits, without regard to the consequences. </p><p>JAYAPAL: So, let's go to that question of regulation. The Federal Trade Commission has repeatedly declined to interfere, as Facebook and Google have acquired would be competitors. Since 2007, Google has acquired Applied Semantics, DoubleClick and Admob. And since 2011, Facebook has acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. </p><p>What do these acquisitions mean for consumers of news and information. I think, sometimes, antitrust is seen and regulation is seen as something that's out there. But this has very direct impact for consumers. </p><p>Can you explain what that means, as these companies have acquired more and more? </p><p>HUBBARD: Sure. So, in my view, those, all of the acquisitions that you just mentioned were illegal, under the Clayton Act, which prohibits mergers that may lessen competition. </p><p>Looking back, it's clear that all of those mergers did lessen competition. And when you lessen competition, the harms to consumers are not just high prices, which are harder to see in the digital age, but it's loss of innovation, its loss of choice and loss of control. </p><p>So, when we approve anti-competitive mergers, consumers are harmed. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And do you think that the FTC--what do you think about the FTC's current work around these? Do you think the FTC should be doing more, and how? </p><p>HUBBARD: I definitely think the FTC should be doing more. I think there's a possibility of unwinding some of the mergers that are now, obviously, illegal, now that we have the evidence, particularly, Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. There have been public documents showing that Facebook had identified WhatsApp, as a competitive threat, using its VPN technology, and that it, also, deceived the European Commission. </p><p>And likely, I don't know if it told anything different to U.S. regulators but it has been fined for deceiving the European Commission saying it couldn't share data between WhatsApp and Facebook. So, I do think that the FTC needs to do much more, in this regard. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you. I see my has expired. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentlelady. I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong, for five minutes </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I, especially, appreciate Mr. Riley talking about small town papers because, if large publishers are having this problem, you can about imagine how adversely affected smaller publishers that do business in North Dakota are, by this issue. </p><p>And my first grown up job was coaching our summer American Legion baseball team. And I learned two--two things, very early in life, when dealing with the press and dealing with the kids of parents. One, you never get in trouble for what you don't say and, two, you should always criticize in private and praise in public. </p><p>So, I've carried those with me for a long time and I--so I appreciate that. But just earlier, we had heard, so, Mr. Chavern and Mr. Pitofsky and Mr. Kimmelman talk about antitrust. And so, we assume that we know that there's exist competition problem in the market. But we already have longstanding remedy and that's antitrust enforcement, if necessary. </p><p>And I think there might be a little disagreement about whether that is actually sufficient. So, supporters of this bill will argue that we need an exemption from antitrust laws, which allows them to come together to negotiate terms.  </p><p>Why should we enact the Journalist Competition Act, as opposed to just enforcing antitrust law? And I'll just start with Mr. Chavern. </p><p>CHAVERN: Well, thank you, very much. You know, the current antitrust laws protect Google and Facebook from us, interestingly, which is both wrong and ironic, from our perspective. </p><p>What we're suggesting is really what we view as the lightest touch option on the table, in terms of giving us the power, just to stand up for ourselves. </p><p>And also, I have to note there's a real urgency in the industry, currently. This is an industry that really can't wait years and years for antitrust solutions. We're at a crisis point now. And what we're asking for is relatively simple, relatively straightforward. We're not asking the government to regulate anyone, or tax anyone. We're just really asking we be left alone to defend ourselves. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you. Mr. Kimmelman. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: So, I do think antitrust can help. I think we've had a lapse in antitrust. Ms. Hubbard referred to it. I don't know about specific cases. It's always easier in hindsight to say something was anticompetitive. Hard to tell at the time. </p><p>But there is no doubt that we've had under enforcement and we need stronger enforcement. I do not believe it solves this problem. It certainly doesn't solve an immediate crisis. </p><p>But I do worry that you should look very carefully at whether the kind of negotiation that Mr. Collins was talking about, and the way it would happen is what would actually happen in the marketplace. I am not all sure that's how it would work. I am not at all sure who is a news content creator. </p><p>You have wonderful news creators here in front of you, today. There are tabloids, there are a lot of purveyors of, there are a lot of bad people out there, too. So, I just think this is very complicated. You ought to take a very careful look at what would actually create a better marketplace dynamic. I actually believe there are better ways to do this but it requires a different approach. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And Mr. Pitofsky. </p><p>PITOFSKY: Yes, I would say that antitrust has been interpreted relatively narrowly, for the last 40 years. And these markets are presenting new challenges. It's going to take time and this committee's investigation is helping move in that direction of understanding how these new markets work. </p><p>So, for example, when some of these mergers were approved, some of the people objecting raised privacy concerns but the regulators felt that privacy was not an area that antitrust could cover. </p><p>I think, as we've had experience with these platforms, we understand that privacy is an aspect of product quality. All of the users of these tools have expectations that those tools carry privacy that's in their interest. And antitrust just hasn't really stretched its muscles in a long time to understand those kinds of quality issues. And it's going to take a while. The facts are complicated. The law is complicated. Judicial precedence need re-examination. And so, the bill is a good short-term remedy, while the larger issues are tackled. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Ms. Hubbard, do you want to talk? </p><p>HUBBARD: I agree with Mr. Pitofsky. I caution what--I worry about what Mr. Kimmelman is saying, that sometimes, when we say things are too complicated, it's a way of not doing anything. And that's what we've been saying in this space, for a long time. Where we've seen regulators around the world and enforcers around the world address this problem. And we've just been sitting back worrying, it's too complicated. </p><p>And I think it's important to take action quickly and not keep kind of viewing complication as a reason to do nothing. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I agree with that. I don't think too complicated is ever an answer. But I would also say, and this is not an apples to apples comparison but we're going to get to watch this play out a little bit, because the EU just adopted really strict internet rules and one of the goals was to increase and remove barriers to entry. </p><p>But by holding the platforms, themselves, liable for copyright violations, they may have--the cure may, actually, be worse for them, than the disease. And time will tell but automatic filter programs and scrubber programs that YouTube, such as YouTube uses, because you mentioned YouTube earlier, are incredibly expensive to run. And so, plus, I mean, at least in the EU, it's not quite the same. And I'm sorry for going over, I didn't do an opening statement. </p><p>CICILLINE: No, no, I'm not trying to gather you down, yet. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: But they, I mean, well, they passed the rules. Each member country is going to have to promulgate their own laws, in association with those rules, which can cause all kinds of problem and companies are going to have to operate in that patchwork of different laws, or just follow the most strict laws of any of those countries. Or probably the worst-case scenario is not do business in some of those countries. </p><p>So, when you come from a small state and knowing that states like California and New York will dictate a marketplace, you always get concerned about that. So, I agree with you but we are going to get to watch it. </p><p>HUBBARD: Can I respond really quickly that we do have a tool that we've had for a very long time, which is the antitrust laws. So, before you're looking at, kind of, different solutions that Europe is pursing, we've used antitrust laws against Microsoft. It led to innovation. </p><p>Many people say, if it weren't for our antitrust enforcement against Microsoft, Google would never actually have been able to come on to the scene. So, it's not actually a novel problem or a novel tool So, we have these tools. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: No, and I agree, which is why I asked the antitrust question to start the questioning process. Sorry about that. I yield. </p><p>CICILLINE: No, no. I now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Demings, for five minutes. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all of you for being here with us, today. Mr. Chavern, we talked about many newspaper publishers have seen significant growth in digital subscriptions but yet, they continue to struggle. And many have shut down, which is truly unfortunate. </p><p>Would you please talk a little bit about why the news industry continues to struggle, despite the increase in online readership and digital subscription? </p><p>CHAVERN: Certainly. Thank you. Again, the audience--our audience is both growing and moving very quickly to online spaces. And those spaces are dominated by just a few companies that take the vast bulk of the advertising revenue. Determine everything about the experience you get with your news publisher. </p><p>Again, I call them our regulators because they get to decide what news is delivered to who and when, how the news is delivered to me is different than the news delivered to you. And whether we can monetize it and on what terms. </p><p>DEMINGS: I think it's so important for everyone to hear your words on that topic. Please go ahead. </p><p>CHAVERN: They are incredible and powerful advertising engines that do great targeted advertising, often around our content. And they take the bulk of the digital advertising revenue. </p><p>So, really, the rules of the game for online engagement of news are set up against content creators, publishers. But again, one of the things we do know is that people love news. The audience is bigger than ever. It drives a lot of engagement. And certainly, the platforms know this. </p><p>DEMINGS: Interesting what we define as news these days. But please, go ahead. </p><p>CHAVERN: The platforms know this. They know that people go online to consume that product and then, they get to make money, monetize them to our detriment. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you. Ms. Hubbard, some researchers have estimated that, for every dollar in advertiser spends on digital ads, only $.30 go to the publisher, meaning that ad tech mediaries (SP) could be capturing around 70 percent of all digital ad spending. </p><p>What, if anything, does the 70 percent figure tell us about the market. I'd love to hear from you about that? </p><p>HUBBARD: Yeah, as an enforcer, I would say, as a former enforcer, I would say that 70 percent cut shows that there is extraction that's happening and it's not, there's not fair bargaining power between the press and the tech platforms because that is not, you know, a fair price. It's a monopoly rent, really. </p><p>DEMINGS: And why is the fair bargaining power so important to this industry and to the consumers? </p><p>HUBBARD: Right, so, as I said, you know, throughout the economy, when you don't have--when you have such concentrated markets, there's a lack of bargaining power. That means that everyone else has to play by the terms of the dominant companies. </p><p>And we're talking about the press here, which is so critical to our democracy. We do not want them playing but the terms of dominant companies. It's, you know, critical that they have bargaining power and can have a fair deal with getting this important content to the world. </p><p>DEMINGS: And finally, Mr. Riley, you know, the 20-second soundbites are fine and being able to click on a lot of different things, which you, many times, they really don't have the same effect as a headline does. But there's just something about reading the newspaper. I believe you get, not half of the story, you get more of the whole story. </p><p>And I heard an editor say, once, that--and the other big benefit is that you may bump into another story that you had no intentions on reading. I think an informed America is a better equipped and a smarter America. </p><p>Could you tell me, what is lost, when a local, or regional newspaper goes out of business and what effect does that have on local community? You've shared two very powerful stories with us, today. But when a newspaper goes out of business, what's that effect on a local community? </p><p>RILEY: Well, let me try to explain it this way. You know, there were several references to the engagement of citizens and voting and that sort of thing. But let me give you a real-world Georgia example. You know, we cover the state. We have a big group of reporters who cover the state legislature in Georgia, when it's in session. </p><p>And I try to go down there, each year, and spend a day with our reporters and editors who do that, so that, you know, I can meet the legislators and really, get a good idea of the work. </p><p>Well, I've been down there, and sometimes it feels like we, our reporters are the only ones there. And what's happened is it's gotten too expensive to send reporters from Macon, or Valdosta, or Columbus, Georgia. And what kind of--that's not good, that's not good for our democracy. That's not good for Georgia. That's not good for any of those communities because of what's happening in the industry. </p><p>And I, I'll be honest with you, not good for us because the competition, we'd like to see them around and it would make us better and we'd all be better. The state would be better and all those local communities would be better. </p><p>And that's the kind of real word example. I mean, it's all of this discussion about these complicated issues. That's how it really plays out. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much. I'm out of time. Mr. chair, I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentlelady. Just to advise the witnesses on the panel, they have called votes. We only have two. So, we're going to have Mr. Gaetz, the gentleman from Florida, do his questioning, then we'll briefly adjourn, go vote, quickly, and come right back. </p><p>And I apologize for the inconvenience. Mr. Gaetz is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>GAETZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I believe that we are presented with an historic opportunity here, where right wing populists and left-wing populists have joined together, under Chairman Cicilline's leadership, to attempt to change the way that consumers interface with major technology platforms. And in a committee that so often sees division, it's nice to be working together toward such an important goal. And it truly is historic that we are working together. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, it seems as though there are three ways that the consumer experience can be altered. Initially, technology companies can voluntarily choose to be more transparent with consumers about their data and information and they could choose to act in better faith with partners in the news industry. </p><p>The second way is that, through investigations and hearings like this, we would be able to animate the Department of Justice to engage in more rigorous enforcement of existing antitrust laws. And then, the third option would be a legislative option. </p><p>So, obviously, someone's voluntary action is self-evident. But Mr. Pitofsky, if our goal here, were the second of, sort of, the three legs of the stool I outlined, to animate the Department of Justice and their antitrust enforcement, what specific guidance would you give, in that light? </p><p>PITOFSKY: I think that the committee's goal of investigating is a very good first step. There's a lot of rapacity in these markets. There's a lot that's not understood about fees that are taken out, through the ad tech stack, about how the algorithms work, about how they're structured, if they are, in fact, structured to benefit consumers, as the platforms say, or if they're structured with the intent of blocking competition. </p><p>So, I think the most important first step is for the committee to really dig into the facts and bring some transparency-- </p><p>GAETZ: --Turning that transparency is an objective, a virtuous one, one that I believe in. What specific types of allegations would you want the Department of Justice to lay out to achieve that outcome? </p><p>PITOFSKY: Well, to coin a phrase, I think I'd follow the money, at this point. The engine of these platforms is the advertising that they sell. And the amount, the paucity of competition, the fact that they're able to extract so much from that ad tech stack, suggests something fundamentally broken. And a lack of competition in those markets, which are the key profit generators of the businesses. So, I think I would go with the ad tech, first. </p><p>GAETZ: That's very helpful. And Mr. Chavern, I'm going to ask you a question about, my sort of, the third leg of the stool, the legislative options that we have available to us. And I know we can enforce our antitrust statutes but another element of the Communication Decency Act applies to major technology platforms and doesn't apply to the people you represent, Section 230. </p><p>Section 230, as I understand it, and I'm happy to be corrected by others, would say that, if a technology platform is a neutral public platform, that they enjoy certain liability protections that newspapers don't enjoy, that News Corp doesn't enjoy, with its assets. </p><p>And so, does it make the anti-competitive posture of technology platforms more pronounced that they have access to this special liability protection that the people you represent don't have access to? </p><p>CHAVERN: Oh, absolutely. There's a huge disparity, frankly, when our content is delivered through these platforms. We get the liability and they get the money. So, that's a good deal from that and. </p><p>You know, we, we're responsible for what we publish. You know, publishers can and do get sued. On the other hand, the platforms are allowed to deliver and monetize this content with complete lack of responsibility. </p><p>I think that is a disparity that will have to be addressed. I think Section 230 had a reason a raison d'etre, at the beginning. I think, particularly, with regard to the massive platforms, I think it's time to relook at that. </p><p>GAETZ: Thank you. And Mr. Chairman, that is very instructive testimony, I think, because as we look at the ways to rebalance the scale, there is legislation that you've introduced with Mr. Collins to give the people before us the ability to ban together in that negotiating practice.  </p><p>But I hope we wouldn't exclude from our gaze, the other statutory advantages that are baked into these business models that, as Mr. Chavern says, shift liability to one particular segment of the industry while, at the same time, giving others liability protection, in absence of the transparency that Mr. Pitofsky noted that would demonstrate that they are worthy of that liability protection. </p><p>And so, I'm not--I agree with Mr. Chavern that I'm sure there was a virtuous reason for Section 230. There's likely an incarnation of Section 230 that would fulfill that initial obligation. But in the absence of the transparency that requires these platforms to show that they are a neutral platform and that they are not putting their thumb on the scale, either in the way they operate their business, or the way they control content, I just think that's an important part of the legislative function. </p><p>And I will finally add, I am grateful that the President has tried to enhance the voluntary actions of some technology platforms by pointing out where he sees bias in that. So, again, among those three things, I look forward to our great work. </p><p>I yield back to the chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: You're doing very well with that final comment, Mr. Gaetz. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>No, I think you're absolutely right and I want to reassure you that this investigation is intended to look at a broad range of practices on these platforms and a broad range of remedies. So, I look forward to working with you on that, as well. </p><p>And we'll just stay in stand in recess, very briefly. </p><p>(RECESS) </p><p>CICILLINE: (OFF-MIC) I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Miss bath, for five minutes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to say to everyone let's hear testifying today, thank you so much. I really appreciate you being here. And because I do represent Georgia's sixth congressional district, I'd like to give a warm welcome, special thank you to fellow Georgian, Mr. Riley.  </p><p>Mr. Riley, your written testimony examines the decline in competition in the Georgia press. What has that meant for the information that Georgians are going to receive, Georgian citizens, about their government at all levels? </p><p>RILEY: Thank you for the question, Congresswoman. And in a way, I guess you could probably answer it after that spirited campaign in the sixth district. I think it was clear that, you know, the Atlanta Journal Constitution, we devoted an awful lot of our folks to covering that. And I mentioned that because, see, I think that's what can be lost, you know, crucial elections where other news organizations may not be in a position in different parts of Georgia to exhaustively cover campaigns to vet the candidates, to deal with the controversies, to sort through potentially misleading television ads, that sort of thing.  </p><p>So and I think also think it--we--it creates a situation where we are not competing with each other as new news organizations as much and we--and as has been acknowledged. I mean, everyone is better off with true competition. And I mention that as well because that's what has made the American press such a powerful part of our democracy for our countries existence. We have always had a healthy, vibrant press and I think that we can point to that and recognize it's part of the reason our country has enjoyed so much success. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. So Mr. Riley, I've heard from editors and journalists that they really value their brand reputation, and I understand a lot about brand, and that readers can trust their content. And of course, we all know that in our online world, misinformation is always a click away. What are some of the ways that online platforms could help the AJC maintain that relationship with its readers and help readers know that they are getting information from a reliable source? </p><p>RILEY: Well, I'm going to offer you a brief answer to that and then suggest Mr. Chavern jump in because he has spent a lot of time on this issue. But one of the things that's important to us as a media organization is that it's clear when users of any service come to our content that it's clear to them that it's from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. And all that that means to people in terms of its accuracy, its fairness, and its--how well presented that it is. And when it's confusing to anyone about the source of content, we do invite that idea of misinformation and people struggling to get to the truth. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. And would you like to add to that, please? </p><p>CAVERN: Sure. The--there's always been crazy conspiracy theories. The usually were delivered to us by a crazy uncle over the dining room table and you knew that was different than was in the newspaper and what was on TV. And the Internet platforms, often these--all the indicators are about brand are suppressed. And that's not only bad for my members in the publishing business because we are--where in the trust business, it's bad for the public because they lose signals about where information is coming from. So brand suppression is a serious issue that we--that does need to be addressed with the platforms. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. And Mr. Pitofsky, some have argued that reforms to preserve local journalism could have the effect of causing higher prices for advertisers, including small businesses. Do you buy that argument? Why or why not? </p><p>PITOFSKY: I don't buy that argument. I think the lack of competition in the ad tech space for digital advertising is raising prices for advertisers. And if there was more competition in the space, the various platforms competing with each other would need to give--offer better deals to one another. I don't know if you've seen--if you have it here that Uber and Lyft are constantly sending notifications to their writers of special deals, and that's healthy competition. That's them having to give better deals to their customers to get their business. I think that's what we'd see if we introduced more competition into the ad tech space. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. And for any of you, are there reforms that could preserve and promote journalism, also ensuring that small businesses have access to affordable advertising? And anyone of you I'd love to hear from. </p><p>SCHRUERS: If I may, Congresswoman. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. </p><p>SCHRUERS: So as mesh as my testimony notes, leaders in industry as already committed hundreds of millions of dollars to supporting advertising initiatives and provide tools that are currently allowing news publishers to monetize their content. The rate at which that revenue is usually split is 70/30. I know that was cited previously in the hearing saying that news publishers are receiving 30 percent. The figure is right. Who is getting the amount is wrong.  </p><p>The split is traditionally 70 percent going to the news publishers, and that's substantiated by a UK government report cited in my testimony as well as a number of other publicly available sources. All that being said, we recognize that more can be done to promote news journalism and, as our testimony suggests, there is a variety of sources of solutions, including tax treatment for incentives or deductions, as well as nonprofit status and, of course, grants beyond what our industry has been providing to various programs for journalism promotion. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you so much. I yield the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentlelady. I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for posting this bipartisan hearing. I certainly appreciate the bipartisan nature of the questions and certainly appreciate the witnesses testifying today on such an important topic. A thriving and diverse press, as we all know, is that gateway for so many of our communities to learn about and participate in our political discourse. In a world in which three out of four Americans now access their news online through two platforms, multiple newspapers are being forced to merge or shut down.  </p><p>Local newspapers have seen the biggest negative impact, as we've heard, from many of our witnesses today. Since 2007, we've lost nearly 1800 newspapers, 500 from rural communities. One of those was my state's very own Rocky Mountain News, Colorado's oldest newspaper, which closed down in 2009. And we also know from empirical studies that when communities are left with no local newspaper, there is a direct correlation to lack of community engagement and government accountability, and so that's why, again, today's hearing is so important. And certainly the testimony and the questions have been posed underscore that fact. Mr.--is it Shures (SP)? </p><p>SCHRUERS: Schruers. Thank you. </p><p>NEGUSE: Sure. I apologize. Mine's a tough one. It's Neguse, so it's-- </p><p>SCHRUERS: --I feel your pain. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you for being here. I have a couple of questions for you. So first I want to talk about your comments regarding antitrust exemptions. I reviewed your testimony. My sense, based on your testimony, I will quote, you note a couple of things. You say, \"Attempts to exempt certain industries from complying with these antitrust protections have negatively affected consumers and the economy as a whole.\"  </p><p>You later talk about the fact that, while you agree that there needed to be potential solutions that antitrust suit exemptions have been proven to be \"An inadvisable solution to business model challenges of news publishers.\" So I take it from your testimony, you're not a fan of antitrust exemptions. I--am I safe in presuming that you would then agree also that the firms you represent, the companies represent, that they are to--that they also are subject to the antitrust laws? Because obviously, you have a variety of them have made arguments in the past that they were not. Is that a fair-- </p><p>SCHRUERS: --The firms we represent are subject to antitrust enforcement, just like any other that doesn't benefit from an exemption. </p><p>NEGUSE: And I presume you would oppose any effort legislatively to try to draw up an exemption for those firms. Fair to say? </p><p>SCHRUERS: CCIA has never supported antitrust exemptions of any kind. And in fact, we argued against them during the antitrust modernization commission that I cite in my testimony. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you. That second point I'd like to follow up on was regarding the ad revenue piece, because I just want to clarify for my own understanding and the record, your--and I missed the exchange regarding the 70/30 split. My understanding from your testimony is the example they are siding relates to Google. Does that same ratio apply to the other companies or is that-- </p><p>SCHRUERS: --Thank you for the question, Congressman. So Google has publicly stated that on a few equations occasions. The Cairncross (SP) report that I identify sites revenue splits between other major Internet services that are at 70 and above. Depending on the particular product, that being used by different platforms, and some cases it's 85 or even 100 percent of that revenue is retained by that news publisher. So it varies greatly by the platform. I know of no revenue split whereby the news publisher only receives about 30 percent. I'm not saying there aren't some, but that these reports that are cited-- </p><p>NEGUSE: --I'm going to--I have limited time, but I appreciate your answer. I guess I would be interested in, and perhaps we can follow up on this after the hearing in getting a detailed breakdown of that revenue sharing across firms because I just--it's painting with a broad brush citing one single example I think is--is not advisable.  </p><p>The last piece I would just--so on page 3 of your testimony, your written testimony, you talk about the benefits, the fact that social media platforms in particular have offered unique functionalities and features, which have redefined user involvement. \"Users may share and amplify the reach of new stories,\" and help, \"Road test journalist story ideas.\" And you talk about that in a favorable sense.  </p><p>The footnote, and I went up because I was struggling to kind of understand who would promote this idea that protesting journalists ideas or journalist stories, I should say, is a good approach to journalism. You cite a study that was called the future newsroom, University of Melbourne September 2017. It's on page 3, footnote 9. And in the parenthetical, you state this study essentially stands for the proposition noting publications use of Twitter to road test story ideas where high engagement was taken as a sign to publish a story. Do you know who commissioned the study? </p><p>SCHRUERS: I do not, no. </p><p>NEGUSE: So I would encourage you to look it up. Facebook commissioned this study. I Googled that and found on page 2 that it was commissioned. And I'm not--I say that only because a lot of the discussion we have had in this committee over the course of the last several months, as you may well know, has been around election interference by foreign adversary in 2016. And so much of that related to social media disinformation and precisely these types of actions where engagement on Twitter is used to proliferate, right, and propagate stories that happened to be false.  </p><p>And I guess what I would just--I would caution that I don't--I think there is reason to be concerned about this notion that road testing and using the engagement on Twitter as a sign as to whether or not the stories should be, you know, further published, that that is the true test of success or barometer of success I just think is--is not a tenable position, in my view. And I'm happy to give Mr. Riley and Mr. Pitofsky a chance to respond to that question. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired, but the witnesses may answer the question. </p><p>RILEY: I'm not familiar with the study, and I do know that a lot of times in some of the social media platforms on the same story, people will experiment with different headlines or invite users to make suggestions. To me, that's sort of a tangent to the core thing that we really worry about with local journalism, which is getting out there, finding out what's really going on, digging deep into it and making sure we get it to an audience. But again, I'm not familiar with the study. </p><p>PITOFSKY: I would just add that some of your earlier questions pointed up a factual dispute in the room, which is the percentage of fees that go to the publishers versus the platforms, which is a critical fact. I would encourage the committee, as part of its investigation, to look there because it's a profound question and there's a lot of disagreement. I think you're going to find the statistics are closer to the ones cited by the congresswoman earlier in the proceedings. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. I now recognize myself for five minutes. Mr. Schruers, I just want to start with you. Google captures 88 percent of the US online search market, 94 percent of all searches on smart phones, 78 percent of that search ad tech market, and 59 percent of the third-party display ad market. I take it you agree that these don't at least on their face appear to be competitive markets. </p><p>SCHRUERS: Which precise market are we talking about? </p><p>CICILLINE: Well, let's start with searches on smart phones. 94 percent of the market controlled by one platform. You agree that's not competitive under any definition. </p><p>SCHRUERS: Well, I think I would say 94 percent of a relevant market would--would be something worthy of considering, but I think-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --You think a mobile search ad market is not a relevant market? </p><p>SCHRUERS: I think the relevant market in that case would be what economists would tell us compete with that. And I know that searching on my phone in the browser I can also search on my phone by asking Siri, I can search talking to the digital assistant smart speaker in my room. There are a lot of places that users today can go to get answers that extend beyond the browser search experience. And these are increasingly page-less tools that don't require a search engine. So you know, I think there's--economists might not agree that--that desktop search is a discrete market-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --I don't actually know any economist who doesn't agree that that's not a competitive market. I guess I'm asking you. Do you agree that that's not a competitive market when it's operating at 94 percent of the market share? </p><p>SCHRUERS: I think 94 percent of the market share of a relevant market is something that merits consideration. </p><p>CICILLINE: Yeah, okay. </p><p>SCHRUERS: I guess the question is whether that's a market. </p><p>CICILLINE: International competition authorities have found that Google has given preferential treatment to its own services in the online shopping and online search markets. Do you see or do you at least acknowledge a risk of self-preferential treatment in the digital ad market? </p><p>SCHRUERS: So the--well, let me start by saying I think that's a reference to the European case and, obviously, European antitrust law is not the same as a U.S. antitrust law and, as I understand it, is actually stricter on the question of self-preferencing. If we are-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --But I'm asking you--set aside I'm asking you whether or not the conduct, self-preferential treatment, whether or not that in fact is--there is a risk of that in this market and whether there are currently is any way for a publisher to identify this self-preferential treatment. </p><p>SCHRUERS: So I don't have sufficient information about the internal decision-making of any of our companies to speak to precisely that issue, but I would be concerned about a rule that says, for example, that the grocery store can't put its own grocery store brand products at eye level in the store because that's where they find more-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Yeah, I don't think anyone is contemplating a rule that does that. It would be helpful though, as this investigation is undertaken that we at least agree to a common set of facts. And so we'll figure out kind of solutions later on in the process, but I think that sort of fact-finding evidence gathering is really important. You encouraged caution when enforcing antitrust against big tech platforms, but in many ways, I think our caution is what we had for the last decade, which I think has resulted in the emergence of advertising monopolies, and I think many of us think it's time to try something different, in any event.  </p><p>But Ms. Hubbard, I'd ask you, the Press Gazette recently reported that a single algorithm change at Google resulted in Google director traffic to the male online that it caused it to fall by 50 percent. Nick Thompson, the editor of Wired shared that a single tweet by Facebook led Facebook-based traffic to Wired to drop by 90 percent. How does this power dynamic, the fact that a platform can effectively shut off a publishers traffic affect the independence of the press and, you know, the ability of people to access trustworthy, reliable news? </p><p>HUBBARD: Well clearly, it's a monopoly problem because no one company should have the ability to decide which publications can exist and which ones can't. And this ability to turn off basically the traffic to any publisher is hugely problematic from a democracy standpoint because it basically is a shield for criticism. There are a lot of people who are never--are not a journalist, are not even going to have the courage to speak out and criticize big tech in the first place knowing that this can be done. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. Mr. Kimmelman, on several leading economists have commented that antitrust enforcers have been too permissive of mergers that involve a loss of competition among nascent rivals or potential competitors. For example, Dr. Kal Shapira (SP), the University of California Berkeley has noted that Google's acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007 and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 are examples of mergers that involve the loss of competition.  </p><p>Do you believe agree, and if so, how can merger enforcement be tightened to address these concerns, and also, you note in your written testimony that we can't rely on antitrust alone to address the problems of platform power? And I wondered if you'd share what tools you think Congress has traditionally used to promote competition and communication markets and what we ought to be thinking about as we confront these challenges. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: So Mr. Chairman, I do think that a potential competition is an area of dramatic under enforcement. When I was at the Justice Department, we did raise concerns about Comcast purchase of NBCU, at the time, and raised the question of impact on online video distribution. It was not the first time, but it was very seldom that that tool was used. I think auntie trust enforcers you need to use it much more aggressively.  </p><p>I think going back and looking at those transactions, there probably are some that ought to be reviewed now to determine whether they were rightly decided, whether there's a basis under antitrust law to revisit those, but potential competition is critical and I'd say most importantly in the marketplace of ideas where you have communications platforms that are the most critical way in which we get content for our news and information. We ought to be most careful to be promoting as many entrants, as much potential competition as possible. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. I just want-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: --(OFF-MIC)  </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Chavern, I just want to ask one final question. You know, I think you made reference to the increasing number of people that obtain their news from digital services, record, you know, participation by subscription, lots of interest and engagement in news, so huge increase in consumer and in customer use of your product, but declining revenues. But I think Mr. Schruers as sort of said that's just the way it is, that's just the market. That's just sort of the moment we are in. What's your response to that? </p><p>CHAVERN: Present trends can't continue. If we continue on this path, we are going to lose mass amounts of quality journalism, particularly in communities all around the country. That's not just a bad business outcome, that is utterly disruptive to our civic society. It can't be allowed to happen. And what we've asked for is a chance, a chance for a different kind of future, and we need that future collectively. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chavern. Before--I can ask unanimous consent right now? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. </p><p>CICILLINE: I would like to ask unanimous consent to allow a member of the--not a member of the--a member of the full judiciary committee, but not a member of that subcommittee who has joined us, the gentle lady from Texas be allowed to ask a question. Without objection, so ordered. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for the journey that you have started this subcommittee on. And out of your courtesies, I hope to be able to join you as you make this journey. Forgive me for my delay, but I was in the rules committee, which is a long process dealing with ongoing amendments. I serve on the full committee for a pretty long time and have served in this committee in the past and my recollection might serve me, I might have even been ranking member at some point or time. But it is an important committee, but there is important work as we speak.  </p><p>And so I will try to be focused in my questions, but to read a statement that I think will guide my questioning. A small number of digital platforms appear to have outsized control over access to trustworthy news online and I am a partaker of the national in NPA, which is the Association of African-American newspapers, newspapers that have an enormous history. Back to reconstruction periods after slavery, as the vehicle of information for many, I'm familiar in a diverse community like Houston that speaks 98 languages that there are many papers that reflect different communities, newspapers may be online as well, but they seem to be adhering to newspapers.  </p><p>So--and then in the last election, of course, and 2018 and 2016, we know the conspicuous invasion of the foreign adversaries who utilize online tools to mislead voters to utilize Russian bots, which we expect to occur in the coming 2020 elections. So we are putting ourselves in a very difficult challenge if we don't look at the source of news. And then as I see the gentleman from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, I know that paper newspapers are online. We understand that.  </p><p>But I think I would ask this question of everyone, and I think it was--was that Mr. Chavin (SP)--Chavern who, as I came in said we can't last this way. And so I'm going to ask the question as we begin this journey of how do we deal with online digital, I know that Mr.--Chairman Cicilline, who I complement, will also have some overlapping digital privacy issues, which we are dealing with at Homeland security. But I want to have everyone answer, if they would, the Achilles' heel of dealing with online truth and a correction that they would want to see this committee engage in.  </p><p>And Mr. Chavern, argued the first? I can't see your placard there. And if everyone would take that question, maybe the Atlanta Journal might want to comment on what it's doing to newspapers, even though I know you may be online, as most are. Go ahead, sir. Thank you.  </p><p>CHAVERN: Just briefly, the answer is more quality and more responsibility. My members produce quality journalism for which they are responsible. If the platforms have a problem with quality information, and they do, the answer is more content from quality publishers. We need a sustainable partnership. We could have one, we can have one, it's achievable, but the platforms have been unwilling to do that to date, and that's why we're here. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. </p><p>KIMMELMAN: Congresswoman, I totally agree that we need quality content. I think we have a problem both on online platforms that comes from every user of those platforms and every media company that is not doing tearful, trustworthy duration of information. It comes all across the marketplace with the same incentives for the most salacious material. I would urge you to consider in your--as you do your fact gathering and investigation to consider whether you need legislation to create some public service duty, everyone online, whether it be news media company, a newspaper, or a platform to deliver trustworthy information and create the financial incentives to produce that. That would give the marketplace better information, better signaling of what is fact and what is fiction, and hopefully it would create the kind of money that we are hearing from local newspapers they need to sustain themselves. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. It's Ms. Hubbard? </p><p>HUBBARD: Yes, thank you. Thank you, Congresswoman. So as I said earlier, I think competition is--would help with this disinformation problem because consumers right now don't have an option of choosing a platform that doesn't boost disinformation with its engagement algorithms. Facebook and YouTube both use these engagement algorithms that actually boost the propaganda and disinformation. So consumers need to be able to vote with their feet, and same with publishers, so that Facebook--so that YouTube and Google actually have a risk of losing profits and they're motivated to fix this problem by not losing profits.  </p><p>And the other thing I would like to add quickly is privacy regulation would also help because it is this 360 degree view of users collecting their data across the web that allows disinformation agents to then precisely target people based on the data collected about them. So if we collected less data about people, especially not in ways that they would never expect, there would be less ability to hyper target them with disinformation. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. The time of the gentlelady has expired. I'm going to now ask unanimous consent to add a number of letters and statements to the record regarding the subject subsequent--subcommittee's recently announced investigation into major technology firms potentially anticompetitive behavior. A statement from Consumer Reports expressing their support for the investigation. Without objection. A joint statement from Laura Bassett and John Stanton, two journalists who were laid off by the Huffington Post and buzz feet respectively without objection. And a letter from EPIC, the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Without objection.  </p><p>This concludes today's hearing and I want to say thank you again to our very distinguished witnesses for their testimony. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record. This hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y24-WBB1-F15W-H18X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

DOUG COLLINS (R-GA.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: Good afternoon. The subcommittee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time. We welcome everyone to the second of our series of hearings investigating competition in the digital markets, this one on innovation and entrepreneurship. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. 30 years ago, the first software for the World Wide Web was released into the public domain to create a global communications network. Within a few years, search and browsing services were built on to the software to give people tools to communicate, share, and explore information through decentralized platform that was designed to be open and nondiscriminatory.  </p><p>Vint Cerf, and Internet pioneer and co-designer of the Internet's early architecture testified in 2006 on behalf of Google that the overarching principle of the open Internet was that no central gatekeeper should exert control over the Internet. As he noted, this open and competitive environment meant that entrepreneurs with new ideas for applications need not worry about getting permission for their inventions to reach end users.  </p><p>Over the following decades, the meteoric growth of our opening open and competitive Internet revolutionized our lives, our work, our businesses, and our entire world. Millions of new good paying jobs were created, greater access to information promised a renewal of our democracy and social progress. This environment also fostered the growth in dynamism of four companies that will testify in today's hearing, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. Each of these American companies have contributed immense technological breakthroughs and economic value to our country. They were started on shoestring budgets, in dorm rooms and garages, and are a testament to our core values as a country.  </p><p>But in an effort to put promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allow these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight. As a result, the Internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growing really hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship. Makan Delrahim, the associate attorney general of the Antitrust Division recently noted, and I quote, \"There are only one or two significant players in important digital spaces including Internet search, social networks, mobile and desktop operating systems, and electronic book sales.\"  </p><p>Google controls nearly all the search market in the United States and over 90 percent of all Internet searches are conducted via Google platforms. Amazon controls nearly half of all online commerce in the United States. Despite statements from the company that it only captures a small percentage of retail in the United States, the reality is that half of American families have an Amazon Prime account, up from only 35 percent just three years ago, and Amazon's closest competitor, eBay, controls less than 6 percent of the market for online commerce.  </p><p>Facebook controls over 58 percent of the U.S. social media market and has approximately 2.7 billion monthly active users across its platforms. Notwithstanding the growing popularity of TicTok, a Chinese video sharing app, Facebook captures over 80 percent of global social media revenue. And as Facebook Co-founder Chris Hughes has recently observed, no major social networking company has been founded in the United States since the fall of 2011.  </p><p>And finally, Apple is under increasing scrutiny for abusing its role as both a player and a referee in the app store through prices that may be higher than a competitive market would allow and policies that may favor Apple's own products and services. As the Supreme Court recently noted in Apple versus Pepper, regardless of price, and I quote, \"Apple pockets a 30 percent commission on every app sale,\" in addition to developer membership fees and a 30 percent commission on its--on in app purchases.  </p><p>A former Apple executive who oversaw App Store approvals for seven years has also described Apple as having, and I quote, \"Complete and unprecedented power over their customers devices and using this power as a weapon against competitors.\" Although Apple has made a series of laudable commitments to protect consumers privacy online, as the union New York Times editorial board recently noted, it's management of the app store is, and I quote, \"Dangerously reminiscent of the anticompetitive behavior that triggered the United States versus Microsoft, a landmark antitrust case that changed the landscape of the tech industry.\"  </p><p>Several reports by leading economists and competition experts also suggest that the dominance of these firms is unlikely to be challenged by new rivals due to certain features that characterize digital markets. As these reports have found the combination of high network effects, high switching costs, and the self-reinforcing advantages of data can result in a winner take all market that shielded dominant firms from competitive threats.  </p><p>At the same time, there is growing consensus among venture capitalists and startups this is a kill zone around Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple that prevents new startups from entering the market with innovative products and services to challenge these incumbents. And in recent years, the number of technology startup financings has dropped significantly from above 10,000 startup financings in 2015 to just above 6000 in 2018, while the number of venture capital deals for investment beneath $1 million have also declined significantly.  </p><p>Even when tech startups escape the investment kill zone, they remain extremely reliant on these platforms in other ways. According to a recent report in Bloomberg, 17 out of 22 initial public offerings by significant technology companies such as a Lyft and Pinterest cited online platforms as competitors or risks to their business. As this report noted, and I quote, \"The tech giants have the power to change their services at any time generating havoc downstream\" on smaller firms. And while the explosion of the early Internet connected local businesses to broader markets, there is growing concern that anti-competitors practices and the gatekeeper role of online platforms is now imperiling small business in our communities. </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: As Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance will testify today, and I quote from her written testimony, \"Powerful online gatekeepers not only control market access, but also directly compete with the businesses that depend on them.\" Undermining entrepreneurship and economic opportunity. As I've said before, this trend is not compatible with the open Internet or its defining features that have allowed innovation and entrepreneurship to flourish.  </p><p>As Tim Wu will testify today, \"The United States is at risk of losing the best of our innovation culture and instead being a culture of giant, lumbering concerns where incremental improvement is the norm and where innovators dream of being bought, not of building something of their own.\" Most importantly for purposes of today's hearing, this trend is not the inevitable consequence of technological progress. It is the result of policy choices we are making as a country.  </p><p>Over the past decade, the largest technology firms have required over 436 companies, many of which were actual or potential competitors. For example, according to the New York Times report by Tim Wu and Stuart Thompson, of the 270 companies Google has acquired, 171 involved actual or potential competitors and of Facebook's 92 total acquisitions, 46 involved actual or potential competitors. But not a single one of these acquisitions was challenged by interest antitrust enforcers. In fact, only a handful of these were closely scrutinized.  </p><p>And in the two decades since the justice department filed its landmark monopolization case against Microsoft, there's not been a single complaint filed by either agency alleging anticompetitive conduct in this market. Together, these enforcement decisions have created a de facto immunity for online platforms.  </p><p>I hope that today's hearing provides an opportunity for a serious and sober discussion about these trends and possible paths forward to addressing them. As Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web recently observed, unless we examine and address these trends, and I quote, \"We can expect the next 20 years to be far less innovative from the last.\" In other words, this hearing isn't just about the companies before us today, it's about ensuring that we have the conditions for the next Google, the next Amazon, the next Facebook, and the next Apple to grow and prosper. With that in mind, I think both of our panels of expert witnesses for appearing before us today, and I now recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin for his opening statement, Mr. Sensenbrenner. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Innovation and entrepreneurship are the hallmarks of the American economy. This is been true in the past and it remains true now in the digital age. Today's hearing will focus primarily on the impacts large online platforms have on innovation and entrepreneurship. This is a critical topic and I want to stress that we must take a fair and balanced approach to it.  </p><p>There are some who advocate that the biggest platform should just be broken up because they supposedly dominate too much of the market. That implore seems misguided for several reasons. First, just because a business is big doesn't mean that it is bad. Anti-trust laws focus on the conduct of companies and whether that conduct is anticompetitive. They do not exist to punish businesses just because they are big.  </p><p>Likewise, the antitrust laws did not exist to punish success. On the contrary, they exist to foster it. The most innovative, successful, and competitive companies are often become very big, not through anticompetitive conduct or violations of antitrust laws, but simply by providing a better service or product than the other companies in the marketplace.  </p><p>Second is the written statements offered by some of our witnesses attest. Big online platforms can present small companies in many sections with a better way to reach them best--the most customers. Breaking up big businesses simply because they're large would end up hurting lots of small businesses throughout the country. Third, breaking up big product platforms won't necessarily solve a problem associated with those platforms. For example, the privacy issues are prominent in today's discussions of what's going on wrong online but breaking up the big platforms into smaller ones might actually compounds the problems of protecting privacy. </p><p>I raise these points not to dismiss the idea that there might be genuine issues of anti-competitive conduct in the online ecosystem. However, I want to offer a counterpoint to some of the more radical positions that are being articulated. We should take a serious look at allegations of wrongdoing. Perhaps we'll hear some of those today, but we should not rush to amend the antitrust laws or break up companies by congressional fiat (SP) based on false notions that being big is inherently bad or that everything a big company does should be presumed to be anticompetitive. And I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Sensenbrenner. I want to just acknowledge that both the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Nadler, and their ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Collins, are on the floor right now. And when they come to committee, they'll be recognized, if it's okay with Mr. Sensenbrenner, for their opening statements.  </p><p>And at this time now, I would like to introduce our panel. We have two panels of witnesses today. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first panel. Our first witness is Adam Cohen, the director of Economic Policy at Google. Before joining Google, Mr. Cohen was an economic correspondent for Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal, reporting out of both London and Brussels. Mr. Cohen received his AB from Harvard University and his MS from the London School of Economics.  </p><p>Our second witness, Matt Perault is head of Global Policy Development at Facebook, leading the company's global public policy planning efforts on law enforcement and human rights issues. Mr. Perault has also overseen public policy for WhatsApp, Oculus, and Facebook artificial intelligence research. Before joining Facebook, he was counselor at the Congressional Oversight Panel as well as a consultant at the World Bank. Mr. Perault received his bachelor's degree from Brown University, his MPP from Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy, and his JD from Harvard Law School. </p><p>Our third witness is Nate Sutton, associate general counsel of Competition at Amazon, who oversees all competition related litigation and regulatory matters for the company. Before joining Amazon, Mr. Sutton was a trial attorney with the Department of Justice Antitrust Division for nine years, working on civil antitrust matters. He also worked at the law firms of Williams and Conley LLP, from 2001 two 2007. Mr. Sutton received his BS in nuclear engineering from North Carolina State University and his JD from the University of Chicago Law School. </p><p>The last witness on our panel is Kyle Andeer, vice president of Corporate Law at Apple. Prior to joining Apple, Mr. Andeer spent four years as the deputy chief trial counsel with the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition, managing a trial staff of more than 25 attorneys and support staff. He also served as the principal competition attorney advisor to Commissioner J. Thomas Roche, as well as the DOJ's antitrust division. Mr. Andeer received his BA from the University of Pennsylvania and his JD from the University of California Berkeley school of Law. </p><p>We welcome all of our distinguished witnesses on our first panel and thank them for participating in today's hearing. Now if you would please rise, I'll begin by swearing you in. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief, so help you God? </p><p>UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>CICILLINE: Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated. </p><p>Please note that each of your written statements will be entered into the record in their entirety. Accordingly, I ask that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light on your table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals your five minutes have expired. Mr. Cohen, we'll begin with you. </p><p>COHEN: Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and distinguish members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Adam Cohen, and I am director of Economic Policy at Google. In my role, I lead our public policy work on antitrust issues. </p><p>Google was founded in 1998 by two students who had a big idea, organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. In their earliest form, Google's search results were simply 10 blue links on a webpage. Twenty years later, we provide our users with much richer results, including direct answers to questions, pinpoints on a map when they search for an address, and direct links to flights, products, and a range of other information. </p><p>As a responsible and successful company, we understand the importance of discussing how our business works and how we compete. We are proud of our record of continued innovation. We face constant pressure to improve our products and services, both the sure signs of a competitive marketplace. In my testimony today, I will focus on the value Google and the wider technology sector are creating for the U.S. economy, our investment in new technologies, and our industry's competitive dynamics. </p><p>For the U.S. economy, Google's products and services create significant value, generating an estimated $335 billion in economic activity in 2018. This has benefited a wide range of consumers and businesses across the country. Firms that once operated in a local or regional market now reach national and international customers using our tools.  </p><p>We have also made substantial direct investments in the U.S. economy. Last year, we hired more than 10,000 people and invested over $9 billion in data centers and offices across the country. In February, we announced plans to invest an additional $13 million this year with major expansions in 14 states. These new investments will give us the capacity to hire tens of thousands of additional employees and create more than 10,000 new construction jobs. </p><p>Overall, the technology sector supports roughly 12 million American jobs, the equivalent of 7.6 percent of the total U.S. workforce. It is a vital source of new jobs. And for consumers, technology companies continue to provide innovation and better prices. Prices in the tech sector fell in 2018 compared to an increase in the rest of the private sector. When it comes to investing in innovation, technology companies are America's largest vendors on research and development. As an example, Google last year spent $21.4 billion on research, development, and related areas, three times more than in 2013. </p><p>Our continuing investments for innovation and improves our own products and services, and also supports and accelerates innovation among other firms. We share many of the results of our research in new technologies, typically through open source software. This helps broad communities of developers to use our advances in their own--own applications and services. </p><p>In terms of competition, our industry is highly dynamic and drives innovation that gives consumers better choices at lower prices. For example, when consumers search for information, they can choose among Amazon, Yelp, Microsoft, Travelocity, and many other companies like these that consistently report strong user growth. If you don't want to use Google, there are many other information providers available. </p><p>We also face formidable competition around the world. Our success enables us to make the research and development investments necessary to compete in a global environment with other global players. New firms are competing too. We continue to see record-setting venture capital activity, with over 8,000 venture-backed companies raising more than $130 billion in financing last year, the highest amount in over a decade. </p><p>The technology sector has had one of the highest rates of business formation and job creation in the country over the past three decades. In fact, in the first quarter of 2019, a record 147 American companies reached so-called unicorn status, with valuations exceeding $1 billion. These companies had a combined value of $582 billion in the first quarter of the year, the highest aggregate value ever recorded. That's a rate of new business success unrivaled elsewhere in the U.S. economy, creating new companies that compete with established companies across many areas. </p><p>To conclude, even as progress and innovation expand, sound regulatory frameworks help ensure our societies and economies continue to benefit from new technologies. We look forward to continued work with the committee as it examines these issues. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Mr. Perault is now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you, Chairman. Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and distinguish members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Matt Perault, and I'm a director of Public Policy at Facebook. I've been at the company for eight years, and I focus on competition and economic policy. It's an honor to be here to discuss these important issues. </p><p>Facebook is an American success story. We were founded in a college dorm room 15 years ago. And since that time, we've helped transform the way people around the world communicate, connect, and share. We believe deeply in the values of competition and innovation, values that are fundamental to the success of the American economy. And it's precisely because of the shared values that Facebook has grown from a dorm room idea to a vibrant American company. </p><p>New apps enabling people to connect, discover, communicate, and share our emerging all the time because barriers to entry for digital platforms are low. Launching a new mobile app for online service often requires minimal staff, capital, and infrastructure. And the rise of cloud computing and app stores enables these platforms to reach a global audience. Consumers move easily between different apps and services. If they don't enjoy a product or experience, they'll leave it and explore other options. </p><p>We face intense competition for all of the products and services that we provide. To name a few examples, Twitter, Snapchat, iMessage, Skype, Telegram, Google, YouTube, and Amazon are for photo and video sharing, messaging, advertising, and other services that compete with Facebook. In fact, more than 92 percent of advertising happens off of Facebook, and less than a quarter of U.S. online ad spend goes to Facebook. </p><p>And our competition isn't just here in America. We compete with companies from all around the world. TikTok, for example, a Chinese app lunch less than three years ago has been downloaded more than a billion times and was the most downloaded iOS app in the world in 2018.  </p><p>Facebook was transformative and groundbreaking when it launched, and we worked hard to remain so today. That's why we push ourselves to evolve and experiment to develop the next big technologies that will change how people connect and communicate in the future. I'd like to touch briefly on four of the ways that Facebook--Facebook is investing in innovation, first through developing new products and features. </p><p>When Facebook was created, the site consisted mostly of text details about each user. Now users can message, read news, broadcast live video, connect with businesses, send and receive payments, and raise money for important causes just to name a few options. And the Facebook family goes beyond software to hardware products like Portal and Oculus. We're proud of how much we've invented and innovated and of how much our products and services have improved. </p><p>Second, our investments in research and development have played an important role in fueling our innovation. We devoted nearly 20 percent of our revenue last year to investments in innovation, and we've made significant advancements in areas like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and energy-efficient data centers. </p><p>Third, our acquisitions have been a powerful force for innovation. Companies like Instagram and WhatsApp have had increased opportunities to innovate as part of the Facebook family. We are better together, and that's good for users. </p><p>Fourth, Facebook has democratized advertising, helping millions of small and medium-size businesses. Our advertising platform can accommodate almost every budget, and we help advertisers reach their target audience and maximize their impact. </p><p>Our services have enabled small and medium-size businesses to grow, create jobs, and more effectively compete with larger companies, leading to more choice and better products for consumers. We have heard countless examples of small entrepreneurs in Rhode Island, in Wisconsin, and across America who couldn't afford print or TV ads but who have been able to succeed by using our services to reach a local, national, or even global audience. </p><p>Facebook is constantly working to find new ways to help people connect, communicate, and share. Like many successful American companies before us, we've grown by taking risks, learning from our mistakes, and constantly striving to improve. We recognize that we're a work in progress, and we're committed to addressing the challenges we face as a company, but we're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished so far. </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Perault. I now recognize Mr. Sutton for five minutes.  </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline and members of the subcommittee. In my brief remarks today I will provide some background on Amazon's approach to business and on the industries which we operate. I will discuss our relationship with third party sellers that sell in our stores and I'll explain the positive effects we have on competition and the economy. Amazon's mission is to be earth's most customer centric company. Our core philosophy is firmly rooted in working backwards from what customer's want. And we seek continually to innovate to provide customers the best experience.  </p><p>This principal is essential to understand Amazon as we apply it to all areas of our business. Amazon operates a diverse range of businesses from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services. In each of these areas we face intense competition from well established competitors. For example retail which remains by far, our largest business, is as old as human commercial experience. It has long been and continues to be characterized by intense competition at every level.  </p><p>New technologies such as the internet have only made retail more competitive reducing barriers to entry and expanding output. Studies show that retailers sell and customers shop in multiple stores both offline and online. In fact, as Target and Best Buy recently announced one of the fastest growing consumer practices is a mix of offline and online whereby customers order products online that they later pick up in a physical store.  </p><p>And there are now dozens of online marketplaces in the U.S. and around the world. The result in retail is an ever broadening array of competitors including many large and well-known companies like Walmart, Ebay, Target, Safeway, Wayfair and Kroger. Not to mention large and growing global competitors such as Ali Baba and Rakuten.  </p><p>Amazon's success in retail depends on our partnership with third party sellers that sell their products right alongside our own products. We have invested heavily in these sellers and they are growing twice as fast as Amazon's own retail and make up almost 60 percent of total unit sales in our stores.  </p><p>These businesses are primarily small and medium sized firms. And last year, almost 200,000 of them sold more than $100,000 in our stores. Amazon supports these sellers because we have a strong incentive to do so. The broad selection and price competition these sellers bring to our stores are attractive to our customers. For example, these selling partners provide the vast majority of new products in our stores.  </p><p>We know sellers have other ways to reach customers so we invest in them, support them and make continuous efforts to improve their experience. We have dedicated teams assigned to supporting sellers, launch new tools to help them increase sales and spend significant resources to root out bad actors and prevent fraud and abuse that harms both sellers and customers.  </p><p>If we did not make these efforts on behalf of our selling partners they would sell fewer products in our stores and more through our competitors. Amazon's investments in retail have also benefitted the economy more generally. We have invested 10s of billions of dollars in infrastructure and technical services. We employ more than 275,000 people in the United States. We offer a $15.00 minimum wage and valuable benefits. We continue to invest in our employees through workforce training programs. For example, just days ago--we announced an initiative to invest $700 million to provide 100,000 of our employees new skills and training to help them move into more advanced jobs or find new careers.  </p><p>From our vantage point as a retailer in a highly competitive field we offer two views for the committee's consideration. First, the technology used to provide a service is not the primary factor in a competitive analysis. Consumers benefit from all retail competition regardless of the precise business model involved. In today's retail market the notion that two products that are exactly the same do not compete with each other simply because one was ordered online and one was bought in a brick and mortar store makes little sense.  </p><p>Second, to avoid unintentionally tilting the competitive playing field new rules should encompass all retailers regardless of the supply models that they use. Thank you and I look forward to answering any questions the committee may have.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Sutton. Chair now recognizes Mr. Andeer for five minutes.  </p><p>ANDEER: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee--thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. My name is Kyle Andeer and I am Apple's chief compliance officer. And I spent a lot of time focusing on business ethics and competition legal issues. Apple is a proud, American company a 40-year history of innovation in very competitive markets. Our mission is to make the best products and services in the world in each of the markets where we compete. For us, it has never been about making the most--it's always been about making the best. We design our technology to be say to use and safe rand secure for all customers. We see our customer's privacy as a fundamental human right and we embed that value in everything we create. We go above and beyond to incorporate accessibility features to make sure everyone can get the most from their devices. And our products are made with our responsibility to the environment in mind.  </p><p>We are deeply proud of the role we play in democratizing coding and other high-tech skills all around the world. In discussing Apple's online platforms, we consider five distinct categories--iOS, Mac OS, Watch OS, TV Os and our soon to be released--iPad OS. Our products run and compete on these platforms. We are very proud of each of these and feel that they are the best in each of their categories. We only create great products not commodity products. And as a result we do not have a majority share in any one of these categories. For Apple, the competition is fierce. Our customers have an ever growing number of choices when it comes to products and services. We compete against some of the largest companies in the world both foreign and cosmetic. We work hard every day to retain and grow customer trust and to compete for their business.  </p><p>Each of our platforms depends on a thriving ecosystem from the app store, to peripherals and accessories, to partners such as service providers and car makers. Our expertise in software enables experiences like moving seamlessly between apple devices, finding your same messages in Safari bookmarks no matter which device you use and taking advantage of features like Car Play that integrates your iPhone into your daily commute.  </p><p>The benefits of this ecosystem and the innovation it makes possible are clear to our customers. It means, for example, world class security and unparalleled ease of use. We are also proud to offer services where millions of artist and entrepreneurs can share their work and ideas. Like Apple Music hosting more than 50 million songs from artists around the world, podcasts--where hundreds of thousands of topics are discussed and shared. And the app store, which has spawned new opportunities from everyone like the individual entrepreneur to the biggest companies in the world.  </p><p>Since it's launch in 2008, the app store has been vibrant, competitive and ever growing. It has transformed the experience and reduced the cost of software distribution. So anyone with a great idea can invent a new app and distribute it worldwide from home. We are proud that app store entrepreneurs across this country have generated over 1.5 million U.S. jobs across all 50 states. We designed the app store to be both a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps that interest them. And a great opportunity for developers to start businesses. In entering the app store every developer abides by the very same guidelines. From the student in her living room to some of the largest companies. We want to have--we want every creator to have an equal opportunity to succeed.  </p><p>We work hard every day to compete for developers who want to join and stay in our ecosystem. We're proud that a good number of apps--apps like Pinterest, Spotify, Lyft and Uber have built successful businesses through the app store with support from our team and the developer tools we offer. The app store provides an enormous opportunity for developers to reach millions of users over night and the vast majority of apps over 84 percent share none of the revenue they made from our store with Apple.  </p><p>Only a very small number of the nearly 2 billion apps in the app store are made by Apple. And in every category where our software competes we face multiple strong competitors. Apple believes users expect that their devices should provide a great experience out of the box. So our products include certain functionality like email, phone and a music player as a baseline. But users have various needs and they are free to discover and use any alternatives they might prefer.  </p><p>For instance, if a customer wants to use iCloud, doesn't want to use iCloud they can use Box, Dropbox or any number of other options. At the end of the day our only objective is to provide our customers the very best products and ecosystem in the world. It means a phone they love, a choice of accessories that enhance their experience and millions of applications and services at their fingertips. And when it all comes together it creates a tremendous market opportunity for everyone--entrepreneurs, artists, carriers, carmakers, accessory makers and developers.  </p><p>We are committed to carrying this legacy forward believing in our core that a single great idea can unlock opportunities once imag--unimaginable. That's what defines Apple and always will. Apple welcomes this subcommittee's efforts to promote American innovation and entrepreneurship and we look forward to working with you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Andeer. I will now proceed under the five-minute rule with questions. I'll begin by recognizing the gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Scanlon. We are doing it a little out of order because due to the time change some of our committee members have other commitments. I want to begin with Ms. Scanlon. You're recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and thank you for hosting this event--this hearing. We certainly heard a lot about the various ways in which your platforms have really developed a whole new sector of our economy but we wanted to dig into a little bit of the anti-competitive aspects. I wanted to focus on the issue of digital piracy and what that does in the creative community. So, Creative Futures is a coalition representing 555 organizations ranging from MGM to one of our local Philadelphia Theater groups. And it represents a quarter million people in the creative rights community. They've raised concerns on the impact of the competitive process of copyright theft on the Facebook and Google platforms. </p><p>Specifically, they noted in a submission--Unfair methods of competition can be facilitated or sometimes practiced on these massive internet platforms and it results in less creative content than otherwise would exist. Fewer new voices and harm to legitimate pirated sources of distribution. So, Mr. Cohen, can you address these concerns of people in the creative rights community, particularly about how YouTube doesn't really have an economic incentive to combat widespread copyright theft and this may have distorted the market for online streaming of movies and television? </p><p>[*]COHEN: Congresswoman, thank you for the question. YouTube has a very strong set of tools to prevent copyright infringing material from appearing. We developed a technology called Content ID that can remove copyrighted material before it's ever seen by anybody ever using the platform. </p><p>We take this matter very seriously and we provide, via YouTube and other products, means for consumers to find and access quality licensed, legitimate content. </p><p>SCANLON: So, is that the process that you use when, in fact, pirated content is uploaded but then there's a takedown notice? Or are you talking about something else? </p><p>COHEN: Congressman--Congresswoman, we use a combination of automated tools. We can recognize copyrighted material that creators upload and instantaneously discover it and keep it from being seen in our platforms. </p><p>SCANLON: I guess an additional concern that has been raised around this issue is that if you google--if I were to google an original show produced by the YouTube premium, maybe something like Cobra Kai or Weird City, if I try to find pirated versions of the YouTube shows, nothing comes up. But, if I go search for a pirated version of a show like Game of Thrones or Netflix's Russian Doll or HBO's Barry, a whole--well, (INAUDIBLE) versions, a lot of different pirated versions pop up. </p><p>So, there's a suggestion that there's a discrepancy in how these tools are working because the YouTube/Google shows, those pirated versions are taken down, but some of the other companies' versions aren't taken down. Can you address how that discrepancy might be occurring? </p><p>COHEN: Congresswoman, I have not seen any evidence of a discrepancy. We take great steps to protect copyrighted material and to show and to provide our customers legitimate means of reaching legitimate licensed content. </p><p>SCANLON: Well, if you do come up with any data regarding discrepancies between the various platforms, can you provide that to the committee, please? </p><p>COHEN: I would--I would be happy to. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you. I'll yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I now recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Sensenbrenner, for five minutes. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you very much. First question is to Mr. Perault. There is a time when Facebook was a pledging operation and people thought that others like Myspace were the future of social media. What competitive features of the social media marketplace made it possible for Facebook to overtake and vanquish Myspace and others like it? </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you very much, congressman, for the question. We have rolled out many innovations over the course of the history of our product. We had a real name policy at the time that we were founded. That was important in ensuring that there were authentic interactions on our platform and provided users with a better experience. </p><p>We've since rolled our many additional features, such as newsfeed and the like button and we continue to innovate today. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: So, Myspace didn't have any of those features? Is that why people went to Facebook and abandoned Myspace? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, I believe they did not have all of those features. We competed aggressively with Myspace and we believe that that aggressive competition is, in part, responsible for our success today. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Well, I think what we're looking at is anti-competitive action. Did Myspace complain about what you were doing, being anti-competitive, or did they just watch their ship slowly sink under the waves? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, I--I am not aware of anti-competitive complaints from Myspace. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you. To Mr. Cohen, your written statement says that Google helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world. That sounds nice, but what facts, figures, and sources can you point to us to prove that it's true? </p><p>COHEN: Congressman, I--I saw a recent study from the Progressive Policy Institute that showed that for every $3 of advertising spent online, a business would have to spend an equivalent of $5 offline to get equal prominence. That cost savings is--that efficiency in those businesses goes to reinvestment, it goes to lower prices for consumers. That is a tremendous savings for the U.S. economy. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Okay. You know, the print news media has come on hard times. There are a whole lot of reasons for that and Google might be one of them, but I don't think it's the exclusive reason for the print media falling on hard times. </p><p>You know, if I buy a copy of the Washington Post and there is an ad in there, and the Washington Post, you know, only circulates at least extensively in the Washington metropolitan area. And, the same company puts an ad on Google. What do you think the exposure is between the print ad and the online ad in terms of numbers? </p><p>COHEN: It--it can vary, congressman. There's a lot of variety and control given to the advertiser in how they interact with online platforms, how they advertise with online platforms. One of the key things is that in newspaper advertising, you would spend a certain amount of money. When I was last a journalist, it was quite expensive to place advertisements in print media. </p><p>You didn't know what your return on that investment was. It was hard to measure. In digital formats, it's easy to know when an ad is clicked on. In fact, for our services, often you only pay when an ad is clicked on, and you can then measure the effectiveness of that advertising campaign. </p><p>You can have these ads reach as broad an audience as you like, or you can--you can use them narrowly in focusing on local markets if you--if you prefer. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: What do you think about the persuasive ability--and I look toward my own campaigns. I don't think we've put ads in newspapers either daily or weekly for over 25 years because the same company puts an ad on Google. What do you think the exposure is between the print ad and the online ad, in terms of numbers? </p><p>COHEN: It can vary, Congressman. There's a lot of variety and control given to the advertiser and how they interact with online platforms, how they advertise with online platforms. One of the key things is that in newspaper advertising you would spend a certain amount of money. When I was last a journalist, it was quite expensive to place advertisements in print media. You didn't know what your return on that investment was. It was hard to measure. In digital formats it's easy to know when an ad is clicked on. In fact, for our services often you only pay when an ad is clicked on, and you can then measure the effectiveness of that advertising campaign. You can have these reach as broad an audience as you like or you can use them narrowly focusing on local markets if you--if you prefer. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: What do you think about the persuasive ability? And I looked toward my own campaigns, I don't think we have put ads in newspapers either daily or weekly for over 25 years because the surveys that we did showed that the people who read political ads in newspapers were either seeing what their favorite candidate was doing and meant to lead sharing, or seeing what the opposition was doing and you know saying boo. But with an online ad, we use those for the last couple of cycles. Do you think there is at least the purpose of advertising is to educate someone toward a vote or buying a product or something like that? Have you done any marketing surveys to show that that is effective? </p><p>COHEN: Congressman, I--I am not an expert in political advertising, but what I would say is that I think you have identified an issue that affects the newspaper industry. There are different ways of reaching customers in different settings and the newspaper business model has come under pressure even before the Internet from competing services like cable news and with the advent of the Internet. From--you know, newspapers use to make a lot of money from classified advertising and a lot of that shifted to services like Craigslist, Autotrader for automotive ads, there are a range of competitive pressures and I think that is probably true for political advertising as well. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you very much. My time has expired. </p><p>CICILLINE: The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Washington, Ms. Jayapal for five minutes. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here. My district has the great honor of long being a place for innovation, a place where many small companies became large giants, including Amazon. And it is also a place where in the past innovation has had to be protected by the federal government. And, specifically, I call your attention to--in 2001 the Department of Justice sued Microsoft accusing the company of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act by using a monopoly to adversely affect the web browser market. And the case leaders settled after Microsoft agreed to make it easier for Microsoft's competitors to integrate their software with the Windows operating system. And there are many scholars out there who believe that this case is actually the one that opened up tremendous space for real innovation that wouldn't have otherwise existed and allowed a whole new wave of tech companies to spring up and some of the companies represented here today actually flourished after that court ruli  </p><p>ng. </p><p>Mr. Perault, let me start with you. You are the head of global policy development at Facebook. Does Facebook devote any resources to identifying promising tech startups or innovative non-Facebook platforms and apps? </p><p>PERAULT: Not to my knowledge, no, Congresswoman. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Not at all? </p><p>PERAULT: We certainly devote resources to understanding the competitive landscape in which we operate but no, I believe the answer to your question is no, not to my knowledge. </p><p>JAYAPAL: So, you don't acquire promising tech startups or innovative non-Facebook owned platforms or apps? </p><p>PERAULT: Congresswoman we certainly look to innovate with our products and the focus of our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring companies that enable us to offer a better service to the people who use our products. So we do look to acquire services that will enable us to innovate more--more effectively. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And they might actually be competing with you and that might be something that you think would integrate well into your existing platform? </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you, Congresswoman. The focus of our acquisition--acquisition strategy is on companies that will enable us to innovate more effectively and bring value to the people who use our services. For instance, at the time that we acquired Oculus, a virtual reality company, it didn't yet have a product in the market. As a result of our investment in Oculus, it now has a virtual-reality product in the market. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And what about when you were acquired the positive--positivity-focused polling startup tbh two years ago and then the company shut down the app after only eight months? And also bought the app Movesand then later shut it down. How would you consider those acquisitions and--and terminations, if you will, of those smaller companies? </p><p>PERAULT: Congresswoman it is certainly the case that some acquisitions don't work. When they don't work, we may discontinue a product because of a legitimate business judgment. </p><p>JAYAPAL: I would just draw your attention to, sort of, eg--you know, I would look at the pharmaceutical industry. And according to a 2018 Yale study some pharmaceutical companies seem to engage in what they called 'killer acquisitions,' where they will advise smaller firms and then shut down potentially competing projects and researchers actually found that when that happened, it was more likely that the acquired companies competing drug would be discontinued, so I'm not saying it's directly parallel but it is one of the concerns that I have. </p><p>Mr. Sutton, you are associate general counsel at Amazon. Does Amazon devote any resources to identifying the most popular brands and products sold using the Amazon interface? So, for example, do you track the most popular non-Amazon brands that are sold in houseware divisions, or the brand of size 14 pants that is sold most often or any other product like that? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you for your question. Amazon is proud to be a company of builders and have built our company from within, not through acquisitions. </p><p>With respect to data such as you identified we do not use in the cellar data for--to compete with them. We have--last year was our smallest year of acquisitions and we have only had one multibillion-dollar acquisition and that was whole foods. </p><p>JAYAPAL: I'm sorry ,that was slightly different than the question I asked, which was, when people sell products on your site, do you track which products are most successful, and then do you sometimes create a product to compete with that product? Because essentially you have this massive trove of data, right? People that are buying products on your platform--and so you are able to see which are the ones that are doing really, really well, like that size 14 pants or that houseware that's being sold. Do you track that and then do you create--create products that directly compete with those most popular brands that are out there? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you and let me answer that question. That data on popularity of products like much retail data is actually public data for each of our products you can see where it's ranked, you can see how popular it is. We do not use any of that specific cellar data in creating our own private brand products, and private brands is an area where quite frankly we lagged behind many of our retail competitors who have 20 percent to 80 percent of their products as private brands where we are only in the low single digits. We do offer private brands on occasion because we think it offers high-value and low-cost items for customers and because customers demand that, and we want to provide that opportunity for customers. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you. I know my time has expired, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to quickly say that my office recently met with a small business located in my district and they pay a living wage, they create a high-quality product that they sell online and in a storefront and they didn't have concerns and so I know my office has reached out directly. We--we are right in the same place and we are looking forward to that conversation with you to see how Amazon can make sure that it is helping some of the small businesses. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong, for five minutes. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I'm glad that privacy has come up already, privacy has, I know censorship has come up, we have talked about newspaper advertising and I think that's where we get into this and everybody that is sitting at that table up they are has a role in some of those issues. We all have different interest in them but I think that is when we and I know everybody at this table is anti---witnesses are antitrust experts but I think one of the problems that I think we have to recognize this is that antitrust is very company-specific and it is very fact-specific so while we may want to talk to one of you about piracy we may want to talk to another one of you about privacy. Piracy and--privacy--I should probably pick two different words as we do that but I think one thing that is consistent is everybody sitting there and the companies you work for are capable of dealing with regulation and we have witnessed this before as we continue to move forward whether it is Dodd-Frank, whether it </p><p>is healthcare legislate--or regulation wherever we deal with this whenever we work as a body to attempt to capture big bad actors I would argue that oftentimes what we do is we make it more difficult for startups whether that was our intent or not. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Would the gentleman pull his mic closer, please? </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Sure. Thanks. So I mean it's just a caution and it's not that we shouldn't have these conversations because I'm glad we are having these conversations but I just want to say that at the beginning whatever concerns anybody may have with a particular company aren't necessarily the same for the other one. But you all, as for-profit companies with a fiduciary duty to shareholders I understand the fierce--particularly in this field to stay on the cutting edge of innovation. 20 years ago GE was the most valuable company in the world and sorry to pick on Apple but you guys were almost bankrupt and even through that space and even now even a handful of unicorn companies even with the vast resources of other companies can show that we miss valuable innovations particularly in the tech field. All of this just simply demonstrates how hard it is to predict what consumers will want in the future. So, I--I guess we'll just go down--and I don't think this applies to Apple so much, but to what extent do your </p><p>companies use venture capital funding to invest in startups? And I'll start with Mr. Sutton. </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you. Amazon is a company of builders, and we primarily build from within. I'm not sure the exact details to the extent we use venture capital funding to start. I would be happy to follow up with more details. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Sure. Mr. Perault? </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you very much, Congressman. My understanding is that we do not engage in that practice, but I'd be happy to follow up with specifics. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And Mr. Cohen? </p><p>COHEN: Thank you, Congressman. We do have a venture capital arm. I'm not familiar with the size or the scope of their investments. What I can tell you is that we acquire some small businesses in order to accelerate innovation. We actually are a great incubator for technology talent as well. And somebody mentioned the number of acquisitions Google has made. We have probably spawned 10 times as many companies from former Google employees who left the company and started companies like Twitter and Pinterest and Instagram. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I--I'd did just go back to Mr. Perault for a second. Your written testimony highlights the new products and features Facebook has introduced, but how many of those has Facebook developed in-house as opposed to buying them? That's a really broad and long question. I understand that. </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you, Congressman. We have developed many in-house. For instance, we developed News Feed, which is now used broadly by many of our competitors. We developed the like button. We developed photo tagging. We developed Portal. We have also invested in companies that we've acquired like Instagram, Oculus, and WhatsApp. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And what features in the current social media market, if any, could make it possible for a new, fledgling competitors, to take on Facebook? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, I think there are probably many different answers to that question. My understanding, for instance, is that TikTok has focused on public sharing, for instance. That may be one feature that companies like ours might be interested in in the future. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And my last question for Mr. Cohen is more of a personal question, not a Congressional question. But can you explain to me why a nine-year-old would rather watch somebody play Fortnite on YouTube than actually play Fortnite? Because I don't understand. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>COHEN: Congressman, I am completely mystified. I have no idea. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you. And with that, I'll yield back, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentleman. I now recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>I want to focus on how the state of competition online is affecting real people in the communities we represent. I think we see a tremendous concentration of economic power that is fundamentally shaping markets in a way that are often unfair, on balance, and not competitive, resulting in less choice and worst quality of products and services for working people. We want to make sure, as part of this investigation, that we're doing everything we can to make sure our competition system is working for the entire economy, including small and local businesses in our community. </p><p>For more than half of online commerce, retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods are reliance on Amazon as a commerce platform. But as we know, and as Jayapal's question revealed, Amazon also offers its own products on the platform. So, Mr. Sutton, initially, I want to say, doesn't that create a conflict of interest? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you for the question. Respectfully, we disagree. We partner very closely with our third-party sellers. We rely on them to provide a broad selection in prices to our customers. And we've been very proud of our investments to help them grow to be a majority of our store and growing twice as fast. </p><p>CICILLINE: That's a different question. What I'm saying is, you are selling your own products on a platform that you control, and they're competing with products in the marketplace from retail--from other sellers, right? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you. I thank you for the question. That practice, I think has been common in the retail industry for decades. Most retailers offer their own products in their store as well as third-party products and-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --But--but, Mr. Sutton, the difference is Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data, and millions of purchases, and billions in commerce, and can manipulate algorithms on its platform and to favor its own product. That is not the same as the local retailer who might have a CVS brand and a--a national brand. I mean, it's quite different, so I want to drill down a little bit on the question that Ms. Jayapal asked you. </p><p>You said the--you said, we do not use seller data to compete with other sellers online. You do collect enormous data about what products are popular, what's selling, where they're selling. You're saying you don't use that in any way to promote Amazon products? </p><p>SUTTON: Let me answer it--thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: And I remind you, sir, you're under oath. </p><p>SUTTON: Yes. Thank you for your question. We--we use data to serve our customers. And to clarify my question, we don't use individual's seller data to directly compete with them. And again, similarly with respect to some of the most-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Do you use consumer data--let me just--do you use consumer data to favor Amazon products? Because before you answer that, analysts estimate that between 80 percent to 90 percent of sales go to the Amazon buy box. So, you collect all this data about the most popular products, where they're selling, and you're saying you don't use that in any way to change an algorithm to support the sale of Amazon branded products? </p><p>SUTTON: Our algorithm, such as the buy box, is aimed to predict what customers want to buy. </p><p>CICILLINE: --Sir, but </p><p>SUTTON: --And we apply the same criteria, whether you're a third-party seller or Amazon, do that--because we want customers to make the right purchase regardless of whether it's a seller or Amazon. </p><p>CICILLINE: But the best purchase to you is an Amazon product. </p><p>SUTTON: No, that's not true. </p><p>CICILLINE: So--so you're telling us, you're under oath, Amazon does not use any of that data collected with respect to what is selling, where it's selling, what products, to inform the decisions you make or to change algorithms to direct people to Amazon products and de-prioritize Amazon--and de-prioritize competitors? </p><p>SUTTON: The algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy regardless of the seller. We provide the same criteria. And with respect popularity, that's public data. On each product page, we provide the ranking of each product. </p><p>CICILLINE: Okay. I'm going to--I just want to give you an example of--of an entrepreneur in Rhode Island who creates a better set of headphones. She sells her product on Amazon on the marketplace. Sales soar, which is great for her, great for Amazon because more people will become Amazon prime customers to buy this great Rhode Island product. </p><p>But instead of seeing the fruits of her success, the next thing that happens is that this hard-working Rhode Islander discovers that Amazon has rolled out a direct replica of her product. And because Amazon controls the platform, Amazon gives itself top billing and demotes the entrepreneur to page three of the results, which most people will never see. So, how would anyone--in light of that kind of sequence of events, how would any entrepreneur invest in this kind of environment where that can happen, where there's no assurance it won't? </p><p>SUTTON: Our incentive is to help the seller succeed because we rely on them. If we did that, we know they go elsewhere. They have many options. So, we apply the same criteria to both, and we do not use their individual data when we're making decisions to launch private brands. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Sutton. And I'm now turning to Google--to the Google search for a moment, Mr. Cohen. </p><p>Similar to results in Amazon, everyday people thinking they're getting the best and most accurate results for searches for the products or services they're looking for, but instead what is happening is people are seeing results for Google's own the services. In 2004, Google's cofounder, Larry Page, said the purpose of Google is to have people come to Google, quickly find out what you want, and to get you out of Google and get to the right place as fast as possible. Would you agree that Google still claims that that's your principle--guiding principle. </p><p>COHEN: Congressman, our goal is to provide users information as quickly and efficiently as possible </p><p>CICILLINE: So, I want to direct your attention to two studies. The first is a study that's recently produced by Rand Fishkin, a leading expert on search engine optimization. His study primarily reviewed desktops and found that a majority of traffic to Google no longer goes out to the broader web but instead stays on Google products. The second is the research by Capra Consulting, which also finds that Google is increasingly keeping both the majority and a growing share of traffic within Google's ecosystem, a sort of walled garden. Do you agree that these studies show that Google is no longer showing people the best products for best results, but instead is giving them results to keep them on Google's products--Google's platform? </p><p>COHEN: Thank you for the question, Congressman, I'm not familiar with either of those studies. But what I can say is that we send a lot of clicks, a lot of traffic to competitors. In our own services, we have aimed to connect merchants, airlines, a range of other services directly with consumers, making the consumer experience better and making the experience for advertisers and merchants better. </p><p>CICILLINE: Well, I--I regret my time is expired. But I would just ask you to review these studies, because if innovators and entrepreneurs don't have traffic to their websites because Google--the Google search is rigged in favor of Google's own services by keeping them inside Google's walled garden, then the Internet as we know it ceases to be an engine of economic opportunity. So, I would really ask you and welcome your comments after you have an opportunity to study those. </p><p>And my time is long expired. I now recognize Mr. Steube, the gentleman from Florida. </p><p>STEUBE: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I--I've got a very important question for Apple that I believe is on the minds of all Americans. Why do you keep getting that alert for the iCloud and for the $.99 on the iCloud all the time, constantly, constantly until you pay the $.99 for iCloud, and then you're paying the $.99 for iCloud but you're not using it? </p><p>ANDEER: Thank you, Congressman. I'm afraid I'm not aware of the details around what you're talking about. I'd be happy to get back to you with any information on that, but I'm--I'm honestly not familiar with that. </p><p>STEUBE: Okay. Yeah, if you can get to me some information on that, because I've seen it and a lot of people have asked me about the fact that they constantly keep getting these alerts for--to use iCloud. And you don't want to use it, but it--dealers will go away until you actually pay the $.99 to use iCloud but you're not using it. So, I'd--if you have some information on that, I'd love to get it. </p><p>ANDEER: Absolutely. </p><p>STEUBE: I'd like to go to Amazon for a second and kind of piggyback on the--the chair's questions. What's the current market share of Amazon in total U.S. domestic retail sales? </p><p>SUTTON: Amazon is 1 percent of the global retail market and 4 percent of the U.S. retail market. </p><p>[*]SUTTON: Approximately. </p><p>STEUBE: So only 1 percent of the domestic retail sales. So, who--who is above Amazon in total U.S. retail market share? </p><p>SUTTON: In the U.S. Walmart is two to three times larger than we are. </p><p>STEUBE: Are there others or just Walmart? </p><p>SUTTON: I don't know of anyone who is potentially larger. There are thousands of competitors across the retail landscape. </p><p>STEUBE: So who is the current market share of Amazon total U.S. domestic online retail sales? </p><p>SUTTON: Online is not a separate market it's just another channel. We know customers shop both online and offline. And the evidence shows that prices have converged between online and offline. With respect to online, Amazon is one of the leading retailers. There are many other retailers including Walmart and every other major retailer who has a large online presence as well as just online players such as eBay. </p><p>STEUBE: So you're like 1 percent you stated is that correct? Roughly? </p><p>SUTTON: 1 percent of the global retail market and 4 percent of the U.S. retail market. </p><p>STEUBE: Let's just focus on U.S. So 4 percent of the U.S. market what's the largest market share of any retailer in the total U.S. retail market? </p><p>SUTTON: Amazon focuses on our customers and so I'm--I'm not sure of exact market shares of all of our competitors because that's not what we focus on as a company. I do know, again, that Walmart is many times our size in the United States. </p><p>STEUBE: Ok. And Amazon sales online U.S. retail share is growing at a faster rate as all companies or along the same level as other companies? So, I know Walmart has put a lot of investment into their online platform. How do you compare--compare to a Walmart or to other retail stores online? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you for your question. The third party reports I've seen report Walmart growing at a faster rate than we are online. </p><p>STEUBE: Ok you're written--written statements suggests that Amazon competes directly with other sellers, serves competing sellers as a distributor and serves other sellers simply as an online marketplace platform through which they can reach their customers which you testified before. Explain to me how that does or doesn't translate into whether Amazon is leveraging allegedly dominant retail market power into anticompetitive behavior against those other sellers? </p><p>SUTTON: I think the clearest answer to that question is--is from the evidence showing how much we have invested to help those third party sellers since we invited them into our store grow. They are now the majority of our sales and they are growing twice as fast. We think that's great for our small and medium sized businesses and it's great for our customers. </p><p>STEUBE: Are--are you aware of any facts or figures that show that consumer choices among outlets in the U.S. retail market is declining or the competition in the U.S. retail market is failing to keep consumer retail prices down? </p><p>SUTTON: I'm only aware of data showing increasing choices for consumers today. </p><p>STEUBE: Oh man, we're going to get back to iCloud. What is Amazon's share of the store market for the online cloud for your cloud? </p><p>SUTTON: We offer AWS for enterprises which is--is different than a personal online storage. </p><p>STEUBE: Ok. Any other comment on that? </p><p>SUTTON: With respect to enterprises the vast majority of that space is still operating on premise servers and cloud is a new and developing space. We are one of the innovators so we are a leader but the competition primarily exists with longstanding on premise IT competitors. </p><p>STEUBE: When did Amazon get into the cloud services market? </p><p>SUTTON: A--a number of years ago. I don't remember the exact year. </p><p>STEUBE: And how fast has this market share grown on the cloud? </p><p>SUTTON: Amazon in--innovated in creating cloud options for both storage and compute for enterprises. So as one of the early innovators we had a lead but So, as one of the early innovators we had a lead but competitors, major competitors have entered and are closing that gap such as Microsoft, IBM, Google and many others. Although again, cloud is still in its very early days and primarily IT is still serviced through on-premise servers. </p><p>STEUBE: All right, thank you. My time has expired. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. Chair now recognizes gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson, for five minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for holding this very important and timely committee hearing. And also, I want to thank the witnesses for your appearance today. Is it Perault, or Perault Mr. Perault? </p><p>PERAULT: It's Perault. </p><p>JOHNSON: Perault. Well, thank you, sir. Mr. Perault, when was the last time that Facebook changed its terms and conditions? </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you, congressman. </p><p>JOHNSON: You don't need to thank me. </p><p>PERAULT: We evaluate our terms and conditions on a regular basis. </p><p>JOHNSON: When is the last time you changed them? </p><p>PERAULT: We are constantly changing our terms and conditions to ensure that people have the best experience on our product. </p><p>JOHNSON: Certainly. So, how many times over the last year have you changed the terms and conditions? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, I don't have the specific data on that. I'd be happy to get back to you. </p><p>JOHNSON: Times? How many? </p><p>PERAULT: I don't have the data. I don't have the data but I do know that we--that we certainly face significant concerns about various different aspects of our product including privacy. That's one of the reasons that we've actually called for regulation in that area. </p><p>JOHNSON: Ok. Well, I--I just wanted to know approximately how many times terms and conditions have changed. Recent report from the Stickler Center(PH) observed, quote, one way in which digital platforms exploit their market share or their market power is by requiring consumers to agree to terms and conditions that are unclear, difficult to understand and constantly changing. Do you agree with that assessment? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, we take privacy very seriously. It's important to us that we provide users with significant transparency and control. </p><p>JOHNSON: I understand. I guess the point I'm trying to make is the users don't really have much--much buy in to the situation. They either have to check the box agreeing to the terms and conditions. Often times having--having not read it in order to get the service or maintain the service or they just go without the service. So, a user may sign up with one set of terms and conditions, invest valuable time in building a social network on Facebook and then a month later be faced with a different set of terms and conditions. And because there is no real alternative to Facebook the user has no choice but--but to accept those changes, isn't that correct? </p><p>PERAULT: No, congressman that--that is not correct. We certainly-- </p><p>JOHNSON: There is competition with Facebook? </p><p>PERAULT: Yes, congressman. There is. We face fierce competition for all the products and services that we offer. </p><p>JOHNSON: Who would be the competition if I might? </p><p>PERAULT: So, many of our competitors--many of our competitors are sitting here at this table with me. In a-- </p><p>JOHNSON: I--I think you're in a unique chair--in a unique position among those who are seated at the tale. Each one of you occupy a unique and dominant position. But Facebook stands alone in terms of social media. Any other social media platform that could compete with Facebook? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, we certainly hope that--we certainly hope that in many ways that we are unique there may not be an identical competitor to Facebook. We try to differentiate our services in an innovative tech industry in which we compete. But yes, there is significant competition in advertising-- </p><p>JOHNSON: Well I'd like to offline I'd like to get a list from you so that I could do some shopping around myself. And that's not to disparage Facebook's offering. I just would like to know who your competition is. It's not readily apparent. Facebook's terms of service maintain that user's \"own\" their data. Yet Facebook has repeatedly prevented users from transferring their data to certain rival platforms including Twitter, Vine, Voxer and MessageMe. How do you reconcile Facebook's stated policy that users own their data with Facebook's repeated refusal to allow users to transfer their data to--their data to rival platforms? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, we do offer a data portability product. And we've offered that product for a long period of time. It's called download your information. We've improved that product in the wake--in the wake of the GDPR in Europe. We are actually a member of the-- </p><p>JOHNSON: You can actually transfer the Facebook data to another platform? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, you are able to take your data out of Facebook to another platform, yes. We are also members of the data transfer project along with several other companies to try to look for ways to facilitate better data portability and our CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has actually called for regulation in this area because of many of the difficult technical and privacy issues at stake. It's one that we're hoping to look to work with congress on to improve the offerings for our users. </p><p>JOHNSON: All right. Thank you, sir. And I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman and I now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Demings for five minutes. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and thank you to all of our witnesses for being with us today. Mr. Sutton, bear with us. In recent years, Amazon has started selling digital advertisement placements. Analysts estimate that digital ads brought tin around $11 billion in business last year. Because businesses are increasingly dependent on Amazon some of them are concerned that Amazon is using its ad business to squeeze more money. As a Bloomberg reporter recently wrote, Amazon's advertising is better understood as an additional tax the company imposes on the millions of businesses that sell through its vast digital mole. It's one more toll extracted from sellers according to the reporter. </p><p>Given how dependent businesses are on Amazon's platform for online sales--what, if anything, Mr. Sutton prevents Amazon from using ads as another way to charge a toll for using its platforms. </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you for the question. We do offer advertising as a service to our sellers--as an optional service that's not necessary but that they can use to help get their products discovered. The large majority of products sold in our store are not sold through advertisements. Again, there are many ways in which sellers have many options. We provide that as an additional one. We know that they have many other options online where customers shop as well as offline. </p><p>DEMINGS: So, what would your response be to the reporter's statement that, Amazon's advertising is better understood as an additional tax the company imposes on the millions of businesses that sells through its vast digital mole? </p><p>SUTTON: Respectfully, I disagree that statement is not correct. It is not a tax. It is like many services we offer that's optional. And again, there are many other ways that sellers can advertise. They can sell--advertise through general purpose search still remains the most popular way for customers to find products online. And in fact, it's one of the reasons we are one of the largest customers of Google. </p><p>[*]DEMINGS: Did you say the number is correct, that you brought in about $11 billion in advertising last year? Does that sound about right? </p><p>SUTTON: I don't know that exact figure. I'm happy to follow-up with it. </p><p>DEMINGS: Okay. Mr. Sutton, who do you view as Amazon's competitors, with regard to third-party sellers? And if you've already covered this, I do apologize. But who do you view as Amazon's competitors as it pertains to third party sellers? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you for the question. Third-party sellers have a wide variety of ways to sell. They can sell directly through brick and mortar retail stores, through their own website, and there are dozens of online marketplaces for them as well from Walmart to eBay-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --So let's just say if I'm a third-party seller, what other platforms can I list my products on that would allow them to be seen by a competing number of buyers? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you. Again, they could list on Walmart, they could list on eBay, Target now has launched a marketplace, there are other new marketplaces including also the ones from Chinese companies such as Ali Baba, Racutan (SP). There are increasingly numbers. In fact, there are so many marketplaces that there is a billion-dollar industry that has grown up to provide services to sellers so that they can use them to list across all marketplaces at the same time. </p><p>DEMINGS: And you believe that those other platforms are competitive, allow for competitive services? </p><p>SUTTON: Yes, absolutely. </p><p>DEMINGS: Okay. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: I think the gentlelady. I now could recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse, for five minutes. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the witnesses for appearing today and for your testimony. I agree with my distinguished colleague from North Dakota. Antitrust analysis is obviously very fact specific and case specific and industry-specific and so forth. I want to talk a little bit today about Facebook. So Mr. Perault, following up on a question from the gentleman from Georgia, I think what he was getting at is this, is Facebook, in your view, a monopoly? </p><p>PERAULT: No, congressman. It is not. </p><p>NEGUSE: Ok. So I assume the reason is because, in your view, Facebook has a number of competitors, as you said, and a number of products that the company offers. Would that be a fair characterization of your view? </p><p>PERAULT: Yes, congressman, that's correct. </p><p>NEGUSE: What is the largest social media network platform company by active users in the world? Do you know? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, I don't. I do know that we have 2.7 billion users. </p><p>NEGUSE: I can tell you that it's Facebook. It's number one. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Do you know the third-largest company is WhatsApp? Who owns WhatsApp for what company owns WhatsApp? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, we do. </p><p>NEGUSE: All right, Facebook, correct? </p><p>PERAULT: Yes, congressman. </p><p>NEGUSE: And the fourth largest social media network platform in the world by active users is Facebook Messenger. I won't make you answer the question. Suffice to say that that company is also--that service also owned by Facebook. The six largest is Instagram. What company owns Instagram? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, Facebook does. </p><p>NEGUSE: Ok. So you can understand the skepticism because when a company owns four of the largest six entities measured by active users in the world, in that industry, we have a word for that. That's monopoly or--or at least monopoly power. Now you know, with respect to my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, he is right that under the Sherman Antitrust Act, a measure of whether or not a company is engaged in monopolistic activities is whether or not there's anticompetitive conduct at--at play. But you know, I suspect you and I may have some disagreements on that front. </p><p>And just to give you a sense of kind of the way in which I think a number of us are evaluating the facts before us, if you could turn Exhibit 1.5, if the committee staff would just put that up on the screen, this is a document, my understanding is there are a number of documents that were published about eight months ago as a result of a parliamentary inquiry conducted by the UK Parliament with respect to Facebook and various activities of the company. This is a platform policy, Platform Policy Number Four, and you'll see under their highlighted subparagraph one the language \"Add something unique to the community. Don't replicate core functionality that Facebook already provides.\" This was a policy maintained by Facebook. Is that correct? </p><p>PERAULT: That is correct although, unfortunately, I'm having trouble seeing the exhibit. As I've gotten older, my eyes have gotten worse. </p><p>NEGUSE: Mine as well. There-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: --It's behind you as well, Mr. Perault-- </p><p>NEGUSE: --We'll be sure to provide you a copy. This is no longer a policy maintained by Facebook. Is that correct? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, that's correct. </p><p>NEGUSE: Okay. And I presume that is because this policy, facially (SP), could be construed as an anticompetitive one. Correct? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, we have--thank you very much. The Facebook platform was designed to enable third parties to engage in complementary innovation that would benefit the people who use our services. When we launch the Facebook platform, we did have rules of the road. We continue to have rules of the road that balance a variety of considerations, including protecting the user experience, protecting privacy and protecting our investment in our product. We have reevaluated those policies over time and have changed them to fit the evolving nature of the industry in which we exist. </p><p>NEGUSE: Well, I appreciate that, and I understand that industries change, industries evolve, and that your business is to evolve to comport with that. I would say, you know, from my vantage point, my understanding is Facebook did have a policy early in its tenure, which it's Exhibit 1, in which the company welcomed developers with competing applications, including developers whose applications might compete with Facebook built applications. That was a policy that was then repealed in favor of policy 4.1, the prior document that I just showed. </p><p>So this notion that Facebook has been open to competition, as you described in your opening testimony, this notion that it's a core value of the company is not borne out by the documentary evidence that we've seen. And I think that's in part why we're having this important hearing today. I see that my time is expired. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I think the gentleman. I now recognize the gentle lady from Georgia, Ms. McBath. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony today. I am truly, deeply concerned about the success of businesses in my district. I represent Georgia's Sixth Congressional District and small, locally owned businesses are the economic life blood of our communities and they should have access to markets and consumers without facing anti-competitive constraints. I also believe that Congress and agencies have a serious responsibility to make sure that there is real competition in the market so that startups, small businesses and local retailers are able to compete on the merits and give people the best options they can find. </p><p>Mr. Sutton, this morning, I met with sellers that have had a very positive experience growing their business through Amazon, but some sellers have had a completely different kind of experience. Some sellers report that Amazon uses a variety of tactics to funnel merchants into using Fulfillment by Amazon. International antitrust authorities are investigating whether Amazon privileges third-party vendors that use Fulfillment by Amazon. Now, does Amazon privilege vendors who use Amazon's fulfillment services over those who choose not to? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you for the question. Amazon is very proud of all we've done to invest and help sellers succeed. And one of those ways is we built a very successful operation and delivery system and we open that up and made that available for sellers to use Fulfillment by Amazon. It's an optional service that sellers can use if they want to. We continue to invest and provide tools for them to shift directly as well. </p><p>We ally apply the same--we do not favor sell--products that use FBA over others. Obviously, FBA is one way to provide quick delivery amongst many and we know that our customers do appreciate quick delivery. That's why we gave that as an option to our sellers to use amongst the various shipping options they have. </p><p>MCBATH: On the second--second panel that we have today, Ms. Mitchell in her written testimony, she highlights how Amazon abruptly and arbitrarily suspends merchants' accounts, freezing their funds and shutting down their Amazon pages. According to her statement, Amazon frequently makes these decisions without explanation, leaving merchants to navigate a black box while their livelihoods are hanging in the balance. According to another report in the Verge, \"Sellers are more worried about a case being opened on Amazon than in actual court.\" So Mr. Sutton, how many employees does Amazon have that are dedicated to addressing these kinds of concerns? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you. Amazon, again, partners with sellers and we are happy--we are very proud of our success in helping them grow and now be growing twice as fast as Amazon. We reluctantly take action-- </p><p>MCBATH: --But how many--but how many do you have, sir, that are-- </p><p>SUTTON: We have thousands of employees dedicated to helping and address concerns from third-party sellers. We do--we absolutely did not take arbitrary action, but we do have to take action on occasion when necessary. There are a dedicated group of bad actors that attempt to sell fraudulent products or counterfeit products or even dangerous products, and we have to take swift and immediate action to protect customers and to protect the legitimate sellers. We try to do that through a transparent process and we always provide an opportunity for sellers to appeal or to provide additional information if they think we got it wrong. In the vast number of situations, they do not take advantage of those opportunities. </p><p>MCBATH: So how do you respond to the concern from merchants who have been abruptly suspended by Amazon who they say have no way of ever reaching an Amazon employee to make their case? And so what recourse do they actually have? </p><p>SUTTON: We provide a variety of ways for them to reach out-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Such as </p><p>SUTTON: I don't know the full way. I know we have a dedicated customer team. We provide a tool, a dashboard tool, so they can see the status of their account. We have a dedicated team that will affirmatively follow up in the more serious cases. We may communicate via email and allow them to respond and provide details via email. There is a variety of ways in which we try to always communicate and to receive communications from our sellers. I would be happy to follow up and provide the full examples and details of that for you as well. </p><p>[*]MCBATH: If you could I would appreciate it. It is also important to me that we keep good-paying jobs in our communities. Too often we hear that retailers, manufacturers, and suppliers have an uphill battle due to anti-competitive prices online and Mr. Sutton again numerous reports have identified instances when online platforms price good significantly below cost over the long term threatening mainstream businesses and other retailers who can't compete on those terms. </p><p>In a letter that I am going to be asked be placed in the record for today Mr. Chairman-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. </p><p>MCBATH: thank you. The retail industry leaders Association notes that although intense competition is a hallmark of America's retail industry the absence of competition elsewhere in the retail ecosystem stifles the benefits that have historically resulted from the intense competition--through this intense competition. Mr. Sutton once again how do you respond to concerns that Amazon has the ability to absorb losses in any market that it chooses? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you. Amazon faces fierce retail competition across many and including from many members of (INAUDIBLE) who are amongst our biggest competitors such as Walmart. </p><p>Amazon has run a profitable retail business for many years. The retail business because of the competition is very thin margins but our retail business in the United States has been profitable. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. And Mr. Cohen given the extraordinary power-- </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlelady's time has expired but if you have-- </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Raskin. </p><p>RASKIN: Mr. Chairman thank you very much. I have a question for Mr. Cohen. According to data produced by Rand Fiskan(SP), Google controls over 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States so congratulations on that. Although this seems to fit the classical definition of monopoly Google has argued that the company's monopoly in the search market is nothing to worry about because competition is just a click away. Is this--I just want to make sure I've got Google's position right. Is--is that essentially the argument against viewing it as a monopoly? </p><p>COHEN: Thank you for the question, congressman. I would say that that definition of the market is quite narrow and that when consumers are searching for information online there are a range of different services that they use. For example, when people are searching for products the majority of Americans start their product searches on Amazon when they are searching for places to travel, hotels and airlines. They start with dedicated specialist competitors. So I think the market is much broader than that. </p><p>RASKIN: Well let me follow up then. I understand that Google paid Apple $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019 for the right to be the default search engine on Safari. Is that right? </p><p>COHEN: Congressman, I'm not familiar with those numbers. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Billion is a big number so it's big numbers. Would Google pay these sums if there were really an effective competitive market in place? </p><p>COHEN: Congressman, I am not familiar with those numbers. We do reach syndication agreements with a range of different partners. I think-- </p><p>RASKIN: Are you familiar with the deal that was (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>COHEN: I--I'm not close to the terms of the deal. I think if anything the prices probably reflect the control or the decisions made by platforms rather than somebody seeking to syndicate their services on those platforms. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. I mean my sense is that if these numbers are correct it is spending over $20 billion in two years to essentially secure its place as the default search engine suggest that Google recognizes that defaults matter and that switching cost for users are high. But I--I appreciate your thoughts on that. </p><p>Let me come to Mr. and deer. You are here, thank you. Apple CEO Mr. Cook has argued that unlike your peers who run ad-based businesses Apple is a company that fundamentally is privacy oriented. Do you believe that Apple is a privacy-oriented business? </p><p>ANDEER: Yes, absolutely. We believe privacy is a fundamental human right. </p><p>RASKIN: Well, then why has Apple allowed Google to be the default search engine on Safari? </p><p>ANDEER: Apple has with all of its products focused on what is the best consumer experience and so when it comes to search we conducted an open competition to see what did we think would be the best for our consumers and consumers have always gone to Google and so we ultimately selected Google but we also make a number of options available to them so it's very easy to change the default on your iPhone to any number of choices including duckduckgo and other search engines that perhaps have more privacy protections. </p><p>RASKIN: Apple charges app developers a 30 percent tax on in-app purchases in the first year and then 15 percent every year thereafter. In a statement submitted for the record, Spotify argues that by charging the 30 percent tax on in-app purchases Apple forces app providers to make an impossible choice, either pass the cost on to consumers or refuse to pay the commission and face a litany of technical hurdles imposed by Apple. These complaints have been echoed by other app developers as you may know. </p><p>Mr. Andeer, how did Apple arrive at the amount of a 30 percent fee and could Apple charge a 35 percent or 45 percent or 50 percent fee for in-app purchases? </p><p>ANDEER: So I think--thank you for the question. 84 percent of the apps, over 2 million apps available on the App Store pay nothing to Apple. It's only a very small percentage that pay a commission. When it comes to spot a five we are--they are one of our most successful developers but yet they pay a commission on less than 1 percent of their subscribers to Apple and so they have been able to build a very successful business thanks to the App Store and we are proud of their success. We continue to invest in tools, and other resources to make it very easy for developers to create great applications. </p><p>You ask about how we came to the 30 percent. 10 years ago and it's easy to forget most software was distributed through physical distribution like CompUSA or Best Buy. Typically a developer would share up to 60 percent, 70 percent of the retail price with the descriptive--distribution channels so we set a very aggressive price of 30 percent only applying to digital content in an effort to compete for those developers mind share and it has been very successful. </p><p>RASKIN: Do--do I have time Mr. Chairman for one more question? </p><p>CICILLINE: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Just a quick question for Mr. Perault. Facebook announced in January that it would be integrating WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, an announcement that coincided with growing calls in different places to break up Facebook specifically by in doing the buyout of What's App and Instagram. Facebook says the integration will let it protect users by providing end to end encryption. Is Facebook's integration ploy and attempt to thwart or preempt these efforts to break up Facebook? </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you, congressman. No, it is not. We face fierce competition for the products and services that we offer. It is our understanding that there are many services in the market that offer more and more privacy-protective services and so our pipit toward privacy with respect to enter operating our services was because of the competition that we faced in the market. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank--think the gentleman and the ranking member has agreed to do a second round of questions so and I--I appreciate that indulgence. Mr. Sutton, I want to just turn to you for a moment. In your testimony, you have repeatedly emphasized that Amazon is a great partner to third-party merchants but reports suggest that Amazon has been steadily increasing the fees it charges merchants. According to a recent article in the Washington Monthly in 2014 Amazon fulfillment fees accounted for 17 percent of the seller's total cost. Today Amazon has raised fees so they now amount to around 27 percent of sellers cost. Amazon has also increased storage fees by over 40 percent since 2015. Seller fees are extremely lucrative for Amazon earning the company over $42 billion in 2018 according to the same article and so Mr. Sutton my question is given how dependent merchants are on Amazon's platform aren't these steady fee hikes by Amazon a pure exercise of its outsized buyer power? </p><p>SUTTON: Thank you for the question. It is because sellers have so many options that we have to provide competitive options and those fee estimates are not accurate. The fees that are necessary to be paid in our store to sell items have actually been steady for a number of years and slightly declining. There are optional fees such as fulfillment which are competitively priced to other fulfillment options and they reflect the cost of fulfilling products, sending items, storing them of that nature but that--those are reflective and competitive with other options sellers would have through the many other third parties that offer similar services or doing it themselves. </p><p>CICILLINE: Well I--I would be anxious to receive from you the data that disputes the numbers. But let me understand the argument. You said because the seller has so many options we should, therefore, that's the explanation for increased cost by Amazon on the seller that it is the exact opposite? I mean the fact that sellers have other options would not cause Amazon to charge more money so I--I don't understand your argument. </p><p>SUTTON: I'm sorry let me clarify. </p><p>CICILLINE: Please. </p><p>SUTTON: It is because they have so many options that we partner with them and we charge fair fees. It is the reason our fees have been steady which was the point I was trying to make. The fees for listing in our store have stayed steady or slightly declined. Some of these optional fees are based on market cost and they have adjusted and they are competitive with other options in that space. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. Over the years various reporting has documented the aggressive and predatory business tactics that Amazon employees. In 2013 Brad Stone(SP) reported that Amazon named one of its business campaigns the gazelle(SP) project. This strategy where Amazon would approach small publishers and I quote the way that aid cheetah would basically gazelle\". Is the gazelle project still in place, Mr. Sutton? </p><p>SUTTON: I'm not familiar with that project. What I can-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Okay, if you could get back to me with an answer and I also would like to know whether Amazon pursues similarly predatory campaigns and other parts of your business and if you could get me answers to both of those questions I would appreciate it. </p><p>The final thing I want to just ask is this committee's investigation is extremely important for the economy, for consumers, for those we represent and I hope that each of the witnesses today will pledge on behalf of the companies they represent to cooperate to the fullest extent possible and to act in good faith to respond to the committee request in a timely and complete manner. I will ask you Mr. Andeer if you can answer that question on behalf of your company. </p><p>ANDEER: Yes, we will. </p><p>CICILLINE: And you Mr. Sutton? </p><p>SUTTON: Yes. </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Perault? </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you, Chairman. Yes, we will. </p><p>CICILLINE: And Mr. Cohen? </p><p>COHEN: Yes, gladly. </p><p>CICILLINE: And--and finally, there has been some reporting of I think very disturbing efforts by a particular company to aggressively impede Congressional oversight to go so far as to hire opposition research firms to do opposition research on members of Congress and staff of the committee. And so, I would similarly ask you, in the spirit of cooperation, do you commit to not engaging in those tactics in response to this investigation? Mr. Andeer? </p><p>[*]ANDEER: Yes, we would never engage in that sort of conduct. </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Sutton? </p><p>SUTTON: Yes. </p><p>PERAULT: Yes. </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Perault, thank you. Mr. Cohen?  </p><p>COHEN: Yes. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. With that, I'll recognize the gentleman of North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, the--Mr. Andeer, the 30 percent markup on apps, that's been the same since the company started--since the App Store started, right?  </p><p>ANDEER: Yes, it's correct, but for some apps we actually reduce that to 15 percent. And of course, that 30 percent only applies to less than 16 percent of the apps on the App Store. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Yeah. And that--and you said 84 percent don't pay anything, right? </p><p>ANDEER: That's correct.  </p><p>ARMSTRONG: But what percentage of the total U.S. global revenue from maps comes from the remaining 16 percent that do share revenue? </p><p>ANDEER: I--I don't know the answer to that question. I do know that developers monetize in a number of ways. And so, we have developers on the App Store that monetize through advertising, through selling of physical goods, through the selling of services. The value that developers collect through the App Store is probably hundreds of billions, perhaps over a trillion dollars. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: So, how does the Apple App Store it into your company's offerings? </p><p>ANDEER: So, I--I think to provide some context, when we launched the first iPhone, it didn't include the App Store. We thought developers and content creators what access consumers through the Safari web browser, and we've long supported an open and free internet. We created the App Store as a complement, an alternative to the open and free internet. </p><p>Now, we have done a lot to encourage developers to create as many great apps as possible. And we really look at it as a way to continue to sell devices. We're a device company at the end of the day, and we're looking to convince consumers that we offer the best possible product. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: How about Apple Music? </p><p>ANDEER: Apple Music is part of that strategy. So, we offer Apple Music, but we also make it very easy for competitors to access each and every iOS user through the App Store. So, Spotify, Google Play Music, and dozens of others offer apps that compete with Apple Music. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Is Apple more of a hardware business, a software business, or a platform business? </p><p>ANDEER: We think of ourselves as a products company first and foremost. So, we are selling an experience to consumers. We are selling an entire product, so everything from hardware, software, to services. It's the total package. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: To what degree does Apple share or not share markets with the other companies providing testimony today? </p><p>ANDEER: In various--we compete with all of the companies on this panel in various ways in addition to dozens of others. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I just did that because I felt like you didn't have enough questions in during the first round of questions. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>So, I wanted to make sure it's there.  </p><p>ANDEER: Thank you. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And this is going to go back to what my friend, Mr. Neguse was talking about, and I'm going to go to Mr. Perault. Can you--you can't use Facebook Messenger without Facebook, right, or can you? </p><p>PERAULT: I believe that you can, congressman. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Okay. So, they are two separate and distinct--do you know what percentage of people use Messenger that don't use Facebook? </p><p>PERAULT: I do not have that data, be happy to follow up. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And the reason I bring it up is when we talk about competition versus compliment--I mean competition versus complementing and I mean how we use this, like I just asked you all of those things because I wouldn't know where to get anything other than Apple--the Apple App Store. I've only--I mean, I'm sure other things exist, but I don't know about them. And I think there's a lot of us that are in that situation. </p><p>So--and with that, I just think as we're closing this out, I hope as we move forward, these hearings become more focused, more single topic specific focused. And then I would just encourage everybody and the companies who are testifying to be forthright with answers. I mean, the questions that are--I can tell you about half the questions that are going to be asked today, of which I'm assuming you all with your vast resources and the company resource can do as well. And it sure makes it a lot easier if--as we go forward and we focus on specific topics or specific things, it'll be easier for everybody if we are more forthright--forthright and honest and transparent with our answers. So, with that, I yield. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. McBath, for five minutes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Google Maps is overrun with millions of all business addresses and fake names, as many as 11 million. The article also noted that Google's ad business actually profits from these scams while consumers and legitimate locally owned businesses suffer. </p><p>Mr. Cohen, given the extraordinary power that Google enjoys over the small and local businesses, what measures is Google taking to identify and remove fraudulent listings? And is it a lack of competition in online search that allows Google to be so complacent about addressing this problem head-on? </p><p>COHEN: Congresswoman, thank you for the question. I'm not familiar with this Wall Street Journal report. I'm also not familiar with any claims of fraudulent listings in Google Maps of that scale. We take a number of measures to address fraudulent--fraudulent listings. It is in our interest to present the most accurate, up-to-date information as possible to our consumers precisely because we operate in a competitive marketplace. </p><p>MCBATH: And can you make available for the committee those processes that you used to make sure that people are fraudulently-- </p><p>COHEN: --I would be glad to follow up with--once I discuss it with the experts at our company. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. Thank you. And with that, I relinquish-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --the gentlelady-- </p><p>MCBATH: --the rest of my time-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --yields back. I recognize the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Raskin, for five minutes. </p><p>RASKIN: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I'm concerned about business conduct that discriminates against competitors online. And because your platforms are so dominant, a decision by any one of them, whether it's deliberate or accidental, malignant or benign, can be fatal for a business that relies on your platform in order to reach their customers. </p><p>First of all, do you all agree that, in theory, each of your businesses can pick winners and losers in the--in the marketplace? Maybe we can go down the line. Would you agree, Mr. Andeer?  </p><p>ANDEER: No, I--I don't. I--I look at the--the facts of the marketplace. And each and every single market in which we compete, whether it's music or books or video, there are companies that are far more successful on our platform than we are. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Mr. Sutton, what's your response? </p><p>SUTTON: Respectfully, I disagree. We--Amazon offers one store amongst thousands of retail options for customers who shop across them every day. Customers pick the winners and losers. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Mr. Perault? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, I--I disagree as well. We face fierce competition for the products and services that we offer. </p><p>RASKIN: Yeah. And Mr. Cohen? </p><p>COHEN: Yes, congressman, online people can traffic anywhere they like. They can click on whatever services they like. And we often see that in our search results. New companies and new ideas are surfacing all the time that we never heard of.  </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Let's work our way back down the other way then. Do you have processes in place for businesses to seek redress if they believe that they been discriminated against by your platform?  </p><p>COHEN: Yes, congressman, we do.  </p><p>RASKIN: You do. Can you just describe briefly what that is? </p><p>COHEN: There is a process for--for forms to appeal the way that they are ranked. I'm not familiar with how it works in depth, but I'd be happy to follow up with you. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Mr. Perault? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, we do have processes as well. We have an appeals process, for instance, and were looking to expand and improve that process. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. And--and that appeals process, how does that work? Would they go to--who do they go to? </p><p>PERAULT: Congressman, pages, for instance, that are disabled on Facebook, they're able to appeal the fact that they're disabled. We would then review that and make a--and then make a--a determination on the appeal. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Mr. Sutton? </p><p>SUTTON: Most of our larger competitors operate their own dependent stores, not through Amazon. With respect to the small and medium-size sellers that sell through our store, we have many processes in place. We have a seller central that provides a lot of tools and services for them and lots of opportunities to--to communicate with Amazon if they have any concerns. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. And Mr. Andeer? </p><p>ANDEER: First and foremost, it's the consumers who make it very clear if they're unhappy with the experience on our products. And we have been very straightforward with wanting to offer not just our own services but third-party services as well. I would also say that we also employ hundreds of Apple employees who are focused on reviewing apps and are in constant communication with developers. And there is an escalation path within Apple to make sure any concerns or issues are quickly escalated, and we address those each and every week. </p><p>RASKIN: Great. Thank you very much for those answers. </p><p>Companies across the digital markets nonetheless live in fear of retaliation, I think, by any of the firms that you represent. And this fear has kept some of them from speaking out publicly about the anticompetitive practices that they experience. And the committee has received a lot of communications from people in advance of this hearing. </p><p>One business wrote, unfortunately, we're not able to be more public at this time out of concern for retribution to our business. Another wrote, given how powerful Google is and their past actions, we are quite frankly worried about retaliation. So, my question to you is would you commit that, on behalf of your company, that you will not retaliate in any way against any of the businesses that cooperate with this committee or share requested information with us as part of the investigation? Will you all agreed to a non-retaliation policy towards businesses that participate? Mr. Andeer? </p><p>ANDEER: Yes. As Apple's chief (INAUDIBLE) officer. I would take such an allegation of retaliation extremely seriously. </p><p>RASKIN: That's great to hear. Mr. Sutton? </p><p>SUTTON: Yes, we would absolutely not retaliate against anyone who cooperates with the committee. </p><p>RASKIN: Mr. Perault? </p><p>PERAULT: Thank you, congressman. Yes. </p><p>RASKIN: Mr. Cohen? </p><p>COHEN: Yes from me too. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay. Well, I appreciate that because, you know, you guys have good done a good job representing your businesses, but if there were a monopoly and you asked them if they were a monopoly, they would say they were not a monopoly. So obviously, we've got to do work that goes beyond just asking you for your opinion on it. We've got to talk to other people. And so for that to be meaningful, they can't be living in fear of retaliation from you. So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. We have now been notified that the ranking member of the full judiciary committee has called for a roll call vote, so we're going to take a quick 10-minute recess so we can all vote and we'll resume with the second panel. I want to thank the witnesses for our first panel for being here, and you are excused. You're welcome, of course, to stay for the second panel, but we very much appreciate you being here today and sharing the perspective on the current state of competition in the digital marketplace. We are in recess until the call of the chair. </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: I again want to apologize to our witnesses. There is historic action on the House floor that has taken a number of our committee members away from the committee but I would like to get started and now we will introduce our second panel of witnesses. </p><p>The first witness in our second panel is Timothy Wu, the Julius Silver professor of law at Columbia Law School.

Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief so help you God? Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you. You may be seated.  </p><p>Please know that each of your written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. Accordingly, I asked that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. To help you stay within a time there's a timing light on the table. When the light turns green to yellow you have one minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red it signals that your five minutes has expired, and we will begin Mr. Wu with you. You have five minutes. </p><p>WU:  Thank you Chairman and other members of the committee. It is a great pleasure to be here today and I'm very grateful that the subcommittee is--is conducting this work and these investigations and I believe this is one of the most important economic issues facing our country. </p><p>I think we face a vitally important question here which is this whether the United States will remain the place that new industries start, the place where startups get--get their start. The place where--where inventors think that they--they have a chance to challenge the dominant firms of their day where innovation flourishes, where really the United dates is capable of being the place as I have said before that new industries are started and I think that is something that has come into question. I think that we face across the economy an over-consolidation, an over-concentration of many industries and I think this is particularly evident and in fact extreme in the tech industries.  </p><p>So over the last two hours of the first panel we listen to something that to me could have been a hearing in the year 2005 or--or maybe almost a fantasy zone. If we are to believe what the test of fires were saying and they were under oath we live in a time of incredibly fierce competition, I could leave us here go to my garage and start a challenger to Google, Facebook and Amazon. There are no barriers to competition. Every competition is only one click away.  </p><p>I think that everybody knows that's not true. There's--there's no mystery anymore about whether the tech markets have flipped. There is no question as to whether there are barriers to entry and whether the tech economies have in fact become a very difficult place for people to get started. People are starting to talk about the decline in the number of startups almost unthinkable in the United States which is always a comparative advantage in being the place where startups would get their start.  </p><p>So I think it is time for the reassertion of what I think have been incredibly successful policies from the last century namely the antitrust laws and procompetitive regulation on the model of the telecom laws and some of the FTC regulations. We have a trilogy--a trilogy of cases in the tech space in particular. IBM, AT&amp;T, and Microsoft which were big section 2 cases which were criticized at the time of being certain to interfere with competition and hurt American companies at a time when Japan seemed very threatening. </p><p>In retrospect when you look back at the effects of these big cases they loosened up the tech markets, they helped to contribute to an enormous boom in the tech and telecom markets that lasted and has lasted more than 30 years and has restored the United States to a place of global leadership in the tech market. So I think that trilogy of cases and some of the most important procompetitive regulation at the FCC and FTC is the policy we need in this time and not a policy of trying to endorse or support national champions.  </p><p>If I have time in questions I will address some of the things that were said earlier but I want to address one or two right now. In--in the testimony we heard earlier I think it's very notable that Facebook had trouble naming competitors. They were repeatedly asked; they couldn't the competitor. I think there's a principal reason for that, they have bought their competitors.  </p><p>They had bought the most threatening companies to them and that is the reason it so hard for them to name them. They could have said Instagram and WhatsApp but they own them. In fact and Facebook also said that its intent about these companies was perfectly benign. It saw them as promising companies wanted to incubate them.  </p><p>I suggest that the subcommittee look into an email written by Mark Zuckerberg around the time of the Instagram acquisition where he stated as been reported in the press that the purpose of this and this is paraphrasing was to eliminate a dangerous potential nascent competitor. You have subpoena power if I'm not mistaken and it might not be a bad idea to get your hands on that letter.  </p><p>I will speak just in my last 20 seconds about Goo--Amazon and their testimony. I--Amazon swore up that there's nothing funny about their searches or algorithms, they--they would never favor their own product over another, but I think there needs to be serious scrutiny of the Amazon search engine. The FTC in 2001 issued a ruling suggesting--or a letter saying that search should be what consumers expect, and I think we have under-enforcement of the questions as to whether searches are deceptive.  </p><p>And I'm over my time, but I will suggest that in each of these comments, there were statements that were really not reflective of the competition--conditions of the competition in this country and the conditions of innovation. And I'm so glad that the subcommittee is taking the time to take a look at these issues. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Professor Wu, and I assure you that the committee is not bound by the characterizations of the witnesses about the nature of the markets or the lack of competition. That's the purpose of the investigation, and we'll take you up on your suggestions. Next, I recognize Dr. Fiona Scott Morton for five minutes. </p><p>SCOTT MORTON: Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Cicilline for the invitation to testify today. I agree with my colleague that we have just heard four very careful corporate discussions. From an economist's perspective, there were a number of concerns that they failed to mention, those in particular that negatively impact competition and innovation.  </p><p>Digital platforms provide tremendous benefits, and yet they've also created problems such as insufficient competition, and that leads to too little innovation on--and on entrepreneurship. I urge you as a committee to use this investigation to identify what types of antitrust enhancements and regular--regulatory tools are needed to both jumpstart, competition in the sector and protect it going forward to the benefit both of consumers and small businesses.  </p><p>As is detailed in the report that I submitted as my testimony, there are a number of characteristics of platforms that tend to drive them toward concentrated markets. Very large economies of scale, consumers exacerbate this with their behavioral biases, we don't scroll down to the second page, we don't--we accept defaults, we follow the framing the platform gives us, and instead of searching independently. And what that does is it makes it very hard for small companies to grow and for new ones to get traction against a dominant platform.  </p><p>And without the threat of entry from entrepreneurs and growth from existing competitors, the dominant platform doesn't have to compete as hard. If it's not competing as hard, then there are several harms that follow from that. One is higher prices for advertisers. Many of these platforms are advertising supported. Then there's higher prices to consumers who may think that they are getting a good deal by paying a price of zero, but the competitive price might well be negative. The consumers might well be able to be paid for using these platforms in a competitive market.  </p><p>Other harms include low-quality in the form of less privacy, more advertising and more exploitative content that consumers can't avoid because, as Tim just said, there isn't anywhere else to go. And lastly, without competitive pressure, innovation is lessened, and in particular, it's channeled in the direction the dominant firm prefers rather than being creatively spread across the directions chosen by entrants. And this is what we learned both from the AT&amp;T and IBM and Microsoft is that when the dominant firm ceases to control innovation, there is a flowering, and it's very creative and--and market driven.  </p><p>So the solution to this problem of insufficient competition is complementary steps forward in both antitrust and regulation. Antitrust must recalibrate the balance it strikes between the risk of over enforcement and under enforcement. The evidence now shows we've been under enforcing for years and consumers have been harmed. We have advances in both the theory and empirical tools that demonstrate how we can better identify those harms and measure them.  </p><p>Digital platforms in particular do raise a number of practical enforcement challenges, for example, measuring quality adjusted prices. Okay, that's hard. But Congress could enable the agencies to bring these cases, nonetheless, by articulating through a statute the risks that Congress wishes courts to weigh and the evidence they should accept.  </p><p>For example, if a dominant platform wants to acquire a nascent entrant when there is uncertainty over how close a competitor that entrant is going to become in the future, how should courts treat that uncertainty? Okay, that today that uncertainty essentially defaults to buy anybody small you want. Okay, that's our rule. Congress could change that default to only--you only get to buy the nascent entrant if the dominant firm proves to the court that the acquisition will benefit consumers. And then only in that case can the merger occur.  </p><p>So the defaults that we use in court really matter in Congress can write laws that change those defaults. Congress could bring enforcement of the antitrust laws more in line with modern evidence and the resource intensity of modern investigations by shifting burdens of proof to defendants in certain settings. That would likely increase accuracy because the dominant or inquiring--acquiring firm has the understanding and evidence of its business model that's needed to assess the impact of the contact or merger conduct or merger.  </p><p>Lastly, regulation is a critical complement to more robust antitrust enforcement. Congress could give a regulator tools that allow it to move quickly, something that litigation typically does not do, and effectively when dominant platforms oppose a harm to competition. For example, a regulator could oversee a requirement that platforms don't harmfully discriminate between their own services and those arrivals. If an agency established a violation of the antitrust laws and determined that the best method of restoring competition was, for example, mandatory interoperability between the dominant firm and small entrants, a regulator could oversee and monitor that interoperability and make sure it happened.  </p><p>Other remedies that require monitoring might be data sharing, unbundling of services, or data porting from one service to another. A regulator could also establish baseline conditions for competition so that entrepreneurs can enter a more level playing for field and small businesses can grow. So for example, an open standard for micro payments to consumers would be helpful. </p><p>In conclusion, strengthening both antitrust enforcement and regulatory oversight of digital platforms is necessary, in my view, to achieve competition in this sector so that it best serves the American people. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Dr. Scott. Morton. And now, the chair recognizes Ms. Mitchell for five minutes. </p><p>MITCHELL: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, and members of the committee. I really appreciate this opportunity for to participate in this hearing and this historically important investigation. America's independent businesses are in trouble. They are declining rapidly across many sectors of the economy, and it's not because they can't compete. On the contrary, research shows that in many sectors, they actually outperform their larger rivals, include--on many measures, including price. </p><p>Rather, the evidence that--rather, the evidence suggests that the problem can be traced to changes in policy and particularly our antitrust enforcement have allowed a few dominant corporations to consolidate markets and giving them free reign to hobble their smaller competitors. Today, this is really--this threat is really magnified in our digital markets. A handful of dominant players now act as gatekeepers, Amazon in particular. Last year, Amazon captured about one of every two dollars that Americans spend online. But the more consequential measure of its market power is that half of all online shopping searches now start on Amazon's platform.  </p><p>What this means is if your--is that for every--virtually every company in the economy that either makes or--or retails anything, increasingly to reach the online market, you have little choice but to sell through a platform that's run by your most aggressive competitor. This is a bitter pill. Becoming a seller on Amazon's platform means forfeiting to Amazon your product knowledge, a trove of data about your transactions. It means giving Amazon a sizable cut of your revenue, and it means entering into a relationship that is often predatory.  </p><p>Studies show that Amazon learns from the retailers on its platform and starts selling their most popular items itself. It has capsized businesses overnight by changing its terms, gating products so they can't sell them suddenly, or simply canceling their accounts without explanation. In the absence of competing platforms, there is no downward pressure on the fees that Amazon can charge sellers. And indeed, these fees now constitute a sizable tax on its competitors trade. And although Amazon didn't address this directly today, it is true that in order to rank high and--and have a better chance of winning the buy box, you need to use its fulfillment services, and those fees have--have increased by double digits for the last few years.  </p><p>Amazon is many things. It's a platform, it's a retailer, it's a manufacturer, it's a digital ad giant, and so much more. And really, I think key to understanding its market power is that it's able to leverage the interplay between these different business lines to extort value from its competitors. An executive at a large well-known performance footwear brand that--that sells to Amazon told me that as long as his company sold to Amazon on their terms, they would help him police the counterfeiters and the other nefarious sellers on the platform. But the moment that they pushed back, that they didn't agree to that next big discount or the change in terms, Amazon's site became a wild west of sellers misrepresenting his brand, many overseas and unreachable. He said \"they use this as a punitive measure. They can sink companies without anyone to answer to.\"  </p><p>Increasingly, our commerce is occurring not in a market, but in a private arena governed by Amazon where it has the power to regulate, tax, and punish America's entrepreneurs. And the consequences of this are being felt around the country. There are a few metros that are doing well, but most places are not. Local businesses are disappearing, and with them, a pathway to the middle class. Producers are struggling to invest in new products and grow their companies. New business formation is down to historic lows. And for many Americans, including those who walked out of an Amazon warehouse this week, work has become increasingly explicated because there are so for you few companies competing for their labor. Amazon would like us to believe that to challenge its dominance is to somehow challenge the digital resolution itself. But the issue here is not technology. It's power and it's the policies that enable that concentration of power. In fact, the urgent risk we face if we do not act is that entrepreneurial</p><p>ism and invention will become increasingly stifled.  </p><p>I hope the committee will consider several policy--policy tools as part of this investigation. In particular, we very much endorse the approach that Congress took with regard to the railroads, that if you operate essential infrastructure you can't also compete with the businesses that rely on that infrastructure. But we also need nondiscrimination roles for platforms, stronger enforcement against the anti-competitive contact--conduct, in changes to merger policy, particularly in light of the pivotal acquisitions that Amazon and other tech giants have made that have flown under the enforcement agencies radar. </p><p>Thank you very much. </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: Thank you, Ms. Mitchell. The chair now recognizes Ms. Ohlhausen for five minutes. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN: My thanks to Chairman Cicilline and members of the committee for inviting me to testify. I'm a Maureen Ohlhausen, and as a former acting chairman and commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission and a longtime antitrust practitioner, I hope to offer some perspectives to assist the committee with its important inquiry. </p><p>In reaction to today's technology driven economy, there is a perception in some quarters that antitrust needs to change from principally protecting consumers to pursuing other goals. Given the clear consumer benefits of technology driven innovation, however, I'm concerned about reducing the focus on consumer welfare. But believing that consumer welfare is the appropriate goal does not mean being passive or embracing the view that antitrust cannot improve its tools to detect anticompetitive behavior. If those tools suggests that competition will be harmed and consumers made worse off from the behavior of any firm, antitrust enforcers should act. </p><p>And my experience suggests that a successful case rests on three pillars, a secure foundation in the law, a solid factual basis, and strong economic evidence of the anti-competitive outcome. And I also recommend that any assessment examine first antitrust laws as interpreted by the courts; second, the application of that law to particular types of anticompetitive behavior in defined markets; and third, the boundaries between antitrust law and regulation. And I will briefly address each of these factors. </p><p>A defining quality of an antitrust violation is the elimination or weakening of a market constraint on a firm's power to set the terms of its interactions. In other words, we examine the impact on the competitive process through which a firm makes its decisions on price, quality, and the need to innovate. Thus, antitrust enforcers should intervene only when firms are likely to corrupt the anti---corrupt the competitive process and gain or maintain market power through means other than competition on the merits, such as by colluding with arrivals, merging with competitors to reduce competition or, for a firm with market power, engaging in exclusionary conduct that does not benefit competition on balance. </p><p>Thus, under current antitrust law, a dominant provider must maintain its position through legitimate competition on the merits rather than through conduct that have little or no purpose beyond disadvantaging rivals. Now, this doesn't mean that antitrust can't reach many of the competitive concerns discussed today as long as there is factual and economic evidence of cognizable competitive harm, and I'd like to offer some recent examples. </p><p>During my time as the acting chairman when the FTC had only two members, one Republican and one Democrat, we successfully handled a total of 32 proposed mergers with significant competition concerns and brought forward nine different conduct cases. And our challenge to the merger between CDK and Auto/Mate involved a large established firm with a substantial market share buying a relatively small upstart that appeared poised to challenge the market leaders more aggressively. </p><p>Now, some have questioned whether the existing antitrust paradigm can ever reach this kind of behavior where a big player squashes or absorbs a promising upstart before it can grow into a more substantial competitor. And the CDK-Auto/Mate action shows that antitrust law can address the competitive issue if the facts and economic evidence supported. </p><p>I'd also like to say a few words about vertical mergers, the majority of which are pro competitive. Vertical mergers can, however, raise antitrust concerns when the parties gain an ability and incentive to foreclose their rivals from a significant portion of the market. Thus, as with horizontal mergers, vertical deals should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on all the evidence available and not prejudged a based on the size of the parties or concerns outside of preserving market competition. </p><p>Now, the agencies can review consummated mergers and order divestitures when justified by the facts and the law. But trying to unscramble the eggs through a divestiture long after a merger or using a breakup as a remedy in a conduct matter is a drastic step that carries serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers. And aside from practical concerns, courts would require a particularly significant causal connection between the challenged conduct and creation or maintenance of the market power. </p><p>Now, for those that seek to supplant antitrust with a regulatory approach, given the troubled history of extensive market regulation by government, we should carefully examine the assumption that regulators can divine of the best course for technology driven markets. Further, the U.S. has consistently been a strong voice globally in advocating for competition law to focus on consumer welfare--welfare goals, not--and not to include other policy goals. And I fear that abandoning this clear position will encourage regimes around the world to pursue industrial policy goals such as favoring domestic industry to the--to the detriment of U.S. consumers and business interests. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you very much. I now recognize Mr. Szabo for five minutes. </p><p>SZABO: Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you again for the opportunity to be here. It's been a long day, so I'm just going to give three points and then kind of explain them a little further. </p><p>First, markets have an outstanding record at eroding first mover advantages that help small business become large. Two, bigger is better for consumers looking for choices or for small businesses looking for customers. And three, competition is robust. Americans know it, and Americans know that weaponization of antitrust isn't for their benefits. </p><p>We've seen throughout the 21st century that markets naturally erode the first mover advantages that helped them get put--helped them get big. Search was once dominated by Yahoo who was later overtaken by Google. MySpace was the dominant social network later overtaken by Facebook. And as the chairman pointed out, Facebook's now facing robust competition from TikTok, a new entrant. And that's just in the past couple of years. </p><p>And with the advent of the Internet, we removed the high start up costs that are often seen in traditional markets. The next big innovation is readily buildable and distributable, further advancing the natural erosion of the first mover advantage. </p><p>For Americans and America's small businesses, bigger is better. What we see here are two-sided markets. We have consumers on one side and small businesses on the other. These platforms are operating as the bridge between the two. The connection is provided a much-needed lifeline to America's Main Street businesses. </p><p>And the bigger the platform, the better it is for these small businesses, because it gives greater access to more potential customers. It drives down prices for advertising. And with micro-targeted ads, American businesses can be sure that every dollar they spend on advertising actually leads to sales, something you didn't have in traditional media. </p><p>And don't take my word for it. Polling shows that online platforms have helped nearly 60 percent of Americans discover new small businesses. And good news for those worried about the death of entrepreneurship. The esteemed Kauffman Index, a nonpartisan group, shows that entrepreneurship is at its highest levels in over a decade. </p><p>Third, competition is robust. Americans know what and then they know weaponization of antitrust is not for their benefit. There has never been more choice and more opportunity. For anyone whose home was damaged in the recent storms, they can easily find repairs on Yelp, Thumbtack, Task Rabbit, Google, or Angie's List. When looking for social media, there's Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube. </p><p>For anyone looking to replace lost commodities, they can turn to eBay, Overstock, Walmart, Wayfair, Amazon, Breckton (PH), and many, many more. Americans can quickly and easily do comparison-shopping on price and services on multiple platforms and on multiple search engines. The Internet continues to create more choices, lower prices, and better services. These are all things you don't see in a consolidated market. </p><p>But advocates on this panel are calling for weaponization of antitrust to address perceived injustices, and that's just not the reality. Some of today's panelists 50 percent of the market should now be considered a monopoly. Others, unable to prove that a dominant firm exists, say, well, let's just take the top two, add them together, call it a duopoly. This is a legitimate antitrust analysis. </p><p>And at the end of the day, advocates calling for weaponization of antitrust stand alone from the wet--from the rest of the country. Polling shows that only one in 20 Americans think text should be the focus of government oversight. And less than one in five think consumers are the beneficiaries of a breakup of big tech. That's because markets have an outstanding record at eroding the first mover advantage. Bigger is better, especially for America's small businesses. Competition is robust and your constituents know it. </p><p>Thank you, and I welcome your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. And before I recognize Mr. Reed, I do want to correct the record. I--I did not at all suggest that TikTok provided robust competition for Facebook. In fact, I was making the point that despite their efforts, Facebook continues to capture 80 percent of global social media revenue. So, with all due respect, I don't want you to mischaracterize my opening statement. </p><p>And with that, I'll recognize Mr. Reed for five minutes. They've called votes, but we're going to, I think, be able to get through the--the questioning. </p><p>REED: I'll make it as fast as possible. Good afternoon, Chairman Cicilline and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for holding this hearing, and finally, at the end of the whole list, get down to actually giving small businesses a voice at the debate. Thank you. </p><p>I get to start with good news. We've heard a lot of bad news today, but I'm going to start with some good news. The app economy in America is thriving, growing up from virtually nonexistent in 2007 to $1.3 trillion today. </p><p>It has created 5.7 million jobs globally. We heard earlier about 1.5 million here in the U.S. and is revolutionizing traditional industry verticals making everything from agriculture to healthcare better and smarter. My written testimony contains a slew of facts and figures that help define the breadth and scope of the app ecosystem and how platforms have benefited my community but I wanted to share how the app economy is thriving in your district and what the world looks like for software companies before the platform revolution. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, in Providence, Mojotech is a company with a 65 employees creating software solutions for healthcare, finance and e-commerce companies. Your district has one of the leaders in cloud deployment for mobile and project management for android and iOS solutions. </p><p>Representative Armstrong in Fargo theirs is a company called Bushel it is an agricultural tech company that provides subscription-based-- </p><p>ARMSTRONG: You are stealing my thunder--you are stealing my thunder. </p><p>REED: Oh, no. I'm sorry. Well, let's get through it. So Bushel has basically has developed hardware for the grain supply chain. There are more than 1000 grain facilities utilizing their platform. It is a great example of the way that mobile apps can have that niche and really take advantage of it. </p><p>Representative Johnson and I have talked to you a few different times about kill companies into your district so this time I thought I would come and talk a little bit about Atlanta-based Turbojet. It's a--it's a smaller shop that's doing solutions for nonprofits including their website buildout, mobile-enabled capabilities more in the nonprofit space. So in all of these cases representatives, I have thousands of stories just like these from all 435 congressional districts. Each one benefiting from the explosion of platforms like the app store, Google Play, Amazon Web services, Microsoft Azure. And do you know who else benefited? Consumers. Here on the table, I have a copy of OmniPage Pro. This was a software you bought if you needed to scan documents. If you wanted to turn it into a processor--into a way you could look at it in a word processor. </p><p>I've also got this great review from PC World. They loved it back in 2005 but the important fact here in this review is it says the street price of this software in 2005 was $450. Now right here I've got an app from a company called (INAUDIBLE) that is nearly the same product level, has a bunch of features that this one doesn't, it's six dollars. </p><p>Basically now consumers pay less than 1 percent of what they use to pay for some of the same capability and what's even better about that even though I love the product from (INAUDIBLE) there are dozens of competitors in the app space. So when you look at it from that perspective consumers are getting a huge win. </p><p>How have platforms made this radical drop in price possible? Simply put they have provided three things a trusted space, reduced overhead and given my developers nearly instant access to a global marketplace with billions of customers. Before the platforms to get your software onto a resell--retail store shelf companies had to spend years and thousands of dollars to get to the point where a distributor would handle their product. Then you would agree--agree to a cut of the sales revenue, write a check for upfront marketing, agreed to refund the distributor the cost of any unsold boxes and then spend tens of thousands of dollars to buy an endcap. </p><p>Digging in a little bit on this I don't know how many of you know or are aware that the products you see on your store shelf or in the Sunday flyer aren't there because the manager thought it was a cool product. Those products are displayed at the end of an aisle or endcap because the software developer or consumer goods company literally pays for the shelf space. In fact for many retailers the sale of floor--the sale of floor space and flyers makes a huge chunk of their profitability for their store and none of this takes into consideration printing boxes, manuals, CDs, dealing with credit cards if you go direct, translation services, customs authorities if you want to sell abroad. </p><p>In the 1990s it cost $1 million to start up a software company. Now it's $100,000 in sweat equity and thanks to these changes the average cost for consumer software has dropped from $50 to three dollars. For developers, our cost to market has dropped enormously and the size of our market has expanded globally. Of course, it's not all roses and sunshine. Platforms need to improve in important ways and we appreciate this committee for monitoring the platform ecosystem to better understand what is happening. One area where we see some fall where some of the platforms have fallen short is transparency. Platforms should communicate to developers the guidelines and any changes they make to them clearly and explain what they mean to my developers. </p><p>Another is safety and security. Some platforms have control over device security and others don't but all of them should strive for security practices that protect everyone who uses the platform. </p><p>Lastly, platforms have a role to play in removing pirated apps. Platforms should diligently respond to even the smallest developer when it comes to protecting IP. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Reed, and I'm going to reduce the time to three minutes so we can be sure to get our questions in. I thank everyone and apologize for the shortness but they've just called votes again. </p><p>I want to start off, Ms. Mitchell, with you if--if I may. You have written about a number of ways in which Amazon leverages its core shopping platform to gain a competitive advantage over entrepreneurs, small businesses and other third-party sellers that attempt to sell their products on Amazon. Can you explain--elaborate a little on that particularly in light of the testimony that was presented in the first panel how Amazon leverages its core platform to disadvantage small businesses and third-party sellers and how such tactics harm entrepreneurship and innovation online, how it impacts everyday people who live in our districts? </p><p>MITCHELL: That's right. Yeah, we--I spend a lot of time interviewing and talking with independent retailers, manufacturers of all sizes. Many of them are very much afraid of speaking out publicly because they fear retaliation. But what we consistently here is that Amazon is the biggest threat to their businesses. We just did a survey of about 550 independent retailers nationally. Amazon ranked number one in terms of being what they said was the biggest threat to their business above rising healthcare cost and access to capital, government red tape, anything else you can name. Among those who were actually selling on the platform only 7 percent reported that it was actually helping their bottom line. </p><p>Amazon has a kind of like godlike view of a growing share of our commerce and it uses the data that it gathers to advantage its own business and its own business interest in lots of ways. A lot of this as I said comes from the kind of leverage, its ability to sort of leverage the interplay between these different business lines to maximize its advantage whether it is promoting its own product because that is lucrative or whether it is using the manufacture of a product to actually squeeze a seller or a vendor into giving it bigger discounts. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you so much, Professor Wu (INAUDIBLE) extensively about the importance of enforcing the antitrust laws in the digital markets in order to spur innovation that is the subject of this hearing. Would you speak a little bit about why competition is so important to innovation, both how does it affect people's lives, also how do you respond to the companies who say we are innovative ourselves? Likely are innovative enough, we don't need competition because we will continue to innovate? And specifically, will you also address Mr. Szabo's use of the word weaponizing antitrust. I'm not sure what he meant by that but I think the antitrust subcommittee takes our responsibility to enforce antitrust laws or to create the architecture for their enforcement very seriously because we understand the value of competition. I'm not exactly sure what--why anyone would say just that is weaponizing it, but maybe you could respond to the critical nature of competition as it relates to innovation and why what w</p><p>e are doing is not actually weapon the rising but trying to promote competition. </p><p>WU:  Thank you for the opportunity. Yes, to the word weaponization I preferred the word enforcement. You know when we talk about enforcing the criminal laws we don't talk about weaponizing, we talk about enforcing the laws and I think that you know the Justice Department, FTC, the states have a duty to enforce the laws. Congress passes them and so that's the way to think about this. I think historically speaking the United States has experimented with two different types of innovation environment. One is centralized where we allow industries to monopolize or oligopoly lies and we sit back and figure out what IBM is going to invent next-door AT&amp;T. And the other and contrasting model is one where we have taken action such as the AT&amp;T breakup for the IBM suit or Microsoft or taken regulatory action and done a lot to reduce the barriers to entry and what we have seen our--are a very different pattern of innovation, much more disrupt - Mac much more kind of what--want economist sometimes called disruptive inn</p><p>ovation or--or competition for the market as opposed to incremental you know adding call waiting to AT&amp;T and I think the comparative economic advantage of the United States over the last century has been its ability to start entire new industries and in these big sort of centralized innovation industries you don't see that. Instead, you see what is called the Kronos effect an effort to stop the advancement of new industries. So I think if the United States wants to be in the next century the tech later, preeminent power it needs to understand our own legacy and the advantages of competition--competitive innovation. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota for three minutes. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: First, I would like unanimous consent to enter ranking member statement into the record. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection and I will also introduce the opening statement of the chairman of the committee, Mr. Nadler and a group of letters from a group of organizations that are contained on this list without objection. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I do appreciate particularly Mr. Reed talking in that I think when recognized I come from a very rural area, the closest what you would consider big box store is Minneapolis or Denver and so when we are talking about competition in all of this I also think we have got to remember at no point in time from my house in Dickinson(SP) North Dakota have I had more access to more diverse and cheap consumer products I mean things that often would require a plane ticket or a nine-hour car ride to my can now be brought to our house. So I think when we are talking about consumers we need to remember that side of it too. And I'm glad you brought up bushel because bushel is a fantastic company that has created I don't know if they are going to qualify (INAUDIBLE) Unicorn or not I don't know what the real definition is but they have created a space that hasn't existed at this point as well as they do. </p><p>Now, I don't know about this particular company, but I do know that there is a--whether it's in technology or in traditional business there are start ups that get to a point where they have a certain product and a certain idea but they've gone as far as they can do--go. They can be acquired--it can be in the oil and gas industry, it can be in any industry it can be in the tech industry. So I would hope that when we deal with this we don't--if at some point in time Bushel decides they do want to sell I hope they have the ability to do that. </p><p>But I--I guess I would just go to this and all of the witness talked about different companies and different what they viewed as problems or potential problems at those companies. But they're not the same for every company. And I think that's where we go is it's well established that the role of antitrust enforcement is to ensure that companies with significant market--market power don't use that power to unfairly harm competitors or consumers. And traditionally in anti-trust is very company specific and is very fact specific. So there are limits to what anti-trust can do and enforcement process often takes years. So, outside of anti-trust I mean we--we don't have to only exist in that universe--are there measures we can take beyond--beyond those laws that promote competition in technology markets? And I--I've got 50 seconds so, which means you all have 50 seconds so we get to go down the line. So, please be quick. </p><p>MORTON: Yes, there are. My report outlines a number of things that a regulator could do. But a regulations that break down entry barriers and try to make a more level playing field for small businesses and entrepreneurs to actually get share and compete. That's the kind of regulation that I think would be really helpful. </p><p>REED: I would say support for open standards in ensuring that we don't have abusive use of--of patent rights in a way that actually harms open standards that are done in a voluntary manner. </p><p>SZABO: And I would warn against turning to a know it when I see it definition for anti-trust or monopoly. Instead, actually doing a fact analysis and an independent analysis as you've suggest--as you've suggested. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN: I--I agree with trying to break down regulatory barriers for small business and entrepreneurs but I would caution against creating a single regulator when you look at the history of the Civil Aeronautics Board and the FCC pre the AT&amp;T breakup. I think there are important lessons there. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired. I will recognize the gentleman from Georgia for three minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you. We've run out of time. I do want to thank the panelists for being with us today. I know it's a late evening for you all. You had not planned on being here. And I want to thank the chairman for hosting this very important topic today. </p><p>If we do not oversee what's going on in this digital economy--in this digital marketplace with the four dominant players that we hosted today on the first panel. If we don't understand their market reach, if we don't understand their business practices and how those practices affect consumers then we will never be able to regulate and legislate as may be necessary. So, I do appreciate us having this hearing today, which is one in a series and with that, I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman for yielding back and I do want to thank the witnesses. We will continue to rely on you as resources as we continue this investigation. I appreciate your patience and your testimony today. This will conclude our hearing. I want to again thank our witnesses. And without objection all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record. Without objection, this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKD-8MH1-JDPT-T0P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

JIM JORDAN (R-OHIO), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: The subcommittee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at anytime. We welcome everyone to today's hearing on Online Platforms and Market Power Part Six, Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. </p><p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind members that we have established an email address and distribution list dedicating to circulating exhibits, motions, or other written materials that members might want to offer as part of our hearing today. If you'd like to submit materials, please send them to the email address that has been previously distributed to your offices, and we will circulate the materials to members and staff as quickly as we can. </p><p>I would also remind all members that guidance from the Office of the Attending Physician states that face coverings are required for all meetings in an enclosed space such as committee hearings. I expect all members on both sides of the aisle to wear a mask except when you are speaking. </p><p>I now recognize myself for an opening statement. More than a year ago, the subcommittee launched an investigation into digital markets. Our two objectives have been to document competition problems in the digital economy and to evaluate whether the current antitrust framework is able to properly address them. </p><p>In September 2019, the chairman and ranking members of the full committee and this is subcommittee issued sweeping bipartisan requests for information to the four firms that will testify at today's hearing. Since then, we have received millions of pages of evidence from these firms as well as documents and submissions for more than 100 market participants. We also conducted hundreds of hours of interviews.  </p><p>As part of this investigation, we have held five hearings to examine the effects of online market power on innovation and entrepreneurship, data privacy, a free and diverse press, and independent businesses in the online marketplace. We've held 17 briefings and roundtables with over 35 experts and stakeholders in support of our work. </p><p>This investigation has been bipartisan from the start. It's been an honor to work alongside my colleague, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, this subcommittee's ranking member, as well as the former ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Doug Collins. We worked closely with all members of the subcommittee on both sides of the aisle. We have taken this work seriously and studied these issues carefully. As my colleague, Congressman Ken Buck, recently commented, and I quote, \"This is the most bipartisan effort that I've been involved with in 5.5 years of Congress.\"  </p><p>The purpose of today's hearing is to examine the dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in America, capturing 70 percent of all online marketplace sales. It operates across a vast array of businesses from cloud computing and movie production to transportation logistics and small business lending. Amazon's market valuation recently hit $1.5 trillion, more than that of Walmart, Target, Salesforce, IBM, eBay, and Etsy combined. </p><p>Apple is a dominant provider of smart phones, with more than 100 million iPhone users in the United States alone. In addition to hardware, Apple sells services and apps including financial services, media, and games. </p><p>Facebook is the world's largest provider of social networking services, with a business model that sells the digital ads. Despite a litany of privacy scandals and record-breaking fines, Facebook continues to enjoy booming profits, $18 billion last year alone. </p><p>Lastly, Google is the world's largest online search engine, capturing more than 90 percent of searches online. It controls key technologies and digital ad markets and enjoys more than 1 billion users across six products, including browsers, smart phones, and digital maps. </p><p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy. In the wake of COVID 19, however, they're likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before. As American families shift more of their work, shopping, and communication online, these giants stand to profit. Locally owned businesses, meanwhile, mom-and-pop stores on Main Street, face an economic crisis unlike any in recent history. </p><p>As hard as it is to believe, it's possible that our economy will emerge from this crisis even more concentrated and consolidated them before. These companies service critical arteries of commerce and communications. Because these companies are so central to our modern life, their business practices and decisions have an outsized effect on our economy and our democracy. </p><p>Any single action by one of these companies can affect hundreds of millions of us in profound and lasting ways. Although these four corporations differ in important and meaningful ways, we've observed common patterns and competition problems over the course of this investigation. </p><p>First, each platform is a bottleneck for a key channel of distribution. Whether they can control access to information or to the marketplace, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power. They can charge exorbitant fees, impose oppressive contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them. </p><p>Second, each platform uses its control over digital infrastructure to survey all other companies, their growth, business activity, and whether they might--whether they might pose a competitive threat. Each platform has used this data to protect its power by either buying, copying, or cutting off access for any actual or potential rival. </p><p>Third, these platforms abuse their control over current technologies to extend their power. Whether it's through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, requiring users to buy additional products, the dominant platforms have wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand. </p><p>At today's hearing we'll examine how each of these companies has used this playbook to achieve and maintain dominance and how their power shapes that affects our daily lives. So, why does this matter? Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects. They discourage entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, hike costs, and degrade quality. Simply put, they have too much power. </p><p>This power staves off new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation. And while these dominant firms may still produce some new innovative products, their dominance is killing small businesses, manufacturing, and overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy.  </p><p>Several of these firms also harvested abuse people's data to sell ads for everything from new books to dangerous so-called miracle cures. When everyday Americans learn how much of their data is being mined, they can't run away fast enough. But in many cases, there is no escape from this surveillance because there's no alternative. People are stuck with bad options. </p><p>Open markets are predicated on the idea that if a company harms people, consumers, workers, and business partners will choose another option. We're here today because that choice is no longer possible. </p><p>In closing, I'm confident that addressing the problems we see in these markets will lead to a stronger, more vibrant economy. Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. </p><p>American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolists in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&amp;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy. We face similar challenges today. </p><p>As gatekeepers of the digital economy, these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers, to shakedown small businesses, and enrich themselves while choking off competitors. Their ability to dictate terms, call the shots, up in the entire sectors, and inspire fear represent the powers of a private government. Our founders would not bow before a king, nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy. </p><p>And with that, I now recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Sensenbrenner, for his opening statement. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the CEOs for quickly working with the subcommittee to appear today. The memorial service for John Lewis on Monday required our attention. However, this hearing is vital to our oversight work, and I appreciate your flexibility. </p><p>Throughout my long time in Congress, I have prioritized oversight as one of our seminal responsibilities. Part of that responsibility is to periodically review the effectiveness of our laws. And I think it's a good and timely thing that we are now turning our attention to technological innovations, which brings us to all of your companies. </p><p>Our country, stricken by a pandemic, becomes a dramatic illustration of the extraordinarily reliance Americans have on technological innovations. In these unexpected and unprecedented times, your companies have provided innovations so our nations can meet a myriad of our daily needs; the delivery of groceries, virtual visits with doctors, connecting socially distant families, or keeping our small and large businesses connected. </p><p>With that responsibility comes in increased scrutiny of your dominance in the marketplace. I want to reiterate something I've said throughout this investigation. Being big is not inherently bad; quite the opposite. </p><p>In America, you should be rewarded for success. We are here to better understand the role your companies have in the digital marketplace and, importantly, the effect they have on consumers and the public at large. You lead some of today's most powerful companies, and my colleagues and I have a great interest about what your companies do with that accumulated power. </p><p>We also know that the tech marketplace is driven by data, so it follows that-- </p><p>[*]SENSENBRENNER: --those who control the data, in essence, control the marketplace.  </p><p>There are broader questions surrounding data, however. Who owns the data? What responsibilities do companies have to share it with their customers or their competitors? What is the fair market value of that data? Is there anything monopolistic in acquiring this data? And what about monetizing it? </p><p>These are complex issues that Congress, regulators and even your own companies are wrestling with in the current technological landscape and the answers to which we owe the American consumers.  </p><p>Since the tech--investigation began, we have heard rumblings from many who are quick to say your successful companies have grown too large. Since his hearing was announced, it seems that those complaints have gotten even louder. While I find these complaints informative, I don't plan on it--litigating each of these complaints today.  </p><p>Antitrust law and the consumer welfare standard have served this country well for over a century. Those laws have provided the framework and creativity to make way for some of our most successful and innovative companies. I will be the first to highlight that. However, as the business landscape involves, we must ensure that our existing antitrust laws are applied to meet the needs of our country and its consumers.  </p><p>I share the concern that market dominance in the digital space is ripe for abuse, particularly when it comes to free speech. As we know, companies like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter have become the public square of today, where political debate unfolds in real-time. But reports that dissenting views, often conservative views, are targeted or censored is seriously troubling. Conservatives are consumers, too, and they need the protection of the antitrust laws. The power to influence debate carries with it remarkable responsibilities.  </p><p>So let the facts be our guide here. Your companies are large. That's not a problem. Your companies are successful. That's not a problem either. But I want to leave here today with a more complete picture of how your individual companies use your size, success and power and what it means to the American consumer.  </p><p>And I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman.  </p><p>Now--the chair now recognizes the distinguished chairman of the Full Committee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, for his opening statement. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and the subcommittee members, for the tremendous effort that--that you have all put into the subcommittee investigation. I appreciate your calling this hearing today so that we can hear directly from the leaders of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. And I look forward to an important dialogue.  </p><p>Today, it is effectively impossible to use the Internet without using in one way or another, the services of these four companies. I have long believed with Thomas Jefferson and Louis Brandeis that concentration of power in any form, especially concentration of economic or political power, is dangerous to a democratic society. That is why we must examine these and other companies that play a dominant role in our economy and--and in our society and ensure that our antitrust laws give enforcers the tools they need to preserve a healthy marketplace.  </p><p>These principles have guided this committee's yearlong investigation into competition in digital market--markets, and they are the lens through which I approach today's hearing. The open Internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment and new pathways for education online. But there is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outside share of online commerce communications.  </p><p>From providing the dominant search platform, retail platform and--and online messaging platform to providing the underlying mapping services and cloud computing on which hundreds of thousands of other businesses rely, these dominant platforms now comprise the essential infrastructure for the 21st century. </p><p>By virtue of controlling essential infrastructure, these companies have the ability to control access to markets. In some basic ways, the problem is not unlike what we faced 130 years ago, when railroads transformed American life, both enabling farmers and producers to access new markets, but also creating a key choke hold that the railroad monopolies could exploit. </p><p>Railroads notoriously abused this gatekeeper power in a variety of ways, they charge tolls, extorting that producers reliant on their rails. They--they discriminated among farmers, picking winners and losers across the economy. And by expanding into lines of business that competed directly with producers, they could use their dominance in transportation to favor their own services. </p><p>These tactics by the railroads spurred fury and despair across the country. Congress initiated investigations to document these problems and enacted legislative solutions to halt and outlaw these anti-competitive practices in the railroad industry and other industries dominated by unregulated monopolies and trusts. </p><p>Importantly, congressional oversight and legislative reforms during that--this period did not prevent the incumbent the inexorable arrival of new technology or human progress. Instead, Congress recognized that these powerful new technologies had reshaped the balance of power in our economy and that it was the role of Congress to ensure that the new monopolists could not abuse their power.  </p><p>Today, the digital economy poses similar challenges. While the underlying technology is dramatically different, of course, new digital intermediaries have the ability to control access to critical markets. If you are an independent merchant, developer or content producer, you are increasingly relying on these powerful intermediaries to access markets and consumers.  </p><p>Across the economy, many businesses live in fear of exclusion from these platforms. In fact, fact that some companies have shared with the committee over the past year during this investigation. The subcommittee's current review of competition in the digital marketplace continues a long tradition in this committee of oversight of the antitrust laws and our economy. </p><p>From the days of Chairman Emanuel Celler, the House Judiciary Committee and its Antitrust Subcommittee have conducted careful, fact-based inquiries into industrial sectors showing signs of consolidation and anti-competitive conduct. This has continued on a bipartisan basis over the years from Chairman Brooks and Hyde, the Chairman Sensenbrenner and Conyers and others.  </p><p>As a 1950 report from the (INAUDIBLE) Subcommittee on Monopoly Power described our mandate, quote, \"It is the province of this subcommittee to investigate factors which tend to eliminate competition, strengthen monopolies, injure small businesses, or promote undue concentration of economic power to ascertain the facts and to make recommendations based on those findings.\" </p><p>Following in this proud tradition, our investigation has held hearings with industry and government witnesses, consultations with subject matter experts and a careful and at times painstaking review of large volumes of evidence provided by industry participants and regulators. </p><p>While ultimately, it is the responsibility of the antitrust enforcement agencies to enforce the law, Congress has an obligation to assess whether existing antitrust laws and competition policies and the will to enforce those laws and policies are adequate to address the competition issues facing our country and to take action if they are found to be lacking.  </p><p>Given the dominant role that these four companies play in our economy and our society, it is only reasonable that our careful examination of the antitrust laws begin with them. I appreciate the--the participation of all of our witnesses today, an investigation would not be complete. Indeed, it has hardly begun without hearing directly from the decision makers at these companies. And I look forward to their testimony and to today's discussion.  </p><p>I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman.  </p><p>And I now recognize the ranking member of the Full Committee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, for his opening statement. </p><p>JORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I also want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Sensenbrenner. I'm not sure how many more committee hearings this subcommittee or the full committee are going to have this Congress. But I want to thank Jim for his--his great work for the constituents of his district in Wisconsin for this many years and for the work he's done for this entire committee.  </p><p>I'll just cut to the chase. Big Tech's out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact. </p><p>July 20 of 2020, Google removes the home pages of Breitbart in The Daily Caller. Just last night, we learned Google has censored Breitbart so much traffic has declined 99 percent.  </p><p>June 16th, 2020, Google threatens the demonetization and ban the Federalist.  </p><p>April 19th, 2020, Google and YouTube announce a policy censoring the content that conflicts with recommendations to the World Health Organization.  </p><p>Now, think about that. The World Health Organization, the organization that lied to us, the organization that shield for China. And if you contradict something they say, they can say whatever they want. They can live for China. They can shield for China. You say something against them, you get censored.  </p><p>June 29, 2020, Amazon bans President Trump's account on Twitch after he raises concerns about defunding to police.  </p><p>June 4, 2020, Amazon bans a book critical of the coronavirus lockdown's written-- </p><p>[*]JORDAN: --by a conservative commentator May 27, 2020, Amazon smile won't let you give to the Family Research Council and The Alliance Defense Fund, but you can give to planned parenthood. </p><p>Facebook June 19, 2020, takes down post from President Trump's reelection campaign. November 1, 2018, Facebook silences a pro-life organizations advertisement. May 19, 2016, Facebook--former Facebook employees admit Facebook routinely suppresses conservative views and I haven't even mentioned twitter who we actually invited Mr. Chairman. We asked for you guys to invite them as one of our witnesses, you guys said no. </p><p>I haven't even mentioned them. Two years ago, they shadow band to members of this committee. For members of Congress were shadow band two years ago, 435 in the house, 100 and the Senate, 535 only for, only four Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan. Only four get shadow band, and of course, what did Mr. Dorsey tell us? </p><p>He said oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm. Just a--I asked him what did you put in the algorithm the names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan? I mean, if I had a nickel for every time I heard it was just a glitch, I wouldn't be as wealthy as our witnesses, but I would be doing all right. We have heard that excuse time and time again. </p><p>May 28, twitter sensors President Trump's tweet on the riots in Minneapolis. May 29, 2020 twitter sensors White House--the White House for quoting the President's comments about the riots in Minneapolis. </p><p>June 23, 2020, twitter sensors the president again for saying he will enforce the rule of law against any autonomous zone in Washington DC. You can tweet all you want about the autonomous zone that happened in Seattle, but the President tweets that he's not going to have one in Washington DC. No, you can't do that, you get banned, you get censored. </p><p>Dozens of examples. I forgot one, I forgot one. Just last week July 21, July 21 here is what twitter did, the leader of Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran this--this--this is from the largest state sponsor of terrorism twitter allows this tweet quote the Islamic Republic of Iran will never forget the martyrdom of Soleimani and will definitely strike a reciprocal blow in the United States. </p><p>So you can threaten the citizens of this great country the leader of the largest state sponsor of terrorism that is just fine, but the President says he's not going to allow some autonomous zone in DC, and he gets--he gets censored. All kinds of examples, most of them from this year and that's what--that's what I think critical for us all to understand, most of them from this year, and the election year and that is what concerns me and so many Americans because we saw what Google did in 2016. </p><p>We all know about the email the day after the election where top executives at Google email chain where they talked about the silent donation Google made to the Clinton campaign. Now thank goodness it wasn't enough and then spied of their efforts to help Clinton President Trump one, but we are 97 days before an election, and the power as the previous Chairman and Ranking Member have said the power of these companies have to impact what happens during an election what people, but American citizens get to see prior to their voting is pretty darn important. </p><p>That is why this committee hearing is important. Look, we all think the free market is great, we think competition is great, we'd love the fact that these are American companies but what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections and if it doesn't end there has to be consequences. </p><p>There have to be consequences. That is what I am concerned about I think what so many Americans are concerned about so I look forward to hearing from our witnesses Mr. Chairman and before I yield back Mr. Chairman we have a colleague I would ask unanimous consent that Mr. Johnson, the ranking member of the Constitution Subcommittee be allowed to participate in today's hearing which is our customary practice for subcommittee hearings. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman makes a unanimous consent request. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman, I would object. </p><p>CICILLINE: Objection is heard. I now have the privilege of introducing today's witnesses-might-- </p><p>JORDAN: Mr. Chairman why are--why are we not allowing--it is customary-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Jordan, there was a unanimous consent request, objection was heard. I now will introduce our witnesses. </p><p>JORDAN: This has never happened-- </p><p>CICILLINE: It is now my pleasure to introduce today's witnesses. Our first witness is Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer-- </p><p>JORDAN: This is-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Jordan, I have the time. </p><p>JORDAN: But this is the ranking member-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Our first witness-- </p><p>JORDAN: We are talking about people's liberties we have a Ranking Member-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Jordan, you made a unanimous consent request, objection was heard. Those are our rules. </p><p>JORDAN: Objection was (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>CICILLINE: It is now my pleasure to introduce today's witnesses-- </p><p>JORDAN: By the (INAUDIBLE) constitutional law professor-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Our first witness is Jeff Bezos, the chief-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: Put your mask on. </p><p>CICILLINE: --executive officer of Amazon.com. </p><p>Mr. Bezos founded Amazon in 19--excuse me. I am going to remind members of this committee unless you are speaking our rules require you to wear a mask according to the attending physician--know, I am speaking about another member of this committee. I will begin again. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's witnesses. </p><p>Our first witness is Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer of Amazon.com. Mr. Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 as an online bookstore. Since then, Amazon has grown to be the largest online retailer on the Internet. Mr. Bezos has also oversees his company's expansion into areas including cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. Mr. Bezos received his Bachelors of Science from Princeton University. </p><p>Our second witness, Sundar Pichai, is the chief executive officer of both alphabet and its subsidiary Google. Mr. Pichai joined Google in 2004 and has helped manage a number of successful products, including Google Chrome, Gmail, and android operating system. Mr. Pichai also oversaw the company's popular search products. Prior to his time at Google, Mr. Pichai worked in management consulting at Mackenzie(SP). </p><p>Mr. Pichai received a degree in metallurgical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, a Masters degree from Stanford University, and an MBA from the Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania. </p><p>Our third witnesses Tim Cook, the chief executive officer of Apple. Mr. Cook joined Apple in 1998 and served as its chief operational officer under Steve Jobs. In 2011 Mr. Cook was named CEO. </p><p>While at Apple, he has overseen their expansion into new markets through the launch and developments of products and services like Apple pay, Apple Watch, iCloud, applecart, and home pod. Prior to joining Apple, Mr. Cook served as the director of North American fulfillment for IBM. Mr. Cook received a Bachelor of Science from Auburn University and an MBA from Duke University's (INAUDIBLE) school of business. </p><p>The last witness at today's hearing is Mark Zuckerberg founder, chairman, and CEO of Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg initially launched Facebook in order to help connect college students at his school more easily. Since then, the company has grown into the world's largest social media platform, with 1.7 billion global daily active users. Mr. Zuckerberg attended Harvard University before leaving to focus full-time on developing Facebook. </p><p>We welcome all of our distinguished witnesses and thank them for participating in today's hearing, and now I will begin by swearing you in and before I do that I want to also remind you that you are the only ones from your respective companies invited to testify today and that in accordance with normal House practice and Section G of the House remote committee proceeding regulations your sworn testimony must be your own. </p><p>Please let me know at any point in the hearing you wish to view yourself so you can confer with your counsel. So will you please unmute your microphones and raise your right hands? Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief, so help you, God? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes. </p><p>UNKNOWN: I do. </p><p>CICILLINE: Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you, and you may remain seated. Please note that your written statements will be entered into the record in their entirety. Accordingly, I ask that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light in WebEx. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals your five minutes have expired. Mr. Bezos, you may begin. </p><p>BEZOS: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the subcommittee. </p><p>I was born into great wealth, not monetary wealth, but as said the wealth of a loving family, a family that fostered my curiosity and encouraged me to dream big. My mom Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque. </p><p>Being pregnant in high school was not popular. The school tried to kick her out, but she was allowed to finish after my grandfather negotiated terms with the principal. She couldn't have a locker, no extracurriculars, and couldn't walk across the stage to get her diploma. She graduated and was determined to continue her education, so she enrolled in night school, bringing me her infant son to class with her throughout. </p><p>My dad's name is Miguel. He adopted me when I was four. He was 16 when he came to the U.S. from Cuba by himself shortly after Castro took over. My dad didn't speak English, and he did not have an easy path. What he did have was grit and determination. He received a scholarship to college in Albuquerque, which is where he met my mom. </p><p>Together with my grandparents, these hard-working resource full and loving people made me who I am. I walked away from a steady job on Wall Street into a Seattle garage to found Amazon fully understanding that it might not work. It feels like just yesterday I was driving the packages to the post office myself dreaming that one day-- </p><p>[*]BEZOS: --we might be able to afford a forklift. Customer obsession has driven our success and I take it as an article of faith that customers notice when you do the right thing. You are in trust slowly over time by doing hard things well, delivering on time, offering everyday low prices, making promises and keeping them and making principled decisions even when they are unpopular. </p><p>And our approach is working. Eighty percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall. Who do Americans trust more than Amazon to do the right thing? Only their doctors and the military.  </p><p>The retail market we participate and is extraordinarily large and competitive. Amazon accounts for less than one percent of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than four percent of U.S. retail. There's room in retail for multiple winners. We compete against large, established players like Target, Costco, Kroger, and of course, Wal-Mart. A company more than twice Amazon's size.  </p><p>Twenty years ago, we made the decision to invite other sellers to sell an art store, to share the same valuable real estate we spent billions to build, market, and maintain. We believe that combining the strengths of Amazon's store with the vast selection of products offered by third parties would be a better experience for customers and that that growing pie of revenue and profits would be big enough for all. We are betting that it was not zero-sum game.  </p><p>Fortunately, we were right. There are now 1.7 million small and medium-size businesses selling on Amazon. The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other company. Hundreds of thousands of jobs across 42 states. Amazon employees make a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum wage. And we offer the best benefits, benefits that include comprehensive health insurance, 401(k) retirement, and parental leave, which includes 20 weeks of paid maternity leave.  </p><p>More than any place on earth, entrepreneurial companies start, grow, and thrive here in the U.S. We nurture entrepreneurs and startups with stable rule of law, the finest university system in the world, the freedom of democracy, and a deeply accepted culture of risk-taking. </p><p>Of course, this great nation of ours is far from perfect. Even as we remember Congressman John Lewis and honor his legacy, were in the middle of a much needed race reckoning. We also face the challenges of climate change and income inequality and we are stumbling through the crisis of a global pandemic.  </p><p>Still, with all of our felts and problems, the rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the U.S. Immigrants like my dad see what a treasure this country is. They have perspective and often can see it even more clearly than those of us who were lucky enough to be born here.  </p><p>It is still day one for this country and even in the face of today's humbling challenges, I have never been more optimistic about our future. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today and I'm very happy to take your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Bezos. Ms. Pichai, you are now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>PICHAI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the subcommittee. Before I start, I know this hearing was delayed because of the ceremonies honoring the life of your colleague, Representative John Lewis. Because of his courage, this world is a better place. He will be deeply missed.  </p><p>At its heart, a discussion about competition is a discussion about opportunity. This has never been more important as the global pandemic poses dual challenges to our health and our economy. Expanding access to opportunity to technology is personal to me. I didn't have much access to a computer growing up in India, so you can imagine my amazement when I arrived in the U.S. for graduate school and saw an entire lab of computers to use whenever I wanted.  </p><p>Accessing the Internet for the first time set me on a path to bring technology to as many people as possible. It inspired me to build Google's first browser, Chrome. I'm proud that 11 years later, so many people experience the web through chrome for free. Google takes pride in the number of people who choose their products. We are even prouder of what they do with them.  </p><p>From that 114 million students and teachers using G Suite for education to stay connected during the pandemic, to the 5 million Americans gaining digital skills through Grow with Google to all the people who turn to Google for help from finding the fact fastest route home to learning how to cook a new dish on YouTube. Google's work would not be possible without the long tradition of American innovation and that we are proud to contribute to its future.  </p><p>We imply more than 75,000 people in the U.S. across a 26 states. The progressive policy Institute estimated that in 2018, we invested more than $20 billion in the U.S., citing us as the largest capital investor in America that year and one of the top five for the last three years. One way we contribute is by building helpful products. Research found that free services like Surge, Gmail, Maps, and Photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American. And many are small businesses using our digital tools to grow.  </p><p>Stone Dimensions, a family owned Stone company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin uses Google My Business to draw more customers. Gill's Appliances (SP), a family owned appliance store in Bristol, Rhode Island credits Google analytics with helping them reach customers online during the pandemic. Nearly one-third of small business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close all or part of their business during COVID.  </p><p>Another way we contribute is by being among the world's biggest investors in research and development. By the end of 2019, our R&amp;D spend had increased tenfold over 10 years from $2.8 billion to $26 billion and we've invested over $90 billion the last five years. Our engineers are helping America remain a global leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and quantum computing.  </p><p>Just as America's technology leadership is not inevitable, and Google's continued success is not guaranteed. New competitors emerge every day and today users have more access to information than ever before. Competition drives us to innovate but it also leads us to better products, lower choices, and more choices for everyone.  </p><p>For example, competition helps lower online advertising cost by 40 percent over the last decade with savings passed down to consumers. Open platforms like android also support the innovation of others using android, thousands of mobile operators build and sell their own devices without paying any licensing fees to us. This has enabled billions of consumers to offer cutting-edge smartphones, some for less than $50.  </p><p>Whether building tools for small businesses or platforms like android, Google succeeds when others succeed. Competition also sets higher standards for privacy and security. I've always believed that privacy is a universal right and Google is committed to keeping your information safe, treating it responsibly, putting you in control, and we have long supported the creation of comprehensive federal privacy laws.  </p><p>I've never forgotten how access to technology and innovation changed the course of my life. Google aims to build products that increase access to opportunity for everyone, no matter where you live, what you believe, or how much money you own. We are committed to doing this responsibly in partnership with lawmakers to ensure every American has access to the incredible opportunity technology creates. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Pichai. Mr. Cook is now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>COOK: Chairmen Cicilline and Nadler, Ranking Members Sensenbrenner and Jordan, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to offer testimony. Before I begin, I want to recognize the life and legacy of John Lewis. I join you in mourning not only a hero but someone I knew personally whose example inspires and guides me still. Every American it was John Lewis a debt, and I feel fortunate to heal from a state and a country that benefited so profoundly from his leadership. </p><p>My name is Tim Cook. I've been Apple's CEO since 2011 and a proud employee of this uniquely American company since 1998. At Apple, we make ourselves a promise and our customers promise. It's a promise that we'll only build things that make us proud. As Steve put it, we only make things that we recommend to our family and friends.  </p><p>You can try to define this difference in a lot of ways. You can call it that seamless integration of hardware and software. You can call it simplicity of design or a great ecosystem all of those things are true, but if you want to put it simply, products like iPhone just were. When customers consistently give iPhone a 99 percent satisfaction rating that is the message they are sending about the user experience. </p><p>But we also know that customers have a lot of choices and that our products face fierce competition. Companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Google have built successful businesses with different approaches. We are okay with that. Our goal is the best, not the most. </p><p>In fact, we don't have a dominant share in any market or in any product category where we do business. What does motivate us is that timeless drive to build new things that we are proud to show our users. We focus relentlessly on those innovations, on deepening core principles like privacy and security and on creating new features. </p><p>In 2008 we introduced a new feature of the iPhone called the app store launched with 500 apps, which seemed like a law that the time. The app store provided a safe and trusted way for users to get more out of their phone. We knew the distribution options for software developers at the time didn't work well. </p><p>Brick and mortar stores charge high fees and have limited reach. Physical media, like CDs, had to be shipped and were hard to update. From the beginning, the app store was a revolutionary alternative. App Store developers set prices for their apps and never pay for shelf space. We provide every developer with cutting-edge tools like compilers, programming languages, and more than 150,000 essential software building blocks called API. The app store guidelines ensure a high quality, reliable, and secure user experience. They are transparent and applied equally to every developer. </p><p>For the vast majority of apps, developers keep 100 percent of the money they make. The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device. In the app store's more than ten-year history, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee. In fact, we have reduced it for subscriptions and exempted additional categories of apps. </p><p>I'm here today because scrutiny is reasonable and appropriate. We approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no concession on the facts. What began as 500 apps is now more than 1.7 million, only six of which are Apple software. If Apple is a gatekeeper, what we have done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the store, not keep them off. The app store's economic contributions are significant. The ecosystem is responsible for 1.9 million jobs in all 50 states, and it facilitated $138 billion in commerce in the U.S. in 2019 alone. </p><p>I share the committee's belief that competition promotes innovation, that it makes space for the next great idea, and that it gives consumers more choices. Since Apple was founded, these things have defined us. The first Mac brought opportunity and possibility into the home. The iPod helped musicians and artists to share their creations and be paid fairly for it. This legacy does much more than make us proud. It inspires us to work tirelessly to make sure tomorrow will be even better than today. </p><p>Thank you very much. I look forward to responding to your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Cook. Mr. Zuckerberg is now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Thank you. Before we begin, I want to add my voice to those honoring Congressman John Lewis and his service to our country. America has lost a real hero who never stopped fighting for the rights of every person. </p><p>Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify. The tech industry is an American success story. The products we build have changed the world and improved people's lives. Our industry is one of the ways that America shares its values with the world and one of our greatest economic and cultural exports. </p><p>Facebook is part of this story. We started with an idea to give people the power to share and connect, and we have built services that billions of people find useful. I am proud that we have given people who've never had a voice before the opportunity to be heard and given small businesses access to tools that only the largest players use to have. </p><p>Since COVID emerged, I am proud that people have used our services to stay in touch with friends and family who they can't be with in person and to keep their small businesses running online when physical stores are closed. </p><p>I believe that Facebook and the U.S. tech industry are a force for innovation and empowering people, but I recognize that there are concerns about the size and power of tech companies. Our services are about connection, and our business model is advertising, and we face some intense competition in both. Many of our competitors have hundreds of millions or billions of users, some are upstarts, but others are gatekeepers with the power to decide if we can even release our apps in their app stores to compete with them. </p><p>In many areas, we are behind our competitors. The most popular messaging service in the U.S. is iMessage. The fastest-growing app is Tik-Tok. The most popular app for video is YouTube. The fastest-growing ads platform is Amazon. The largest ads platform is Google, and for every dollar spent on advertising in the U.S., less than $.10 is spent with us. </p><p>We are here to talk about online platforms, but I think the true nature of competition is much broader. When Google bought YouTube, they could compete against the dominant player in video, which was the cable industry. </p><p>When Amazon bought whole foods, they could compete against Kroger's and Walmart. When Facebook bought WhatsApp, we can compete against telcos, who use to charge $.10 a text message but not anymore. </p><p>Now people can watch video, get groceries delivered, and send private messages for free. That is competition. New companies are created all of the time all over the world, and history shows that if we don't keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today and that change can often happen faster than you expect. </p><p>Of the ten most valuable companies a decade ago, only three still make that list today, and if you look at where the top technology companies come from a decade ago, the vast majority were American. Today almost half are Chinese. </p><p>Aside from competition, there are other serious issues related to the Internet, including questions about elections, harmful content, and privacy, and while these are not antitrust issues and are not specifically the topic of today's hearing, I recognize that we are often at the center of these discussions. </p><p>We build platforms for sharing ideas, and important debates play out across our services. I believe that this ultimately leads to more progress, but it means we often find ourselves in the middle of deep disagreements about social issues and high-stakes elections. I personally don't believe that private companies should be making so many decisions about these issues by themselves, and that is why last year, I made the case that there needs to be new regulation for the Internet. </p><p>Facebook stands for a set of basic principles giving people voice and economic opportunity, keeping people safe, upholding democratic traditions like freedom of expression and voting, and enabling an open and competitive marketplace. These are fundamental values for most of us but not for everyone in the world, not for every company we compete with or the countries they represent, and as global competition increases, there is no guarantee that our values will win out. </p><p>I am proud of the services we build and how they improve people's lives. We compete hard, we compete fairly, we try to be the best, that is what I was taught matters in this country and when we succeed it is because we deliver great experiences that people love. Thank you, and I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, and I think the witnesses for your opening statements. Before I begin recognizing members for questioning under the five-minute role without objection, I'm going to enter into the hearing record the documents and exhibits majority members will be referencing in their questioning today. These materials have been distributed to the witnesses. I will now recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>Mr. Pichai, over 85 percent of all online searches go through Google. Every online company in the United States depends on Google to reach users. A business may sink or swim based on Google's decisions a loan. </p><p>Numerous online businesses told us that Google steals their content and privileges its own sites in ways that profit Google but crush everyone else. Most businesses ask to stay anonymous due to fears that Google would retaliate against them. </p><p>One entrepreneur Brian Warner(SP) told us his website was driving until Google stole his content. After Google's decision traffic to his website dropped by 80 percent. He had to downsize his business and lay off half his staff. He told us, and I quote if someone came to me with an idea for a website or a web service today, I would tell them to run, run as far away from the web as possible. Launch a lawn care business or dog grooming business, something Google can't take away as soon as he or she is thriving. </p><p>So my first question Mr. Pichai is why does Google steal content from honest businesses.  </p><p>PICHAI: Mr. Chairman, with respect, I disagree with that characterization. Just last week, I met with many small businesses. In fact, today, we support 1.4 million small businesses, supporting over $385 billion dollars in the economic activity. We see many businesses try, particularly even during the pandemic, businesses--an example, Kettle Kings in Texas which sells kettlebells, they've really expanded-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Well, Mr. Pichai, I have a limited amount of time, so I don't want to interrupt you, but my question is very specific. We heard throughout this investigation that Google has stolen content to build your own business. These are consistent reports, and so, your--your testimony that that doesn't happen is really inconsistent with what we've learned over the course of the investigation. But--but I'll move on to a new question.  </p><p>Mr. Pichai, most Americans believe that when they enter a search query, that what Google shows are the most relevant results. But increasingly, Google just shows whatever's most profitable for Google, be it Google ads or Google's own sites. And so my question, Mr. Pichai, isn't there a fundamental conflict of interest between serving users who want to access the best and most relevant information, and Google's business model which incentivizes Google to sell ads and keep users on Google's own sites? </p><p>PICHAI: We have always focused on providing users the most relevant information, and we rely on the trust for users to come back to Google every day. In fact, a vast majority of queries in Google, we don't show ads at all, and we show ads only for a small subset of queries where the intent from users is highly commercial. For example, they may be looking for something like TV sets or so on. So-- </p><p>CICILLINE: But Mr. Pichai, what is the--what is the value of the part that you do use the Google ads for? I mean, it's a substantial part of your business. What's the--what's the actual value, $200 billion, $300 billion? </p><p>PICHAI: You know, in terms of revenue, it's around hundred--hundred plus billion dollars, but-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Okay. That's a lot of money, Mr. Pichai. Let--let me move on. Really, Mr. Pichai, it's Google's business model that is the problem. Our documents show that Google evolved from a turn style to the rest of the web to a walled garden that increasingly keeps users within its sights. Emails show that over a decade ago, Google started to fear competition from certain websites, webpages that could divert search traffic and revenue from Google.  </p><p>These documents show that Google's staff discussed the proliferating threat, is how it was described, that these webpages posed to Google. Any traffic lost to other sites was a loss in revenue. One of Google's memos observed that certain websites were getting, and I quote, \"too much traffic,\" so Google decided to put an end to that. Mr. Pichai, you've been at Google since 2004, were you involved in these discussions about the threat from vertical search?  </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, without knowing the specifics--you know, I'm not fully clear of the context, but definitely, when we look at vertical searches it validates the competition we see. For example, when users come looking to shop online, independent studies show that over 55 percent of products searches originate with Amazon, and over 70 percent originate from the major ecommerce companies. </p><p>In the few categories which are commercial in nature, we see vigorous competition be it travel, be it real estate, and--and we are working hard, focused on the users, to innovate there-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Let me ask very specifically, Mr. Pichai. The evidence that we collected shows that Google pursued a multi-pronged attack. First, Google began to steal other webpages content. For example, in 2010, Google stole restaurant reviews from Yelp to bootstrap its own rival local search business. </p><p>Mr. Pichai, do you know how Google responded when Yelp asked you to stop stealing their reviews? Well, I'll tell you. Our investigation shows that Google's response was to threaten to delist Yelp entirely. In other words, the choice Google gave Yelp was, let us steal your content, or effectively disappear from the web. Mr. Pichai, isn't that anti-competitive? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, you know, when I run the company, I'm really focused on giving users what they want. We conduct ourselves to the highest standard, happy to engage and understand the specifics, and--and answer your questions further.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. And just one final series of questions, Mr. Pichai. Did Google ever use its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, just like other businesses, we try to understand trends from, you know, data which we can see, and we use it to improve our products for our users. But we are really focused on improving our products, and that's how search works, we are-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --I appreciate that, Mr. Pichai. Google's own documents in numerous interviews with companies affected by this conduct show that Google did just that, which is very disturbing and very anti-competitive. In addition to stealing content, Google also began to privilege its own sites. An investigative report published just yesterday found that 63 percent of web searches that start on Google also end somewhere on Google's own websites. </p><p>And to me, that's evidence that Google is increasingly a walled garden which keeps users on Google's sites, even if Google doesn't have the most relevant information, and it's economically catastrophic for other companies online.  </p><p>And so, my time is running out, but Mr. Pichai, I'll just end by saying, the evidence seems very clear to me; as Google became the gateway to the internet, it began to abuse its power. It used its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats and crushed them. It has dampened innovation and new business growth, and it's dramatically increased the price of accessing users on the internet, virtually ensuring that any business that wants to be found on the web must pay Google a tax. </p><p>And with that, I recognize the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. Sensenbrenner, for his first round of questions.  </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I've been in Congress 42 years. And that's coming to an end at the end of this year; I'm breathing a sigh of relief. Look, during that period of time, during the decade of the 90s and the 00s, you know, I was involved as chairman of the Science Committee and chairman of this committee, and trying to make the net universal, you know, and open it up to everybody.  </p><p>And one of the--or one of the theses that we used is that the net should end up becoming basically the debate on issues, not only in our country but throughout the world. And in exchange for that, this committee and the Congress gave internet service providers immunity, so that if somebody said something defamatory in what they posted, the ISPs could not be a part of a lawsuit for defamation.  </p><p>Now, after hearing Mr. Jordan give a long line of censorship of conservative viewpoints, you know, I am concerned that the people who manage the net, and the four of you manage a big part of the net, and are ending up using this as a political screen. Conservatives are consumers too, and the way the net was put together, in the eyes of Congress, is that everybody should be able to speak their mind. </p><p>Now, Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Jordan's litany of censorship zeroes in on Facebook. Exactly what are your standards and, quote, \"filtering out political speech,\" that maybe some people out there don't' agree with? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, thank you for the--the opportunity to address this. Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas. We want to give everyone in the world a voice to share their--their experiences and ideas, a lot of that is day-to-day things that happen in their lives, some of it is political. And frankly, I think that we have distinguished ourselves as one of the--the companies that defends free expression the most.  </p><p>We do have community standards around things that you--you can and cannot say. I--I think you would likely agree with most of them, they--they ban categories of harm such as promoting terrorist propaganda, child exploitation, incitement of violence, some more legalistic things like intellectual property violations. </p><p>And they also ban things like hate speech that could lead to dehumanizing people and encouraging violence down the road-- </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: --If--If I may ask specific of you, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time, because he put something up on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. Now, I wouldn't take it myself, but there still is a debate on whether it is effective either in treating or preventing COVID-19. </p><p>And I think that this is a legitimate matter of discussion, and it would be up to a patient and their doctor to determine whether hydroxychloroquine was the correct medication, you know, given the circumstances. Now, why did that happen? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman--well, first to be clear, I think what you might be referring to happened on--on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that. But I can talk to our policies about this. We do prohibit content that will lead to imminent risk of harm. And stating that there is a proven cure for COVID, when there is in fact none-- </p><p>[*]ZUCKERBERG: might encourage someone to go take something that could have some adverse effects. So we do take that down. We do not prohibit discussion around trials of drugs or--or people saying that they--they think that things might work or personal experiences with experimental drugs. But if someone is going to say that something is proven when in fact it is not, that could lead people to make a decision with their health-- </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: --But wouldn't that be up to somebody on the other side of the issue to say that this is not proven? And you know, I know is a fact that, you know, for people with certain conditions it contraindicated, and they shouldn't take it on that. But with not be up to somebody else, you know, to say okay, what somebody posted on this really isn't true and here's what the facts are rather than having a Twitter or a Facebook take it down? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, in general, I agree with you and we do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that that would be a bad position for us to be in and not--not what we should be doing. But on specific claims, if someone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to cure COVID when in fact it has not been proven to cure COVID and that that statement could leave people to take a drug that in some cases some of the data suggest that it might be harmful to people, we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of harm. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. I now recognize the distinguished chair of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler from New York for five minutes. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zuckerberg, I want to thank you for providing this information during our investigation. However, the documents you provided tell a very disturbing story, and that story is that Facebook saw Instagram as a powerful threat that could siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. </p><p>Now, let me explain what I mean. Mr. Zuckerberg, you have written that Facebook can likely always just by anticompetitive startups. In fact, on the day Facebook bought Instagram, which you described as a threat, you wrote \"One thing about startups is you can often acquire them.\" Mr. Zuckerberg, you were referring to companies like Instagram and that quote, weren't you? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I--I don't have the exact document in front of me, but I've always been clear that we viewed Instagram both as a competitor and as a complement to our services. In the growing space around--after smartphones start getting big and this--they competed with us in the space of mobile cameras and mobile photo sharing, but at the time, almost no one thought of them as a general social network and people didn't think of them as competing with us in that space. </p><p>And you know, I think that the acquisition has been wildly successful. We were able to--to by acquiring them continue investing in it and growing it as a standalone brand than outrageous many more people than I think either Kevin, the cofounder or I thought would be possible at the time while also incorporating some of the technology into making Facebook's photos sharing products better. So--so yes. </p><p>NADLER: Okay. Now, in early 2012 when Facebook contemplated acquiring Instagram, a competitive startup, you told your CFO that, though nascent, Instagram could be very disruptive to us and in the weeks leading up to the deal, you described Instagram as a threat saying that \"Instagram can meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business.\" </p><p>Now Mr. Zuckerberg, what did you mean when you described Instagram as a threat, as disruptive and when you said that Instagram could meaningfully hurt Facebook? Did you mean that Instagram--that consumers--did you mean that consumers might switch from Facebook to Instagram? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, thanks for the--the opportunity to address this. At the time, there was a small but growing field of-- </p><p>NADLER: --Did you mean--did you mean that consumers might switch from Facebook to Instagram? That was my question. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --Thanks. Congressman-- </p><p>NADLER: --Yes or no, did you mean that? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: In the space of mobile photos and--and camera apps, which was growing, they were a competitor. I've been--I've been clear about that and-- </p><p>NADLER: --Okay, fine. Fine. In February of that year, February 2012, you told Facebook's chief financial officer that you were interested in buying Instagram. He asked you whether the purpose of the deal was to neutralize a potential competitor or to integrate their products with hours in order to improve our services. You answered that it was a combination of both saying what we are really buying is time. Even of new some new competitors springs--springs outcome of those products won't get much traction since will already have the mechanics deployed at scale. Mr. Zuckerberg, what did you mean when you answered that the purpose of the deal was to neutralize a potential competitor? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, will, those aren't my words but yes I've been clear that Instagram was a competitor in the space of mobile photo sharing. There were a lot of others at the time. They competed with apps like VSCO Cam and Pick Please (SP) and companies like Path. It--it was a--a subset of the overall space of connecting that we exist in and by having them join us, they certainly went from being a competitor in the space of being a mobile camera to an app that we could help grow and help get more people to be able to use and be on our team. And I think that that's been-- </p><p>NADLER: --Thank you--thank you for your time-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --Wildly successful. </p><p>NADLER: Well, Mr. Zuckerberg, mergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust laws. In your own words, you purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitive threat. If this was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction, why shouldn't Instagram now be broken off into a separate company? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well congressman, I think the FTC had all of these documents and reviewed this and unanimously voted at the time not to challenge the acquisition. I think with hindsight, it probably looks like obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today but at the time, it was far from obvious. A lot of the competitors that they competed with in mobile sharing including companies like Path, which were hot at the time and had great founders and entrepreneurs running them, Dave Moore and I worked closely with him. I mean, I don't even think Path existed. It was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed. </p><p>The acquisition has done wildly well largely because not just of the founder's talent, but because we invested heavily in building up the infrastructure and promoting it and working on security and working on a lot of things around this. And I think that this has been an amazing success story. </p><p>NADLER: Well, thank you. Mr. Zuckerberg, you're making my point. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I wanted to end where I began. Facebook, by Mr. Zuckerberg's own admission and by the documents we have from the time, Facebook saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook and so rather than compete with it, Facebook bought it. </p><p>This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should never have happened in the first place. It should never have been permitted to happen and it cannot happen again. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would remind the witness that the failures of the FTC in 2012 of course do not alleviate the antitrust challenges that the chairman described. And with that, I'm going to recognize the gentleman from Colorado and again thank him for cohosting one of the most important field hearings we had along with Mr. Neguse in Colorado and I think was very critical in this investigation. You recognized for five minutes, Mr. Buck. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to offer my appreciation to you for the bipartisan way that you have approached the subcommittee's investigation. I want to start by saying that capitalism it is the greatest instrument for freedom this world has ever seen. Capitalism has given the United States the freedom and means to defeat the Soviet Union, beat back Fascism, and put a man on the moon. </p><p>This economic system has lifted millions out of poverty. It has made America the freest, most prosperous nation in the world. Our witnesses have taken ideas born out of the dorm room, garage, eye warehouse and built these dreams into four of the biggest power players in the digital global economy. You have all enjoyed the freedom to succeed. </p><p>Now, let me be clear, I do not believe big is necessarily bad. In fact, big is often a force for good. However, I want to address one particularly disturbing issue. Mr. Pichai, in October 2018, Google dropped out of the running for a Pentagon contract to complete the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI contract, which was valued at more than $10 billion. Google's stated reason for removing itself from the bidding process is that the U.S. military's project did not align with Google's corporate values and principles. </p><p>This is that same U.S. military that fights for our freedoms and stands as a force for good across the globe. These are the same soldiers, sailors--sailors and airmen that sacrificed their lives to ensure you have the freedom to build your company and set your corporate policies without fear of government interference, unlike in communist China. I also find it very interesting that only months after making this decision to withdraw from the JEDI contract, Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff </p><p>[*]BUCK: warned the Senate Armed Forces Committee that the Chinese military was directly benefiting from Google's work. It made me wonder what values Google and Communist Red China had in common. I asked myself, self, is it that the Chinese Communist Party imprisons Uyghur Muslims in concentration camp? I--it is shown on the chart behind me. Could it be that China forces slaves to work in sweatshops? Maybe they align on the design to suppress free speech in Hong Kong. Did Google agree with CCP's decision to lie to the world about the COVID-19 pandemic? </p><p>Then I thought about Google's Dragon Fly experiment. I wondered if perhaps you agreed with the Chinese government's use of technology platforms to spy on its own people and enforce Draconian security laws. Maybe it's that your company is aligned with the Chines Communist Party's corporate espionage policies, where the strategy is to steal whatever can't be produced domestically. </p><p>These values that allow Google to work with the Chinese military but not the U.S. military explain why Google wouldn't think twice about blatantly stealing a competitor's product, right down to the watermark without any hint of attribution. Mr. Pichai, during your--our field hearing in my home state of Colorado, I heard a story that sounded so brazen and contrary to free market principles, that I thought it must've been straight from the Chinese Communist Party's corporate espionage playbook. </p><p>Google took advantage of a company that relied on your search engine to build its brand and compete. Google misappropriated lyrics from Genius Media Group's website and published those lyrics on Google's own platform. However, Genius caught Google in the act, quite literally, red-handed. When Google--when Genius suspected this corporate theft was occurring, the company incorporated a digital watermark in its lyrics that spelled out, \"red-handed,\" in Morse code. </p><p>Google's lyric boxes contained the watermark, showing that your company stole what you couldn't or didn't want to produce yourself. After Google executives stated that they were investigating this problematic behavior, Genius created another experiment to determine the scope of the misappropriation. It turns out that out of 271 songs where the watermark was applied, 43 percent showed clear evidence of matching. </p><p>Your company, which advertises itself as a doorway to freedom, took advantage of this small company, all but distinguishing Genius' freedom to compete. Google is supposed to connect people to information. Your corporate values once stood for freedom, a platform that let capitalism flourish and helped bring countless people across the globe out of poverty. My question to you, Mr. Pichai, do you think that Google could get away with following China's corporate espionage playbook if you didn't have a monopolistic advantage in the market? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, I want to be able to address the important concerned you have raised. First of all, we are proud to support the U.S. government. We recently signed a big project with the Department of Defense where we are bringing our world-class, zero-trust-based cybersecurity approach to help protect Pentagon networks from cybersecurity effort--attacks. </p><p>We have projects underway with the Navy, the Department of Defense Affairs, happy to follow up and explain more. We have a very limited presence in China, we don't offer any of our services, search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, etcetera in China. And with respect to music, we license content there--in fact, we license content from other companies, and so this is a dispute between Genius and the other companies in terms of where the source of the content is. But again, happy to engage and explain--explain what we do here further. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. I now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson, for five minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cook, with over 100 million iPhone users in the United States alone, and with Apple's ownership of the App Store, giving Apple the ability to control which apps are allowed to be marketed to Apple users, you yield immense power over small businesses to grow and prosper. Apple is the sole decision maker as to whether an app is made available to app users through Apple's App Store, isn't that correct? </p><p>COOK: Sir, the--the App Store--thank you for the questions. The App Store is a feature of the iPhone, much like the camera is and the chip is. And so what-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Yeah. And my--and my point is, and I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to get to the point. The point is that Apple is the sole decision maker as to whether an app is made available to app users through the Apple Store, isn't that correct? </p><p>COOK: If it's a native app, yes, sir. If it's a web app, no--. </p><p>JOHNSON: --Alright. Okay, thank you. Thank you. And throughout our investigation, we've heard concerns that rules governing the App Store review process are not available to the app developers. The rules are made up as you go, they are arbitrarily interpreted and enforced, and are subject to change whenever Apple sees fit to change. And developers have no choice but to go along with the changes, or they must leave the App Store. That's an enormous amount of power. Also, the rules get changed to benefit Apple at the expense of app developers, and the App Store is said to also discriminate between app developers with similar apps on the Apple platform, and also as to small app developers versus large app developers. So, Mr. Cook, does Apple not treat all app developers equally? </p><p>COOK: Sir, we treat every developer the same. We have open and transparent rules; it's a rigorous process. Because we care so deeply about privacy and security and quality, we do look at every app before it goes on, but those apps--those rules apply evenly to everyone. And as you can tell by going from-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Some--some developers are favored over others, though, isn't that correct? </p><p>COOK: That is not correct. And as you can tell from going from about 500-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Sir, I'll give you an example. I'll--I'll give you an example. Baidu has two app stores--two App Store employees assigned to help it navigate the App Store bureaucracy, is that true? </p><p>COOK: I don't know about that, sir. </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, you don't have other app developers who have that same access to Apple personnel, do you-- </p><p>COOK: --We--we do a lot of things with developers, including looking at their beta test apps, regardless of whether they're small or large. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay, well let me ask you--let me ask you this question. Apple has negotiated exceptions to its typical 30 percent commission for some apps like Amazon Prime. Is that--is a reduced commission such as the one that Amazon Prime gets available to other app developers? </p><p>COOK: It's available to anyone meeting the conditions, yes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay, well let me ask you this. Apple requires all app developers to use Apple's payment processing system if those developers want to sell their goods or services to Apple users through Apple's App Store, isn't that correct? </p><p>COOK: That is correct, because it's-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --And by processing--and by processing payments for apps that you allow into the app store, you collect their customer data, and you use that data to inform Apple as to whether Apple should--whether or not it would be profitable for Apple to launch a competing app, isn't that correct? </p><p>COOK: Sir, 84 percent of the apps are charged nothing. The remaining 16 percent either pay 15 or 30, depending upon the--the specifics. If it's in the second year of a subscription, as an example, it only pays 15 percent. If you look back at history-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Well what's--what's to stop Apple from increasing its commission to 50 percent? </p><p>COOK: We--sir, we have never increased commissions in the store since the first day it operated in 2008. What-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --There's nothing to stop you from doing so, is there? </p><p>COOK: No, sir, I disagree strongly with that. There is a competition for developers, just like there's a competition for customers. And so the competition for developers, they can write their apps for Android, or Windows, or Xbox, or PlayStation. So we have fierce competition at the developer side and the customer side, which is essentially, it's so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business. </p><p>JOHNSON: Has Apple ever retaliated against or disadvantaged a developer who went public about their frustrations with the App Store? </p><p>COOK: Sir, we don't--we do not retaliate or bully people. It's strongly against our company culture. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gaetz. </p><p>GAETZ: Mr. Zuckerberg, in his written testimony, made the claim that Facebook is an American company with American values. Do any of the rest of you take a different view, that is to say that your company companies don't embrace American values? It's great to see that none of you do. Mr. Pichai, I'm worried about Google's market power, how it concentrates data power and ultimately how it wields it. </p><p>Project Maven was a collaboration between Google and the Department of Defense that Google pulled out of, citing ethical concerns and you made the decision to pull out of that joint venture following receipt of a letter from thousands of your employees saying that Google should not be in the business of war. My question, Mr. Pichai, is did you wait the input from your employees when making the decision to abandon that project with the United States military? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, thanks for your concern. As I said earlier, we are deeply committed to supporting the military and the U.S. government. We have undertaken several projects since then. We do take our employees input into account, but it's one input. We make decisions based on a variety of factors. As a company, we were new in the cloud space at that time. Since then-- </p><p>GAETZ: --Thank you. That's a sufficient answer. That you did it take their--their feedback into account. And in fact, some of your Googlers have recently sent you a letter where they've asked you to exit other partnerships as a consequence of ethical concerns. They've asked you to stop doing business with American law enforcement saying that police broadly uphold white supremacy and that--and that Google should not be engaged in any services to police. </p><p>And as you well know, you provided some of the most basic services to police like email, but you also provide services that help keep our cops safe when they're doing their job. And so my question is here in front of Congress and the American people, will you take the pledge that Google will not adopt the bigoted anti-police policy that is requested in the most recent letter? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we have a long track record of working with law enforcement when it is supported by due process and--and the law. We push back against over broad requests. We are transparent about the requests we get. But we have a long history of following the law and--and cooperating with law enforcement where appropriate. </p><p>GAETZ: No, I understand the history. I'm asking about the future. To the law enforcement-- </p><p>PICHAI: We will come-- </p><p>GAETZ: --That are watching today, can they rest assured that under your leadership, Google will not adopt these bigoted anti-police policies? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we are committed to continuing to work with law enforcement in a way that's consistent with law and due processes in the U.S. </p><p>GAETZ: Well, I greatly appreciate that, and I know that will be very comforting to the police who utilize your services. You mentioned earlier in your--in the discussion about China that your engagement in China was very limited, but yet, Google has NAIA China Center. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published a paper saying that--that enhanced the targeting capabilities of China's J-20 fighter aircraft. You collaborate with Chinese universities that take millions upon millions of dollars from the Chinese military. </p><p>As a matter of fact, one of your Googlers, Fei-Fei Li while under your employee was cited in Chinese state media saying, \"China is like a sleeping giant. When she wakes, she will tremble the world.\" The former secretary of defense Mr. Shanahan said that the lines have been brought in China between commercial and military application. And as Mr. Buck cited, General Dunford says that your company is directly aiding the Chinese military. And Peter Thiel, who actually serves on Mr. Zuckerberg's board at Facebook--book said that Google's activities with China are treasonous. He accused you of treason. </p><p>So why would an American company with American values so directly aid the Chinese military but have ethical concerns about working alongside the U.S. military on Project Maven? And I understand your point about cybersecurity and those things, but Project Maven was specific way to ensure that our troops are safe on the battlefield. And if you have no problem making the J-20 Chinese fighter more effective in its targeting, why--why wouldn't you want to make America as effective? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, with respect, we are not working with the Chinese military. It's absolutely false. I had a chance to meet with General Dunford personally. We have clarified what we do--what we do in China compared to our peers. It's very, very limited in nature. Our AI work in China is limited to a handful of people working on open source projects. I'm happy to share and engage with the office to explain our work in China further. </p><p>GAETZ: Gosh, I mean, when--when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says that an American company is indirectly aiding China when you have an AI center when you were working with universities and when your employees are working about China trembling the world, it seems to really call into question your commitment to our country and our values. I see my time has expired. I hope we have an additional round, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: I think the gentleman. I now recognize the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Raskin for five minutes. </p><p>RASKIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zuckerberg, as you know, the proliferation of fake Facebook accounts was a key tool in the strategy of Russian interference in the American election in 2016 American law enforcement, the Senate, the House have all found that Vladimir Putin--Vladimir Putin and changed engaged in a sweeping and systematic campaign to undermine American democracy in 2016 and to work for a victory for Donald Trump. </p><p>In his remarkable book, \"Mind Blank,\" and I'm being polite here, Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who worked for several years at Cambridge Analytica accounts of the Russian assault on America in Cambridge Analytica's research depended on Facebook. </p><p>\"When Cambridge Analytica launched in the summer of 2014, Steve Bannon's goal was to change politics by changing culture. Facebook data, algorithms, and narratives were his key weapons. The Cambridge Analytica team used these tools to identify people who exhibited the three traits in what they called the dark triad. Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. They then proceeded to bombard and activate these people, a small percentage of the American public, but still millions of people with increasingly dark and manipulative messages from fake Facebook pages to get them to vote for Trump, but more importantly, to activate them as racists and white nationalists.\" </p><p>And they go on to describe the--he goes on to describe the remarkable success of this campaign both electorally but also politically in the country in terms of selling the terrible racial and ethnic divisions that you see in America today. So they waged a mass campaign of psychological warfare to polarize America around race and religion and to active not activate racists and anti-Semites and it worked splendidly for them. But it didn't work so well for America. </p><p>So Mr. Zuckerberg, which parts of this narrative have you addressed what are you planning to address, or do you just see that essentially has a cost of being a form and a marketplace for ideas? Is there nothing that can be done about the use of Facebook to engendered social division in America? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, thank you. Since 2016, there have been a lot of steps that we've taken to protect the integrity of elections. We've hired I think it's more than 30,000 people to work on safety and security. We've built up AI systems to be able to find harmful content, including be able to find more than 50 different networks of coordinated and authentic behavior, basically nation-states trying to interfere in elections around the world, not just in the U.S.-- </p><p>RASKIN: --A--can I as you--can I pass you let me just as you were there for a second because I'm interested in that. The stop hate for-profit campaign is a coalition that includes the color of change, the anti-defamation league and other civil rights groups and they are targeting Facebook right now for a boycott because of the rapid spread of hate messages online, the presence of Boogaloo and other right wing extremist groups trying to infiltrate and disrupt Black Lives Matter protests and the fact that white racist and anti-somatic content flourishes on Facebook. </p><p>So they're asking you to remove these pictures and essentially to join the movement for civil rights by not allowing that kind of content. They are--their breakwaters include a lot of big companies including Patagonia, Levi's, McDonald's, VW, Heineken, and so on. But you seem not to be that moved by their campaign. I just wondered what you think about what they're asking you to do. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, thanks. We are very focused on fighting against election interference and were also very focused on fighting against hate speech. And our commitments to those issues inviting them go back years before this recent movement. Since 2016, the defenses is that the company has built up to help secure elections not just in the U.S. around the world I think are some of the most advanced that any company or government has in the world now. </p><p>We routinely now collaborate with law enforcement and intelligence agencies and--and are able to sometimes identify threats coming from other countries before governments are even able to. In terms of fighting hate, we've built really sophisticated systems. Our goal is to identify it before anyone even sees it on the platform and we've built AI systems and, as I mentioned, have tens of thousands of people working on safety and security with the goal of getting this stuff down so that way--before people even see it. And right now we're able to proactively identify 89 percent of the hate speech that we take down before I think it's even--even seen by other people. So--you know--I--I want to do better than 89 percent. I'd like to get that to--to 99 percent. But we have a--a massive investment here. We invest in billions of dollars-- </p><p>RASKIN: --Can--can you just tell me--because my time's almost out. I--can--can you just address the proliferation of fake accounts? I understand annually you get 6.5 billion fake accounts produced there. But in some sense you have a profit motive that's linked to that because that's what's reported to your investors, the number of accounts. Are you working zealously to try to ferret out these fake accounts that are used to spread hate and disinformation? </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman's time has expired but the witness may answer the question-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --Absolutely, congressman. Congressman, absolutely. We work hard on this. We take down billions of fake accounts a year. A lot of that is just people trying to set up accounts to spam people for commercial reasons. A--a very small percent of that are nation-states trying to interfere in elections. </p><p>But we're very focused on trying to find those. Having fake and--and harmful content on our platform does not help our business. It hurts our business. People do not want to see that stuff. And--and they use our services less when they do. So we are aligned with people in order to take that down and we invest billions of dollars a year in doing so. </p><p>RASKIN: I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: The committee will stand in recess for 10 minutes while we fix a technical feed with one of our witnesses. </p><p>[*](RECESS) </p><p>CICILLINE: The committee will come back to order. </p><p>I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong, for five minutes. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Google has received criticism about--about bias against conservatives and content moderation. There were threats of monetizing the Federalist and numerous other complaints of viewpoints oppression. As a result, a significant portion of the American public has lost trust in your company. </p><p>A lack of public confidence in a product usually means there is economic harm to the company. But that just isn't the case with Google. So I think it's a legitimate question as to whether Google's market power insulates it from loss of revenue normally associated with offending half the people who use your product. </p><p>I also think it's a legitimate question to ask if other attempts to regulate your industries have worked. </p><p>So, Mr. Pichai, Google has restricted advertising analytics or the portability of user data related to advertising due to compliance with the general data protection regulation. Specifically in 2018, Google restricted the ability to export the double ID, a cookie-based identifier that complies individual user data and creates profiles through Google data transfer. Is that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, I'm not familiar with the specifics of that particular issue, but happy to follow-up more once I understand it better. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: So you're not particular--particularly familiar with how you're complying with GDPR. </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we--we've long been working to comply with GDPR. We think it's an important regulation. And, you know, we have--you know, we are in full compliance to the extent of my knowledge. I just meant I'm not aware of that specific issue with identifier you mentioned there. But I'm happy to understand it better and follow-up. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: All right. </p><p>So in order to comply with GDPR, Google must retain control over more user data and restrict the ability to combine this user data with other platforms to conduct--cross platform analysis. It seems as if that ultimately limits the ability of advertisers to make comparisons between--Google based campaigns and non-Google based campaigns. Would you agree with that? </p><p>PICHAI: In all of these ecosystems, we are--we are balancing between users, advertisers and publishers. We deeply care about the privacy and security of our users, and so when we serve these ecosystems, we have to take that into account. We have to comply with important laws and regulations in every country we operate it. And so that--that's the delicate balance we are constantly striking, but we are focused on our users and trying to do the best we can. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I--I just want to be perfectly clear. I--I personally believe that--that just the market power consolidation is significant. But I also want to be clear that when we're moving forward to regulate this, that we aren't actually squeezing out competition in our quest--in our--in our quest to do something. Because I've said that. </p><p>I've said that before in this hearing, and I'll say it again. Usually in our quest to--to regulate big companies, we end up hurting small companies more. And I'm a strong privacy advocate, but the consequences of GDPR have been to further entrench large established actors like Google, leading to regulatory capture that exasperates competition concerns. And Google's digital ad market share has increased since the implication--implementation of GDPR. Do you know that to be correct? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, to just give you a sense of the robust competition we see, ad prices have fallen down by 40 percent in the past ten years. And in fact, in the U.S., advertising as a share of GDP has come down from 1.4 percent in 1990 to less than 1 percent today. </p><p>So we see robust competition in the marketplace. And as I said earlier, you know, we have to comply with regulation. We have to interpret it strictly. And we have to balance the ecosystem. But our utmost care is ensuring privacy and security of our users as we serve these markets. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I'm glad you mentioned privacy because I would be remiss if I didn't deal with this issue because it is so relevant. And I think generally speaking, outside of the political issues and the biases that solved with all of this, and this is for essentially all four of our witnesses, I think one of our bigger concerns when we talk about data and value--and that data having value and privacy, that--which is where people really get concerned with how the digital age is--moving forward. </p><p>And there are news reports that law enforcement has made increasing use of what are called GEO-fence warrants. And these GEO-fence warrants allow authorities to compel technology companies to disclose location records for any device in a certain area at a particular time. Court filings suggest that Google receipt about a 1500 percent increase in GEO--GEO-fence requests from 2017 to 2018 and a 500 percent increase from 2018 to 2019. </p><p>Unless--and so the Fourth Amendment requires probable cause and specificity. And that's not what these are. These warrants are essentially for any person in an area at a particular time, and GEO-fence warrants require neither. So unless a company by particularized information in identifying a subject, GEO warrants are essentially general warrants. </p><p>I believe that the location information should be considered as contents of the Electronic Communications Act under the Stored Communications Act. Do you agree? </p><p>PICHAI: You know, I'm happy to understand more. We deeply care about it. This is why we shoot transparency (INAUDIBLE) because we think it's an important area for Congress to have oversight. And we recently made a change by which we automatically delete location activity after a certain period of time by default for our users. So we are happy to engage with the office, congressman, and--and--and engage more. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I'm using you because these are going on in Virginia and New York, I think, right now. But I mean, this--this equates for everything. I think people would be terrified to know that law enforcement could grab general warrants and get everybody's information anywhere. So it requires Congress to act and it requires everybody that is a witness in this hearing to be willing to work, too, because it is the single most important issue. I think we're--. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired, but I believe he has a unanimous consent request. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: I do. I have unanimous request--consent requests for a Wall Street Journal article, Police Request for Google Users Location Histories Face New Scrutiny. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And then I have two letters. The letters are from Congressman Walden, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers. The first letters to Mr. Cook of Apple. The second letter is to Mr. Pichai. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection, both may be entered into record. </p><p>I now recognize the gentlelady from Washington, Ms. Jayapal. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being with us. </p><p>Mr. Bezos, in July 2019, your employee, Nate Sutton, told me under oath in this committee that Amazon does not, quote, \"use any specific seller data when creating its own private brand product.\" </p><p>So let me ask you, Mr. Bezos, does Amazon ever access and use third-party seller data when making business decisions? And just a yes or no will suffice, sir. </p><p>BEZOS: Thank you for the question. I know it's an important topic, and I also want to thank you for representing us. But I can't answer that question yes or no. What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Mr. Bezos, you're probably aware that an April 2020 report in The Wall Street Journal revealed that your company does access data on third-party sellers, both by reviewing data on popular individual sellers on products, and by creating tiny product categories that allowed your company to categorically access detailed seller information in a supposedly aggregate category. Do you deny that report? </p><p>BEZOS: --I'm familiar with the Wall Street Journal article that you're talking about and we continue to look into that very carefully. I'm not yet satisfied that we've gotten to the bottom of it and we're going to keep looking at it. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Okay. </p><p>BEZOS: It's not as easy to do as you would think because some of the sources in the article are anonymous, but we continue to look into it. </p><p>JAYAPAL: I'll take that as a you're not denying that. You're looking into it. </p><p>I will tell you, a former Amazon employee in third-party sales and recruitment told this committee, quote, \"There's a rule, but there's nobody enforcing or spot checking. They just say, don't help yourself to the data. It's a candy shop. Everyone can have access to anything they want.\" </p><p>Do category managers have access to non-public data, about third-party products and businesses? </p><p>BEZOS: I--here's what I can tell you. We do have certain safeguards in place. We train people on the policy. And we expect people to follow that policy the same way we would any other. It's a voluntary policy. As far as I'm aware, no other retailer--. </p><p>JAYAPAL: So there's no--so there's no actual--. </p><p>BEZOS: (INAUDIBLE) at all. </p><p>JAYAPAL: There's no actual enforcement. There's no actual enforcement of that policy? So it's voluntary, and there's no actual enforcement. So maybe that answers my--. </p><p>BEZOS: Sorry. No, I think--I think I may have misspoken. I'm trying to say that Amazon's--the fact that we have such a policy is voluntary. I think no other retailer even has such a policy. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Well, that's--that's--. </p><p>BEZOS: Our enforcement of that policy, we--we would treat that like any internal policy. And if we found that someone violated it, we would take action against them. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Well, there's numerous reports and the committee has conducted interviews with former employees who confirm that there are employees who do have access to that data and are using it. </p><p>And so my next question was going to be if you--if you thought you were actually enforcing these rules, do you think that that's working? And again, I would just say that there's credible reporting that's documented of these rules that you have put into place. And the committee has interviewed employees that typically say--say that these breaches typically occur. </p><p>Let's talk about aggregate data for a minute. Your rules do allow for you to access combined data on a product when there are only one or two sellers in the marketplace, correct? </p><p>BEZOS: Yes. Aggregate data is allowed under our policies. That is correct. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And interviews with former employees have made it clear that that aggregate data essentially allows access to highly detailed data in those product categories. There's the example of Fortem, a small business that had no direct competitors except for Amazon warehouse deals, a resale clearing account--clearance account that only sold 17 units. </p><p>An Amazon employees accessed a detailed sales report on Fortem's product with information on how much the company spent on advertising per unit and the cost to ship each trunk. And then Amazon launched its own competing products in October 2019. That's a major loophole. And I go back to the General Counsel's statement to this committee very clearly that there was no access to this data, that Amazon does not use that data for its own benefit. And I'm now hearing you say well you're not so sure that that's going on. </p><p>And the issue that we're concerned with here is--is very simple. You have access to data that far exceeds the sellers on your platforms with whom you compete. You can track consumer habits, interests, even what consumers clicked on but then didn't buy. You have access to the entirety of sellers' pricing and inventory information past, present, and future, and you dictate the participation of third-party sellers on your platform so you can set the rules of the game for your competitors but not actually follow those same rules for yourself. </p><p>Do you think that's fair to the mom-and-pop third-party businesses who are trying to sell on your platform? </p><p>BEZOS: I appreciate that question. I like it a lot because I really want a chance to address that. I'm very proud of what we've done for third-party sellers on this platform. We've started our third-party platform 20 years ago and we had zero sellers on it-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --The--the--the question I'm asking-- </p><p>BEZOS: --eBay was (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --I'm sorry--I'm so sorry my time is expiring-- </p><p>BEZOS: --I'm sorry. Go ahead. I didn't-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --And the question I wanted to ask you is that you have access to data that your competitors do not have. So you  might allow third-party sellers onto your platform but if you're continuously monitoring the data to make sure that they're never gonna get big enough that they can compete with you, that is actually the concern that the committee has. </p><p>And--you know--I think your company started in my district. I want to thank you for that. I want to thank you for the work that you've done. And say that the whole goal of this committee's work is to make sure that there are more Amazons. That there are more Apples. That there are more companies that get to innovate, and small businesses get to thrive. And that is what we're trying to get at. That is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly. </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentlelady has expired. I just wanted to remind the witnesses we appreciate the gratitude for the questions and your description of them as good questions but we'll just assume that they're good questions and they're--and you're happy to answer them so we can make sure we're making good use of your time. </p><p>And with that I recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Steube. </p><p>STEUBE: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pichai I'd like to start with you. And I'm just gonna illustrate my question with a--a factual incident that actually occurred to me. Several months ago my wife called and said, \"Hey there's a good article on the Gateway Pundit that you should read.\" </p><p>So out of curiosity I was up here in Washington--out of curiosity I googled Gateway Pundit. And it didn't show up on the first page. It didn't show up on the second page. There was a bunch of different blogging sites about how there were disagreements with what was on the Gateway Pundit, but I actually had to type in gateway pundit dot com to get to it. </p><p>Interestingly, Google didn't allow me to get to the actual website. That was a couple of months ago before this hearing was set to be heard, before this hearing was noticed, before you knew that you would be br--appearing before us today and that this is an issue that obviously Conservatives and Republicans have had. </p><p>Last week after the--the--this was noticed--this hearing was noticed, I did the exact same thing here in the capital. And wouldn't you know it. I googled Gateway Pundit and that was the very first website that came up. Now this isn't from a constituent in my district, this isn't from somebody telling me, this isn't a news report. I actually physically did this on my laptop here in the capital several months ago and then today. </p><p>So clearly something had happened between not being notified that you were going to be appearing before our committee and then last week knowing that you would be appearing before our committee and suddenly conservative websites are now at the top of the bar when you search for them. </p><p>So was there any--anything done at Google between a couple of months ago and last week or the week before you appearing today that has changed your approach to silencing conservative websites? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we approach our work with a deep sense of responsibility without--in a non-partisan way. We want to serve all our users no matter where they are. In fact, it's in our long term business incentive--incentive to do so. And I believe on our platforms including YouTube there are more conservative voices than ever before. And--and we believe in freedom of expression. </p><p>On this specific issue--you know--you know--I will have to look into it. You know--I obviously wasn't aware of it. We do--it could be a--a number of reasons. We constantly get reports from both sides of the aisle-- </p><p>STEUBE: --So if you're--if you're gonna look into it for me is there--can I re--can I expect a response from you, say, in the next two weeks as to why that occurred? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we'll do our best to follow up. And I'll engage with your office to (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>STEUBE: --Okay. We'll foll--we'll follow up on that. I--I've got a similar question. So, I've been in elected politics for almost 10 years. And when I was in the Florida Senate in the State Senate I never had a problem with my campaign emails being marked as spam or going to junk folders or anything along those lines. And we had 30, 40, 50,000 people on our email list. </p><p>And suddenly I get elected to Congress and I'm now up here in Washington, D.C. and my parents who have a Gmail account aren't getting my campaign emails. My supporters--just last week one of my supporters called me and said, \"Hey, I--I just want you to know this. That my Gmail account suddenly is taking your campaign emails that I've received for almost 10 years and suddenly they're going to spam and junk folders.\" </p><p>This is--appears to only be happening to Conservative Republicans. I don't see anything in the news or anything in the press or other members on the other side of the aisle talking about their campaign emails getting thrown into junk folders in Gmail. So my question is--is why is this only happening to Republicans? And it's a fact it's happening. Because I can have my supporters testify that they've received my emails for eight years--eight, nine years and suddenly this last year all of their Gmail--my campaign emails in their Gmail are going to their spam folder. So if you could--if you could give me some clarification on that I would appreciate it. </p><p>PICHAI: In--in Gmail we--we are focused on what users want. And users have indicated they want us to organize their personal emails, emails they receive from friends and family separately. And so all we have done is we have a tabbed organization and--and--you know--we've--the primary tab has emails from friends and family and the secondary tab has other notifications and so on. </p><p>These things are applied-- </p><p>STEUBE: --Yeah, well it was my--it was my father who was not receiving now my campaign emails. So clearly--clearly that familial thing that you're talking about didn't apply to my emails. </p><p>PICHAI: Our systems probably are not able to understand that your campaign--I mean that it's your father. Obviously we don't have that context there. We just apply it neutrally across--across--you know--all--all organizations. And--and--you know (INAUDIBLE) that's really how we explain (INAUDIBLE) here-- </p><p>STEUBE: --Well what assurances can you give me that there's--what is--my time's short. One last question. What assurances can you give me that any bias amongst your employees isn't influencing your spam folder algorithms? </p><p>PICHAI: Con--Congressman there's nothing in the algorithm which has anything to do with political ideology. And--you know--we--we--we do get complaints across the aisle. For example, the World Socialist Review complained in January of this year that their--you know--their site wasn't found in Google search results. </p><p>And so we get complaints, we look into it. But--you know--we approach our work in a non-partisan way and it's in our long term incentive to serve users across the country. And today that's why we invest in our (INAUDIBLE) in 49 states across the U.S. so that we can capture all viewpoints. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. I now ca--recognize the gentlelady from Florida Ms. Demings for five minutes. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much Mr. Chairman and let me just suggest for the record I'm a Democrat from Florida and I've had co--heard complaints about my emails going into spam as well. And I'm sure other Democratic members have had the same experiences unfortunately. </p><p>Mr. Pichai, in 2007 Google purchased Double Click, the leading provider of certain advertising tools. Is that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: That's correct, congresswoman. </p><p>DEMINGS: When Congress pur--when Google purcha--or proposed the merger alarm bells were raised about the access to data Google would have, specifically the ability to connect a user's personal identity with their browsing activity. Google, however, committed to Congress and to the antitrust enforcers that the deal would not reduce user privacy. </p><p>Google chief legal advisor testified before the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee that Google wouldn't be able to merge his data even if it wanted to, given contractual restrictions. But in June of 2016, Google when ahead and merged this data anyway, effectively destroying anonymity on the internet. Mr. Pichai, you became CEO in--of Google in 2015, is that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: That's right. </p><p>DEMINGS: Okay. And this change was made in 2016, is that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: That's my understanding. </p><p>DEMINGS: Okay, thank you for that. Did you sign off on this decision to combine the sets of data with Google--that Google had told Congress would be kept separate? </p><p>PICHAI: Congresswoman, any--any changes we made, you know, we comply-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --Mr. Pichai, with all due respect, please, did you sign off on the decision or not? </p><p>PICHAI: I--I reviewed at a high level all important decisions we make. We deeply care about privacy and security of our users-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --So you signed off on the decision--? </p><p>PICHAI: --And we provide user consent for-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --Okay. You signed off on the decision. Practically, this decision meant that your company would not combine all of--would now combine all of, for example, all of my data on Google, my search history, my location from Google Maps, information from my emails from Gmail, as well as my personal identity with a record of almost all of the websites I visited. That is absolutely staggering. According to an email from a Double Click executive, that was exactly the type of reduction in user privacy that Google's founders had previously worried would lead to a backlash, and I quote, \"They were unwavering on the policy due to philosophical reasons,\" which as Larry and Sergey was fundamentally not wanting use is associated with a cross-site cookie. They were also worried about a privacy storm as well as damage to Google's brand. </p><p>So in 2007, Google's founders feared making this change, because they knew it would upset their users. But in 2016, Google didn't seem to care. Mr. Pichai, isn't it true that what changed between 2007 and 2016 is that Google gained enormous market power. So while Google had to care about user privacy in 2007, it no longer had to in 2016. Would you agree that what changed was Google gained enormous market power? </p><p>PICHAI: Congresswoman, this is an important issue, if I could explain. You know, we today make it very easy for users to be in control of their data. We have simplified their settings; they can turn ads personalization on or off. We have combined most of factory settings into three groupings. We remind users to go to a privacy check-up; one billion users have done so, and 20 billion people-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --Okay, Mr. Pichai. Thank you so much for that. I am concerned that Google's bait-and-switch with Double Click is part of a broader pattern where Google buys up companies for the purposes of surveilling Americans, and because of Google's dominance, users have no choice but to surrender. In 2019, Google made over 80 percent of its total revenue through selling of ad placement, is that correct, Mr. Pichai? </p><p>PICHAI: You know, majority of the business-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --About 80 percent? Yeah, okay. And because Google sells behavioral ads, ads targeted to each of us as individuals, the more user data that Google collects, the more money Google can make. More user data means more money, is that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: In--in general, that's not true. For example, there's common sites, when you type-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --More user data, not the more money Google collects--? </p><p>PICHAI: --Most of the data we need is built into the-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --I'm sorry, please. So you're saying that the more user data does not mean the more money that Google can collect? </p><p>PICHAI: Congresswoman, most of the data today we collect is to help users and provide personalized experiences back. Ad data is not delivered at that time at all--. </p><p>DEMINGS: --Okay. Thank you--thank you so much, Mr. Pichai. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentlelady. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Jordan for five minutes. </p><p>JORDAN: Thank you--thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pichai, is Google going to tailor its features to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we approach our work--you know, we support both campaigns today. We think political ads is an important part of free speech and democratic societies, and we engage with campaigns, you know, according to law, and we approach our work in a non-partisan way. </p><p>JORDAN: It was a yes or no question. Can you assure Americans today you won't tailor your features to help Joe Biden in the upcoming election? </p><p>PICHAI: You know; we support work that campaigns do. I just want to make sure I am answering that-- </p><p>JORDAN: --I understand that. We all--we all do all kinds of online social media, all kinds of that kind of--that--that outreach, that communication. This is a simple question; can you today assure Americans you will not tailor your features in any way to help--specifically help one candidate over the other? And this--this--what I'm concerned about is you helping Joe Biden over President Trump. </p><p>PICHAI: We--we won't do any work to politically tilt anything one way or the other; it's against our core values. </p><p>JORDAN: But you did it in 2016. There's an email in 2016 that was widely circulated amongst the executives at your company, that got public, where Ms. Eliana Murillo, head of your multicultural marketing, talks about the silent donation Google made to the Clinton campaign. And you applauded her work, she points that out in the email. I'm just curious if you did it in '16, I want to make it--you know, in spite of the fact you did it in '16, President Trump won, I just want to make sure you're not going to do it again in 2020. </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, I recall our conversation at that time, and I appreciate your concern. We didn't find any evidence of such activity, and I took the opportunity, after our conversation, to reinforce to the company--we realize even an appearance could be improper. So we have clearly communicated to our employees, any personal political activity, left or right, needs to happen on their own time and resources, and should avoid any use of company-- </p><p>JORDAN: --Well, of course, everyone's got their First Amendment rights to campaign for who they want, what they can't do is configure your features to help one candidate over the other. So you might have not have found any evidence, but here's what she wrote to the email, to a number of key executives in your company. Quote, \"We pushed to get out the Latino vote with our features,\" second quote, \"We pushed to get out the Latino vote with our features in key states.\" Seems to me those last three words are the real qualifier here; that's electioneering. When you're trying to increase the Latino vote in key states. And she had already communicated that she was supporting Clinton, that she wanted Clinton to win. </p><p>So when she talks about increasing the Latino vote, which she assumed was going to help candidate Clinton, and she's doing that in key states--it's one thing if you're going to increase the Latino vote around the country. If you're just a good corporate citizen, you're urging people to vote. It's quite another when you're focusing on in key states, and you know what those key states were? Nevada and Florida, the swing states. So again, I want to make sure this isn't going to happen in 2020. </p><p>PICHAI: I can assure you that we complied with laws in 2016. As a company, any work we do around elections is nonpartisan. Users do come for us for understanding where polling places are, where to vote, what is the date to vote, what the voting hours are. We are committed to providing that information, and I can assure you that we will approach our work in a nonpartisan-- </p><p>JORDAN: --So--so Mr. Pichai, here's the--here's the question I think's on so many Americans minds. They saw the list that we read here earlier on in our opening statements, all the things Google has done. Google is siding with the World Health Organization over--over anyone. who disagrees with them, even though the World Health Organization obviously lied to America, obviously shields for China. Google's siding with them, YouTube's siding with them. We have the history of all the things Google has done, and the history of what happened in 2016 in the election where they obviously, according to one of the--your multicultural marketing executives, tried to help Clinton. </p><p>And here we are, 97 days before the election and we want to make sure it's not going to happen again. We want to make--can you give us two assurances? One, you're not going to try to tailor your features, configure your platform in a way to help Joe Biden, and second, that you're not going to use your search engine to silence conservatives. Can you give us those two assurances today? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, on our search engine, conservatives have more access to information than ever before-- </p><p>JORDAN: --And we appreciate that. That--that wasn't the question. Can you assure us today you're not going to try to silence conservatives, and can you assure us today you're not going to try to configure your features--as Ms. Morillo said you did for Clinton in '16, can you assure us today you're not going to do the same thing for Joe Biden in 2020? </p><p>PICHAI: You know, you have my commitment. It's always been true, and we'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way. </p><p>JORDAN: Appreciate it. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Scanlon. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you, gentlemen. I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories. Mr. Bezos, our investigation-- </p><p>JORDAN: --Mr. Chairman, we have the email. There is no fringe conspiracy-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Excuse me, it's not your time. </p><p>RASKIN: Mr. Jordan, you do not have the time. Please be respective of your colleague. She controls the time. </p><p>CICILLINE: Put your mask on. Put your mask on. </p><p>JORDAN: Mr. Raskin, you want to talk about masks-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Mr. Jordan, Ms. Scanlon controls the time--. </p><p>JORDAN: --Why would the Deputy Secretary of Treasury unmask Michael Flynn's name, Mr. Raskin--. </p><p>CICILLINE: Ms. Scanlon-- </p><p>JORDAN: --And what I want to know is, can someone come after my motives for asking questions, I get a chance to respond. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlelady is recognized. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>Mr. Bezos, our investigation uncovered documents that show that Amazon sometimes doesn't play fairly, crossing the line from robust competition to predatory pricing to destroy rivals rather than outcompete them. And let's take the example of Kudzu, which used to own Diapers.com and provided online baby care products. </p><p>In 2009, your team viewed Diapers.com as Amazon's largest and fastest growing online competitor for diapers. One of Amazon's top executives said that Diapers.com keeps the pressure on pricing honest. And strong competition from Diapers.com meant that Amazon was having to work harder and harder so that customers didn't pick Diapers.com over Amazon. And the customers we're talking about were hard working families, single parents with babies and young children. </p><p>Now, because Diapers.com was so successful, Amazon saw it as a threat. The documents that we've obtained showed that Amazon employees began strategizing about ways to weaken this company. And in 2010, Amazon hatched a plot to go after Diapers.com and take it out. </p><p>In an email that I reviewed, and we've got these up on the slides, one of your top executives proposed to you a, quote, \"aggressive plan to win\" end quote, against Diapers.com, a plan that sought to undercut their business by temporarily slashing Amazon prices. We saw one of your profit and loss statements, and it appears that in one month alone, Amazon was willing to bleed over $200 million in diaper profit losses. </p><p>Mr. Bezos, how much money was Amazon ultimately willing to lose on this campaign to undermine Diapers.com? </p><p>BEZOS: Thank you for the question. </p><p>I--I don't know the answer--the direct answer to your question. This is going back in time, I think maybe 10 or 11 years or so. You could give me--maybe the dates on those documents. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay. </p><p>BEZOS: But what I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers who are--who have new families is a very traditional idea. </p><p>SCANLON: Sure. But let's delve into this a little further. </p><p>BEZOS: We didn't invent that I deal, neither did Diapers.com. </p><p>SCANLON: I'm sorry. You know, I only have a few minutes here, so I just press on. </p><p>BEZOS: Of course. </p><p>SCANLON: Your own documents, make clear that the price war against Diapers.com worked. And within a few months it was struggling. And so then Amazon bought it. </p><p>After buying your leading competitor here, Amazon cut promotions like Amazon.mom and the steep discounts it used to lure customers away from Diapers.com, and then increase the prices of diapers for new moms and dads. </p><p>Mr. Bezos, did you personally sign off on the plan to raise prices after Amazon limited its competition? </p><p>BEZOS: I don't remember that at all. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you. </p><p>BEZOS: What I remember is that we--we--we matched competitive prices. And we--I believe we followed Diapers.com. Again, this is 11 years ago, so you're asking a lot of my memory, but I believe we followed Diapers.com. </p><p>I can also tell you that we bought Diapers.com--. </p><p>SCANLON: I understand that. Okay. </p><p>BEZOS: We put more than $300 million in trying to make it successful. </p><p>SCANLON: Just moving on, reclaiming my time. Sir, I'm sorry. </p><p>So you said that Amazon focuses excessively on customers. So how would customers, especially single moms, new families, how would they benefit when the prices were driven up by the fact that you eliminated your main competitor? </p><p>BEZOS: Well, I don't agree--with great respect, I don't agree with the premise. At the same time, you should recognize in context, diaper's is a very large product category sold in many, many places, not just at Amazon and Diapers.com</p><p>SCANLON: Right. But this was the online diaper market. Now, we do have evidence that these predatory--. </p><p>BEZOS: (INAUDIBLE) Costco and Kroger, and Walmart and so on. </p><p>SCANLON: I'm sorry, Mr. Bezos. I need to push on here. </p><p>BEZOS: Of course, sorry. </p><p>SCANLON: the evidence we've collected suggests that the predatory practices weren't unique here. In 2013, it was reported that you instructed Amazon employees to approach discussions with certain business partners, and I quote, \"the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\" </p><p>Is the Gazelle project still in place? And does Amazon pursue similar predatory campaigns in other parts of its business? </p><p>BEZOS: I--I--I cannot comment on that because I don't remember it. What I can tell you is that we are very, very focused on the customer as you started. And, of course, that does include bargaining very hard with vendors and suppliers to get the lowest prices so that we can offer those to customers. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay well, I'm concerned with the customers, as well, especially the families in my district. I'm sorry, Mr. Bezos. I'm almost out of time. I'm concerned, too, because especially with the current pandemic, one of the biggest needs I'm seeing at the food drives and the giveaways that we're having to run in my district is that families don't have diapers and we have to collect them to give them out. So it certainly is some--something that has a really hard impact on families. And I--I'm really concerned that pricing might have been driven up here by this tactic. </p><p>And I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlelady yields back. </p><p>I just announced that votes have been called, but we're going to continue at the hearing. So I invite colleagues to vote at--you know, it's a rolling vote, so vote according to your own schedule. </p><p>I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse, for five minutes. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank each of the witnesses today for your testimony. </p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, in 2004, when you had launched Facebook, it's fair to say, I think you'd agree with me, that you had quite a few competitors. Do you agree with that? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, yes. </p><p>NEGUSE: MySpace, Friendster, Google's Orkut, Mixi, Cyworld, Yahoo! 360, AOL's Babo, they were all competitors? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, those were some of the competitors at the time, and it's only gotten a lot more competitive since. </p><p>NEGUSE: Well, let's talk about that, because by 2012, Mr. Zuckerberg, none of those companies that I just identified existed. And you're certainly aware of that. They were all basically gone. Facebook, in my view, I think, was a monopoly by then. I wonder whether you would agree with that. I--I take it you don't. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, that's correct, I don't. We face a lot of competitors in every part of what we do, from connecting with friends privately to connecting with people in communities, to connect them with all your friends at once, to connecting with all kinds of user generated content. I mean, I would bet that--that you or most people here have multiple apps for each of those on your phones. </p><p>NEGUSE: Mr. Zuckerberg, let's--why don't we dig into this a bit further? So you and I clearly disagree about that. </p><p>In 2012, I'm looking at a document that was produced by Facebook in response to the subcommittee's investigation. It's a presentation prepared for Sheryl Sandberg to deliver to the board of directors of a major telecommunications firm boasting that, quote, \"Facebook is now 95 percent of all social media in the United States.\" </p><p>The title of the slide is even, quote, \"The industry consolidates as it matures.\" So it's I look at that graph, I, you know, certainly think most folks would concede that--that Facebook was a monopoly as early as--it's 2012. But nonetheless, I understand that we disagree on that point. </p><p>Would you agree with me that Facebook, it's strategy since that time, to essentially protect what I describe as a monopoly, but obviously what you would describe as market power, that Facebook has been engaged in purchasing competition, in some cases replicating competition and in some cases eliminating your competition? Would that be a fair statement? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressmen, the space of people connecting with other people is a very large space, and I--I would agree that there were different approaches that we took to--to addressing different parts of--of that space. But it's all in service of building the best services for people to--. </p><p>NEGUSE: And I appreciate that, Mr. Zuckerberg. I appreciate the latter point. </p><p>It--it sounds like you are conceding that at least some of those strategies were what I identified. And so I want to talk a little about that. In 2014, here's an email. It's from Facebook's current chief financial officer, described the company's acquisition strategy as, quote, \"a land grab,\" and saying that we are going to spend 5-10 percent of our market cap every couple of years to shore up our position. </p><p>And my sense of the facts is that--that that is, in fact, what has occurred. Facebook, as you conceded, you conceded earlier that Instagram was a competitor of Facebook's. You acquired Instagram in 2012. Instagram is now the sixth largest social media platform in the world. Is that right? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I'm not sure what rank it is, but it's certainly grown beyond our--our wildest expectations. </p><p>NEGUSE: I--I can represent to you that the statistics demonstrate that empirical data shows it's the sixth largest. </p><p>In 2014, Facebook bought its competitor WhatsApp. Is that correct? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, yes. WhatsApp was also both a competitor and complimentary. They competed with us in the space of mobile messaging, which is a growing and important space and is again one part of the--the global space of how people connect more broadly. </p><p>NEGUSE: Understood. </p><p>And at that time, WhatsApp had over 400 million monthly users, a clear path towards one billion monthly active users. And WhatsApp is now the second largest social media platform in the world, with two billion users worldwide more than Facebook Messenger. And of course, your company owns WhatsApp. </p><p>Facebook also tried to buy other competitive startups. In fact, as Chairman Nadler noted, you did tell one of Facebook's senior engineers in 2012 that you can quote, \"likely buy--just buy any competitive startup, but it'll be a while before we can buy Google.\" Do you recall writing that email? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I don't specifically, but it--it sounds like a joke. </p><p>NEGUSE: Well, it certainly--I don't take it as a joke. You know, as I review the email, it was in regard to having just closed the Instagram sale. And the response from this individual--this engineer to you was quote, \"Well played.\" Your response was, \"Thanks.\" One reason people underestimate the importance of watching Google is that we can likely always just buy any competitive startups, but it'll be a while before we can buy Google.\" And--and given the purchases that Facebook had made previous to this and the attempted purchases--my understanding is that Facebook made several overtures to Snapchat for example which rebuffed those efforts--clearly demonstrates in my view that that email was not made in jest. </p><p>But I--here's why I ask these questions, Mr. Zuckerberg. It--it strikes me that over the course of the last several years, Facebook has used its market power to either--you know--purchase or replicate the competition. And Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram are the most now downloaded apps of the last decade. Your company, sir, owns them all. And we have a word for that. That word is monopoly. With that I would yield back, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you gentleman. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. McBath for five minutes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bezos, you referred to third party sellers today as Amazon's partners and that your success depends on their success. But over the past year we've heard a completely different story. As part of this investigation we've interviewed many small businesses, and they used the words like bullying, fear, and panic to describe their relationship with Amazon. </p><p>I'm gonna share the story of a small business owner who is also a wife and a mother so you can understand how this is this actually affecting the lives of everyday people and why this truly matters. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>\"We were a top bookseller on Amazon dot com. And we worked day and night very hard towards growing our business and maintaining a five star feedback rating. Most importantly this business feeds a total 14 people, which includes three children and one 90-year-old granny. And as we grew, we were shrinking Amazon's market share in the textbooks category. </p><p>So now in retaliation, Amazon started restricting us from selling. They started with a few titles in early 2019 and within six months Amazon systematically blocked us from selling the full textbook category. We haven't sold a single book in the past 10 months or--or probably more. We were never given a reason. Amazon didn't provide us with a notice as to why we were being restricted. There was no warning. There was no plan.\" </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>So, Mr. Bezos, after Amazon dis--delisted this small business without any apparent reason or notice, she told us that they sent more than 500 separate communications to Amazon including to you, Mr. Bezos, over the past year. And there was not a single meaningful response. Do you think this is an acceptable way to treat someone that you described as both a partner and a customer? </p><p>BEZOS: No, congresswoman. And I appreciate that you've shown me that anecdote. And I would like to talk to her. It does not at all to me seem like the right way to treat her. And I'm surprised by that. It--and--and it's not the systematic approach that we take, I can assure you. I don't even understand what's going on in that anecdote 'cause we would love for third party sellers to sell books on the website-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Respectively sir, just-- </p><p>BEZOS: --So I don't--I don't understand it but I would like to understand it better and--and with your permission I would-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Respectively, sir, I--I-- </p><p>BEZOS: --I would like to get in touch with your office-- </p><p>MCBATH: --I think though that you're missing the point. This is not just about one business. Now I'm concerned that this is a pattern of behavior and basically this pattern of behavior has to change. Mr. Bezos, my question is simply are you willing to make sure going forward that--you know--the numerous sellers that we've talked to, they have problems just like this. And there are more sellers who have told us that they have exhausted all of their options before finally reaching out to you directly as a last resort. But they're still waiting for your response. </p><p>So what do you have to say to the small businesses who are talking to Congress because you simply won't listen to them? </p><p>BEZOS: Well I'd say that's not acceptable. If we aren't listening to you I'm not happy about that at all. And I--but I do--you know--if you'll allow me to disagree a little bit with a piece of this, I do not think that's systematically what's going on. And the evidence that I would suggest would be useful for you to consider in that regard is that third party sellers in aggregate are doing extremely well on Amazon. </p><p>They grew from 20--you know--20 years ago it was zero and today it's 60 percent of sales-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Right. Okay-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Third party sellers are growing even-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Thank you very much-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Faster than first party retail-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Thank you so much. That--Mr. Bezos you-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Oh. I--thank you. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you so much. You said that sellers have many other attractive options to reach customers, but that's not at all what we found in our estim--investigation. According to eMarketer, a source Amazon cited in submissions to this committee Amazon has nearly seven times the market share of its closest ecommerce competitor. One seller told us that and I quote, \"Amazon continues to be the only show in town no matter how angry sellers get. They have nowhere else to go.\" </p><p>So are you saying that these people aren't being truthful when they say that Amazon is the only game in town? </p><p>BEZOS: Yeah. Congresswoman, with great respect I--I do disagree with that. I believe that there are a lot of options. And some of them are not even listed on that chart. I just looked at it briefly, but I didn't see some that I know of for example. So I--I think there are a lot of business dynamic-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Okay thank you. Alright. Thank you for that-- </p><p>BEZOS: --There're more--there're more and more every day-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Mr. Bezos, my time is short. If Amazon didn't have monopoly power over these sellers do you think they would choose to stay in a relationship that is characterized by bullying, fear, and panic. </p><p>BEZOS: With all respect, congresswoman, I--I do not accept the premise of your question. The--that is not how we operate the business-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Okay. Alright-- </p><p>BEZOS: --And in fact we pro--we work very hard to provide a fantastic tool for sellers-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Thank you for that. Thank you for that-- </p><p>BEZOS: --And that's why they've been successful-- </p><p>MCBATH: --Thank you for that. Mr. Bezos, I'm gonna close with giving the bookseller the opportunity to finally be heard by you. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>\"Mr. Bezos, we increased our sales on Amazon by five times in the past three years. And we have contributed that much of proportional seller fees to Amazon. We have contributed that much to your business. To five times. We followed all the rules that were set by you. We--we--please--you know--just help us in earning our livelihood. We beg you. There are 14 lives at stake. Please, please, please help us get back on track.\" </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>With that I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentlelady. We've now concluded our first round. I now recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>Mr. Bezos, according to your testimony the marketplace is competitive. But Amazon controls as much as 75 percent of all online marketplace sales and eMarketer, a source you cited to us in submissions to this committee, reports that Amazon has nearly seven times the market share of its closest competitor. </p><p>Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but to rely on Amazon to connect with customers and make online sales. </p><p>BEZOS: No sir. With great respect I--I--I do have a different opinion on that. I believe there are a lot of options for small sellers. I believe Amazon is a great one and we've worked very hard. I think we are the best one. We have-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Mr. Bezos-- </p><p>BEZOS: --A lot of different programs that help sellers, but we are not the only option. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. There are 2.2 million active sellers as of yesterday. About 37 percent of those sellers rely on Amazon as their sole source of income. That is over 800,000 people relying on Amazon to feed their families, put their kids through school, and keep a roof over their heads. </p><p>Mr. Bezos, you have referred to third party sellers as both your partners and customers. But isn't it true that Amazon refers to third party sellers as internal competitors? </p><p>BEZOS: I think in so--I--it wouldn't surprise me. In some ways we are competing and they're also competing with each other-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Oh that's right. Your own documents Mr.--Mr. Be--Mr. Bezos-- </p><p>BEZOS: --The marketplace does allow that-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Amazon's own documents that you produced refer to the very same sellers that you have described as Amazon partners as internal competitors. In fact, we've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of the investigation that Amazon is the only game in town. One small businessowner we interviewed described it this way. And he--and he--and I quote, \"We're stuck. We don't have a choice but to sell through Amazon.\" Another said and I quote, \"They've never been a great partner, but you have to work with them.\" </p><p>During this investigation we have heard so many heartbreaking stories of small businesses who sunk significant time and resources into building a business and selling on Amazon only to have Amazon poach their best selling items and drive them out of business. </p><p>So I want to talk to you about one company that really stood out from the rest. I want you to pay close attention to how they describe your partnership, Mr. Bezos. We heard from a small apparel company that makes and sells what they call useful apparel for people who work on their feet and with their hands, like construction workers and firefighters. </p><p>This particular business discovered and started selling a unique item that had been--never been a top seller for the brand. They were making about $60,000 a year on just this one item. One day they woke up and found that Amazon had started listed the exact same product, causing their sales to go to zero overnight. </p><p>Amazon had undercut their price, setting it below what the manufacturer would generally allow it to be sold so that even if they wanted to, they couldn't match the price. Here's how the apparel company described working with Amazon. And I quote, \"Amazon strings you along for a while because it feels so good to get that paycheck every week. And in the past, for lack of a better term, we included Amazon heroin because you just kept going and you had to get your next fix, your next check. But at the end of the day, you find out that this person who is seemingly benefiting you, making you feel good was just ultimately going to be your downfall.\" So Mr. Bezos, this is one of your partners. Why on earth would they compare your company to a drug dealer? </p><p>BEZOS: Sir, I have great respect for you and this committee, but I'd completely disagree with that characterization. When we have done is create in the store a place--if you go back in time, we sold only our own inventory. It was a very controversial decision inside the company to invite third party sellers to come into what is really our most valuable retail real estate, our product detail pages. We did that because we were convinced that it would be better for the consumer. It would be better for the customer-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Mr. Bezos, this is-- </p><p>BEZOS: --to have all of that selection. And I think we were right and I think it's worked out well for the customer-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Reclaiming my time. Unfortunately, this is one-- </p><p>BEZOS: --For the third-party seller, and for-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Reclaiming my time, Mr. Bezos. This is one of many small companies that have told us during this year-long investigation that they were mistreated, abused, and tossed aside by Amazon. Now Mr. Bezos, you said that Amazon is only focused on doing what's best for the customer. You just said it again and that third party--and also third-party sellers. </p><p>But how is that possible when you compete directly with third-party sellers with your own products that undercut the competition? Isn't it an inherent conflict of interest for Amazon to produce and sell products on its platform that compete directly with third-party sellers, particularly when you, Amazon sets the rules of the game? </p><p>BEZOS: Thank you. No, I don't believe it is. We have--we have--the consumer is the one ultimately making the decisions. They're making the decisions about what to buy, what price to buy it at, who to buy it from. And our--but we try to do-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --That's not the question, Mr. Bezos-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Is make it easy for-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --The question is is there an inherent conflict of interest because you are a data company, you know when customers put something in the cart, when they take it out. Traditional brick and mortar stores like a grocery store where competition occurs don't have that. </p><p>And so I just want to follow-up, finally, on an answer to the question that you gave to Congresswoman Jayapal. You said that you can't guarantee that the policy of not sharing third-party sellers data with Amazon--Amazon's online hasn't been violated. You couldn't be certain. Can you please explain that to me? </p><p>How--can you list examples of which--where the policy has been violated? Because it's particularly concerning to me, Mr. Bezos, that shouldn't third parties know for sure that data isn't being shared with your online, their competitors? Why should a third-party seller list their product on Amazon if they're just going to be undercut by Amazon's own product as well as a result of data you take from them? </p><p>BEZOS: So, I think what--what I want you to understand I think it's important to understand is that we have a policy against using individual seller data to compete without private label products. </p><p>CICILLINE: And you couldn't assure Ms. Jayapal that that policy isn't violated routinely. </p><p>BEZOS: Well, we're investigating that and I--I do not want to sit here and I do not want to go beyond what I know right now. We are, as a result of that Wall Street Journal article, we are looking at that very carefully-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Thank you, Mr. Bezos-- </p><p>BEZOS: --And we want to get this back-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --The evidence-- </p><p>BEZOS: --And I will surely share them with you-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Thank--thank you. And we look forward to that. The evidence we've collected shows that Amazon is only interested in exploiting its monopoly power over the e-commerce marketplace to further expand and protect its power. This investigation makes clear that Amazon's dual role as a platform operator and competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anticompetitive and Congress must take action. And with that, I recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Sensenbrenner for five minutes. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Mr. Chairman, I think that that history proves that Congress does a poor job in picking winners and losers and I've looked over a lot of the material that has been assembled. I've been working with the chairman for over a year on this bipartisan investigation and I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws. They have been working just fine. The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws. </p><p>Now, we've heard a lot about the Facebook acquisition of Instagram. That happened in 2012. Obama's FTC signed off on that. So regardless of what you think has happened at that time, the fact is is that this acquisition did pass the smell test of the regulators involved. Maybe they made a mistake or maybe something else happened. I don't know, but the fact is is that there is not a problem with the law. </p><p>Now, you know, back about 35 years ago, AT&amp;T was broken up because it was determined that one stop shops were monopolistic and AT&amp;T, because you have to get your long distance service from your local phone company, that was monopolistic. So the baby bells (SP) were spun off. A lot has happened since then. There were mergers and acquisitions in the telecom industry. Technology advanced a huge amount and guess what? We're back to exactly where we were in 1984. So this goes to show that congressional pressure is not the best. </p><p>Now, using the AT&amp;T example, which I think was a big flop and counterproductive, let me ask Mr. Bezos, you know, say the AT&amp;T example was applied to Amazon and you were required to spend stuff off. So you might have no more of the one stop shop, but you have to go to separate places for books or groceries or videos or electronics. How are the consumers helped by that? </p><p>BEZOS: Sir, thank you. They would not be. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Right. </p><p>BEZOS: Very clear. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Now Mr. Pichai, let me ask about Google. If you were forced to split up your business lines, say spin all Adtech (SP) and YouTube, can you describe what happens to consumers there? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, today consumers in most of the areas we are dealing with, they see prices free or falling and they get more choices than ever before. So I think--I think it serves them well. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: And you are right there. So you know, I--I'm not going to be on this committee in the next Congress. I am going to put my feet up and become a senior \"statesman.\" But you know, let me say that we have heard a lot of complaints about big tech. Some of them are political in nature and I share the complaints and the concern of Mr. Jordan and others. And others talk about allegedly anticompetitive activity. </p><p>It seems to me that it's not for Congress that legislates to toss all of our antitrust laws in the precedent that has been established through litigation over the last 100+ years. But it's something where we ought to go back to the regulators, to the enforcers, have them look at this stuff and have them make a determination on whether or not the law has been violated. I think the law is good on that and we don't need to throw it all in the wastebasket. </p><p>But there are some matters of concern that we've heard from both sides of the aisle that I think need to be addressed. And if it requires an agency like the FTC to say that they've made mistakes in the past, so be it. We're all human. We all make mistakes. And even government agencies do that. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentle lady from Washington, Ms. Jayapal. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zuckerberg, in March 2012, you suggested by email to your management team that moving faster and copping other apps could \"Prevent our competitors from getting footholds.\" Sheryl Sandberg responded that \"It is better to do more and move faster, especially if that means you don't have competitors build products that take some of our users.\" </p><p>Facebook's product manager--management director added that \"I would love to be far more aggressive and nimble in copying competitors. Has Facebook ever taken steps to prevent competitors from getting footholds by copying competitors? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I view it as our job to understand what people are finding valuable in all of the services that they use and certainly, if--if someone-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --Do you copy--do you copy your competitors? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, we certainly adapted features that--that others have let in as of others copied and--and adapted features that we have-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --I'm not concerned about others. I'm just asking you, Mr. Zuckerberg. Since March 2012, after that email conversation, how many competitors did Facebook end up copying? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I--I can't give you a number of companies who have-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --Is it less than five? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman--Congresswoman, I don't know, I-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --Less than 50? Any estimates? Your team is making a plan. How did it play out? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman I--I'm not sure I agree with the premise here. Our job is to make sure that we build the best services for people to connect with all of the people they care about and a lot of that is done by innovating and by building new things that are-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank--thank you, thank you-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --(INAUDIBLE) internally. </p><p>JAYAPAL: --Mr. Zuckerberg. Let me go on. Has Facebook ever threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman not that I would--not that I recall. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And I would like to just remind you that you are under oath, and there are quotes from Facebook's own documents. Prior to acquiring Instagram, Facebook began developing a similar product called Facebook Camera, correct? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, that is correct. I--I--I have said multiple times that we--we are competing in the space of building mobile cameras with Instagram. That is what they did at the time. Their competitive set was companies like we were building with Facebook Camera and Vscocam and Pic Please (SP) and-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank--thank you, Mr.--thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg. Did you ever use this very similar Facebook camera product to threaten Instagram's founder Kevin Systrom? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I'm not sure what you would mean by threaten. I think it was public that we were building a--a camera app at the time. That was a well-documented thing. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Let me tell you that Mr.--in a chat, you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook was quote developing our own photos strategies, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line. Instagram's founder seem to think that was a threat here and he confided--confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would--he would--that you would go into quote, \"destroy mode,\" if he didn't sell Instagram to use so let's just recap. Facebook cloned a popular product, approached the company you identified as a competitive threat, and told them that if they did and let you buy them up, there would be consequences. Were there any other companies that you used this same tactic with while attempting to buy them? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I want to respectfully disagree with the characterization. I think it was--it was clear that this was a space that we were going to compete in one way or another. I don't view those conversations as a threat in any way. </p><p>JAYAPAL: I just--I am just using the documents and the testimony that the committee has collected from others. Did you warn Evan Spiegel, the founder of Snapchat, that Facebook was in the process of cloning the features of his company while also attempting to buy Snapchat? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I don't remember those specific conversations, but that was also an area where it was very clear that we were going to be building something. It--people want to be able to communicate privately, they want to be able to communicate with all of their friends at once, and we are going to make sure that we build the best product in all of these spaces that we can around helping people stay connected with the people they care about. </p><p>JAYAPAL: I appreciate that Mr. Zuckerberg. I think the question again here is when the dominant platform threatens its potential rivals that should not be a normal business practice. Facebook is a case study in my opinion in monopoly power because your company harvest and monetizes our data, and then your company uses that data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire, and kill rivals. You have used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors and to ensure that you always get your way. These tactics reinforce Facebook's dominance, which you then use in increasingly destructive ways. So Facebook Sperry model makes it impossible for new companies to flourish separately, and that harms our democracy, it harms mom and pop businesses, and it harms consumers. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>UNKNOWN: The gentlewoman yields back. The gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Buck, is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bezos, thank you for being here today. I am concerned that you have used Amazon's dominant market position to unfairly harm competition. We've heard from a number of companies that Amazon uses proprietary data from third-party companies to launch its own private label products, meets with startups to discuss investing in the product and then uses the proprietary data from these meetings to create its own private label products, allows the sale of counterfeit items through its Web platform. During this subcommittees field hearing in Boulder this January, PopSockets CEO and inventor David Barnett detailed how Amazon allowed counterfeit products to appear on Amazon's marketplace of head of PopSockets products. Mr. Barnett told CNBC that PopSockets found at least 1000 counterfeit products for sale on Amazon's marketplace, which Amazon allegedly failed to remedy until PopSockets agreed to a nearly $2 million marketing deal with Amazon. </p><p>We also seem troubling reports in the Wall Street Journal detailing Amazon's use of third parties sellers proprietary data to develop and market its own competitive private label products. The Wall Street Journal also reported last week that Amazon's venture capital fund used meetings with unsuspecting startup companies to gain access to secret proprietary product information and financial details. Amazon then reportedly use that information to launch competing products, often disastrous results for the original startup company. There are many examples of this behavior, but one allegation in the journals reporting sticks out in particular. In 2011 Amazon contacted Vocal Life LLCs inventor about the possibility of investing in speech detection technology. Vocal Life's founder accepted the meeting, thinking this was the company's big break. After displaying vocal lives microphone technology and providing proprietary information, including engineering data to Amazon employees, the relationship came to an abrupt halt. Amazon employees allegedly stopped responding to emails before the technology eventually found its way into the Amazon's Echo device. </p><p>These allegations are serious, especially because the size and scope of these practices couldn't happen without Amazon's monopolistic control of the marketplace. I am also concerned that given Amazons allowance of counterfeit goods on its marketplace especially counterfeit goods from China that Amazon's marketplace may be knowingly or unknowingly furthering China's use of forced and slave labor conditions. This is especially important following recent reports that at least 80 global companies that sell on the Amazon marketplace, including Nike, Starbucks, and Samsung, have ties to Chinese factories that use enslaved Uighur Muslims. </p><p>Following these concerning reports, Senator Hawley introduced an important bill last week requiring American businesses to certify that their supply chain does not rely on forced labor. I will be introducing the house companion bill later this afternoon. While I do not expect you to have intimate knowledge of the legislation, I do want to ask all four of our witness is a simple yes or no question. Will you certify here today that your company does not use and will never use slave labor to manufacture your products or allow products to be sold on your platform that are manufactured using slave labor? Mr. Cook, you were kind enough to visit with me on the phone. I think we briefly discussed this issue. If you can give a yes or no answer and I understand you haven't read the details of the bill that would you agreed to this idea? </p><p>COOK: I would love to engage on the legislation with you Congressman but--but let me be clear, forced labor is abhorrent, and we would not tolerate it an apple, and so I would love to get with your office and engage on the legislation. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you. Mr. Pichai? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, I share your concern in this area. I find it abhorrent as well. Happy to engage with your office and discuss this further. </p><p>BUCK: So I really don't want to even engage with my office half the time. Well you guys agree that slave labor is not something that you will tolerate in manufacturing your products or in products that are sold on your platforms? </p><p>PICHAI: I agree, Congressman. </p><p>BUCK: And Mr. Cook? </p><p>COOK: We wouldn't tolerate it. We would--we would terminate a supplier relationship if it were found. </p><p>BUCK: Mr. Zuckerberg? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I agree. We wouldn't tolerate this, and if we found anything like this, we would also terminate any relationship. </p><p>BUCK: And--and Mr. Bezos? </p><p>BEZOS: Yes, I agree completely. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you very much and gentlemen, and I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman. I now recognize the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Raskin, for five minutes. </p><p>RASKIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Mr. Buck for that excellent line of questioning and for the upcoming legislation. I look forward to joining that. We--we want you know in the 19th century we had the (INAUDIBLE) in the 21st century we get the cyber barons, and we want to make sure that the extraordinary power and wealth that you have been able to amass is not used against the interest of democracy and human rights around the world and not against the interest of a free market and home. </p><p>So Mr. Bezos let me turn to you I am interested in the role that you play as a--as a gatekeeper. A lot of consumers want to know when the HBO Max app will be unavailable on your fired of ice, and I understand that negotiations are ongoing but that your company is not only asking for financial terms but also for content from WarnerMedia. Is that right and is that a fair </p><p>[*]RASKIN: way to proceed. In other words, is it fair to use your gatekeeper status role in the streaming device market to promote your position as a competitor in the video streaming market with respect to content? </p><p>BEZOS: I'm not familiar with the details of those negotiations. I just said they're underway right now. I predict that the companies will eventually come to an agreement. And I think this is kind of two large companies negotiating agreements is kind of normal case of--it's normal commerce. </p><p>RASKIN: Right. But--and here--here's why I pursue it, precisely because it is a large company. And in a way, they stand in for hundreds of thousands of much smaller companies who are even in a more disadvantageous position with respect to negotiating with you. </p><p>I guess the--the general proposition then you can speak to if you don't know the details of this, which is is it okay to negotiate not just for financial terms and having someone be part of your--your fire unit, but also to try to extract in that negotiation leverage with respect to getting content from them? </p><p>BEZOS: Well, again, I am not familiar with the details. What I would say is I think that we-- </p><p>RASKIN: --I'm not asking about that one; in general, in general. </p><p>BEZOS: In general, I think that when two companies are negotiating, you are negotiating not just the--the amount of money that's going to change hands, but also what you're going to get in exchange for the amount of money. That is the very fundamental way that business works. </p><p>RASKIN: --Do you see at least to third-- </p><p>BEZOS: --We do have to agree on both paths-- </p><p>RASKIN: --Do you see at least to outsiders that would look like a structural conflict of interest, like you're using your control over access to people's living rooms, essentially? You're using that in order to obtain leverage in terms of getting creative content that you want. And are you essentially converting power in one domain into power in another domain where it doesn't belong? </p><p>BEZOS: I think what I should do is offer to get you information. And if you--I'll--I'll get it to your office for you, because I'm not enough--I'm not familiar enough with this. And I can imagine that there would be scenarios, if we're just talking in the abstract, where it would be inappropriate. And I could imagine scenarios where it would be very normal business and-- </p><p>RASKIN: --Okay-- </p><p>BEZOS: --And very appropriate. </p><p>RASKIN: Fair enough. I want to talk about the--an emerging market, smart homes. And I want to start with the hub of the smart home, smart speakers. Does Amazon price the Echo device below cost? </p><p>BEZOS: Not its list price, but it's often on promotion. And I--sometimes when it's on promotion, it may be below cost, yes. </p><p>RASKIN: Well, several other companies to tell us, in fact, that Amazon is pricing have Echo device is way below cost, making it nearly impossible for them to compete, and aggressively discounting Alexa enabled speakers is a strategy to own the smart home. Like many markets we've heard about today, smart speakers with voice assistance like Alexa, along with the myriad of smart home appliances that Alexa can interact with, make up the next ecosystem or platform for tech companies to lock-in customers. </p><p>Would you say the smart home market for which the Echo, Ring security system, and other smart devices operate is a winners' take all market, yes or no? </p><p>BEZOS: No, I wouldn't, especially if we--if we are able to succeed at what we want, which is we would like--our--our vision for this is that smart home speakers should answer to different way cords, so-- </p><p>RASKIN: --Well-- </p><p>BEZOS: --You know, from different companies-- </p><p>RASKIN: --When considering the acquisition of-- </p><p>BEZOS: --On a case by case basis. And I think in that--just to--you know, because I think it's important. If we could achieve that, then I think you would get really good behavior on the part of, you know-- </p><p>RASKIN: --Okay-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Competitive voice agents helping you. </p><p>RASKIN: When you--when you are looking at acquiring Ring, you wrote to your executive team, \"We're buying market position, not technology. In that market position and momentum is very valuable.\" So, if smart homes are not a market with lock-in effects, why would a leading market position and momentum be so very valuable? </p><p>BEZOS: Sir, market position is--is valuable almost any business, and it's one of the primary things that one would look at in an acquisition. There--there are multiple reasons that we might buy a company. Sometimes we're trying to buy some technology or some IP. Sometimes it's a talent acquisition. But the most common cases market position, that the company has traction with the customers, they've built a service. Maybe they were the first mover. There could be any number of reasons why they have that market position. But that's a very common reason to acquire a company. </p><p>RASKIN: Well, once a company becomes dominant in a market, it can favor its own products and services. Alexa enabled smart speakers make up over 60 percent of the smart-speaker market. Mr. Bezos, when I ask Alexa to play my favorite song, Prime Music is the default music player. Is that right? </p><p>BEZOS: If you're--I think that's true if you're a Prime member, yes.  </p><p>RASKIN: And a New York Times report found that when users say, Alexa, buy batteries, Alexa responds would you like to buy double A Amazon basic batteries. So, has Alexa ever been trained to favor Amazon products when users a shop by voice? </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired, but the witness may answer the question. </p><p>BEZOS: I--I--I don't know if it's been trained in that way. I'm sure there are cases where we--we do promote our own products, which is of course a common practice in business. And I--you know, so I--it wouldn't surprise me if Alexa sometimes does promote our own products. </p><p>RASKIN: Thank you and I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The--the chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gaetz, for five minutes. </p><p>GAETZ: Mr. Pichai, during our prior discussion earlier today, you said that Google doesn't work with the Chinese military. That answer was deceptive because Google works with many of the entities that work with the Chinese military in common collaboration. And--and just as one example would be Tsinghua University, where Jeff Dean, who is the head of Google AI, served on the computer science advisory committee for the university, and then the university takes nearly $15 million from China's essential military commission. So, you can see how even if you don't literally show up at the offices of the Chinese military, if you're all showing up at the same place, working together on AI, that would lead to my concern. </p><p>But I--I want to talk about search because that's an area where I know Google has real market dominance. On December 11th, you testified to the Judiciary Committee. And in response to a question from my colleague, Zoe Lofgren, about search, you said we don't manually intervene on any particular search results. But leaked memos obtained by the Daily Caller show that that isn't true. In fact, those memos were altered December 3rd, just a week before your testimony. </p><p>And they describe a deceptive news blacklist and a process for developing that black west--list approved by Ben Gomes, who leads search with your company, and also something called a--a fringe ranking, which seems to beg the question, you know, who gets to decide what's fringe. And--and in your answer, you know, you said to Ms. Lofgren that there is no manual intervention of search. That was your testimony. </p><p>But--and now I'm going to cite specifically from this memo from the Daily Caller. It says--or that the--I'm sorry, that the Daily Caller obtained from your company. It says the beginning of the workflow starts when a website is placed on a watchlist. It continues, this watchlist is maintained and stored by Aeries with access restricted to policy and enforcement specialists. It sort of does beg the question who these enforcement specialists are. Access to the listing can also be shared on a need to know basis to enforce or enrich the policy violations. The investigation of the watchlist is done in the tool Athena, the Aeries manual review tool. </p><p>So--so, you said to Congresswoman Lofgren that there was no manual review tool, and then your documents indicate that there is a manual review tool. So, help us understand the inconsistency. </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, there are two parts to this. In general, you know, we algorithmically approach our search results. We have robust policies to do so. And we test it both with user feedback and we use raters to validate. Last year alone, we ran over 300,000 experiments and launched around 3,000 improvements to search. And we don't manually tune. The question last time was in the context of is there someone behind the curtain, you know, manually tuning an individual search result. We don't. We generally approach it algorithmically. </p><p>We, however, in order to comply with the law in every country we operate in, for example, there may be an actor or a website identified as interfering in elections, and we then have to put that site on a--on the list so that that doesn't appear in our search results against queries. So, other examples would be violent extremism, (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>GAETZ: --And is that done manually, Mr. Pichai? That--that process you described, is that done manually? </p><p>PICHAI: And--and we could get reports from law enforcement agencies. You know, we are complying with our--it's a known DMCA-based copyright violation. </p><p>GAETZ: There is either a manual component or there is not a manual component. Which is it? </p><p>PICHAI: For--for creating those lists, that process can involve manual portions too. </p><p>GAETZ: Okay, great. Well, that--that is sort of the concern that I have. You've now said something different today than you said to Ms. Lofgren, because you've--you've confessed that there is a manual components to the way in which you blacklist content. And it--it seems to be no coincidence that it's sites like Gateway Pundit, the Western Journal, American Spectator, Daily Caller, and Breitbart that received the ire or the negative treatment as a consequence of your manual tooling and it also seems noteworthy that whistleblowers at your own company have spoken out. You said that one of the reasons you maintain this manual tool is to stop election interference. I believe it is in fact your company that is engaging in election interference. And it's not just my view. </p><p>Mike Wacker came out and was a whistleblower indicating that that may blacklist targets that Google specifically goes after those who support President Trump, who held a conservative viewpoint, and--and he left your company in 20--2019 because he was speaking out against these outraged mobs. So you can you see how when you empower individuals, some of the same individuals that Project Veritas has exposed as labeling people as terrorists, who say make America great again or who support the president that that in fact can be the very election interference that we are concerned about and that you're using your market dominance and in search to accomplish that collection interference? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, with respect, I strongly disagree with that characterization. We don't approach this work with any political viewpoint. We do that to comply with law, known copyright violations, very narrow circumstances and we have to do--to comply with the law. And in many cases, those requests can come from law enforcement agencies (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>GAETZ: Your own employees are saying you doing it for different reason </p><p>CICILLINE: --The time of the gentleman-- </p><p>GAETZ: --Your own employees are saying it's political-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Has expired-- </p><p>GAETZ: --Bias. I yield back-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Thank you. Mr.-- </p><p>GAETZ: --I'm sorry. May I be recognized for a unanimous consent request? </p><p>CICILLINE: Yes. </p><p>GAETZ: Mr. Chairman, I--just given the productivity of our discussion, I request that we be permitted a third round of questioning. </p><p>CICILLINE: Without objection. I now recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Nadler. </p><p>NADLER: Yeah. You know, the--the documents prove the news and journalism industry in this country are in an economic freefall. Over 200 counties in America no longer have a local newspaper and tens of thousands of journalists have been laid off in recent years. The reason journalism is in freewill is that Google and Facebook now capture the vast majority of digital ad revenue. </p><p>Although news publishers produce valuable content, it is Google and Facebook that increasingly profit off that content. Publishers have told us that Google and Facebook maintain their dominance in these markets in part through anticompetitive conduct as well as conflict of interest. Mr. Zuckerberg, in 2015, Facebook reported high and quickly growing rates of video viewership on its platform. Based on these metrics, whose publishers fired hundreds of journalists choosing instead to boost their video division. </p><p>In 2018, it was discovered that Facebook had inflated these metrics and had known about the inaccuracies several years before Facebook publicly disclosed to this. Mr. Zuckerberg, did you know that these metrics were inflated before they were publicly released? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, no. I did not. And we regret that mistake and have put in place a number of other measures since then to make sure that we </p><p>NADLER: And you realize--and do you realize the harm that this caused journalists across the country? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I--I certainly know how important it is that the metrics that we report our--are accurate and we put in place additional measures to make sure we can audit those. </p><p>NADLER: And what do you have to say to the journalists who've lost their jobs because of Facebook's deception? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well Congressman, I disagree with that characterization and also your description of what-- </p><p>NADLER: --Reclaiming my time, Google meanwhile maintains its dominance in part through aggregating data from across its products and services. Mr. Pichai, I understand that Google collects user data on users browsing activities through its Chrome browser. Does Google use that data for its own purposes either in advertising or to develop and refine its algorithm? </p><p>PICHAI: Mr. Chairman, we--we do use data to improve our products and services for our users. Anytime we do it, we believe in giving users choice, control, and transparency. We make it very clear and we give them simply simplified settings to choose how they like their data to be used. </p><p>NADLER: And--and so you use--you do use the data that you get from--from these companies for your purposes? </p><p>PICHAI: My understanding was whether we use data in general to improve our products and services and, you know, we do use data to show ads, but we give users the choice. They can turn ads personalization on or off and-- </p><p>NADLER: --Now this--this obviously--the use of this data from all these--from all these companies gives you a tremendous advantage over them and over any competitor. Does the ability to make money in any way affect Google's algorithm in terms of what news appears in atypical users search results? </p><p>PICHAI: The way we'd rank our search results, you know, we don't take into account commercial relationships that we have. </p><p>NADLER: Okay, but Facebook and Google have gravely threatened journalism in the United States. Reporters have been fired, local newspapers have been shut down, and now we hear that Google and Facebook are making money over what news the American--they let the American people see. This is a very dangerous situation and, unfortunately, I--my time is expired and I have to yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I think the judgment for each building. I now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Steube for five minutes. </p><p>STEUBE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm just going to pick up where I left off. Mr. Pichai, there--there are rioting groups that are going contract with the posting of what I would contend is a very violent video. Yet yesterday, I was sent a YouTube video about doctors discussing hydrochloriquine [sic] and discussing the not dangerous of children returning to school. And when I clicked on the link, it was taken down and then I was sent a different light on YouTube and it was taken down. </p><p>I just checked again to just make sure and it says that this video has been removed for violating YouTube's community guidelines. How can doctors giving their opinion on a drug that they think is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 and doctors who think it's appropriate for children to return back to school violate YouTube's community guidelines when all of these videos of violence is posted on YouTube? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we--we believe in freedom of expression and there is a lot of debate on YouTube about effective ways to deal with COVID. We allow robust debate, but in the area during a pandemic, we look to local authorities. So for example, in the U.S. it would be CDC, for guidelines around medical misinformation in a narrow way, which could cause harm in the real world. And--and so for example, if there is aspects of a video and if it explicitly states something could be a proven cure and that doesn't meet CDC guidelines, you know, we would remove that video </p><p>STEUBE: It--it's free expression of speech and you have these doctors who are giving their opinion as doctors. And I don't understand why YouTube and therefore Google thinks it's appropriate to silence physicians and their opinion of what can help and cure people with COVID-19. </p><p>I'm going to switch quickly to Mr. Zuckerberg. I think at this point it's fairly obvious that technology platforms have been stifling conservative news and opinions. You employ a panel of content moderators. Can you explain how Facebook chooses who these moderators are? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Thanks, Congressman. We--we do hire a lot of people around the world to work on--on safety and security. We--our team is--is more than 30 or 35,000 people working on that now. We certainly try to do this in a way that--that is--is neutral to all viewpoints. We wanted to be a platform for all ideas. </p><p>I don't think you build--a social product with the goal of giving people a voice if you don't believe that people being able to express a wide variety of things is ultimately valuable for the world. And we try to make sure that our policies and our operations ultimately reflect and carry that out. </p><p>STEUBE: Is there an ideological diversity amongst the content moderators? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I don't think we choose to hire them on the basis of an ideology. There are--there have it all over the world. This is certainly a bunch in the U.S. They--there's diversity and where they are hired, but certainly, we don't want to have any--any bias in what we do and we wouldn't tolerate it if we discovered that. </p><p>STEUBE: So you don't specifically hire, say, conservative moderators and Democratic or liberal moderators so that there is a balance in your content moderators? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, in terms of the 30 to 35,000 people or more and more at this point you are doing safety and security review, that is correct. In terms of the people setting the policies, I think it is valuable to have people with a diversity of viewpoints involved so we can make sure that we have the different viewpoints represented in the policy development process. And we also consult with number a number of outside groups whenever we--we develop new policies to make sure that we are taking into account all perspectives. </p><p>STEUBE: What are some of those outside groups that would be conservative leaning? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I--I needed to get back to you with the--with a list of specific groups, but it would depend on what the topic is. That was talked about </p><p>STEUBE: Yeah, can you just--can you just think of one? I mean, you said you--you-- </p><p>STEUBE: --Reach out to outside groups can you think of one Conservative outside group that you reach out to and use as a content moderator? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman I'm--I'm talking about different external stakeholders and groups that are inputs to our--our policy development process. And I'm not involved in those conversations directly so I would have to get back to you with--with specifics on that. But I am quite confident that we speak with people across the ideological spectrum when we're developing our policies. </p><p>STEUBE: I would very much appreciate a follow up on that. Real quickly can you briefly explain the approval process for third party fact checkers? And how many fact checkers does Facebook employ? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes. Thanks. We work with about 70 fact checking partners around the world. And the goal of the program is to limit the distribution of viral hoaxes. So things that are--are clearly false from--from getting a--a lot of distribution. But we don't ourselves want to be in the business of determining what is true and what is false. That feels like an inappropriate role for us to play. </p><p>We rely on an organization called the--the Poynter or--institute and--the--I think it's called the--the independent fact checking organization. That has a set of guidelines of--of what makes an independent fact checker. And they certify those fact checkers. And then any organization that gets certification from that group is qualified to be a--a fact checking partner within Facebook. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. The gentleman's time is expired. We're gonna rec--I'm gonna recognize Mr. Johnson for five minutes and then we're gonna take a short break of the committee. Mr. Johnson you're recognized. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bezos, Amazon has a significant problem with counterfeit products being sold on its platform. Counterfeit products not only rip off the owners of legitimate businesses, they also can be dangerous. Counterfeit medicine, baby food, automobile tires, and other products can kill. Amazon has said it's fissing--it's fitzing--fixing its counterfeit problem but counterfeiting seems to be getting worse not better. </p><p>Amazon is a trillion dollar company, but Amazon customers are not guaranteed that the products purchased on your platform are authentic. Amazon acts like it's not responsible for counterfeits being sold by third party sellers on its platform, and we've heard that Amazon puts the burden and cost on brand owners to police Amazon's site, even though Amazon makes money when a counterfeit good is sold on its site. </p><p>More than half of Amazon's sales come from third party seller accounts. Why isn't Amazon more aggressive in ensuring that counterfeit goods are not sold on its platform and why isn't Amazon responsible for keeping all counterfeit products off of its platform? </p><p>BEZOS: Thank you. This is an incredibly important issue and one that we work very hard on. Counterfeits are a scourge. They are a problem that is not--it does not help us earn trust with customers. It's bad for customers. It's bad for honest third party sellers. </p><p>We do a lot to prevent counterfeiting. We have a team of more than 1,000 people that does this. We invest hundreds of millions of dollars in systems that do this. We have something called project zero which helps brands serialize individual products which really helps with counterfeiting-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --But--but--I'm glad that you have those-- </p><p>BEZOS: --We have other programs as well-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --I'm glad that you have those features in place but why isn't Amazon responsible for keeping all counterfeit products off of its platform? </p><p>BEZOS: We certainly work to do so, Congressman. And we--and we do so not just for our own retail products but for third party products as well-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Well oh--okay. Well thank you-- </p><p>BEZOS: --And we do work closely with brands-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --We've--we've--we've heard from numerous third party sellers and brand owners that Amazon has used knock-offs as leverage to pressure sellers to do what Amazon wants. For example, the founder of PopSockets testified in January that Amazon itself was selling knock-offs of its product. After reporting the problem it was only after his company committed to spending two million dollars on advertisements that Amaz--that Amazon appears to have stopped diverting sales to these knockoffs. </p><p>What is your explanation for that business practice? </p><p>BEZOS: That's unacceptable. If--if that--if those are the facts and that if some--if someone somewhere inside Amazon said--you know--buy x dollars in ads and then we'll help you with your counterfeit problem, that is unacceptable. And I will look into that and--and we'll get back to your office with that. </p><p>What I can tell you is that the--we have a counterfeit crimes unit. We attempt to prosecute counterfeiters. I would encourage this body to pass stricter penalties for counterfeiters and to increase law enforcement resources to go after counterfeiters. Because they are bad actors-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --But your company does make money off of counterfeit goods being sold on your platform. Isn't that correct? </p><p>BEZOS: If it does in my view sir it would only be in the short term. We ma--we don't ma--I--I would much rather lose a sale than lose a customer-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Alright-- </p><p>BEZOS: --We make money because a customer comes back-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Fair--fair--fair enough sir. Making companies pay extra to avoid having their products disappear in rankings seems to be so unfair especially to small businesses. The American dream is threatened when that happens. Don't you think so? </p><p>BEZOS: Sir I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to. If you're talking about what we were just talking about a second ago I agree completely-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --No, I'm talking about a totally different-- </p><p>BEZOS: --That's unacceptable-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Totally different situation-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Okay-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Now where a company that is selling on your platform but is not paying anything extra gets buried in the rankings and--but companies that pay extra are able to get their products pushed up and they avoid getting pushed down. Is that an acceptable practice? </p><p>BEZOS: Sir, I think what you're referring to is the fact that we offer a--a--an advertising service basically for third party sellers to drive additional promotion to their products. That's a voluntary program. Some sellers use it, some don't. And it's been very effective at helping people promote their products. </p><p>JOHNSON: With that I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. The committee will stand for--in brief recess. </p><p>[*](RECESS) </p><p>CICILLINE: There we go. The committee will come to order. I recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Demings, for five minutes. </p><p>UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CICILLINE: I recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong from his for five minutes. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bezos, earlier my colleague brought up what I think is an important issue and they were discussing Amazon's stated policy against using third-party seller information to inform business decisions regarding Amazon's private-label brands. Ms. Jayapal specifically noted that possible loophole that allows Amazon to reviewed nonpublic aggregate data to inform product brands even in instances where there are only a few third-party sellers. I just wanted to drill down on that just a little more. Where exactly does Amazon draw the line? </p><p>BEZOS: I'm sorry, aggregate data would be in more than one seller. And of course you have to remember that the person seeing the report would have no way of knowing how many sellers are inside that group, you know, with the breakdown would be. Between the sellers. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: So-- </p><p>BEZOS: --I would remind you it's not that different from perhaps a bestseller list or product ranking, which we do make it public for all. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: And I just want to be clear, does Amazon allow the use of aggregate data to inform private label Amazon brands when there are only three sellers for product? </p><p>BEZOS: Yes, sir. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Does Amazon look at aggregate data when there are only two sellers of the product? </p><p>BEZOS: Yes, sir. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: So--and--and am I correct in my understanding that Amazon is conducting an internal investigation on the use of third-party data? </p><p>BEZOS: Yes, were basically trying to understand some of the anecdotes that we saw in the Wall Street Journal article. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Will you commit to informing this committee on the outcome of that investigation, including on the exact circumstances of when Amazon is allowed to view and/or use aggregate data? </p><p>BEZOS: Yes--yes, we will do that. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Now want to move--just really quick, I--music can be used to drive revenue. And obviously, there's a reason it's important and want to talk about Twitch for a second. News reports have indicated that Twitch users are receiving notice and takedown requests pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. My understanding is that--is that Twitch allows users to stream music but does not license the music. Is that correct? </p><p>BEZOS: I--I'm going to have to ask that I could get back to your office with an answer to that question. I don't know. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Okay and then--well--so that would be great. And then--so my--I just have two more questions related to that. If Twitch is responding to DMCA notice and takedown requirements, should we--should one, Twitch consider proactive licensing music instead of retroactively adhering to those notices? So these are the questions we're interested in. I'm primarily concerned about small up and coming musicians, different people that aren't necessarily labels to make it as easy for them to at least get a cease and desist notices out as well and as we continue to move forward there. </p><p>BEZOS: Yes, congressman. That is--that's an important issue and I understand it and we will get--I will get back to office on that. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: All right. Earlier this year, Google announced plans to retire a third-party cookies that websites attached to users browsers. And this allows users to track--to be tracked across the Internet. A consequence of that change is that it will put other digital advertising market participants at a disadvantage because they can no longer track users. </p><p>Now the--at the very, very dangerous being pro cookie, because I'm not when I use my computer as well, but--and I understand that there are legitimate privacy concern with third-party cookies, but I do want to focus on the competition aspect. Did this asset--action also plays Google at a disadvantage where does Google have alternative means of collecting that user data to and inform its digital advertising activities, Mr. Pichai? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, as you rightly pointed out, this is an area where we have focused on user privacy and users clearly don't want to be tracked third-party cookies. In fact, other browser vendors, including from Apple and Mozilla foundation have also implement it these changes. </p><p>We are doing it thoughtfully, giving time for the industry to adapt as we know publishers depend on revenue in this area. But it's an important change and I think we have to be focused on privacy to drive the change forward. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: But you have other ways of collecting that information, correct? </p><p>PICHAI: On our first party services, you know, we don't rely on cookies. And obviously, one people come and type into search, to give an example-- </p><p>ARMSTRONG: --I'm not asking you if you rely on cookies. I'm asking you if you have other ways of collecting it through Gmail or consumer facing platforms, right? </p><p>PICHAI: We don't use data from Gmail for ads, commerce men, but to the extent of the services we provide ads and, you know, if users have consented to ads, personalization, yes, we do have a data. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentle lady from Florida, Ms. Demings for five minutes. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zuckerberg, during discussions of changing Facebook's platform policy in 2012, you said that, and I quote, \"In any model, I'm assuming we enforce our policies against competitors much more strongly.\" It sounds like Facebook recognizes its policies to target competitors. Why would Facebook enforce its policies against competitors more strongly? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, when we were a much smaller company we saw-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --This is 2012 now. This was in 2012, so please, go right ahead. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Sure. We've had policies in the past that have prevented our competitors, which at the time were primarily worried about larger competitors from using our platforms to grow and compete with us. So we--we had some of those policies. We continually review them over time and in-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg, in 2013-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --Since then, we-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --A senior Facebook employee identified MessageMe as a fast-growing out on Facebook and said that we will restrict their access. Was this another example of enforcing Facebook's policies against competitors much more strongly? MessageMe. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I'm not familiar with that specific example, but we--we did have that policy. We-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --Okay, let's move to another one and see if you remember this one-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --(INAUDIBLE) since then and change the policy-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --In 2014, other Facebook product managers openly discussed removing Pinterest's access to Facebook's platform tools. As one employee said, \"I am 100 percent in favor of the idea of moving it from Pinterest, but I am not recommending removing it from Netflix going forward.\" Why would Facebook product managers want to restrict Pinterest's access to Facebook, but not Netflix? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I'm--I'm not familiar with that exchange. I don't think I was on that. </p><p>DEMINGS: Why you think they--you wouldn't have to be on that, but why do you think they made that decision? Or would make a decision like that? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well congresswoman, as I said, we used to have a policy that restricted competitors from using our platform and Pinterest is social competitor with us. It's one of the many competitors that are valuable-- </p><p>DEMINGS: --Okay, alright-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --That allow people to share different types of (INAUDIBLE) with our community-- </p><p>DEMINGS: Mr. Zuckerberg, these examples and supporting documents strongly suggested that Facebook does weaponize its policy--platform policies, enforcing them selectively to undermine competitors. But let's move on. </p><p>Mr. Cook, I am concerned that Apple's policies are also picking winners and losers in the Economy and that Apple rules mean Apple apps always win. Mr. Cook, in 2019, Apple removed from the Apple Store certain apps that help parents control their children's devices. Do you remember what justification Apple cited? </p><p>COOK: Yes, Congressman--Congresswoman, I do. It was that the--the use of technology called MDM, mobile device management placed kids' data at risk. As we were worried about the safety of kids. </p><p>DEMINGS: Okay, all right. So you were concerned about that the app basically undermined kids privacy. But another applet used this same tool was Apture, an app owned by the Saudi Arabian government. Do you recall what Apple's position on this app? </p><p>COOK: I am not familiar with that app. </p><p>DEMINGS: Okay. Apple allowed this Saudi app to remain, so there are two types of apps that use the same tool, Apple kicks one out and said that that was help--one that was helping parents but keeps the one owned by a powerful government. If that is correct, Mr. Cook (INAUDIBLE) supposedly did the same thing why do you--why would you keep the one owned by a powerful government? </p><p>COOK: I--I would like to look into this and get back with your office. </p><p>DEMINGS: It sounds like you applied different rules to the same apps. </p><p>COOK: We--we apply the rules to all developers evenly. </p><p>DEMINGS: Do the fact that Apple had its own-- </p><p>COOK: We were--we were-- </p><p>DEMINGS: Mr. Cook, let me just ask you, does the fact that Apple had its own parental control apps that were competing with these third-party apps contribute to Apple's decision to kick them off the Apple Store? Mr. Cook, what do you think about that? </p><p>COOK: It--it did not. There's over 30 parental controls on the App Store today, so there's plenty of competition in this area, and I would point out that this is not an area where Apple gets any revenue at all. We do this because-- </p><p>DEMINGS: Mr. Cook, I did then ask anything about revenue, that was not my question, but I am out of time, and thank you so much, Mr. Chair. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Think the gentlelady for yielding back. I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Jordan, for five minutes. </p><p>JORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would yield to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gaetz. </p><p>GAETZ: I think the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Zuckerberg just as Mr. Pichai gave prior testimony to Congress saying there was an editorial manipulation on their platform you have previously given testimony to Congress saying that there is not editorial manipulation that disadvantages conservatives stand just like in the case of Google there have been whistleblowers from Facebook that not only have offered evidence indicating your testimony was not truthful, but there is even video that suggest that content moderators that you employ are out there disadvantaging conservative content. I am wondering if you are familiar with the experiences of Zach McElroy and Ryan Hartwig, two people who participated in Facebook content review and--and what is your response to the very damning video evidence and the testimony from them that the culture that you lead within Facebook is one that disadvantages conservatives and leads to content manipulation? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman I--I am somewhat familiar with the concerns that they have raised stand as--as I have said we came to be a platform for all ideas, we got into this because we want to give everyone a voice. I certainly do not want our platforms to be run in a way that has in the ideological bias, and I want people to be able to discuss a range of issues. When people raise concerns like that, we do look into them to make sure that everyone in our operation is behaving and upholding the standards that we would like, and if the behavior that they cited it is true, then that would be unacceptable in our operation. </p><p>GAETZ: And--and following the release of those videos and that evidence from project Veritas will you then describe the investigation that Facebook undertook to root out these--these very corrosive effects on your platform? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman I would have to get back to you with more details on that, but I know that we have ongoing training in what we do and we certainly will look into any complaints that come up, and we want to make sure and how we run the content review teams that it is done in a way that reflects the values of the company are around giving (INAUDIBLE) voice and being a platform for all ideas. </p><p>GAETZ: I am concerned that the content review does reflect the values of the company but those values don't, in fact, give everyone a voice, they prejudice against certain content, and while I appreciate training as a prophylactic endeavor to try to guide future content it seems disingenuous for you to suggest that these videos come out that are very damning that showed the people that you trust with content moderation admitting on video that they disadvantage conservatives, that they labeled people who support the President as a way to push down their content and limit the reach of that content for you then to come to us many months later after that was all over the news and the Internet and say well, you know you will get back to us, and you do a little training. It seems to suggest that you don't take these allegations and this evidence very seriously and so I will ask the question perhaps in a different way. Would you revise your prior--in your prior testimony to energy and commerce you said this do</p><p>es not happen, it cannot happen. Would you at least be willing to acknowledge based on the irrefutable evidence before us that you don't seem to have investigated that it is possible that at Facebook your employees do have the power to disadvantage conservative viewpoints and that they, in fact, have used that power in ways that we need to root out? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, my testimony in the past and today, is about what our principles are as a company and what we try to do. Of course, when you have tens of thousands of employees people make mistakes, people have some of their own goals some of the time, and it is our job in running the company to make sure that we minimize errors and that we make sure that the company's operations reflect the principles that we intend to run it on. </p><p>GAETZ: And when you fire people as a consequence of their politics, do you think that that impacts the culture and perhaps empower some of the content moderators to also treat people worse as a consequence of their politics? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I--I am not sure what you are referring to, but I am not aware of any case where we have fired someone on behalf of their--their politics and I would say that that would be an inappropriate thing for us to do. </p><p>GAETZ: Why did you fire Palmer Luckey? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I am not sure it's appropriate to get into a specific personnel issue publicly. </p><p>GAETZ: I mean, I could just tell you that Palmer Lucky NDA with you--I only have 10 seconds, but Palmer Lucky's NDA with you doesn't allow him to talk to anyone except government officials. I am a government official. I have seen the messages where you have specific specifically directed Mr. lucky to make statements regarding his politics for the benefit of your company, so I think both in the case of these content moderators and in the case of the testimony you just gave regarding Mr. lucky and firing people over there politics there is serious question as to whether or not you are giving truthful testimony here or whether it's lying before Congress. I see my time has expired, and I will you back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Scanlon. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pichai, I wanted to focus a little bit on Google's acquisition of YouTube and some of the consequences of that move for consumer privacy and competition. Now Google purchased YouTube in 2006 after identifying it as a potential rival that could eventually draw business away from Google, and it is my understanding Google paid $1.65 billion for that acquisition, nearly 30 times its original bid of $15 million so could you tell us why Google was willing to pay so much more beyond the initial proposed bid and was this as a result of any analysis on the harm Google would suffer if a competitor had purchased YouTube? </p><p>PICHAI: Congresswoman, we acquired YouTube in 2006, and this was well before my time there as CEO, and I wasn't directly involved, but you know what I do recall at the time is that we saw it as a newly emerging area and our mission is to help users with information. We saw an opportunity, and it wasn't clear YouTube only had 67 people-- </p><p>SCANLON: Okay. Was Mr. Page in charge of that decision? </p><p>PICHAI: Congresswoman, I wasn't-- </p><p>SCANLON: Or you don't know? </p><p>PICHAI: --I wasn't directly involved, but I am pretty sure our senior leadership team at that time definitely looked into it. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay, we--I would encourage the subcommittee to take the steps necessary to have us here from whoever it was in charge of that. </p><p>Moving on Google is now by far the top online site where Americans watch videos including children's videos and as I am sure you are aware federal law prohibits companies from collecting data on children under 13 however just last year the Federal Trade Commission found that Google had spent years knowingly collecting data on children under 13 on YouTube and offering advertisers the ability to target those children directly. Mr. Pichai, did you to use the data it illegally acquired to improve its ability to target ads to children? </p><p>PICHAI: We are--you know this is an area you know I take it very seriously I am a parent too. We have committed, we have invested tremendously. We have a dedicated product for kids in YouTube kids on the main you to platform. We make sure we have clear policies, we enforce them vigorously just in Q4 of 2019 we flagged and removed almost close to 1 million videos potentially for concerns are round child safety so it is an area we are investing rigorously and--and will continue to do so. </p><p>SCANLON: Well, I am more concerned about the fact that you are investing rigorously in luring in advertisers like toymakers Mattel and Hasbro by telling them that YouTube is the number one website regularly visited by kids. So, that sounds like you're targeting the kids and then targeting advertisers to--to bring them on board. Is that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: Today in the main site of YouTube, we don't allow anyone under 13 to create accounts. There are scenarios in which there could be family viewing, and--and today there are creators who create content oriented towards families. And--and as part of that, there are advertisers which are interested in connecting with those users. But everything we do here, we obviously comply with all the--all the applicable regulations. And-- </p><p>SCANLON: --Okay-- </p><p>PICHAI: --And its-- </p><p>SCANLON: --Well, let's look at some of the--some of the content that is specifically for children. COPA makes it illegal to target those kids, but--but we've got an issue where content creators are in a very difficult position now. So, if a show like Sesame Street doesn't want to show ads for junk food on YouTube, does YouTube allow it to make that choice? </p><p>PICHAI: Today, we--we do--you know, we--we have choices both for creators in terms of, you know, tools and preferences, and we have extensive tools for advertisers. And above all, for users we get the choice. They can either use YouTube as a subscription service without seeing those types of ads, or, you know, they can use it for free with ads. So, we give choice. And--and you know, for us, it is of utmost importance that YouTube is a place where people come to learn. And, you know, we find increasingly small and medium businesses use YouTube to thrive, especially even during COVID, particularly many-- </p><p>SCANLON: --Okay-- </p><p>PICHAI: --Many business will-- </p><p>SCANLON: --Let's go back to content that's designed for children. So, you know, if there's an organization like Sesame Street that wants to provide child centered content but they don't want that content to be sullied, shall we say, with junk food ads or something, my understanding is that you say that the content creators can do that. But we got a recent report from the Wall Street Journal that says YouTube hasn't been honoring those requests, and it's been making it difficult for independent auditing companies like Open Slate to independently audit that and then report back to those content creators about whether or not YouTube is--is honoring those. Is that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: I'm not familiar with the particular report, but I'm happy to understand it better and, you know, have my office follow up with your staff, congresswoman. </p><p>SCANLON: I would appreciate that. And my time is expired. I yield back. </p><p>NEGUSE: The gentlewoman yields back. The chair now recognizes himself for five minutes. Mr. Bezos, thank you for being here today. In your opening statement, you reviewed your written testimony. You indicated, and I'll just quote, that \"Amazon accounts for less than 1 percent of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than 4 percent of retail in the U.S.\" When--end quote--when you refer to retail, I take it, based on the empirical studies I reviewed, you're referring to a broad definition of retail that includes restaurants, bars, gas stations. So, it's a fairly all-encompassing view of retail. I--I wonder if you know what percentage of Amazon's sales are representative the terms of online retail sales, the e-commerce market stream. </p><p>BEZOS: The figures I've seen for--you know, I--I don't--with all respect, I don't accept that e-commerce is a different market. But as a different channel, what I've seen is sort of 30 percent to 40 percent is the outside studies that I've seen were Amazon's share of that e-commerce channel. </p><p>NEGUSE: And that's--that's consistent with the--the data that I have seen. The--the-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Okay-- </p><p>NEGUSE: --The latest figure I saw was 40 percent. And so, in terms of how we define it, whether it's a stream or a channel, nonetheless I do think that, you know, is--factually it's important. It's an important distinction that I want to make sure we clear here. </p><p>Obviously, I suspect you understand more than most that--the early stages of a startup where entrepreneurs are undertaking risks to bring their products and services to market. Over the course of our investigation, we have are directly from startups who rely on Amazon services, and that includes, obviously, Representative Jayapal's questions, Representative Buck, my colleague from Colorado, with respect to concerns about the way in which Amazon uses confidential information. </p><p>But we've also heard that not just with respect to the marketplace, but Amazon's cloud-computing arm, AWS, the notion that that computing arm essentially identifies startups' best technologies and rolls out replica products and services. So, Mr. Bezos, does Amazon use confidential information that companies share via AWS to build competing services? </p><p>BEZOS: No, sir, not that I'm aware of. AWS does often--you know, they do keep expanding their services. AWS started, you know, what, 15 years ago? We invented this entire-- </p><p>NEGUSE: --Let--let me-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Category. </p><p>NEGUSE: Let me just clarify that, Mr. Bezos. I appreciate that. Sorry, I apologize for interrupting. But last week, one of Amazon's former engineers posted online that he and his team \"proactively identify growing businesses on AWS, that they build competing products, and that they targeted those products to the business's customers.\" And there's been public reporting on that strategy. So, I guess I wonder if you can comment on that and how you would account for--for those statements. </p><p>BEZOS: Well, I think there may be categories--I know some databases of different kinds and so on where we see that it's an important product for customers and we make our own product offering in that arena. And--but it doesn't mean we stop servicing the--the other companies that are also making those products. We have competitors using AWS, and we work very hard to make them successful. Netflix is one example, Hulu is another, and so on. </p><p>NEGUSE: I think the concern, Mr. Bezos, with respect, is that the pattern emerges across the different components in Amazon, whether it's the marketplace or--or whether it's the cloud services I mentioned. In addition, there was an article, I'm sure you're aware, in the Wall Street Journal regarding the Alexa fund, that according to news reports, Amazon's venture capital fund, the Alexa fund, had invested in a number of different companies. I believe you're familiar with the Alexa fund investing, for example, in DefinedCrowd Corp. Does that ring a bell? </p><p>BEZOS: No, sir. I'm afraid it doesn't. </p><p>NEGUSE: Okay. Well, I'll represent to you, according to the Wall Street Journal, and I'll just quote from them. \"When Amazon, Incorporated's venture capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd Corp., a gain access to the technology startups finances and other confidential information. Nearly 4 years later, in April, Amazon's cloud-computing unit launched an artificial intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does,\" said DefinedCrowd founder and Chief Executive Daniel Braga. Does that refresh your recollection? And are you aware of those allegations? </p><p>BEZOS: I read that article, but I didn't remember that piece of it. I--I apologize for that. I don't know the specifics of that situation, and I would be happy to get back to your office with more information about that. </p><p>NEGUSE: Well, I would appreciate it. I--I certainly would welcome that. And to the extent that you all can follow up with the subcommittee with--with respect to this particular article and the different episodes that are referenced, both in terms of DefinedCrowd Corp., there's also another company called Nucleus that you may be familiar with. </p><p>The reason why I asked these questions, the reason why it matters, Mr. Bezos, to me is that we are very concerned about this innovation kill zone that seems to be emerging. I represent Boulder and Fort Collins, two of the fastest-growing and most innovative tech hubs in the country. And entrepreneurs in founders share their stories with this committee during one of our field hearings, actually a field hearing that we helped at the University of Colorado Law School just earlier this year. And they are extremely dependent on big technology firms, including in terms of investment in capital, yet they live in constant fear that the platforms can steal their core technologies or ideas, making it impossible to compete because of those existing advantages. </p><p>So, I--I see my time is expired, but we will certainly be following up with respect to the episodes that are referenced. And with that, I would yield back. The gentlemen's time is expired. And the gentlewoman from Georgia, Ms. McBath, is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Cook, Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014. And at that time, Sheryl Sandberg told the board that the deal was critical for countering the App Store power of Apple and Google, who choke off Facebook's access to--to mobile devices. Was Sheryl Sandberg correct? Does Apple have the power to exclude apps from the App Store? </p><p>COOK: If you look at the history of this, congresswoman, we've increased the number of apps from 500 to 1.7 million. So, there is a very wide gate for the App Store. And there is a fierce competition for developers, and we want every app we can on the platform. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. So--but, Mr. Cook, then what you're saying is that Apple can exclude apps from the App Store. In fact, it has. In 2018, Apple introduced an app called Screen Time, which helps people limit the amount of time they or their kids spend on their iPhones. Is that correct? </p><p>COOK: It sounds right. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. But before Screen Time existed, there were other apps in the App Store that gave parents control over their kids phone usage, apps like OurPact and Kidslox, and parents dependent on them. Soon after you introduced Screen Time, however, you removed these competing apps from the App Store. </p><p>One mother wrote to Apple saying, and I quote her, \"I am deeply disappointed that you have decided to remove this app and others like it, thereby reducing consumer access to much-needed services to keep children safe and protect their mental health and well-being.\" Mr. Cook, why did Apple remove competing apps right after you released Screen Time? </p><p>COOK: We were concerned, congresswoman, but the privacy and security of kids. The technology that was being used at that time was called MDM, and it had the ability to sort of take over the kid's screen and a third party could--could see it. And so, we were worried about their safety. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. </p><p>COOK: Today we have-- </p><p>MCBATH: --I appreciate that. But the timing of the removal seems very coincidental. If Apple wasn't attempting to harm competitors in order to help its own app-- </p><p>[*]MCBATH: why did Phil Schiller, who runs the App Store promote the ScreenTime app to customers who complained about the removal of rival parental control apps? </p><p>COOK: Congressman, I can't see those this email. I'm sorry, my eyes are not good enough to--to read it. But I'd seek ScreenTime is just an alternative, but there are over 30 parental control apps there in the App Store today. So there is vibrant competition for parental controls out there. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. Well, Mr. Cook, the fact is that Apple sidelined Screen Time's competition by keeping them out of App Store. And while Apple claims these competitors were meeting apples privacy standards, these app creators say that you admitted them back in six months later without requiring significant privacy changes and, of course, six months is truly an eternity for small businesses to be shut down. Even worse, if ever while a larger competitor is actually taking away customers. </p><p>And you know, this is not the first time something like this seems to have happened, Mr. Cook. Let me give you another example, you know, of the harm that's been caused to your competitors. In 2010, Apple introduced an online bookstore called the iBookstore where it offered e-books and the only major publisher that didn't agree to joint iBookstore was Random House. Random House wanted to offer its own e-books through its own apps and submitted their apps to be added to the App Store. </p><p>Amidst continued negotiations between Apple and Random House, Senior VP Eddie Cue said, and I'm quoting him,\"--I'm quoting him when he said it prevented an app from Random House from going live in the App Store. Cue himself cited this Projection is a factor in finally getting Random House to give in and join iBookstore. Mr. Cook, is it fair for Apple to use its power over the App Store to pressure a business to join Apple's own app? </p><p>COOK: I can't see the email, and so I don't know the context of it, but there are--there are many reasons why an outlet might not initially go through the--the App Store gate because it--inmate--it may not work properly, there may be other issues with that. So it's very difficult to say. What I would--I would say though on a macro basis that deeded to the App Store is very wide. We had 1.7 million apps in it. It's become an economic miracle with over $138 billion of commerce just in the United States. </p><p>MCBATH: Well Mr. Cook, I really, really appreciate that sentiment, but you know, I wanted to say to you that Apple enjoys enormous power to control which apps can reach consumers, even some of the largest companies in the country fear your power. Our evidence suggests that your company has used its power to harm your rivals and boost your own business. </p><p>This is fundamentally unfair and arms small businesses that rely on you to reach customers and it stifles the innovation that is the lifeblood of our economy. Ultimately, it reduces the competition and choices that are made available to consumers, and that is of great concern to all of us. And I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlelady yields back. That concludes that around. In light of the request of Mr. Gaetz for third round and because many of my colleagues would like to get more fulsome answers on a number of issues, we will proceed to a final-round and my expectation is we will conclude within the hour. And I will recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, we've seen the dominance of several of the companies appearing before us today that it's not just harmful to our economy and competition, but it's harmful to the founding principles of our democracy. Facebook and Google are designed to keep users on the platforms whatever the cost because disinformation, propaganda and hateful speech are good for engagement, they're good for business. </p><p>But over 100 years ago, the Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing panic. My first question is, Mr. Zuckerberg, do you agree with that principle, that there are limits to harmful and fast speech and that--that are particularly important when it comes to the health and safety of the public? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I--I certainly do, and I actually think that our policies go further than just limiting those types of things. </p><p>CICILLINE: Well Mr. Zuckerberg, you have a billion users and almost 50,000 employees and so you agree you have a responsibility to remove harmful rise from your platform, correct? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I think we have a responsibility to--to limit the spread of--of content that's going to be harmful for people. Also, if--if--I'd like to add that I do not believe that we have any incentive to have this content on our service people don't like-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Except that--wait, Mr. Zuckerberg, with all due respect, except that it is often the most engaging. It's the most--it brings the most like sport brings the most activity, which of course produces great profit. So you do have an incentive. The more engagement there is, the more money you make on advertising. </p><p>So let me ask you a question--let me give you some specific examples that will illustrate my concerns. There are--these are some of the top 10 most shared articles on Facebook and 2020. Trump suggests injection of disinfectant to beat coronavirus and claimed the lungs. Coronavirus hype. Biggest political hopes in history. U.S. hospitals getting paid more to a global cause of death as coronavirus. During the greatest public health crisis of our lifetime, don't you agree that these articles viewed by millions on your platform will cost lives? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, with respect, we certainly have policies that prohibit this information about covert that would lead to imminent harm and we've been quite aggressive about taking that down as some of the questioning from--from the other side of the aisle has--has shown so far. </p><p>CICILLINE: But Mr. Zuckerberg-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --I've been quite proud of our efforts here-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Well, the-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --We--we've-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --With all due respect, the problem is Facebook is profiting off and amplifying disinformation that harms others because it's profitable. This isn't a speech issue, it's about Facebook's business model that prioritizes engagement in order to keep people on Facebook's platform to serve up more advertisements. So I'll ask you very specifically, what are you doing right now to protect people from demonstrably false claims related to this deadly pandemic? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I'll certainly answer that, but I have to disagree with the assertion that you are making this content is somehow helpful for our business. It is not what people want to see and we rank our--our--what we show in feed based on what is going to be the most meaningful to people and is going to create long-term satisfaction, not what's just going to get engagement or clicks today-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --So, if that's true-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --That's a common misconception about the company-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --If that's true, Mr. Zuckerberg, how do you explain that on Monday the second most popular post on Facebook was a Breitbart video claiming that you don't need a mask and hydroxychloroquine is a killer for coded and in the first five hours after being posted on Facebook racked up 20 million views and over 100,000 comments before Facebook acted to remove it? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well Congressman, a lot of people showed that, and we did take it down because it violates our policies. We work with the CDC to figure out-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --After 20 million people saw it over a period of five hours? I mean, doesn't that suggest, Mr. Zuckerberg, that your platform is so big that even with the right policies in place, you can't contain deadly content? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I don't think so. I think we have included misinformation in particular a relatively good track record of fighting and taking down lots of fast content as well as putting up authoritative information. We have built a COVID Information Center-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --I understand-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --With intuitive authoritative information from health officials-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: (--INAUDIBLE--) </p><p>CICILLINE: --I just have one more question for you-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --(INAUDIBLE) 2 billion people. </p><p>CICILLINE: I appreciate that. Mr. Zuckerberg, if a television station runs a fast political advertisement, there it held liable for that. Why should Facebook or any other platform be different? </p><p>While you may not be a publisher, you are responsible maybe not for the first posting, but you then take that posting and you apply a set of algorithms that decide how you will disseminate that, which is a business decision, not a First Amendment decision. And it's hard to understand why this book should be responsible for those business decisions. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, in terms of political ads, we monitored a lot of our policies off of the FCC guidelines on broadcasters and their requirements to run political ads equally from--from all different sites. </p><p>CICILLINE: Well, I think this-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --(INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CICILLINE: Yeah, I think these examples, unfortunately, Mr. Zuckerberg, are just the tip of the iceberg. It's not just about COVID. Facebook posts posters enables countless pages and ads that are dedicated to conspiracy theories and calls to violence including content that led to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017. And Facebook gets away with it because you're the only game in town. </p><p>There's no competition forcing you to police your own platform. Allowing this misinformation to spread can lead to violence and frankly, I believe it strikes at the very heart of American democracy. And with that, I now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Gates for five minutes. </p><p>GAETZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pichai, in 2016, there was an internal Google meeting. You attended that meeting along with Sergey Brin. A video of that meeting was linked to Breitbart and at the meeting, top Google executives, including Kent Walker lamented Trump's victory, they compared Trump voters to extremists, and it was discussed that there was an intent to make the Trump when a blip in the populist movement in American history. </p><p>Now, I know you've testified today in response to my questions and Mr. Jordan's questions that you don't intend this time to engage in electioneering on behalf of the former vice president then, but given the video evidence of senior members of your team in your presence saying that they had the intent to make the Trump victory a blip, why should we believe that testimony today? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we do not have a view on--we respect the democratic process, we are deeply committed to it as a company. We take pride in the information we provide to help people purchase of paid and free elections, and we are deeply committed to it as I said to Congressman Jordan-- </p><p>GAETZ: Do you remember that meeting? </p><p>PICHAI: -- </p><p>GAETZ: 2016 that you attended? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, yes, I do. Yes, I do. It was in the context of you know through the election across both sides there was a lot of opinions, and as you know elections are kind of a polarizing moment generally in the country, and there was a lot of rhetoric about certain issues which were-- </p><p>GAETZ: I understand rhetoric. I guess the question is when the senior members of your team in your presence said that they did have the intent to change the outcome in a subsequent election and then since that moment in time where we have seen all of these conservative websites and conservative viewpoint censored you can understand why people would be concerned so after your employees and top executives said in your presence that they intended to make the Trump victory a blip what action did you take as the CEO to protect and preserve the neutrality of your platform? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman no one had a view on you know ever interfering with the elections are so on but what I can tell you is we have made it very clear about two years ago we announced new community guidelines for within Google clearly making it clear that you know employees obviously are free to have their political views but number of that should ever, they shouldn't bring that as they work on any of our products and if we found any evidence that people are using a political agenda to manipulate any of our content platforms we would take strong enforcement action. </p><p>GAETZ: But unfortunately, you have sort of a string of events here. We have the 2016 meeting where people demonstrated their intent to make changes to hurt the President then we have your testimony today that's a little different than your testimony from D sambar where you say people can manipulate blacklist and then you have the outcome where sites like Breitbart and Gateway Pundit and others see that--that disparate treatment, so it really doesn't take Sherlock Holmes here to connect the dots and see what Google is doing. I am going to move on with my final 90 seconds. </p><p>Mr. Bezos, I am deeply moved by your personal story. I am not here accusing U.S. someone who would ever traffic in hate, but it seems you have empowered people who do, and I am particularly talking about the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center which you allowed to dictate who can receive donations on your AmazonSmile platform have said the Catholic family news, Catholic family ministries, the Federation for American immigration reform, the American Family Association, the family research Council, the Jewish Defense League, and even Dr. Ben Carson are extremist and should be treated differently. Dr. Carson is on the cabinet and is one of the most renowned mines in America. I--I am just wondering why you would place your confidence in a group that seems to be so out of step and seems to take mainstream Christian doctrine and label it as hate. </p><p>BEZOS: Sir, it is a good question, and we have for those of you who don't know what Amazon smile is it is a program that allows customers to designate a certain fraction of their purchases to go to charity that we then pay for and they can select from any one of millions of charities, and we use the Southern Poverty Law Center data to say which charities are extremist organizations. We also use the U.S. Foreign Asset Office to do the same thing. </p><p>GAETZ: But why-- </p><p>BEZOS: Those two together-- </p><p>GAETZ: Since they are calling Catholics and these Jewish groups hateful groups, why would you trust them? </p><p>BEZOS: Sir, I'm going to acknowledge this is an imperfect system and-- </p><p>GAETZ: No doubt. </p><p>BEZOS: I would like suggestions on better or better or additional sources. </p><p>GAETZ: My suggestion would be a divorce from the SPLC, and I see that I'm out of time, and I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the chair--sorry, recognize the gentleman from Georgia Mr. Johnson. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Facebook is dominant not just in the social media market but also in its digital surveillance capabilities. In 2012 Facebook had several tools that allowed it to conduct digital surveillance, including trackers, Facebook's like button, Facebook login, and a series of application programming interfaces or API. Mr. Zuckerberg, these tools provide Facebook with insights into its competitors' websites, and apps isn't that correct? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: -- </p><p>JOHNSON: Yes or no? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman I think broadly the answer to what you are saying is--is yes. Every other company here do market research to understand what people are finding valuable-- </p><p>JOHNSON: All right, okay. So you are going beyond the scope of my question. I appreciate that answer, though. </p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, a few days before Facebook acquired Instagram, a Facebook vice president email views suggesting ways to improve Facebook's quote competitive research\" by building a custom model, Facebook could improve its understanding of its competitors and quote make more bold decisions on whether they are friends or foes end quote. Mr. Zuckerberg, how does Facebook improve its competitive research to distinguish friends from folk? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman I'm not sure exactly what he was referring to in that email there, but he is one of the people involved in running our analytics organization, and I think it is natural that he would as part of his responsibility be focused on market research and understanding more there. </p><p>JOHNSON: And certainly isn't it true that Facebook, after that conversation, purchased the web analytics company (INAUDIBLE) in 2013 to give Facebook more capability to monitor its competitors? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I think you have the timing correct. We--we purchase (INAUDIBLE) as part of our--our broader market research capacity. </p><p>JOHNSON: And that would give you the capability to monitor your competitors, correct? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, it gave aggregate analytics as to what people were using and what people were finding valuable sort of like the type of product you would get from Nielsen or Comscore or some of these other third-party companies that provide similar data. </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, Mr. Zuckerberg that acquisition gave you nonpublic real-time data about engagement, usage and how much time people spend on maps and when it became public that Facebook was using (INAUDIBLE) to conduct digital surveillance your company got kicked out of Apple's app store isn't that true? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I'm not sure I would characterize it in that way. I think (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>JOHNSON: I mean (INAUDIBLE) did get kicked out of the app store, isn't that true? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I believe we took the app out after Apple changed their policies about-- </p><p>JOHNSON: And it was because--and it was because of the use of the surveillance tools? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I'm not sure that the policy was awarded that way or that that is exactly the right characterization of it but-- </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay, well, let me ask you this question. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: But Apple changed their policy. </p><p>JOHNSON: Let me ask you this question. After (INAUDIBLE) was booted out of the app store, you turned to other surveillance tools such as Facebook research app, correct? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, in general, yes we do a broad variety of (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>JOHNSON: And also isn't it true Mr. Zuckerberg that Facebook paid teenagers to sell their privacy by installing Facebook research app? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I am not familiar with that, but I think it is a general practice to be able to--that the companies used to have different surveys and--and understand data from how people are using different products and what their preferences are. </p><p>JOHNSON: Facebook research app got thrown out of the app store to isn't that true? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I'm not familiar with that. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay. Well over nearly a decade, Mr. Zuckerberg, you lead a sustained effort to serve bail smaller competitors to benefit the Facebook--to benefit Facebook these--these were steps taken to abuse data, to harm competitors and to shield Facebook from competition. You tried one thing, and then you got caught, made some apologies, and then you did it all over again. Isn't that true? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I--I respectfully disagree with that characterization. I think every company engages in research to understand what their customers are enjoying so they can learn and make their products better, and that is what we were trying to do, that is what our analytics team was doing. And I--I think in--in general, that allowed us to make our services better for people to be able to connect in a lot of different ways, which is our goal. </p><p>HANK JOHNSON: Did you use the capability to purchase WhatsApp? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, it--it was one of the signals that we--that we had about WhatsApp's trajectory. But we didn't need it. Without that, was pretty clear that WhatsApp was a great product. I already had a--a relationship Jan Koum, the founder. And-- </p><p>HANK JOHNSON: --And it was a competitor. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlemen's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Steube. </p><p>STEUBE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question for all four, a yes or no answer. Do you believe that the Chinese government steals technology from U.S. companies? Start with Mr. Cook. </p><p>COOK: I don't know of specific cases where we have been stolen from by the government. </p><p>STEUBE: So, you don't believe that the Chinese government's stealing technology from U.S. companies, or you're just saying that not from yours? </p><p>COOK: I'm saying I--I know of no case on ours where it occurred, which is--I can only speak to firsthand knowledge. </p><p>STEUBE: Mr. Pichai, do you believe that the Chinese government steals technology from United States companies? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, I have no firsthand knowledge of any information stolen from Google in this regard. </p><p>STEUBE: Mr. Zuckerberg? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I think it's well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies. </p><p>STEUBE: Thank you. Mr. Bezos? You're on mute. </p><p>CICILLINE: Mr. Bezos, I believe you're on mute. </p><p>BEZOS: I'm sorry. I've seen--I have heard many reports of that, and I--I haven't seen it personally, but I've many reports of it. </p><p>STEUBE: So, of all the different products that Amazon carries, you haven't seen that in any of the--the companies that sell products on Amazon or your company yourself? </p><p>BEZOS: Well, certainly there are knockoff products, if that's what you mean. And there are counterfeit products and all that. But the Chinese--if the answer is the Chinese government stealing technology, that's the thing I've read reports of and--but don't have personal experience with. </p><p>STEUBE: It's no secret that Europe increasingly seems to have an agenda of attacking large successful U.S. tech companies, yet Europe's approach to regulation in general and antitrust in particular seems to have been much less successful than America's approach. America is a remarkable nursery for innovation and entrepreneurship in pursuit of the American dream. </p><p>As you all know from direct experience, this is a country where it's possible to start a company from a garage or dorm room and experience tremendous success. Do you have any recommendations on how Congress can better protect U.S. firms and U.S. companies from aggression and government intervention abroad, not just in Europe but in China as well? Anybody that would like to chime in, I'll open it up to any of you. </p><p>None of you have any recommendations on how Congress can better protect U.S. companies like yourself? All right. With that, I'll yield the remainder my time to Mr. Gaetz. </p><p>GAETZ: I think the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Zuckerberg, what is a digital land grab? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I'm not sure what you're referring to. </p><p>GAETZ: Well, in the emails that your company produced to the committee, there's one from David Weiner in 2014 where he is describing, under the mergers and acquisitions advice within the company, that--that you need to engage in a land grab. And he says I hate the word land grab, but I think that's the best convincing argument and we should on that. And it goes on to describe a strategy where in Facebook would spend 5 percent to 10 percent of its market cap each year to shore up its market position. Does that refresh your recollection? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes, Congressman. Thanks for the opportunity to address this and--and--and frankly to correct the record, because I--I believe that what he was referring to was a question that was incoming from investors about whether we would continue to require different companies. </p><p>I don't think that that was--that wasn't referring to an internal strategy. It was referring to an external question that we were facing about--about how we would--how investors should expect us to--to act going forward. And I think he was discussing the fact that, as mobile phones were growing in popularity, there were a lot of new ways that people can connect and communicate that were part of this overall broader space and market around human connection and helping people stay connected and share their experiences that were-- </p><p>GAETZ: --Okay. Well, Mr.--Mr. Zuckerberg, it--it seems to be both internal and external, because then in an email from you in 2012, we see a similar sentiment expressed. You write we can likely always just by any competitive startups. So, is--is your desire to limit competition by--by purchasing your competitors consistent with the message to your investors that the way you'll run your company is through digital land grabs? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I--I am not sure I agree with the--the characterization of how we communicate with investors. But I-- </p><p>GAETZ: --It's your words, Mr. Zuckerberg-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --But I think the broader point is that there were a lot of new ways that--that people can connect that were created by smart phones, and we-- </p><p>GAETZ: --But this is about your merger and acquisition strategy. You went on to say one thing about startups is you can often acquire them. So, I mean, I--I'm not uninterested in how people connect. I'm interested in how you--how you acquire businesses to limit competition. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlemen's time has expired, but the witness answer the question. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, in order to serve people better and help people connect in all the ways they would want, we innovated and built a lot of new use cases internally and we acquired others. And that, I think, has been a very successful strategy at serving people well. And a lot of the companies that we've been able to acquire have done--have gone on to reach and help connect many more people than they would've been able to on their own. </p><p>GAETZ: You've grabbed a lot of land-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --You know, in terms of things like-- </p><p>GAETZ: --I would say. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the chair of the full committee, Mr. Nadler, for five minutes. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cook, we've heard from businesses that Apple is canvassing the App Store to determine whether it can extract commissions from apps that have changed their business models in response to the pandemic. Businesses that relied on--on in-person interactions have moved online, and Apple is looking for its cut. Our staff has heard from some of the affected businesses. They say you're calling them up demanding your 30 percent. Isn't this pandemic profiteering? </p><p>COOK: We would never do that, Mr. Chairman. The--the pandemic is a tragedy and it's--it's hurting Americans in many people from all around the world. We would never take advantage of that. I believe the cases that you're talking about our cases where something has moved to a digital service, which technically does need to go through our commission model. But in--in both of the cases that I'm aware of, we are working with the developers to--to sort of zoom out. </p><p>And to give you some historical context on this, when we entered the App Store market, the cost of distributing software was 50 percent to 70 percent. And so, we took the rate in half and to 30 percent, and we've held it in that same level over time or lowered it. It's now responsible for 2 million jobs across America, and 84 percent of the apps on the store are distributed for free, where 100 percent of the proceeds go to the developer. Only that 16 percent is subject to a commission of either 15 percent or 30 percent. </p><p>NADLER: And--and school is about to start around the country, and millions of parents and students will attend school online. They will rely on apps to talk to teachers, tutors, and virtual learning tools. Are these online learning tools next on Apple's--are they on Apple's list to monetize? </p><p>COOK: They're--they're not, Mr. Chairman. We would--we will--we're very proud of what we've done in education. We're serving that market in--in a significant way, and including tons of donations. And we will work with the people that happen to--to move from a physical--move from a physical to a virtual world because of the pandemic. </p><p>NADLER: And-- </p><p>COOK: --We've done a lot to address COVID in general as a company. We've sourced and donated 30 million masks, turning our supply chain into something that would be great for America. We've designed a face shield and donated 10 million of those. We're donating significant amounts of money across the U.S. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you. Thank you. Now-- </p><p>COOK: --Thank you-- </p><p>NADLER: --We've--we've heard that Apple is now trying to extract commissions from various apps that previously didn't pay you anything. You approved, we're told, the email app HEY, and then days later frantic to get out of the App Store unless it built a way to give you a--a cut of revenue. The COO of Base Camp, maker of the--of the HEY app, testified before our committee earlier this year. He was concerned about Apple's monopoly over software distribution on iOS devices. And he's--and he--he seemed to have been right. Apple says it services like HEY have always been required to cut Apple in, but you previously didn't interpret your rules that way. You didn't enforce your rules this way. So would you--would you comment on this, please? </p><p>COOK: Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would. HEY, is in the store today and we're happy that they're there. I believe that there--they have a version of their product is for free and so they're not paying anything on that. I would also say that 30 percent, and I hope you give me a time to explain this for 15 percent is for lots of different services from programming languages to compilers to 150,000 APIs. </p><p>It's--it has been an economic miracle to allow the person in their basement to start a company, a global company and serve 175 countries in the world. It is amazing. Likely, the highest job creator in the last decade. </p><p>NADLER: I see. And you haven't changed the rules in such a way as--estimate apps pay when they weren't paying before? </p><p>COOK: I know of no case will be done that. I'm sure we've made errors before. We get 100,000 different apps submitted a week and we've got 1.7 million on the store. But across that period of time, we've never raised commissions from that first day the--at the Apple Store went into effect back in 2008. We've only lowered them. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you. I see my time has expired. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. </p><p>COOK: Thank you for the question. </p><p>CICILLINE: I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pichai, in 2015, Google announced that it would not allow third parties to buy YouTube ads via Adax. That means that ad buys on YouTube are conducted only through Google demand-site products. Google justified this change by citing privacy and user experience. </p><p>My understanding is that Google cited a concern that third-party digital and participants would develop user profiles based on this viewing. It is also my understanding that even under the GDPR, you are allowed--you allow users to provide consent, which would authorize this type of activity. It seems that if--that this policy, regardless of the privacy concerns reduced competition for demand side platforms on YouTube. Do you agree? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we're always looking to improve the YouTube experience. Part of being able to integrate that space while in YouTube, we've been able to innovate something called true view adds. So for users, we give them scalable ads if they find that not to be relevant, they can skip past those ads and, you know, monetizing YouTube is what allows--today, we have many, literally hundreds of thousands of creators earning a livelihood and many of them are small and medium businesses. So we want to support that well and so we are focused on that. Allowing this type of integration is what allows us to create that user experience. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: But after Google stopped allowing third parties to buy YouTube ads via Adax, Google limited the interoperability of third-party analytics on YouTube. You now required the use of ads on data hub. Again, the justification is based on user privacy. Other ad market participants may not have access to that data, but it doesn't--it doesn't disappear, does it? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, this is consistent with how to date many services, be it Facebook work Snapchat or Pinterest, you work with their ad tools to buy ads on their properties and (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>ARMSTRONG: --Well, I understand that, but the excuse is privacy, but the data doesn't disappear. You just have greater control over it, right? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, it's a service we provide to our users. We obviously want to make sure we protect the privacy of users there. We do monetize with ads. We give users a choice of either consuming it as a subscription service using it with ads and we've been very focused on making YouTube at great platform for creators. And I think the model is working well. It's really helped many small and medium businesses to invest on the platform and grow their businesses. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: So you would--regardless of the intent was to lessen competition or not, the action resulted in smaller competitors unable to participate in placing ads on YouTube, isn't that correct? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, we've seen robust choice for, you know, advertisers. You know, there is several alternatives. There is, you know, obviously Facebook suite of products, there is Amazon with their ads marketplace, there is companies like Snapchat, Pinterest, twitter, there are new competitors have emerged. And this is why boosting advertising cost decline by 40 percent in the last 10 years. And so we see dynamism in the marketplace-- </p><p>ARMSTRONG: --Here's my-- </p><p>PICHAI: --We are focused on (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Yeah, but here's my issue. And there are policies that actually protect user--user privacy. Apples (INAUDIBLE) policy. Microsoft just came out on facial recognition policy. My concern is that your position--the position is that when using privacy, we're trying to use privacy and reusing privacy as a shield bill over really doing and what your company is really doing is using it as a cudgel to beat down the competition. </p><p>And when we're talking about privacy, it's a great word that people care about, but not when it's utilized to control more of the marketplace and squeeze out smaller competitors. And with that, I'd yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Gaetz. </p><p>GAETZ: I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Bezos, we were cut short in our--in our last discussion. I just wanted to give you the chance to clear this up. You don't believe Dr. Ben Carson is an extremist, do you? </p><p>BEZOS: No sir, I don't. </p><p>GAETZ: So help me understand why you would partner with the group that labels him as someone worthy of an extremist watchlist. </p><p>BEZOS: Well, it's--I want you to hopefully appreciate when we're trying to make a policy for people to donate to any member of from millions of different charities and we need to have some source of data to use, and--and while I accept what you're saying that the Southern Poverty Law Center in the U.S. foreign asset office are not perfect, and I would like a better source if we could get it, that is what we use today. </p><p>GAETZ: Oh that's breaking news-- </p><p>BEZOS: --I would happily engage with you-- </p><p>GAETZ: --It's--it's great to hear that you do recognize the infirmities in the Southern Law--Poverty Law Center--and there are I guess Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Pichai's companies use them as well. Mr. Zuckerberg, do you believe that Doctor Ben Carson is an extremist? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: No, Congressman. </p><p>GAETZ: And--and so why would you trust the people who think he is? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, I'm not aware of where we work with the organization that you are--but you're saying. </p><p>GAETZ: Oh, (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --The gentleman's time has expired. </p><p>GAETZ: Okay, that's helpful. </p><p>CICILLINE: I now recognize the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Raskin for five minutes. </p><p>RASKIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I read Richard Hofstadter's The Paranoid Style in American Politics. So I suppose it's futile to try to cure the obsessive persecution complex and victimology of some of our colleagues, but they should check out the top-performing Facebook link posts by the United States pages today or yesterday or any day for the last week. And 7 or 8 out of the 10 each day our right wing--right wing sites, Ben Shapiro, Fox News, Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro, Fox News, Blue Lives Matter, and so on. </p><p>So if Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech, they're doing a terrible job at it. And so I don't understand just the endless whining about how Facebook and Twitter or Facebook and Twitter are somehow discriminating against--against conservatives. The removal of Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. from Twitter, their tweets was all about their spreading disinformation, false statements about COVID-19. That was an absolute public health measure, which I hope all of us would endorse. We don't want anybody, including the president of the United States spreading false information about COVID-19. </p><p>So I think they--they essentially destroy their own case when they pick that as they are--their cause for going after all of you. And I don't understand for the life of me the line of questioning about electioneering taking place by some of your companies. If you're opposed to electioneering by corporations, as I am, and you're opposed to Citizens United, then you've got no problem. Citizens United is what gave corporations the power to go out and spend money. And if you don't like the love that some companies are spending money, you know, either start your own company or tell them what's wrong with it. But the idea of that electioneering is something you're opposed to just strikes me as completely inconsistent with the history of the facts. </p><p>So I want to go to Mr. Cook if we could. But first, a quick question. Are any of your companies benefit corporations and is that something you considered doing? Is there any one--any one of you that have thought about becoming a B Corp or a benefit corporation? Okay, I take it the answer is \"no\" there. </p><p>Mr. Cook, I'm hung up on this 30 percent question that several members have talked to you about. And you said sometimes it's 15 percent, sometimes it's 30 percent. Can you explain when it's 15 and when it's 30 and why it's 15 sometimes and why it's 30? </p><p>COOK: Sure. Thank you for the question, congressman. In 84 percent of the time, it's zero. 16 percent of the time, it is 15 or 30. In the case of it is 15 if it is in the second year of a subscription. </p><p>RASKIN: Okay, so you just graduate from your first year you are taking no toll essentially, the second year, it is 15, and then it is 30 after that, is that right? </p><p>COOK: No, if it's a subscription product, it's 30 percent in the first year, and then it drops to 15 in the second year and every year thereafter. </p><p>RASKIN: I got you, okay. Well, what troubles me is just what one businesswoman told me when I was looking at this switch is she said I pay are around 25 percent of my income to Uncle Sam, to the government, and then I pay 30 percent of my income to Apple, and so I get half of it, and it is very hard to make ends meet, and I just wonder look all of you were in business and all of you were tremendously successful at what you do, and obviously this model has worked for you, but the question is, does this model actually squeeze out the next generation of entrepreneurs and is said and unjust arrangement because you are you know the 10,000-pound gorilla and they are just trying to get started? </p><p>COOK: No, I don't think so. In fact, keep in mind we have gone from 500 apps to 1.7 million, so there's a lot of apps on the store, and a lot of people are making a very good living from it. </p><p>RASKIN: And you have said that and forgive me for interrupting, but you have said that several times but that to me might just underscore the monopoly nature of your business that everybody's got to go through you. There's really no alternative, and so I don't blame you for taking them all, but that doesn't mean that the terms that are being dictated are, in fact, fair term, so how would you defend substantively that bargain? </p><p>COOK: That they--whether you look at it from a customer point of view or a developer point of view there are enormous choices out there. If you are a developer you can write for android, you can write for Windows, you can write for Xbox or PlayStation. If you are a customer and you don't like these setup, the curated experience of the app store you can buy a Samsung--you can buy-- </p><p>RASKIN: Okay, I appreciate that and forgive me for cutting you off. I have one more final question for Mr. Zuckerberg. You spend a lot of your time speaking to our conservative colleagues who have this persecution complex that you are somehow going after them. Will you have time to meet with this broad coalition of civil rights groups that are engaged in a boycott because of what they think is the proliferation of hate speech and Holocaust revisionism and other affiliated topics on Facebook? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congressman, yes--yes, I already have taken the time to meet with them. I think that the topics that they are pushing on are important on a lot of the goals we agree. These are issues around finding hate that we have focused on for years, and we are committed to continuing to improve the way that our company works and--and just continually getting better on these issues. </p><p>RASKIN: I appreciate that, and I will tell them of your answer. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank--thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg. I now recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, for five minutes. </p><p>JORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cook, is the canceled culture mob dangerous? </p><p>COOK: I--it is something I am not all of the way up to speed on, but if you--if you are talking about where somebody with a different point of view talks and they are canceled I don't think that's good. I think it's good for people to hear different points of view and decide for themselves. </p><p>JORDAN: Yeah, I--I agree with that. I just want to reference a letter Bari Weiss who resigned as an editor at the New York Times she wrote a letter explaining why she re-signed she--and I will just read three sentences for--for all of you actually. She says first of all my own forays into wrong think made me the subject of constant bullying by my colleagues who disagree with my views. She then says later in the letter, everyone lives in fear of the digital thunder dome. The online venom is excused so long as it is directed that the proper targets and those targets aren't just conservative. In fact, Ms. Weiss is actually center-left, she is not conservative. The targets are anyone who disagrees with the mob. Are the rest of you concerned about the canceled culture mob and what it's up to? Mr. Pichai? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman I am sorry I had momentary difficulty hearing, but you know we--I can--we have built platforms which allow for freedom of expression, and we take pride in the fact that across our platforms including YouTube, there are more diverse voices than ever before. It is something - mag </p><p>JORDAN: That is fine. I am just--I'm just saying are you--I am concerned about it and again I am concerned about it not just because conservatives get attacked I am concerned with anyone gets attacked for expressing a viewpoint. I thought we had a First Amendment, and yet they constantly get attacked. How about you, Mr. Zuckerberg? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes, congressman. I believe strongly in free expression. Giving people a voice is an important part of what our services do, and I am--I am very worried about some of the forces of the liberalism that I see in this country that are pushing against free expression. I think that this is one of the fundamental democratic traditions that we have in our country and it is how we make progress over the long-term on a number of issues and our company is committed to doing what we can to protect-- </p><p>JORDAN: Mr. Bezos? Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Bezos? </p><p>BEZOS: Yes, sir. I am concerned in general about that, and what I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that social media is a nuanced instruction machine, and I don't think that is helpful for a democracy. </p><p>JORDAN: Do you agree with the terms she used Ms. Weiss used, digital thunder dome? </p><p>BEZOS: I say that yes. </p><p>JORDAN: Yeah, I see--I see it to. I think I guess my point is you are for pretty important guys waiting for of the most important companies on the planet, and it would sure be helpful if you spoke out against this. I mean Mr. Cook there was a 1984 Super Bowl ad in black and white, have this big-brother type figure as the narrator saying over the screen to a bunch of these workers looks like it was straight out of the Soviet Union saying to a bunch of these workers as they are sort of marching along he says one of the lines of the narrator uses is our unification of thoughts is more powerfully a weapon than any fleet or army on the earth and then the ad is with this lady running in in color and smashing the screen busting the group think, busting the mob think. You remember that ad Mr. Cook, what company have that ad? </p><p>COOK: I remember it--I remember it very well. It was Apple versus IBM at the time. </p><p>JORDAN: Yeah, but that--the point was mob think canceled culture, groupthink is not what this country is about, and we are seeing it play out every single--just take the sports world for goodness sake in the last few weeks Drew Brees had to--had to bow to the mob simply because he suggested you should stand for the anthem. We had--there was a football coach at Oklahoma State who wore the quote wrong T-shirt fishing with his boys he got in all kinds of trouble. James Harden wears a mask saying back the police, help the police, support the police he gets attacked. Why don't we just let the First Amendment work, that is all we are asking? And you are for individuals who have so much influence it would sure help if you are out there criticizing what the canceled culture mob is doing to this country and people see it every single day, and I hope you will do it. I hope you will--you all said you disagree with it. I hope you will really speak out against it and be fair with all viewpoints. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I recognize the gentlelady from Washington, Ms. Jayapal. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pichai, I direct my questions to you. Many of us feel a deep urgency to protect independent journalism, and I wanted to talk a little bit about ad revenue and independent journalism. Google makes most of its revenue through selling advertising, and Google's advertising exchanges a quote real-time place to buy and sell rising space, correct? </p><p>PICHAI: Yes, congressman, that is correct. </p><p>JAYAPAL: And over 2 million websites, including online newspapers, use that exchange, correct? </p><p>PICHAI: We are very proud to support publishers, and I don't have the exact numbers, but yes, that seems (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>JAYAPAL: Okay, well, well, that's, and an estimate put forth by tech expert (INAUDIBLE) and your own website for a Google display network says you have access to over 2 million sites. What is Google's share of the ad exchange market? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, I am not exactly familiar. I have seen various--various reports, but you know we--we are a popular choice. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Great. Let me put it up for you. If you look at the screen, you will see that 50 percent, 60 percent Google has 50 percent, 60 percent according to the online platforms in digital advertising CMA market study that was just really stand in order to buy and sell on these exchanges websites and advertisers go through a middleman like Google's DV360 and Google ads. If you look at the slide Mr. Pichai you can see that the share of this by side market that Google has is 50 percent, 90 percent according to the same study and I just want to simplify how these exchanges work so say in Seattle DEE's Electronics, a mom-and-pop business wants to buy </p><p>[*]JAYAPAL: online ad space in the Seattle Times. Dee's Electronics would need to go to a middleman like Google Ads, which would then bid for ad space on an ad exchange. The problem is that Google controls all of these entities. </p><p>So, it's running the marketplace. It's acting on the buy side and it's acting on the sell side at the same time, which is a major conflict of interest. It allows you to set rates very low as a buyer of ad space from newspapers, depriving them of their ad revenue, and then also to sell high to small businesses who are very dependent on advertising on your platform. </p><p>It sounds a bit like a stock market except, unlike a stock market, there's no regulation on your ad exchange market. If there were regulation, it would actually prohibit insider trading, which means that the broker can't use the data in the broker division to buy and sell for their own interests. Instead, brokers have to serve the clients--their clients. Does Google have a similar obligation to serve its clients, the businesses that are selling and buying ad space? </p><p>PICHAI: Congresswoman, if I could explain this for a minute, we paid over $14 billion to publishers. We are deeply committed to journalism. In this area, on a--on an average, we pay out 69 percent of the revenue when publishers use Google's buy and sell side tools. And, you know, out of--it's a low margin business for us. We do it because we want to help support publishers-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --Right-- </p><p>PICHAI: --In this area. </p><p>JAYAPAL: No, I--I understand that, Mr. Pichai. What I'm trying to get at is, when any company controls buy and the sell side--I worked on Wall Street a very long time ago--there are reasons that insider trading is regulated. And this ad exchange is essentially the same thing. And without accountability, it isn't meaningful to just care about the newspapers. We're seeing them die all over and ad revenue is a big reason. </p><p>Let me put up a graph here that shows that Google's ad revenue is increasingly coming from ads on Google owned sites and less so from other websites. Can you explain that trend? </p><p>PICHAI: I can't quite see whether this is net revenue or gross revenue. Obviously, when it comes to non-Google properties, we share the majority of revenue back to publishers, whereas on our own properties we obviously--you know, we are--we have the inventory. So--but I would need to understand more. I just quickly looked at it. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Okay. </p><p>PICHAI: I--and I am not sure I fully grasped it. </p><p>JAYAPAL: We--we can send it. We can send it to you and make sure you have it. You know, Google has not made it search traffic volumes public in years, so there's no way for us to know exactly what's happening here. And there's no way for businesses to verify whether they've been treated fairly or left behind in favor of Google owned companies. Is Google steering advertising revenue to Google search? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, users come to Google search. It is that traffic and, you know, that's where our source of revenue comes from. So, we're focused on providing users the information they are looking for. We work hard to earn their trust. We know competition for information is just a click away. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Pichai. I just want to make the point that independent journalism is incredibly necessary to our democracy, and we want to do what we can to protect it. </p><p>I--I want to just ask one last question of Mr. Zuckerberg. Over 1,100 companies and organizations pull their advertising business from Facebook as part of the stop hate for profit campaign to protest the spread of hate speech and disinformation. But you had a staff meeting earlier this month where you told employees we're not going to change our policies or approach because of the threat to any percent of our revenue. My guess is all these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough. </p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, are you so big that you don't care how you're impacted by a major boycott of 1,100 advertisers? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: No, Congresswoman, of--of course we care. But we're also not going to set our content policies because of advertisers. I think that that would be the wrong thing for us to do. We've cared about issues like fighting hate speech for a long time, and we've invested billions of dollars. And I've talked about today how we have tens of thousands of content reviewers. We've built AI systems that proactively identify the majority. We're now at 89 percent of the hate speech that we remove before anyone even reports it to us. </p><p>We're going to continue getting better at that. And I think that those investments over time and the results that we've put up will be recognized by people, since I do believe that they are industry-leading. And I--I think that our advertising also is, for a lot of small businesses, the most effective or among the most effective ways that they can find and reach new customers-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: --Thank--thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Thank you-- </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: --And a lot of people rely on it-- </p><p>JAYAPAL: My time has expired, but I would just say that I know you've commissioned your own civil rights audit. I don't think that you've implemented all those recommendations yet. I hope you will move quickly to implement those. This is a critical time, as we watched the body of John Lewis leave us here in the capital, that we focus on civil rights. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Before I call on the next witness, I want to recognize Mr. Pichai, who I think wants to make a correction for the hearing. </p><p>PICHAI: The only correction--thanks, Mr. Chairman. There was a question earlier about information with respect to China. I just wanted to acknowledge on record that I recall in 2009 we had a well-publicized cyber attack originating there, which did exfiltrate some code from there. I just wanted to correct that on record. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Pichai. The record will also reflect. I recognize the gentlelady from Pennsylvania for five minutes. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In March 2020, Amazon announced that it was going to are delaying shipments of nonessential products in order to better serve customers and meet need while helping to ensure the safety of their warehouse workers. In practice, however, it appears that this policy was applied selectively, as Amazon appeared to continue to designate its own products as essential even as it delayed competing products from third-party sellers. </p><p>So, the essential items were supposed to include household staples, medical supplies, high demand products, and that many factors were considered when determining eligibility to be essential. But we've had several employees report that Amazon continued to ship nonessential items like hammocks, fish tanks, pool floaties, etc. Mr. Bezos, were Amazon devices like Fire TV, Echo speakers, and Ring doorbell designated as essential during the pandemic? </p><p>BEZOS: I don't know the answer to that question. What I can tell you is that we had--there was no playbook for this. We moved very quickly. Demand went through the roof. It was like having a holiday selling season but in March, and we had to make a lot of decisions very rapidly. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay. </p><p>BEZOS: Our goal was to limit it to essential supplies, but I'm sure we did not do that perfectly. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay. I know the Ring doorbell has two competing products, including Arlo and eufy, maybe. Do you know if they were designated as essential? </p><p>BEZOS: I do not. </p><p>SCANLON: Okay. Are you able to testify to Congress today whether Amazons profit factor was a factor in giving an essential classification distinction? </p><p>BEZOS: No, not to my knowledge. We were working to achieve two objectives. One was to get essential products to customers, and the second was to keep our front-line employees safe. And we did a tremendous amount of work in both categories. And--and that's what we were focused on. We were not focused on profitability at that time. </p><p>SCANLON: Pushing out the elusive Clorox wipe, I guess. </p><p>But at any rate, moving along, we--with talk about the fees that Amazon charges sellers. According to a recent report, seller fees net Amazon almost $60 billion in 2019, nearly double the $35 billion in revenue from AWS, Amazon's massive cloud-computing division. Five years ago, Amazon took an average of 19 percent of the sale made by a third-party on its site. Today, Amazon keeps an average of 30 percent. Doesn't Amazon's ability to hike those fees so steeply suggest that Amazon enjoys market power over those sellers? </p><p>BEZOS: No, congresswoman, I don't believe so. I think what you're seeing there when you see that go from 19 percent to 30 percent is that more and more sellers are taking advantage of the incremental services that we offer. And a big piece of that is fulfillment by Amazon, which is probably the greatest innovation that we ever created for sellers. And it's working for sellers. That's why today 60 percent of sales are going to third-party sellers, up from zero 20 years ago. </p><p>SCANLON: Right. But I--I think a little more concerning is the 11 percent hike. </p><p>Since 2014, Amazon's revenue from seller fees as grown almost twice as fast as its overall sales. So, seller fees now account for 21 percent of Amazon's total revenue. Mr. Bezos, aren't seller fees now effectively subsidizing Amazons retail division? </p><p>BEZOS: Congressman, no, I don't believe so. I think what you're seeing there, when you see these fees going up, it--what's really happening is that sellers are choosing to use more of our services that we make available. They are--you know, previously perhaps they were shipping their own products from their own fulfillment center, so they would've had costs doing that. If you're operating your own fulfillment center and--and--and buying transportation services to the customer through the Postal Service or through UPS or--or who--whoever it would be, you are also--you have those fees anyway, but-- </p><p>SCANLON: --Well, let's talk a little bit about the-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Now you're-- </p><p>SCANLON: --Fulfillment centers-- </p><p>BEZOS: --You're doing that with fulfillment by Amazon. </p><p>SCANLON: Right. Okay. </p><p>BEZOS: Yes. Please, go ahead. Sorry. </p><p>SCANLON: So, you've got fulfillment by Amazon. And a year ago we asked whether who is enrolled in fulfillment by Amazon, also known as FBA, is a factor in whether they can be awarded the Buy Box. And at that time, Amazon said no. But the evidence is indicating in your own documents showing that being enrolled in that program is a major factor ended up first effectively forces sellers to pay for fulfillment services from Amazon if they want to make sales. Mr. Bezos, has Amazon's big Buy Box algorithm ever favored third-party sellers who by fulfillment services from Amazon over other sellers? </p><p>BEZOS: I think effectively the Buy Box--maybe directly or indirectly, I'm not sure if it's direct, but indirectly, I think the Buy Box does favor products that can be shipped with Prime. So especially if you are a Prime member, the Buy Box is trying to pick the offer, if we have multiple offers from multiple sellers for the same item, customer wants to buy that item, the Buy Box is trying to pick the offer that we predicted the customer would most like. That includes price, it includes delivery speed. And if you're a Prime member, it includes whether the item is eligible for Prime. And so I think-- </p><p>SCANLON: --Thank you, Mr. Bezos. I think my time is expired-- </p><p>BEZOS: --Okay, I think it (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --Okay the gentlelady's time has expired. Before I recognize our last two colleagues, I think Mr. Zuckerberg would like to clarify something for the record as well. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Chairman, thank you. In response to Congressman Johnson's question before I said that I wasn't familiar with the Facebook research app when I wasn't family without a name for it, but I--I just want to be clear that I--I do care that we used a--an app for research and it has since been discontinued and I would be happy to follow up with his staff on any more details that he would like on that. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg. The record shall show reflect. I recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Mr. Cook. I wanted to direct a few questions to you. And wanted to talk a little bit about the App Store and app development. So just taking a step back, my understanding from your testimony today is that, essentially, Apple has to operate by the same rules that the app developers operate by in terms of being able to access the App Store. Is that correct? </p><p>COOK: We have 60 apps on the App Store. They go through the same rules that the 1.7 million do. </p><p>NEGUSE: Okay. So here's--kind of guy I asked that question. My understanding is the App Store review guidelines tell app developers not to submit copycat apps. Is that correct? </p><p>COOK: I'm not totally familiar, but I believe that's the case because we were--we were getting a number of apps that were essentially the same thing, so sort of a cookie-cutter. </p><p>NEGUSE: And I--and I can represent to you, Mr. Cook, we've reviewed--our subcommittee staff has obviously review the guidelines and they--they--precisely, they say that app developers should have original ideas that copycat ideas on failure and Apple's customers don't want those. </p><p>On the other hand, the app developer agreement, which you require every developer to agree to does it give Apple the right to copy other apps. And so the question is why one rule for the developers that compete with you and the opposite rule for Apple. </p><p>COOK: Congressman, I'm not familiar, I'm not familiar with that but I could follow up with your office on that. </p><p>NEGUSE: Well, I would appreciate if you could follow up with our office. My understanding, again, is that the app developer agreement explicitly says that Apple can use any information that an Apple developer provides to Apple for any person--any purpose. And so obviously, you have complaints from any number of, you know, app developers who have testified before our committee. </p><p>And my--as I said, represent the state of Colorado. We heard from a call company called Tile, which said that Apple had access to confidential information about the apps distributed by the App Store. And given that, juxtaposed against this language in the exclusive agreement, you can understand why we would have concerns about anticompetitive conduct. </p><p>COOK: Yeah, congressman and, we run the App Store to help developers, not put them. We respect innovation. It is what our company is built on. We would--would never steal somebody's IP. But I will follow up with your office on--on more detail on this. </p><p>NEGUSE: Well, and I appreciate that, Mr. Cook because I think to the extent that happen were willing to commit and I tend to ask Mr. Pichai a similar line of questioning because I believe this is consistent across multiple different platforms, to the extent Apple is willing to commit within the developer agreement to say that while you have access to that data that you are not going to use that data and are not permitted to use that data to replicate your own app, a copycat app if you will. That would certainly, in my view, be a reflection of--of a step away from any type of anticompetitive conduct. And it sounds like you will follow-up and we can learn more. </p><p>But just back to that issue, I--Mr. Pichai, similarly, there was an article just today, or excuse me, yesterday about--from the Verge. The title is Google Reportedly Keeps Tabs on Usage of Rival Android Apps to Develop Competitors. And I'll quote from the article. \"Google said that the data doesn't give information about how people behave while they're using individual apps, but wouldn't say whether it had been used to develop competing apps.\" So I guess first, I take it you would confirm that Google does have access to confidential information or ultimately competitively sensitive information about apps on android devices? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, if I could clarify this, today, we have an API, which is available for other developers as long as users consent this gives us system health metrics. This is how we can launch digital well-being features on android. This is how we understand which apps are using battery and we can give a dashboard which shows, you know, maybe for crashing or quality control for battery usage for digital well-being. Sort of high level this data is available through a public API and other developers can avail as long as that user's consent to it. </p><p>NEGUSE: So Mr. Pichai, I just want to clarify. Again, I'll quote from this article. The article refers to this data as sensitive data about other apps including how often they--there opened and for how long they're used. I'm not asking how you use that information. I'm just asking whether or not in fact what the article alleges is correct, that you do have access to that data. </p><p>PICHAI: Yeah, with the--with user consent and the APIs exist, yes, we do. </p><p>NEGUSE: And does Google use that-- </p><p>PICHAI: --And it's critical for us to have access to that so that we can maintain that--you know, this is how we understand and we can, you know, improve research--research resource uses usage of applications-- </p><p>NEGUSE: --Understood-- </p><p>PICHAI: --(INAUDIBLE) just like-- </p><p>NEGUSE: --My time is limited. Sorry, sir. I--I just wanted to get to this core question. Given that Google doesn't have access to that data, does Google use that data to develop competing apps? And if your answer is no, will Google commit to making the necessary changes within its android developer app agreements to ensure that developers have that sense of clarity that in fact the data will not be used for Google to be able to develop a competing application? </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, like other businesses today, we do look at trends and you know, we in fact in place or we do publish a number of installs of application and we give ranges. And so it is a wide variety of way by which we try to understand what happening in the market. But I appreciate your concern about making sure there's clarity in this area and we'll continue to invest and give more clarity. </p><p>NEGUSE: Yeah I just--I must--and I guess I want to just follow, Mr. Chairman, if you're willing. So I guess I'm wondering if you can just answer that fundamental question. Does Google use that information to develop competing apps? I understand that the purposes you described in terms of how you use the information, I'm just asking if one of those in fact is to develop competing apps. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman's time has expired, but the witness may answer the question. </p><p>PICHAI: Congressman, because he was going on in market and we are aware of, you know, popularity of apps, you know, I don't want to--I want to be accurate in my answer, but in general, the primary use for that data is to improve the health of android. But you know, in any--any data that we did, we have user consent for it and we make it available to through an API to other developers as well.  </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. McBath. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And gentlemen, thank you so much for spending so much of your time with us today. We really appreciate it. And many of you have mentioned John Lewis today and his fight for equality that I know that all my colleagues and I will carry on. Very quickly, can each of you simply commit to improving racial and gender equity accurate companies, including black leadership and women in your senior ranks, just a yes or no answer, please. Mr. Zuckerberg. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes. </p><p>MCBATH: Mr. Cook. </p><p>COOK: Yes, I am very personally committed. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. Mr. Bezos. </p><p>BEZOS: Absolutely, yes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. Mr. Pichai. </p><p>PICHAI: Yes, and we are have made public commitments to this regard. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you so much. Mr. Zuckerberg, in 2004, there were dozens of social media companies. Facebook distinguished itself from the competitors--competitors by focusing specifically on privacy. You had a short, clear privacy policy. It was just 950 words. </p><p>It made a promise to users, and I quote, \"we do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user.\" And you said will not. That's a commitment about the future and that was 2004. Mr. Zuckerberg, today, does Facebook use cookies to collect private information on users? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, my understanding to that is--is no, we're not using cookies used to collect private information about--about people who use our services and I--I believe we have upheld that commitment. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay, thank you. So Mr. Zuckerberg, do you think that your company would be as successful if it had started with today's cookies policy in place? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, I am not sure exactly what you are referring to, but in general, cookies is not a--a big part of how we are collecting information. We have primarily use them to make sure that someone can stay logged in on the web. We use them to some degree for security to make sure that you don't have someone trying to login under a lot of different accounts under--for one computer or something like that. </p><p>MCBATH: So Mr. Zuckerberg, once again, you do not use cookies? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Congresswoman, just to make sure I am clear-- </p><p>MCBATH: Yes or no? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG: We do use cookies, we do use cookies; yes, we do use cookies. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. So, Mr. Zuckerberg, the bottom line here is that you broke a commitment to your users and who can say if you may or may not do that again in the future. The reality is that Facebook's market power grew, and Facebook sacrificed its users policy. </p><p>Mr. baize owes my colleagues have touched on counterfeit goods, and I share their concerns very deeply. I am also concerned about stolen goods. Mr. Bezos are stolen goods sold on Amazon? </p><p>BEZOS: Congresswoman not to my knowledge although there are more than 1 million sellers and so I am sure that there have been stolen goods-- </p><p>MCBATH: Really, Mr. Bezos? </p><p>BEZOS: On Amazon. </p><p>MCBATH: Really, Mr. Bezos? </p><p>BEZOS: I'm sorry? </p><p>MCBATH: They're not? You don't believe that there is, that surprises me. </p><p>BEZOS: No, just with over 1 million sellers, I am sure that it has happened, but certainly, I don't think it is a large part of what we are selling. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay, so Mr. Bezos, basically, then you are saying yes? </p><p>BEZOS: I guess so. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. So I wanted to ask you about information that you require from sellers to prevent the sale of stolen goods. Do you require a real name and address yes or no? </p><p>BEZOS: For sellers? </p><p>MCBATH: Once again, do you require a real name and address from sellers? </p><p>BEZOS: I believe we do, but let--let me get back to your office--I would rather give you the accurate answer, but I think we do. </p><p>MCBATH: And I am aware that you are. So yes, you do require a name and address. Do you require a phone number, yes or no? </p><p>BEZOS: I don't know if it is required. I think we often have it, but I don't know. </p><p>MCBATH: So briefly, then how do you verify that each of these pieces of information is accurate? </p><p>BEZOS: I don't know the answer to your question. </p><p>MCBATH: So you don't know how many people work on verifying seller verification before the seller is allowed to sell on Amazon? </p><p>BEZOS: No, congresswoman, I don't. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay. Then I'm going to ask you, sir, will you commit to reporting all sales of stolen and counterfeit goods to law enforcement and to victims to track large-scale offenders engaged in organized retail crime? </p><p>BEZOS: To the degree that we are aware of it, we will certainly pursue it. In fact I'm-- </p><p>MCBATH: Sir, can you just make a blanket commitment? Can you just make a blanket commitment, whether you are aware of it or not? </p><p>BEZOS: A blanket commitment to--to what? Sorry, congresswoman, I'm trying to be helpful. </p><p>MCBATH: Reporting all sales of stolen and counterfeit goods to law enforcement and to victims to track large-scale offenders engaged in organized retail crime. </p><p>BEZOS: I see no reason why if we are aware of stolen goods, we wouldn't report it. We would want the correct law enforcement authorities to be involved. </p><p>MCBATH: Okay, thank you so much. I yield back my time. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank the gentlelady for yielding back. I want to thank the witnesses for their testimony today and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary work of our team led by Slade Bond, Lena Kahn, Amanda Lewis, Phil Baron Burke, (INAUDIBLE) and Joe (INAUDIBLE) you have done an extraordinary job and throughout this investigation and in preparation for our hearing today. </p><p>Today we had the opportunity to hear from me decision-makers that four of the most powerful companies in the world. This hearing has made one fact clear to me, these companies, as it exists today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. We need to ensure the antitrust laws first written more than a century ago work in the digital age. When these laws were written, a monopolist were men named Rockefeller, and Carnegie. Their control of the marketplace allowed them to do whatever it took to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. Well, the names have changed, but the story is the same. Today the men are name Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai, and Bezos. Once again, they controlled--their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power. This must end. </p><p>The subcommittee will next publish a report on the findings of our investigation. We will propose solutions to the problems before us. As a Great American Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once said, \"We must make our choice, we may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\" This concludes today's hearing. Thank you again to our witnesses for attending. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record, and without objection, this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-78G1-F15W-H200-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

We welcome everyone to today's hearing to explore proposals to strengthen the antitrust laws and restore competition online. </p><p>Before I begin, I would like to remind members that we have established an email address and distribution list dedicated to circulating exhibits, motions, or other written materials that members might want to offer as part of our hearing today. If you would like to submit--submit materials, please send them to the email address that has been previously distributed to your offices, and we will circulate the materials to members and staff as quickly as we can. </p><p>I would also like to remind all members that guidance from the office of the attending physician states that face coverings are required for all meetings in an enclosed space such as committee hearings. I expect all members on both sides of the aisle to wear a mask except when you are speaking. I now recognize myself for an opening statement.  </p><p>Since June 2019, the Antitrust Subcommittee has conducted a bipartisan investigation into the state of competition in digital markets. From the beginning of this process, we promised to perform a top to bottom review including an examination of the business practices and dominance of the largest tech firms--technology platforms Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.  </p><p>Over the past 15 months, we have collected nearly 1.3 million internal documents and communications, a hearing record that totals 1800 pages, testimony from 30 witnesses, submissions from more than 40 antitrust experts of every political persuasion, and interviews with more than 240 market participants, former employees of the investigated platforms and other interested parties. Similar to prior Congressional investigations, we did not set out with any preordained outcome in mind, and we have followed the facts.  </p><p>We have also worked to preserve bipartisan cooperation throughout this process. As my colleague and friend Ken Buck said before our last hearing, and I quote, this is the most bipartisan effort I've been involved with in five and a half years in Congress end quote. Let us continue our work in the same spirit during today's hearing, the seventh and final hearing that we will hold to conclude the subcommittee's investigation.  </p><p>At our last hearing in July, we took the testimony of the chief executive officers of the four leading digital platforms Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. For almost 6 hours, we pressed them for answers about their business practices, including about the evidence we uncover that they have exploited, entrenched, and expanded their power in anti-competitive and abusive ways. To put it simply, their answers were evasive. They were nonresponsive, and they raised new questions about whether they believe their companies are beyond oversight. </p><p>These four corporations differ in important ways, but our investigations identified three problems that each present. First, each platform now serves as a gatekeeper over a key channel of distribution. By controlling access to markets, these giants able to pick winners and losers throughout our economy. Not only do they wield tremendous power, but they are also able to abuses by charging exorbitant fees, imposing oppressive contracts, and extracting valuable personal data from the people and businesses that rely on them.  </p><p>Second, each platform uses their gatekeeper position to protect their own power by controlling the infrastructure of the digital age they have surveilled other businesses to identify potential rivals and ultimately bought out, copied, or cut off their competitive threats. Third, these platforms have abused and it seems will continue to abuse their control to expand their power in the marketplace, whether it's through self-preferencing, predatory pricing, or requiring additional products, the dominant platforms have used their power in destructive ways in order to grow even bigger.  </p><p>Each of these American companies have contributed immense technological breakthroughs and economic value to our country over the past several decades. They were founded on shoestring budgets in dorm rooms and garages and are a testament to our core values as an ec--as a country, but in an effort to promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allow these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight. As a result, the Internet has become highly concentrated, less open, and more hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.  </p><p>To put it simply, these once scrappy underdogs startups have grown into the kinds of monopolies we last saw more than a century ago during the time of oil barons and railroad tycoons. We stand at a crossroads; there is no doubt about that. As part of this hearing, we will discuss paths forward for addressing these competition problems.  </p><p>Today's hearing also concerns broader questions about the overall rise of market power in our economy and potential solutions to arrest this concerning trend. In March subcommittee Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and I sent bipartisan requests for submissions from antitrust and anti-competition policy experts with a diverse range of views on these matters. We requested comments on several questions as part of our review, including whether existing laws and enforcement levels are adequate to prohibit monopolization and anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions in today's economy.  </p><p>In response, we received 38 submissions from dozens of leading experts, including several witnesses testifying at today's hearing, which we have made public in connection with today's hearing. We are joined today by several leading experts in this field who will offer their thoughts on potential remedies for the problems that we have identified over the past 15 months.  </p><p>In closing, I thank our esteemed panel of witnesses for their testimony at today's hearing, and before I conclude, I just want to take a brief moment to recognize the outstanding career of the ranking member of the subcommittee, my friend and colleague Jim Sensenbrenner. It has been a tremendous pleasure working with you this Congress. As part of your distinguished career, you have left an indelible mark on this committee, on the United States Congress, and on our country.  </p><p>You never hesitated to work across party lines in service of hard-working Americans, which is a quality that I hope and doors in the subcommittee in your absence following your retirement from the Congress. As an incoming Chairman, I looked to you for leadership at the beginning of the Congress, and you have been a great source for advice and wisdom to me over the past two years. I thank you for your friendship and for your incredible service to this committee and to our country, and with that, it is my great privilege recognize the Ranking Member of this subcommittee for purposes of making his opening statement. Mr. Sensenbrenner? </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your wonderful words. In looking back at 42 years, you know I tried my best identifying issues, seeing where bipartisan agreement can be made, and then moving forward and during my chairmanship, we were tremendously productive on a bipartisan basis, and since then, I have kind of picked and choose my issues, and this has been one of them.  </p><p>This investigation has been very informative for us to better understand the tech ecosystem. When we began the process--this process more than a year ago, I was very interested to learn about some of the country's largest and most successful companies, these companies Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are ubiquitous in today's America but grasping their influence and size and more importantly what they do with that influence and size was something that Congress needed to examine.  </p><p>Examination on the state of antitrust in the state tech world is wrapping up. We've heard from academics, enforcers, competitors, and notably the big four tech companies themselves. The record is extensive. So we find ourselves today hearing from a panel of witnesses who will tell us exactly what we should do about all of this. The size of this panel reflects the diverse opinions of what is to be done.  </p><p>At our last hearing, I don't believe we needed to change the country's antitrust laws or abandon the consumer welfare standard. It has been my experience after 42 years in Congress that this body is ill-suited to micromanage the economy and probably even worse at predicting what it will look like in the future. I remain skeptical of proposals that break up these companies, mandate a one size fits all data standard or create a government-run quote public option unquote. It appears to me that this would ultimately stifle innovation and be more harmful to consumers.  </p><p>The question we should be answering is whether the law is inefficient to protect the consumer. I believe the American people have been well served by our antitrust framework for decades. By contrast, I don't think that overly burden regulations that break up these companies or have the government insert itself in their operations is the right course of action. Where we need to see improvement is in the enforcement of existing law; however, it should be noted that enforcement is starting to work. </p><p>For more than a year, the DOJ and FTC have been conducting their own antitrust investigations into the big tech companies. It is being reported that as a result of this investigation, DOJ is readying a case against Google. Let us keep in mind as we consider whether a drastic overhaul of antitrust is warranted to meet the goals of the consumer welfare standard.  </p><p>I do want to take a moment to thank Chairman Cicilline for the courtesies that he has extended to me during this process as an effort to keep this investigation bipartisan. I do truly believe that the friendship we have developed, and while we ultimately disagree on the future of antitrust laws and the tech companies, I can say that it has been a pleasure to know you and to work with you. </p><p>[*]SENSENBRENNER: --on this. I also want the record to reflect that the next time we go to dinner, it is Chairman Cicilline's turn to buy. And I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. I now recognize the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler for his opening statement. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman for holding today's hearing. It has been a pleasure to take part in this historic and bipartisan process. As we approached the final months of this session, I want to take a moment to reflect on the subcommittee's substantial efforts during this Congress.  </p><p>The subcommittee has taken a number of concrete steps forward in support of its critical mission to promote open and fair markets for the American people. With an appropriate focus on consumers and workers as well as small and medium sized businesses who were struggling to stay afloat.  </p><p>During the 116th Congress, we have favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee nearly a dozen bipartisan bills developed by the antitrust subcommittee, all of which passed with unanimous support. These include a bipartisan package of bills that ban various types of anticompetitive conduct by branded drug companies, which are vital to stop the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. We were able to enact one of these bills, the CREATES Act into law last year.  </p><p>This act, which was sponsored by subcommittee Chairman Cicilline and Senator Patrick Leahy will cut drug prices by billions of dollars by removing entry barriers for generic competitors. Over the past year, we have also enacted several other important laws that originated with this subcommittee, including laws to ensure that small businesses, veterans, and consumers have access to a fresh start through the bank bankruptcy system.  </p><p>This work is more important than ever as our nation continues to grapple with the devastating economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also passed out of the House for the very first time the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, or the FAIR Act, which restores the rights of every American and small business to their day in court by ending forced arbitration. This important legislation was championed by courts and intellectual property subcommittee Chairman Johnson.  </p><p>Just two days ago, the Judiciary Committee wrote it on--voted out a bill that I sponsored to help address the student loan debt crisis. That legislation makes student loan debt dischargeable in bankruptcy, fixing a great injustice that burdens millions of Americans. I am deeply proud of these efforts and I look forward to continuing our work towards enacting laws that will promote competition, access to the courts, and a fair bankruptcy process, among the subcommittees other important work.  </p><p>Turning to today's hearing, over the past 15 months, the antitrust subcommittee has undertaken historic bipartisan investigation of competition in the digital marketplace. As I made clear at the subcommittee's last hearing, I had significant concerns about consolidation and it's harmful effects. The investigational record board this out. Each of the major companies that were part of this investigation in its own way exerts dominant control in the digital marketplace that has is cause for great concern.  </p><p>As we approach the end of this investigation with the benefit of our six hearings and substantial record, my belief that we must modernize and reinvigorate enforcement of the antitrust laws is stronger than ever. We must modernize our antitrust laws to meet the challenges of our modern economy. We must ensure that our enforcement agencies have the tools, resources and the will to vigorously enforce the law to protect consumers and promote competition.  </p><p>This investigation has also made clear to me that beyond fixing antitrust laws, we must use our oversight authority to shore up the antitrust enforcement agencies ability and will to enforce those laws. In some instances, that lack of enforcement may come down to a lack of will. Our antitrust enforcers should not pull punches. We must ensure that the leadership of these agencies is committed to robust enforcement. It is also important to adequately staff and resource the agencies as antitrust cases have become more resource intensive and agency staff is faced with investigating some of the wealthiest companies of all time.  </p><p>I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and to discussing how we can work together on these important matters going forward. I thank the chairman for holding this hearing and for his leadership of this important investigation. I also want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Sensenbrenner, the chairman emeritus of the full committee for his many years of service to this committee and to the House. He will be sorely missed next Congress. With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentleman and I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan for his opening statement. </p><p>JORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Big tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. It's a fact. I said that two months ago at our last hearing. It's every bit as true today.  </p><p>Democrats have said that they want to take a serious look at the size, power, and influence of these companies, but they've refused our repeated requests that this include an evaluation of how platforms are censoring speech. Maybe it's because the left isn't being censored. We never hear about Mother Jones being demonetized. We don't hear about Young Turks videos being taken down. We don't hear about the Daily Kos(PH) being censored. No. This only happens to conservatives.  </p><p>Google tried to demonetize the Federalist. Amazon censors the Family Research Council. YouTube blocks videos from Senator Blackburn. Twitter--Twitter censors the president but they let the leader of Iran post a statement where it talked--where he says they will strike a blow against American citizens. The last hearing, hour concerns were dismissed as \"conspiracy theories,\" despite this mounting evidence of biased actions against conservatives.  </p><p>Even though you are seeking to radically rewrite antitrust laws, Silicon Valley continues to use its power to carry your water. In fact, the vast majority of political contributions from the very firms you were targeting go to Democrats. You've even denied Republicans, more importantly the American people, the opportunity to hear from Twitter at the last hearing held by this subcommittee. Twitter, I'll remind you, banned four--shadow banned four members of Congress. 435 in the House, 100 in the Senate, 535. Four. Only four. Four conservative Republicans get shadow banned by Twitter. But when we asked you to bring them in, you said no, can't do that.  </p><p>A root cause of big tech censoring conservatives lies with the defects in how the law governing liability online has been applied and interpreted. Rather than stimulate open debate, free exchange of ideas, section 230--section 230 of the communications decency act has given license to platforms to target particular viewpoints, particularly, as I pointed out, those of conservatives.  </p><p>In fact, the otherwise objectionable--\"otherwise objectionable provisioned has been abused by the platforms as a catchall term used to discriminate against any content they find disagreeable. Congress has an obligation to ensure that the rules in place governing accountability online and providing protections for the moderation of content are applied fairly and without undue bias against certain ideologies.  </p><p>Today, a dozen Republican members of this committee introduced legislation to update laws governing the liability, platforms could face when they insert their own opinionated editorial decisions into what content stays up and what content comes down. Our bill amends communications--Communications Decency Act 230 to provide needed clarifications and transparent rules of the road. Importantly, we replaced the vague, otherwise objectionable category with the narrowly tailored categories and make clear that decisions to remove or restrict content are immune from liability only--only in certain specific instances that reasons for these editorial decisions must be made on an objectively reasonable basis, not the subjective standard that is in current law.  </p><p>Legislation also makes clear that decisions to remove content must actually be done in good faith based on predictable criteria. Under the new law, platforms would be required to have publicly available terms of service and state plainly how content moderation decision are being made. And if content is taken down, the platform now must supply the provider of that content with notice explaining the basis for restricting the censorship and provide them with an opportunity to respond.  </p><p>This is common sense reform and I hope--I hope as the ranking member mentioned, I hope we can move on in a bipartisan fashion--basis. Free speech should not be a Republican or Democrat issue. It's a matter at the very heart of our democracy and I look forward to today's discussion.  </p><p>I want to thank our witnesses for appearing and I too want to thank Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, former chairman Sensenbrenner for his decades of work in the United States Congress for the American people. With that, I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. It is now my pleasure to introduce today's witnesses. Our first witness is Bill Baer. Mr. Baer is a visiting fellow in government studies at the Brookings Institution. He's the only person to have ever led antitrust enforcement at both U.S. antitrust agencies as both assistant attorney general from 2013 to 2016 and director of the Bureau of Competition at the Federal Trade Commission from 1995 to 1999.  </p><p>Mr. Baer is--was twice named the best competition lawyer in the world by the global competition review by the National Law Journal as one of the decade's most influential lawyers. He received the FTC's Miles W Kirkpatrick lifetime achievement award in 2005--15. </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: Mr. Baer received his BA from Lawrence University and his JD from Stanford law school where he served as senior article editor at the Stanford Law Review. </p><p>Our second witness is Zephyr Teachout. She is an associate professor of law at Fordham University. Professor Teachout is an expert on antitrust, election, and constitutional law. She was the first director of the Sunlight Foundation and serves on the board of the Open Markets Institute, and she has written dozens of Law Review articles and two books, including Corruption in America, From Ben Franklin's Snuffbox to Citizens United. Professor Teachout received her BA from Yale University and her JD from Duke Law School. </p><p>Our third witness is Michael Kades, the director of markets and competition policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Prior to joining the Equitable Growth, Mr. Kades served as an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission for 20 years. During his time at the commission, he was also an attorney advisor to Chairman John Leibowitz and the deputy trial counsel. Mr. Kades is a graduate of Yale University and University of Wisconsin Law School. </p><p>Sabeel Rahman, our fourth witness, is the president of Demos. Demos is a group dedicated to fighting for a just, inclusive, multiracial democracy. Mr. Rahan is also an associate professor of law at Brooklyn Law School. His writings on democracy, economic power, and inequality have been published in The Atlantic, the New Republic, the Boston Review, Dissent, and the Washington Post. His first book, Democracy Against Domination, won the Dahl prize for scholarship on the subject of democracy. Professor Rahan received his masters degree from the University of Oxford, and both his law and doctorate from Harvard University.  </p><p>The fifth witness at our hearing today is Christopher Yoo, professor of law, communication, and computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He is a frequently cited scholar in administrative and regulatory law, with his primary research focusing on ways to connect more people to the Internet, the Internet's routing architecture, and network neutrality. He's written more than 100 scholarly works and regularly testified before Congress, the FCC, the FTC, and the Department of Justice. Professor Yoo received his AB from Harvard University and his JD from Northwestern Law School. </p><p>Rachel Bovard, our sixth witness, is the Senior Director of policy at the Conservative Policy Institute. She has more than 10 years of experience working in policy in Washington, DC. In 2006, she served as Senator Rand Paul's legislative director. She went on to work on the Senate steering committee under both Senator Pat Toomey and Senator Mike Lee as policy director. She has also served as director of public service--policy services for the Heritage Foundation, and in 2013 she was named one of the National Journal's most influential women in Washington under 35. Ms. Bovard received her BA from Grove City College and her masters from George Washington University. </p><p>Our seventh witness, Tad Lipsky, is the assistant professor and director of the Competition Advocacy Program at the Global Antitrust Institute at Antonin Scalia Law School. Prior to joining the Global Antitrust Institute, Professor Lipsky served as acting director of the FTC's Bureau of competition from February 2017 to July 2017. Over his storied career in antitrust law, Professor Lipsky has served as the Coca-Cola Company's chief antitrust lawyer, the first international officer of the American Bar Association's Section of Antitrust Law, and as the co chair of the International Competition Policy Working Group of the U.S. Chamber Of Commerce. Professor Lipsky received his masters and JD from Stanford University. </p><p>Our last witness, Sally Hubbard, is the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute. Prior to her time with Open Markets, Ms. Hubbard was the senior editor of antitrust enforcement and regulation of tech platforms at the Capital Forum. She has also spent seven years as the Assistant Attorney General at the New York State office of the Attorney General's Antitrust Bureau. Ms. Hubbard earned her bachelor of arts at the College of William and Mary and her JD at New York University School of Law. </p><p>So, as you can see, we have a very distinguished panel and I'm grateful for their presence today. We welcome all of you and thank you for your participation. And I will begin by swearing in our witnesses. And I ask our witnesses testifying in person to rise, and I ask our witnesses testifying remotely to turn on their audio and make sure I can see your face and your raised hand while I administer the oath. </p><p>Do each of you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief so help you God? </p><p>UNKNOWN: Absolutely. </p><p>UNKNOWN: Yes.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you all. You may be seated. Please note that your written statements will be entered into the record in their entirety. Accordingly, I asked that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light in Webex as well as before you. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals your five minutes have expired. </p><p>I would also remind you that you are the only ones that from your respective companies invited to testify today. And in accordance with normal House practice and Section G of the House Remote Committee's Preceding Regulations, I will assume that your sworn testimony is(PH) your own. Please let me know if at any point in the hearing you wish to mute yourself so you can confer with your counsel or other individuals. </p><p>Mr. Baer, you may begin.   </p><p>BAER: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Members Sensenbrenner and--and Jordan, I appreciate the opportunity to appear today and thank you for the courage and tenacity this subcommittee has shown in tackling the role of antitrust law in the 21st century. </p><p>I bring the perspective of someone who--who has been privileged to serve on the front lines of antitrust enforcement in four different administrations, twice in the FTC and most recently as head of antitrust at the Department of Justice. That experience teaches me that in many cases our antitrust laws have been successful and forces for good, but too often antitrust jurisprudence has--has fallen short and failed to protect consumers and competition as--as much is it can and as it should. </p><p>My submission makes four basic points. Antitrust enforcement does need to be based on an analytically sound, fact-based framework. But we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and many courts have held enforcement to an effective standard of proof that is unrealistic and inconsistent with the plain language of our antitrust statutes. If the courts are unwilling to step back from this overreach, legislation may well be needed to reset the balance. And finally, I do believe more resources are needed if antitrust enforcement is to fulfill its role as the economic cop on the beat. </p><p>Now, I was on the scene in the '70s as the Chicago School came to narrow dramatically the focus of antitrust, mostly to price-fixing and a few mergers to monopoly or near-monopoly. The Chicago School, as former FTC chair Bob Pitofsky (SP) put it, really overshot the mark. We went from a place in the 1960s when Supreme Court Justice Stewart complained that the only consistency he could find in Supreme Court antitrust decisions was that the government always wins. We went from there to a 25 year dark age where the government invariably lost. </p><p>Now, we moved the needle somewhat in the '90s, convincing the courts to block merger consolidations; office-supply superstores, drug wholesalers, and to sustain efforts by the government to challenge behavior by Microsoft and Toys 'R Us that limited competitive opportunities for rivals. These modest successes have continued over the last couple of decades as some courts have recognized the anticompetitive impact of hospital consolidation and anticompetitive agreements, pay for delay understandings between generic manufacturers and brand names.  </p><p>But looking back at the cases where the government prevailed in the last couple of decades helps explain why concentration and market power have actually increased. Invariably, when the government won an antitrust challenge, the government's evidence was overwhelming, mergers to monopoly or near-monopoly and transparently bad conduct by dominant firms. In close cases, the government typically lost or enforcers never brought the case in the first place out of fear that the courts would rule against and make more bad law. </p><p>How did we get there? In my view, the fear of getting it wrong worked antitrust enforcement. Antitrust jurisprudence today is too cautious, too worried about the effects of over enforcement, what they call, the social tightness--scientists, type 1 errors. Bias against enforcement has caused many courts to demand a level of proof that is often unattainable that chills enforcement, limits our ability to challenge conduct or acquisitions of potential rivals, especially in the tech sector where firms benefiting from network effects can acquire enduring market power. </p><p>So, what do I think we should do about it? I think we need to modify current law to wreck--to direct the courts and antitrust enforcers to be more assertive in challenging conduct in consolidation that risks creating or enhancing market power. Modest changes will suffice by incorporating presumptions that certain behaviors are--are likely to reduce competition, making it clear that showing a risk of reduction in competition is sufficient. </p><p>[*]BAER: Emphasizing that anticompetitive effects include price and quality innovation competition and legislating to overrule recent problematic court decisions Congress can make a meaningful difference and we need to consider forward-looking rules and legislation that will enhance competition. We have precedent for that, the 2004 FCC rule allowing consumers to port their phone numbers to competing carriers gave consumers the economic power to reward those with lower prices and better service. It forced incumbent carriers to compete like never before. Those sorts of tools, portability, interoperability can help restore markets to a competitive equilibrium. </p><p>Congress also needs to fund antitrust enforcement. Today we spend about 18 percent less than we did 10 years ago despite increasing concentration. A growing number of dominant arms and a much, much larger economy. We need funding both to bring enforcement actions and to allow for after action studies of what happened in markets where the agency has decided not to bring enforcement actions or the courts rejected an antitrust challenge. We can do more and we can do better and thank you again for the opportunity to be here today. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Baer. I now recognize professor Teachout for five minutes. Could you please turn on your microphone? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify at this historic hearing. My expertise is in the law of democracy so I will speak to the essential nature of what you are doing to protect our democracy. </p><p>Laws and strong antitrust laws are essential for freedom and for a thriving economy. The high concentrated big tech marketplaces in the existing abuses of big tech enabled by their dominant positions poses a major democratic threat. It is quintessentially a congressional job to respond to this threat. For nearly 40 years the Supreme Court not Congress has been the primary institution rewriting American antitrust laws. The court is detached from the realities of business and power unaccountable to the public and Congress has essentially allowed them to take the reins gutting popular laws with their own judge made theories and allowing this massive growth of concentrated power. This has to change. Congress not the Supreme Court must be the body responsible for defining the scope of those laws. </p><p>The Sherman act, the Clayton Act, and our other antitrust laws are not constitutional provisions over which Congress must defer interpretations to the court. There are federal laws passed by this body and when they are misinterpreted by courts Congress must act. There are several particular cases that I and others highlight in my written submission that are ripe for direct congressional overturning. But it is not sufficient to pick a handful of cases. This body must recognize it central role in making economic policy and play an ongoing role in the kind of investigations that it has just conducted overseeing agencies and continually re-examining antitrust laws. </p><p>Senator Phil Hart went to his death been working on antitrust legislation. Up until the 1980s this body understood that economic policy and anticorruption policy required ongoing anti-monopoly vigilance. Second, it will not be sufficient to overturn those laws. Significant new legislation is required as your investigation revealed. Key parts of big tech companies have become a kind of essential public infrastructure. The economy and public life would come crashing to a halt if they were suddenly removed, no merchant politician political activist or journalist can thrive without them and few individuals can. </p><p>They play a grossly outsized role in the basic functions of our--our society and have become unelected unaccountable and self-serving heads of planned economies, planned by them. This is deeply problematic infrastructure because they are riven with conflicts of interest. They own platforms and compete on the platforms. So Congress should pass a law people often talk about this in terms of structural separation delineating the single-line and business rules for the very biggest tech companies. </p><p>This single line of business role kind of law exists throughout our nation's history and would lead to things like Amazon for instance being prohibited from being involved in the cell mentor shipping a distinct line of business. A Facebook could not also be engaged in Facebook messenger. Google should not be owning YouTube. </p><p>Finally, I want to applaud the subcommittee for a riveting and critically important investigation and--and argue that Congress must continue with this kind of investigation not just this committee. This should be the beginning of the Golden age of congressional investigations where committees use their investigative power to reveal abuses and address them. As big tech companies become more powerful they are building direct political power. Big tech as you know is the biggest lobbyist in DC and Congress must stand up to these new robber barons to protect our public institutions to restore democratic and economic freedoms and build a thriving, fair, and free country. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Professor Teachout. I now recognize Mr. Kades for five minutes. </p><p>KADES: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, full committee Chairman Nadler, full committee Ranking Member Jordan, and the members of the subcommittee, for the opportunity to testify to you on this important issue and I would like to share the accommodations that my colleague Bill Baer who also gave me my first promotion probably his biggest mistake that this committee really needs to be commended for taking on this topic proceeding despite political the politics in a bipartisan way and it's a really testament to the--to the--to the strength of this nation and democracy. </p><p>The challenges we face are not limited to one or two companies the filing of one or two cases will not solve problems in digital marketplaces. This committee has an ongoing important role in promoting competition in digital markets and so there are three issues I urge you to consider as--as the committee moves forward. First, we need legislative reform not just enforcement actions. Over the past 40 years showing an almost neurotic fear of over enforcement the courts have increased the burdens on plaintiffs nearer the scope of the antitrust laws. Both economic research and empirical results discredit that approach. </p><p>As the letter I along with the 11 other economist and lawyer submitted to this committee concludes the antitrust laws as interpreted and enforced today unnecessarily limit the ability to address the anti-competitive conduct in digital marketplaces that the committee has investigated. So for example under current case law it is arguably-- it is arguable that the government could not have successfully pursued its claim that led to the breakup of the American--the AT&amp;T phone monopoly in the 80s perhaps the most significant monopolization case in the history of the U.S. and maybe the world. Something is simply wrong when judicial decisions implicitly undermine basic competition principles. </p><p>Just yesterday the third circuit Court of Appeals found that the Federal Trade Commission is powerless to punish monopolists. Despite agreeing that a definitive case branded man-made pharmaceutical manufacturer had violated the FTC act and delayed lower cost generic competition the court politely concluded that the FTC could not obtain an injunction to stop the conduct in the future nor good it recover the nearly half $1 billion that the company earned by violating the law. Again something is wrong when the courts decide there are no repercussions for violating the antitrust laws. </p><p>We know how the courts are interpreting the antitrust laws that is-- as professor Teachout just mentioned it is up to Congress to decide whether that is correct but unless Congress acts it is excepting the judicial view that the antitrust laws have little power to stop or deter anti-competitive conduct whether it be in the pharmaceutical industry, digital markets or anywhere else in the economy. Two bills introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, the anti-competitive exclusionary conduct prevention act and the consolidation prevention and competition promotion act-- </p><p>[*]KADES: --Forms that would allow Congress to restore the strength of the antitrust laws. None of this is to suggest that the government should just get a pass from prosecuting antitrust violations against digital platforms. To the contrary, antitrust enforcers have a duty to attack monopoly power with where they find it, despite these challenges.  </p><p>This leads me to my second point. A key remedy in an antitrust case involving digital platforms needs to be to under--once a violation has occurred, the remedy needs to eliminate the network effects that create entry barriers. And I talk about this more fully in my statement, but that means when we think about remedy, prohibiting conduct, penalizing the companies, even breaking them up all may not be sufficient to restore competition. So that's the challenge the enforcers will have going forward.  </p><p>Finally, I want to commend also the committee for thinking broadly about solving competition. This is not just about competition antitrust enforcement, or regulation. We need both tools, as my colleague Sally Hubbard reminds me often. So this committee is correct to be considering both regulatory tools as part of that solution.  </p><p>Protecting competition in digital marketplaces requires that the laws efficiently distinguish between pro and anti-competitive conduct, that remedies deal with the underlying structural problems causing the anticompetitive activity, and a combination of antitrust enforcement of regulations so that markets deliver the results the benefit us all. And I have nine seconds. I just want to say, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, one of my favorite things was as I would drive to clerk for Judge Reynolds back in the early 90s through your district and I would complain about the traffic. He would always explain to me we don't complain about that traffic because we like James Sensenbrenner even when we don't agree with him. So I thought this was an appropriate time to share that story with you.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Kades. I now recognize Professor Rahman for five minutes. </p><p>RAHMAN: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, members of the subcommittee and the full committee. Grateful for this opportunity to participate in this hearing with you all on this critical issue of reinvigorating our competition policy in the online economy. As president of Demos, we're focused very much on this idea of how we build an inclusive and equitable democracy and economy. And the work of this subcommittee is critical to that vision.  </p><p>Tech platforms are our modern infrastructure, like roads, bridges, telecom and poses unique regulatory and policy challenges that this committee and its recommendations will have to consider. In short, as some of our colleagues have already mentioned, we will have to engage both structural tools (INAUDIBLE) break up as well as regulatory tools, and I'll talk about that in these next few minutes.  </p><p>So if we think about the physical infrastructure of our ordinary life, roads, telecom, bridges, electric utilities, there's some basic rules of the road that we need from them to actually serve the goals of economic innovation, serving consumers and communities, and ensuring that all of us are able to benefit in the (INAUDIBLE) growth of our economy. We need to make sure that these infrastructures don't discriminate on basis of price, on basis of race. We need to ensure that they don't self-deal the kinds of conflicts of interest that Professor Teachout mentioned or a big problem.  </p><p>We also need to make sure that our basic infrastructure isn't toxic, right? We wouldn't want people who drive on the roads to then get sick from driving on those roads. And we want to make sure that they don't entrench themselves. That the fact that one how we exists doesn't mean that we can't build another faster highway that takes us--that shortens time on the route. These are the kinds of challenges that we actually face in the digital environment.  </p><p>So let me give two quick examples highlighted by the work of this subcommittee. If we take Amazon, for example, we've seen in the hearings of this subcommittee over these last few months how Amazon has leveraged its dominance over online retail transactions to undercut its competitors to engage in predatory pricing and to stifle innovation. This impact is not just on the economy and on growth. </p><p>It is also particularly hard felt impact one black, brown, indigenous communities when you think about the impact on small businesses, for example. That market dominance has been in turn also enabled Amazon to pressure state and local governments for more favorable regulatory treatment and subsidies and to avoid the kinds of liabilities for its workplace safety, particularly at a time where we see black and brown essential workers facing astronomically high injury rates, double the industry average and where Amazon warehouses have themselves become hotspots for COVID transmission.  </p><p>Facebook offers another example. With the election rapidly approaching, we've seen the dangers of an ad based, data mining based business model where an online information platform like Facebook uses algorithms that maximize user attention in order to sell targeted ads. That essentially means that our information infrastructure of Facebook is actually incentivized to allow the rapid spread of toxic misinformation, disinformation, hate speech attacks on black and brown speakers in particular. Here too, we see the burden is felt disproportionately on black and brown communities.  </p><p>The policy response to this type of problem has to grapple with the fact that we need--in some ways we want infrastructure to enable communication, to enable new innovation. That infrastructure has to serve all of us, has to serve the economy as a whole rather than being a basis for the kind of entrenchment that Professor Teachout mentioned. So I want us to suggest in the last minute and a half briefly some of the policy strategies that this committee should consider.  </p><p>First, we need to include structural separations and breakups as part of the policy toolkit. Congress can legislate standards to this effect and also reinvigorate the enforcement powers of agencies like the FTC to pursue the kinds of functional separations, outline of business separations that will be important. Second, we need to complement breakups and structural separations with regulatory standards and public standards that enforce those basic rules of the road for our digital infrastructure. That means standards for nondiscrimination and for portability, labor and consumer protection standards, basic--basic rules of the road that we see in all other parts of the economy that we need to bring to the digital space.  </p><p>Third, there might be instances where we might want public provision, as has been mentioned already, in order to ensure fair and equal access and to provide the kind of competitive pressure that is sometimes lacking in these markets. These are all familiar and doable policies. They are in fact common in our history and our tradition going back a century ago and over the years. And in fact, the use of these tools has enabled the kind of innovation and dynamism that has brought the gains of many of these last few decades of economic growth.  </p><p>As my time is winding down, I'll just note that these policies, these strategies are essential to rebuilding our economy in this moment of crisis that will be need--these policies will be a central as we move forward out of the current crisis that we are in. Thank you very much and I yield back my time.  </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Professor Rahman. And I now recognize Professor Yoo for five minutes. New  </p><p>YOO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Subcommittee Member Sensenbrenner, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Jordan, and the members of the subcommittee, I applaud the subcommittee for its review of how antitrust laws should apply to digital markets. In sifting through the various reform proposals before you, I would encourage this subcommittee to keep in mind key three key principles.  </p><p>The first is the importance of maintaining antitrust longstanding commitments to protecting consumers of the competitors. The second is the key role played by innovation and the importance of flexibility and promoting innovation. And the third is that many remedies work far worse in practice than they sound in theory. I'll explore these three themes by examining two of their proposed reforms that have already come up today by restricting companies to a single line of business and mandating affordability and interoperability.  </p><p>Beginning first with line of business restrictions, there's strong evidence that proposals to prevent companies from entering complementary lines of business would likely harm consumers. The reality is that all companies do more than one thing and consumers typically benefit. And to cite one specific example, my colleague Herbert Heidkamp has noted that allowing Amazon to sell private label products has provided enormous consumer benefit by allowing them to pay lower prices. </p><p>In addition, we've seen Amazon expand from just an ecommerce platform into cloud computing and other aspects that have been tremendously beneficial. If you look at the surveys of the literature on vertical integration conducted by anti-force--antitrust enforcement officials from both parties, those surveys confirm that, although the theoretical studies hypothesize ways that vertical integration could harm consumers, the real word--world data indicate that it is much more likely to benefit consumers.  </p><p>These results underscore the importance of assessing consumer welfare based on system--systematic, real world evidence and not abstract theoretical possibilities or anecdotes. Sorry. Restricting companies to a single line of business can also harm innovation. For example, in 2005, U.S. mobile operating systems were a sleepy market dominated by Palm, BlackBerry, Symbian, and Microsoft. Apple IOS appeared in 2007 and then Android followed in 2008 and these new entrants employed innovative new business models based on vertical innovation and third party payments that reduced direct cost by consumers that went beyond the original lines of business of justice simply mobile operating systems.  </p><p>In so doing, these new entrants unleashed the smartphone revolution that has provided tremendous benefits for consumers. </p><p>[*]YOO: This history provides useful examples of how consumers benefit when companies at least have the breathing room to experiment with different approaches, and contrary rules would risk ruling particular business models out of balance.  </p><p>And so, the case-by-case approach of traditional antitrust is better suited to promoting innovation than would anti--ex-ante prohibitions. This is particularly important in dynamic industries where technological change frequently renders particular verbal formulations of ex-ante rules obsolete. </p><p>Now, regarding data portability and interoperability, another common but interesting problem is that large platform such as Google and Facebook already provide for data portability, and yet consumers almost never avail themselves of this feature. Understanding why requires a deeper appreciation of what mandating data portability and interoperability actually requires. </p><p>For data portability and interoperability to be meaningful, the data must be in a standardized format. To do otherwise would like to be trying to fit the proverbial square peg into the round hole. The reality is that different companies structure their data in radically different ways, and reconfiguring data is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, mandating data portability and interoperability imposes in--standardization costs and has the unfortunate effect of picking winners and losers. As Ranking Member Sensenbrenner noted, the results would be to force data into a one-size-fits-all approach. </p><p>In addition, interoperability can be only imposed under certain circumstances. We've learned over time that it works when interfaces are relatively simple. They're easy to monitor and require little information. The type of data interfaces we're talking about in this series of proceedings seem to represent a complex interface that has not historically been embeddable to mandated interoperability. </p><p>And importantly, data formats are tied directly to innovation. The structure of data determines what types of uses are and are not possible. Forcing data into a particular format would inevitably preclude certain types of important innovation. </p><p>Together, these considerations suggest that seemingly simple remedies are going to (INAUDIBLE) likely to prove hard to implement and create hidden consumer harms in terms of cost and loss of innovation, and that the traditional case-by-case approach, fact intensive and specific, should be more beneficial. </p><p>In closing, I would like to emphasize that it is tempting to ask antitrust to provide--to serve a wide range of goals beyond its traditional role in protecting competition. While there are many important rules, any--asking one law to do too much risks causing it to be ineffective and doing nothing. I believe U.S. citizens would be best served if antitrust continues to retain its traditional focus on promoting consumer welfare and competition in markets. Thank you very much. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Yoo. I now recognize Ms. Bovard for five minutes. </p><p>BOVARD: Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, Chairman Nadler, and Ranking Member Jordan, thank you for inviting me to testify today.  </p><p>A growing bipartisan consensus is emerging against the power of the big tech companies. This consensus is based on the recognition that corporate hegemony, that is concentrated power exercised at scale, can be a threat to individual liberty, the free market, an independent thought in a free society. To that end, I started the Internet Accountability Project in 2019 to give a voice to conservatives concerned about the growing concentrated power of big tech as it is exercised and weaponized at unprecedented levels. </p><p>IAP has focused its efforts on three areas of policy remedy; antitrust enforcement, data privacy and ownership, and reform of Section 230, which one pro-tech law professor has identified as big tech's implicit financial subsidy. That big tech systematically engages in viewpoint and information bias is increasingly obvious. Here are a few recent examples. </p><p>Dr. Scott Atlas, neuroradiologist and professor at Stanford Medical School, has been accused of spreading medical misinformation by Google's YouTube, but only after he joined the White House's coronavirus task force. A deep investigation into Google by the Wall Street Journal founded the company \"made algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big businesses over small ones.\" The investigation also found that Google modified its search results around topics like abortion and immigration. </p><p>In June, Google polluted with NBC News to flex its muscles against the conservative news site The Federalist for minor violations of its ad policies in their comments section. In July, the search engine inexplicably stopped presenting search results for several leading conservative websites. </p><p>Conservatives are routinely told that bias is a myth, but that assertion is unprovable because these tech companies are not at all transparent about their algorithmic and content moderation practices, but they should be. These decisions have profound impact on the nature of free thought and expression when done at a scale at which these companies exist. A single algorithmic decision made by individuals in a private corporation accountable to no one changes what kind of viewpoints and information are available to billions of people around the world. </p><p>Antitrust enforcement, the subject of this committee's remit, is equipped to tackle corporate hegemony. It is the view of myself and the Internet Accountability Project that our antitrust laws do not need to be updated, that the laws on the books are sufficient for tackling per se violations of antitrust as they exist in the tech sector.  </p><p>Antitrust enforcement is not regulation. It is law enforcement. As conservatives, we do not support legal amnesty for those who violate our nation's laws, and this should be extended to corporations who violate competition laws in the market. Though antitrust application to so-called speech concerns may not be direct, proper enforcement of the law against violations where they exist would certainly have positive downstream effects. </p><p>Antitrust enforcement does not occur in a vacuum. Enforcing against the monolithic dominance of these companies in one sector, if warranted, could free up the market in such a way that concerns over viewpoint bias could be competed away in ways big tech's market dominance now makes impossible. Conservatives who rightly champion the innovation generated by a free market should be equally vigilant about maintaining the integrity of that marketplace. To borrow the old adage from Ronald Reagan, trust but verify. </p><p>Conservatism properly understood follows a tradition of skepticism when it comes to concentrations of power. As Barry Goldwater wrote in Conscience of a Conservative, \"Let us henceforth make war on all monopolies, whether corporate or union. The enemy of freedom is unrestrained power and the champions of freedom will fight against the concentration of power wherever they find it.\" Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Ms. Bovard. Professor Lipsky is now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>LIPSKY: Thank you, Chairman Cicilline. And thank you also to Ranking Member Sensenbrenner as well as Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan. Good to see you. You have my statements for the record. And I'm--given the length of the witness list, I'm going to try and summarize very briefly. </p><p>130 years ago, a gigantic network industry arose as one of the greatest economic manifestations of the second Industrial Revolution in the United States, and that was the railroads. And Congress addressed many grievances and problems with the performance of the railroads into fundamentally different ways.  </p><p>In 1887, it passed the first major federal sectoral regulation, creating the Interstate Commerce Commission to enforce the Interstate Commerce Act, which was a method of directly regulating competitive outcomes in the railroad industries. And in 1890 it enacted the Sherman Act, which very simply prohibited restraints of competition; conspiracies and monopolization. </p><p>It's 130 years later. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the Interstate Commerce Act are gone, but antitrust thrives and competition thrives, and the success of--of the American economy thrives. In the very early stages of Sherman Act interpretation, the Supreme Court, taking a common-law approach as Congress intended, very quickly determined that cartel activity was to be condemned per se. But then in 1898 in the Addyston Pipe and Steel case, it confirmed that--that a restraint could be reasonable if it had a sensible relationship to a transaction with a lawful purpose. </p><p>And except for the 1911 imposition of the per se rule against retail price fixing, a long period of time happened in which the courts were trying to feel their way through the complex issues that naturally arise when the antitrust laws are--are applied to particular industries. And there's--there are nice judgments that were required to be made to determine what is anticompetitive and what is procompetitive.  </p><p>Then in the late New Deal, in the second rose--FDR term, under the leadership of Assisting Attorney General Jackson and--and his successor, Thurman Arnold, something-- </p><p>[*]LIPSKY: --changed in antitrust enforcement with the encouragement of the antitrust agencies the courts became far more willing to deprive companies of any right to defend their conduct either using economic arguments or trying to show on the basis of facts and circumstances that what they were doing was justifiable, procompetitive, that they lack market power or--or to present any other defense. This was the start of--of the so-called per se rule arrow which occurred around 1945 with the associated press decision a number of patent licensing practices were condemned per se and on and on until when you reach United States versus Topco almost any type of conduct challenge by a plaintiff or by the government was condemned per se or--or very strong presumption against business conduct the legality of business conduct was adopted by the courts. </p><p>But simultaneously with the end of that era America's economic fortunes started to go south. We had severe competition from companies arising in Europe and Asia and many of our leading industries began to see negative results and our country entered a period of stagflation. Scholars and academics and law and economics pointed this out in the 60s and 70s and they weren't all from Chicago. As a matter of fact you could say that the study of economics and its application to antitrust law was probably most notably introduced antitrust enforcement by Lyndon Johnson's first assistant attorney general for antitrust Don Turner who had both a Harvard PhD in economics and a Yale law degree and who advocated very strongly that economic analysis be used as the touchstone for antitrust. </p><p>And fortunately in the mid-70s the Supreme Court began to take that up and ever since there has been a very powerful consensus in the courts, the bar, the agencies, antitrust practitioners and businesses that have to deal with the very severe antitrust remedies then comply with the law that the focus on competition rather than competitors and the ability to defend oneself based on facts and circumstances and the willingness of the courts to listen at least listen to economic arguments those are critical to successful application of the antitrust laws to the economy not to destroy the economy but to help it grow and the Supreme Court and other courts have shown very great flexibility and understanding and absorbing new economic learning and applying it to (INAUDIBLE) technology industries as in the Microsoft case--to Microsoft cases that were litigated in the 1990s and the latter one result in 2001 and most recently for example in the Ohio versus American Express case. </p><p>It is not a--it is not a right left Republican Democrat liberal conservative issue. Successful implementation of the mandate for competition in the antitrust laws encourages innovation which is the main driver of economic growth and it ensures that our economy continues to grow and prosper and so I want to associate myself with Senator--with Representatives Sensenbrenner's remarks. I think things are--are very well positioned and I would caution aggressively against any extensive innovate--intervention in our common law system of interpreting the mandate of our basic antitrust-- </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you Mr. (INAUDIBLE) we have gone over our time significantly but the gentleman yields back I now recognize Sally Hubbard for five minutes. </p><p>HUBBARD: Chairman Cicilline and(PH) Ranking Member Sensenbrenner and members of the subcommittee thank you for inviting me to speak with you today and for conducting this critically important investigation. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google started on their paths to dominance with innovation but you have uncovered major evidence that the platforms have used anti-competitive conduct and acquisitions to grow and maintain their monopoly power. They have violated the antitrust laws as they now stand. You have opened up Americans' eyes to the widespread harms that flow from the illegal monopolization of digital markets. </p><p>If there's one thing that most Americans still can't see what our lives, economy and country could look like if these markets were open and competitive. We have been under monopoly rule for so long we are suffering from a crisis of imagination so let's take a moment and envision the possibilities of what America could be. I see an America where anyone can pursue an innovative business idea, get it funded, and build a company that doesn't get crushed by giants protecting their turf. </p><p>Diverse ideas and founders flourish, small and big companies can decline platforms extractive terms of dealing, stop paying them taxes and tolls, reap the rewords of their ingenuity and pay their employees more. Strong antitrust enforcement creates new waves of innovation like when the government broke up AT&amp;T and when U.S. the Microsoft pave the way for Google to exist by stopping Microsoft from taking over every market that touched its monopoly. </p><p>I see an America where creators of all types from musicians to journalist enjoy the fruits of their labor no longer siphoned off by big tech. I see an America where no company has concentrated control over speech. Public discourse flows freely not subject to business models that this divisive and incendiary content where when we all see the same speech we can respond to it with cameras speech as the First Amendment requires. This vision of America can be ours if we defeat the robber barons of today just like we have done before using the antitrust laws. Some say antitrust isn't the right solution and some of their fix is the answer but we are in a crisis. This isn't an either or situation, it's a both and situation. We must attack the monopoly rule from every angle. For example we also need privacy laws but regulation doesn't work when monopolist are too powerful to comply or when monopolist shape the laws themselves. </p><p>Others say antitrust is being weapon eyes for improper purposes but Senator Sherman always intended to save America from Kings of commerce and if we open up markets by ending platforms anti-competitive tactics and deals a wide range of benefits will follow. Enforcing the antitrust laws won't magically solve all of our problems but we won't be able to cure America's ills if we don't first disperse monopolies concentrated power by unlocking competition. Of course the tech giants each provide useful services but providing some benefits does not give them a free pass to break the antitrust laws. </p><p>Unfortunately, our laws have been attacked by the courts for decades making enforcement expensive and hard. Even so enforcers need to bring more cases and be more willing to risk losing in court. Ultimately we are depending on you, Congress, to fix this. Congress should use bright line rules and presumptions to remove complexity and make antitrust cases easier, faster, and cheaper. Congress should overrule the legal precedent that imposes obstacles for monopolization and merger cases. Congress should also structurally eliminate the platforms, conflicts, and interest and remove their incentive and abilities to self-preference. It should separate platforms from commerce and divest business lines. The U.S. has used structural separation as a standard regulatory tool and antitrust remedy in network industries. </p><p>Congress should require the platforms to offer equal access on equal terms to all protecting citizens as sellers of goods and services consumers and us speakers. Lawmakers should open up competition through interoperability and eat immediately in order to preserve our elections Congress should ban the surveillance based hyper targeting of content. Advertising should be done based on context not identity. This is a turning point for our nation. Our democracy is hanging in the balance. The time to act is now decisively and with courage. </p><p>Speaking to my fellow Americans in order for your elected representatives to stand up to monopoly power they need you behind them. The tech giants have endless lobbying funds but we the people can once again rise up and prevail against monopolist. Thank you very much. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you, Ms. Hubbard. Thank you all for your opening statements and now we will begin questioning under the five minute rule and I will begin with the Chairman of the full committee Mr. Nadler you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. As I said in my opening statement I strongly believe that we must modernize our antitrust laws to meet the challenges of the modern economy. We must update the antitrust laws to reiterate as Justice Thurgood Marshall said that antitrust laws are the Magna Carta of free enterprise. They are as important to the preservation of economic freedom and our free enterprise system as the bill of rights is to the protection of our fundamental personal freedoms. What do each of you think is the most important thing we can do from a legislative standpoint to address the deficiencies of current antitrust law? Start with Mr.-- </p><p>BAER: Baer. </p><p>NADLER: Baer. </p><p>[*]BAER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just briefly I think we need to modify the standard by which we judge mergers. The current law says mergers that may tend substantially to reduce competition are problematic. But the way the courts have interpreted that, they've read the word tend to--out of the law. I think we moved to a materially reduced competition standard, that will help us attack more anticompetitive mergers.  </p><p>Second thing I think is to deal with section two of the Sherman Act and basically where a company gets of a certain size an engages in conduct that appears to have a significant effect on limiting opportunities for rivals, that that needs to be a potential cause of action where the courts will evaluate whether the procompetitive benefits or whatever that behavior is are vastly outweighed by the potential harm to consumers and the competition. That's where I would focus, on those two areas. </p><p>TEACHOUT: There are three primary areas of focus. The first, especially since we're talking about big tech is structural separation. I think that's quite urgent. And again, your investigation has shown the incredible abuse is of platforms that are also allowed to own companies that compete on those platforms. That's major legislation that I think this body should push.  </p><p>Second, a--the series of cases, some of which were just mentioned, the cases that predatory pricing trio of casing cases I think is really important. This is a Brooke Group Weyerhaeuser and other cases that make incredibly hard to prove that companies are engaged in predation. That's important to overturn along with Trinko, Twombly, the series of cases which I and others have outlined and I would approach those as a set, which comes to my third point, which is that I would be very clear that the purpose of antitrust law includes the protection of Liberty and the support of a decentralized economy and move past the consumer welfare standard which has not been successful over the last 40 years.  </p><p>I said three, but the fourth thing that I think we need to do in this arena is something that both Ms.--Ms. Hubbard and Mr. Rahman mentioned, which is in the communications infrastructure in particular, ban targeted advertising. It's truly toxic. It's undermining our democracy. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you. Mr. Baer, as you previously testified in 2016, there's been any upstream upswing an extremely large complex and blatantly anticompetitive transactions that never should have made it out of the boardroom. Why is it that this trend is continued and possibly even worsened and what can Congress or the agencies do to deter companies from brazenly proposing transactions that are so clearly anticompetitive?  </p><p>BAER: As I said earlier, Mr. Chairman, I think the standard as interpreted by the courts, the current standard of Clayton Act, our merger statute. It--the courts have sort of applied a one way ratchet. It gets tougher and tougher for the government successfully to challenge mergers. It is nearly impossible to challenge today an acquisition by a dominant firm of a nascent competitor, something that isn't a large rival today but could well be tomorrow.  </p><p>Legislative changes that basically make it clear that once a firm achieves a certain dominance that the burden shifts to justify that its acquisition of small potential rival, we think Facebook, right, Instagram and WhatsApp, they need to justify why this isn't a problematic merger, why it doesn't eliminate somebody who either on its own or together with merging with somebody else might well become an alternative platform to a dominant platform today. </p><p>NADLER: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Sensenbrenner for five minutes.  </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Lipsky, what shortcomings in the antitrust laws, if any, prevented the Obama-Biden era regulations from examining or blocking some of the transactions that have been scrutinized by this investigation? For instance, when Facebook acquired Instagram and was greenlit by the FTC. I'm not asking you to second guess that decision, but rather to discuss whether the existing antitrust laws were insufficient to allow for a proper review.  </p><p>LIPSKY: Thank you, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner. My view is that there are no deficiencies in the antitrust laws. In fact, over the years, our--the legal apparatus built up for the prevention of anticompetitive mergers has become truly formidable. There was some initial question that the Sherman Act as past applied to corporate transactions, but any doubt about that was eliminated with passage of the Clayton Act in 1914 and then again the standards were the Clayton Act was broadened and the standards were clarified by the Seller key offer (SP) amendments to the Clayton Act in 1950.  </p><p>And then in 1976, you had Hart-Scott-Rodino, which essentially made it impossible for any significant transaction to be consummated until the federal authorities had been notified of the nature of the transaction, the competitive activities of the parties and give them very ample opportunity with tremendous discovery powers to investigate and to go to court prior to consummation of the transactions. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: So you're saying that the existing statutes at that time of the Facebook, Instagram buyout were sufficient to do a proper review? </p><p>LIPSKY: I do say that. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Okay. Now, Mr. Baer, this was before your time as chief honcho in the antitrust division, but I think you were wrong at the time. Would you care to respond to that? </p><p>BAER: As I indicated, Mr. Sensenbrenner, my law school classmate and friend Tad Lipsky and I have a bit of a disagreement on this. I do think you look at Instagram or WhatsApp and you look at some of the documents that were revealed in this committee's--subcommittee's most recent hearing, these were companies that potentially either on their own or in combination with other companies had potential to be rivals. It wasn't clear they were going to be, but by allowing Facebook to grab these folks up when they were small, Facebook I think according to the documents your investigation has--has uncovered recognized these firms as potential rivals.  </p><p>Current law does not allow the FTC or my old place the antitrust division to challenge those transactions. You need to be a significant actual potential competitor in the marketplace in order for any antitrust laws to apply. I'm sorry. Go ahead.  </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: You're--you're essentially saying that the law that was in effect at the time, which I don't think has been significantly changed then prevented the enforcement during the Obama years. </p><p>BAER: That's correct. And I think modest changes to the current statute would allow us to go after those kind of acquisitions by dominant firms. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Do you know if DOJ requested an amendment to those laws so that they could be more active in enforcing them? </p><p>BAER: I think while I was there that debate was just beginning and as I've watched what's happened to the antitrust laws since then, the way the courts have, as I indicated this one way ratchet imposing more and more conditions on the government to meet its burden of proof that we are at a place where some tweaks to the antitrust laws would help the courts understand better what the congressional intent was at the time and is today. I'm sorry to filibuster here. </p><p>SENSENBRENNER: Okay, Senator. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>You know, I guess, you know, my observation on, you know, on this is that, you know, we hear from DOJ and FTC all the time when they think laws are inadequate and they come and crack the whip on us to say let's get it fixed, let's get it fixed right away. Not tomorrow, but yesterday. And there wasn't any real move on the Department of Justice or the FTC to get those laws fixed if this merger prevented an enforcement of the laws.  </p><p>You know, the final point I'd like to make is, you know, I think that antitrust law passed to be continued to be focused on consumer welfare rather than deviating in into other problem areas. If we go back to the basics and enforced those basics, a lot of the complaints that we heard during the previous hearing when the CEOs were here never would have existed. And I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson for five minutes. </p><p>[*]JOHNSON: I thank the gentleman for hosting this hearing. It's been a very important hearing, and it's been a very important topic and it's time for Congress to act. I'm happy to be part of this monumental effort. </p><p>Mr. Rahman, in July I asked Apple's CEO Tim Cook about Apple's power and control over the App Store. I'm still troubled that, in order to sell in the App Store, Apple forces app developers to comply with rules it makes up as it goes along. It develops and sells apps that compete with the app developers who need to be in the App Store in order to gain access to the 100 million Americans who use iPhones, and it also paces--also forces those app developers to--to pay a 30 percent--it holds them over a barrel and makes them pay 30 percent of whatever they get out of the App Store for selling their product. So, it's like the fox owning the henhouse and pimping the--the chickens and then eating the chickens. </p><p>Mr. Rahman, in your written statement you address the concept of gateway power as a type of infrastructure power that the antitrust laws should address. Can you elucidate a little more on gateway power and how the App Store exploits its gateway power? </p><p>RAHMAN: Yeah. Thank you very much, Congressman. And it's such an important question because I think all of the platforms that we're talking about in these hearings have this type of gateway power. And I--I love that metaphor you used, the--the fox owning the henhouse. </p><p>The way this works is, if you build--if you build the kind of infrastructure that everybody needs to--to access basic goods and services, in this case the App Store, same argument you can make about Facebook or Google, because we all need to get entry into the marketplace, if I'm an app developer, that means that the owner of the App Store, the owner--the person who controls the gates has a lot of control, a lot of power to--and can demand--make unreasonable demands, right, on anyone who needs to gain access to that marketplace, to that ecosystem. </p><p>And so, that--they--they may not always use that power in--benevolently. They may not always use it in an extractive way. But they have that power nonetheless because they have something that any entrepreneur or business developer needs, which is access to the marketplace.  </p><p>So, this is why I think it's so important that any remedy include some basic rules of the road, that if you're going--if you build that kind of infrastructure and you own the control, the gateway, the access point, it's incumbent upon you as the firm who controls that gateway to observe basic standards of fair treatment, of nondiscrimination, and so forth. And that would provide regulators with the tools that Congress provided them, tools to enforce against those types of practices. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you. Ms. Teachout, Amazon has much the same relationship with vendors on its platform. Can you tell us your thoughts about how this works and how consumers are harmed, how the--how small businesses are harmed, and what Congress should do in order to alleviate this imbalance in our--in our commerce? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Thank you. There are, I believe, about 2 million small business owners that depend upon Amazon to get their goods to market. In your investigation, along with the research of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, has shown that Amazon charges as much as 30 percent of every sale--Amazon takes as much as 30 percent of every sale when those sellers sell on Amazon on average. </p><p>This is essentially a form of private tax. And when you talk to Amazon sellers, as you have, you hear about the incredible fear that Amazon sellers have and a kind of rational paranoia about how the algorithms are treating them, and their own beliefs that they need to purchase ancillary Amazon services, something that your investigation revealed is a legitimate belief, as Bezos admitted that use of fulfillment has an impact on the algorithm for the sellers. </p><p>And--and that's really dangerous for democracy, but it also leads to inequality, because that is essentially Amazon standing like a--at the narrowest port--point in a pathway at a chokepoint moment and demanding 30 percent of every sale. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you. Ms. Hubbard, do you believe Section 2 of the Sherman Act is sufficient to address the conduct that we are discussing? </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired, but the witness may answer the question. </p><p>HUBBARD: Thank you, Congressman. I do not believe Section 2 is sufficient because the self-preferencing and self-prioritization is so rampant that is basically a game of whack a mole. There's a myriad of ways that these owners of the platforms can privilege their own products and services.  </p><p>And it's nearly impossible to police them all, not to mention because often it's being done through algorithms that are not transparent and are completely opaque. So, that's why I advocate for the structural separation as a way to remove the incentive and ability of these platforms to prioritize their own products and services. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, and I yield back.  </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I recognize the distinguished gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Buck, for five minutes. </p><p>BUCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing. I appreciate the bipartisan and thorough nature in which you have conducted this investigation. </p><p>I want to start by reiterating one of the nation's most important founding principles. As Professor Teachout noted, Congress writes our laws and the courts interpret those laws. In the words of my fellow Coloradan, Justice Gorsuch, judges wear robes, not capes. The American people elect their representatives every two years. Our constituents hold us accountable for our votes in a way that judges are not. </p><p>It's worth remembering this as we examine big tech anticompetitive action and our nations antitrust regime more broadly. It's clear that are antitrust enforcement agencies have hobbled themselves by--by observing judicial interpretations instead of adhering to the letter of the law, which hampers enforcements agency's ability to bring cases against industries that do not have a defined price structure or offer free services like big tech. </p><p>Congress did not intend for regulators to only bring antitrust cases based on price differential. In fact, lawmakers intentionally wrote the Sherman and Clayton Acts with an open ended consumer welfare framework to enable antitrust enforcement agencies to bring cases also related to quality, output, consumer choice, or potential innovation in the marketplace. </p><p>Following this original standard would allow regulators to review big tech mergers that offer free services while relying on seller--selling user data or make acquisitions based on potential competition. Data presented by McKinsey and Company further shows how dangerous relying solely on price change doctrine can harm the economy. McKinsey's data shows that return on capital in many industries, including restaurants, auto parts stores, department stores, and oil and gas companies has remained nearly steady over the past 50 years. However, to industries show rapid growth, big pharma and big tech. </p><p>There is a breakdown occurring in the digital economy. A small number of tech titans are using anticompetitive means to grow their marketplace dominance and control the channels of distribution. Our nation's law enforcement agencies can't keep pace.  </p><p>For example, Facebook's acquisition of Instagram was allowed to proceed primarily because there was no defined price change to the consumer. This review didn't take into account Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg's stating his desire to purchase Instagram centered on buying an up-and-coming competitor before they could overtake Facebook's market dominant position. </p><p>This case shows exactly why the current price focused model of antitrust enforcement misses the mark and fails to account for potential innovation and consumer choice. Congress should lead the way with a meaningful solution to ensure our enforcement agencies are adhering to the original intent of the law, not judicial interpretations.  </p><p>If we don't provide constructive action to address these issues, the progressive left will undoubtedly push for an oppressive regulatory regime. Anew Dodd-Frank, along with a CFPB-like agency overseeing the Internet, will only benefit big tech firms and harm future innovation. </p><p>This shouldn't be the only action Congress takes though. This committee should work together to ensure our antitrust regulators of the tools and resources necessary to conduct a meaningful oversight and successfully bring enforcement cases against bad actors. Currently, the FTC and DOJ antitrust division's combined enforcement budget stands at approximately $510 million. Conducting effective oversight and lodging antitrust reviews is difficult when your budget is only a minor fraction of big tech's approximately $2 trillion market share. </p><p>[*]BUCK: unfailingly deep pockets to combat litigation, comply with regulatory requirements and pay expert witnesses. Our law enforcement agencies can't keep up with this onslaught. Congress should consider allocating more funds to the FTC and DOJ to ensure that they have the proper resources to conduct serious investigations and enforce antitrust laws. We should also work to ensure these agencies can recruit and retain the best possible talent to achieve the mission. </p><p>We also need to seriously consider increasing scrutiny on big tech companies including shifting the burden of proof required for a market dominant company to prove that a merger is not anti-competitive. These changes may stop market dominant companies from further consolidating the tech center in an anti-competitive manner. As a conservative I want to see Congress reassert its article 1 duties to write(PH) our nation's law. As a former prosecutor I understand how important it is for our nation's law enforcement agencies to have the tools necessary to fight and win these cases. </p><p>It is clear that the ball is in Congress' courts(PH). Companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and twitter have acted anti-competitively. We need to rise to the occasion to offer the American people a solution that promotes free and fair competition. Ms. Bovard, could you please offer your thoughts on these proposals? </p><p>BOVARD: Thank you, Congressman. I think you make a couple of really lucid points that are worth emphasizing. We do expect our enforcement agencies to parry with billion-dollar companies the biggest the world has ever seen and we give them minuscule budgets to do it. The $10 trillion or the $2 trillion that you mentioned is about 10 percent of U.S. GDP and that is the tech sector. We need to give our--our enforcement agencies I think the resources and commitment from Congress to pursue their full mandate in this space and I would also add that I think a little bit of humility from our enforcement agencies is necessary that they may not have always gotten it right. </p><p>If you look at the last 20 years there have been about 750 acquisitions that have taken place with relatively little scrutiny and Bill Kovacic who is a George W. Bush appointee to the FTC who voted actually to approve the Google acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008 recently told the New York Times--I want to make sure I quote him correctly if I knew in 2007 what I know now I would have voted to challenge the double--DoubleClick acquisition and this tells me that everything that you said is pretty on point. We need to make sure these agencies have the resources to do it and also that they are not hamstringing themselves by raising the bar on themselves with the laws that currently exist. Section 7 of the Clayton act which I think you you know referenced is actually a fair--a fairly generous standard when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. </p><p>You know to quote it, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. It doesn't specify price competition alone and it doesn't raise the evidentiary bar potential completion versus actual competition. So I would like to align myself with your statement and thank you for the question. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentle lady from Washington, Ms. Jayapal for five minutes. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here for what is such an important hearing. I think technology offers us the promise of freedom and yet over and over again in these hearings we have heard about people and businesses that are trapped, small businesses that can never quite get a fair shake, news sites that lose ad revenue or other websites that lose viewers because of unregulated practice or conflicts of interest in the many roles of these platforms that disadvantage innovation and competition and would-be innovators and developers have to make products that cater to major tech companies or face the real threat of being copied and crushed. No one likes to feel trapped but right now I think many people do and our democracy is trapped, too. </p><p>Ms. Teachout, let me start with you. In other sectors of the economy like in healthcare markets Congress has developed legislation that makes certain conduct presumptively illegal and there's been quite a bit of discussion about this through these questions. Do you think a law that would make certain types of mergers presumptively illegal shifting the burden to the merging parties to prove the transaction would not be harmful to competition could be an effective remedy? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Thank you, Congresswoman. Yes, you know in the field where I come from democracy law and anticorruption law prophylactic rules are actually absolutely essential. You don't investigate every time there's a $2700 I mean if we--if you had to investigate every time there was a $10,000 direct campaign contribution whether was something problematic you would never actually be able to protect against corruption in the campaign-finance sphere. So I think it's really important to think about these kinds of prophylactic rules including the one you talk to about to really shift the burdens. Thank you. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Mr. Baer, I saw you nodding. Did you want to add anything to that? </p><p>BAER: Just that I think as antitrust lawyers we tend to think of antitrust law enforcement as often the only solution to a problem in there may well be prospective rules my testimony I talked about the FCC rule basically saying our phone numbers actually were our phone numbers and we could port them elsewhere. That was a prospective rule, it was not a law enforcement action. Basically there are ways to promote interoperability in a fashion that may channel competition in constructive ways. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you. Mr. Rahman, I don't believe that many people make the necessary connections that they should between antitrust law and racial equity and economic equity. How would making changes to the antitrust laws help us to empower black and brown communities in particular that have been burdened throughout our history with structural inequities? </p><p>RAHMAN: Thank you, Congresswoman, for that question. It is such an important link to be made. They antitrust laws we are talking about here really are one of those foundational rules of the road that if we don't change them and we actually leave in place many of the structural inequities along the lines of race that you talk to about so three very quick ways that I would name that are connected around economic opportunity, around labor and the treatment of workers and around racist forms of algorithmic bias. </p><p>So the first piece, this whole point about accessing the marketplace the new digital infrastructure that we talked about the burden falls here monopoly powers burden falls especially hard on small and medium businesses in particular on black and brown businesses if you look at the challenges of business formation, of--of staying alive in a float(SP) is specially in this kind of an economy it is the same kind of challenges that we are seeing hitting black and brown businesses in response to say the COVID economy collapsed. </p><p>Solving this in an antitrust policy approach would actually help jumpstart small business formation, that is number one. Number two, in terms of workers we haven't talked about it much yet today but monopoly power is actually one of the key drivers of the suppression of wages and also the perpetuation of low labor standards, workplace safety standards in particular and when you look at the plight of essential workers, black and brown workers in this moment whether they are Amazon workers or workers of other dominant firms breaking up monopoly power actually is critical to empowering black and brown workers and finally the kinds of toxic spread of white nationalism, of extremism on mine and information platform like Facebook is fundamentally tied to the ad-based business model that Facebook has and if we are trying to build a racially inclusive public sphere we have to tackle the monopoly power that Facebook has. Thank you Congresswoman. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you so much. Ms. Hubbard, you argue in your testimony for aggressive antitrust enforcement against platform monopolist. Can you talk a little bit about the structural separation and how it would help small businesses, new tech startups and consumers if--if we were to implement that? </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentlelady has expired but the witness may answer the question. </p><p>JAYAPAL: I think you may be-- </p><p>CICILLINE: I think you are on mute maybe, Ms. Hubbard. </p><p>HUBBARD: Thank you, Congresswoman. As we have heard today small businesses, entrepreneurs, citizens are all beholden to these tech companies and are forced to play by their rules often paying them which is the equivalent of taxes. You know the 30 percent tax that Zephyr Teachout mentioned the amount that every small business pass to pay just to appear in Google search results under their own name is a huge tax on small business. So what we have our small businesses paying taxes to these huge companies and those companies don't in turn pay their own fair share of taxes. </p><p>So structurally separating the platforms from the commerce will give everyone a fair shot at innovating, at getting their rewords the--sorry, reaping the rewards of their hard work and it will be good for consumers because consumers are human beings and they benefit from the choice, innovation and quality that robust competitions--competition brings and they are also citizens that benefit from the free flow of speech and they are workers and employees of companies that benefit when the platform extraction seizes. So we can't think of consumers only in one role because it doesn't make any sense to care about whether I pay low prices but not care about whether I am getting paid less. Thank you very much. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank is my--thank you, Ms. Hubbard. </p><p>JAYAPAL: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlelady yields back. I recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong, for five minutes. </p><p>[*]ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it's just through the course of this investigation that it's obvious that there's bipartisan agreement that there's serious competition concerns in digital marketplaces. We may differ on whether we--on whether its anti--antitrust remedies are sufficient for some of these. I like Mr. Baer talking about tweaks versus large scale what has changed.  </p><p>But I mean, at the very least, I'd like to know whether our current antitrust enforcement is capable of addressing at least some of these concerns. And I'm glad you did the DoubleClick quote, other than you to stole it from me and I'm going to probably do it again. But I think over the past two decades, there's been, I mean, a lack of antitrust enforcement in digital markets.  </p><p>And to illustrate, when we were talking about Google's acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007, it was permitted by the FTC. The acquisition allowed Google to leap forward in third party--digital--display advertising where it previously only enjoyed considerable market share in search advertising. There's an argument to be made that nobody could foresee the future competition concerns at the time, that the third party ad markets were relatively competitive.  </p><p>However, the FTC majority opinion in that case acknowledged that with DoubleClick, Google could engage in a number of potential anticompetitive strategies to further enhance its positions in various markets. The commission dismissed the concern that Google would bundle or tie parts of its growth ad tech stack, and that concern was hypothetical in 2007, but now we know that it was a very real consequences of googles acquisition.  </p><p>And I said during the last--out last hearing, the major part of this investigation is dealing exactly with those things. And when we talk about, like, Instagram or WhatsApp or Messenger, it's easy to see those things, but a lot of these acquisitions are very small companies at the time. And it only gets to be a problem when it's in the aggregate. And I mean, with Google on the ad tech stack, it was both on the buy and sell side, which means they just simply have too much control over advertising.  </p><p>And in the case though, the commission also dismissed an additional concern that consolidated cult consolidation of ad tech stack would create a network effect whereby Google's position would make it more attractive to advertisers, which in turn would make it more attractive to publishers and so on and so on and so on. Ad--Google's ad tech informed by vast majority of the user data, and they got it from their first party services in Google Maps and Chrome.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Google has consolidated its market share by cutting off third parties and cookies. And I will say this every time I bring up the word cookie, I do not want to be the congressman responding responsible for bringing them back, but there's no doubt that it consolidated their market share. And I'm not even saying FTC was right or wrong in that decision, but I'm pointing out the FTC was aware of the concerns, which turned out to be proven correct, it did not do any enforcement in the subsequent years.  </p><p>And even though the that in the majority FTC opinion concluded by promising to watch the online advertising market closely in the future, and that was, I think towards William Kovecheck's (SP) quote. If he'd known then what he knew in 2007, he would not have voted to challenge--or he would have voted to challenge that. And since 2007, Google spent billions of dollars to acquire a lot of other key ad tech firms. Some big, some small.  </p><p>This is one anecdote, however, there's similar stories and concerns throughout the digital marketplace. The DOJ right now though is--and FTC are conducting investigations and suit and I mean, suits are reportedly imminent. That seems to me to be at least the most aggressive antitrust enforcement we've seen in--in decades and I--I concur with my friend Ken Buck from Colorado, this is one area where I--I mean, I do think we need more money, more resources, more enforcement.  </p><p>Mr. Baer, your testimonies discuss is additional resources for after action studies, which obviously this would be easier on the front end, but sometimes, that's not always realistic. Where agencies do not--and studies of what would have happened in markets where agencies did not bring enforcement actions. Can you elaborate how and after action review of an instance like DoubleClick merger would result in better antitrust enforcement? </p><p>BAER: Absolutely, sir. And the best example is hospital consolidation. We saw the courts hospital to the creation of monopolies and near monopolies in local markets as hospitals chains combined over the course of the 80s and 90s. Tim Muris, Republican Chairman of the FTC Commission after action studies of what those markets look like after consolidation occurred and the courts had rejected the FTC's merger challenge. They found dramatic price increases in those markets.  </p><p>It established the FTC was right. In subsequent hospital merger challenges, the FTC was able to go to court, use those economic studies and demonstrate hey, this risk is real and the court courts responded. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: Thank you. And at the risk--because I'm--you know, and it--like, it wasn't just DoubleClick, though. It was AdMob in 09, AdMeld in 2011, Adometry in 2014. And so when you were talking about tweaking on mergers and changing the standard, I'm interested in having that conversation possibly offline because I'm not sure any one of these meet it initially. But when you look back, we--I mean, I think in some instances, we're going to have to figure out a way to deal with that and I know that's not ideal.  </p><p>You see it right now with Instagram and Messenger trying to combine their data. Well, that's going to be--I mean, just practically, it makes it harder to intertwine. But do you think after action reports considering how these companies work or aa key part to enforcement moving forward? </p><p>BAER: It's--it's a key tool, but in addition, statutory changes, which would require a dominant firm to offer an affirmative justification for its acquisition of smaller nascent competitors would actually empower the antitrust agencies to address that potential accumulation overtime of--of significant enhanced market power. </p><p>ARMSTRONG: My only concern with that is that a lot of these companies build themselves solely for the purpose of getting bought out. I mean, eventually, we get into a capitalized--we saw that with the SprintT-Mobile merger. It was never a question between four and three. It was going to be a question between four and two. I've used too much. Thank you, sir. </p><p>CICILLINE: No, I thank the gentleman. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the(PH) distinguished gentle lady from Florida, Ms. Demings for five minutes. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you so much to our witnesses for being with us today. Mr. Baer, you know, it's always so important. You know, we would have never thought of course 20 years ago when we--really 30, 40 years ago when we really began that we would have companies that have grown or mergers that would grow so huge until they really affected everybody else in an adverse way around--around them.  </p><p>You talked about but sometimes the fear of getting it wrong really kind of stifles our ability to do what we need to do in this space. Could you please expound on that a little bit and also talk a little bit about the path forward? The fear of getting it wrong? </p><p>BAER: Well, thank you. And thank you for reminding me I've been at this business over 40 years.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>But the--the fear of getting it wrong is sort of an outgrowth of in our overreach by the Chicago School of Economics. It's basically the notion that unless we are 100 percent certain that there's an antitrust problem, we should stay back. And that has been infused in the thinking of the courts. I don't blame the courts for that thinking, it is just this one way ratchet, which has gotten tougher and tougher for the government or a plaintiff to prove up an antitrust case.  </p><p>That's why I conclude that one of the key solutions has to be Congress stepping forward and instructing the courts that no, we meant if there's a tendency to substantially reduced competition, you should act. The courts need to intervene. So it's that that hesitation about getting it wrong. Avoidance of what they call type--type one errors. Errors of over enforcement that I think has it(PH) shifted the pendulum way to the wrong side.  </p><p>DEMINGS: You also talked about additional resources or the need for additional resources. Why should Congress give additional resources when many of the companies that we're talking about have not appropriately used the resources that they have effectively for enforcement efforts?  </p><p>BAER: Well, one could always criticize Federal Trade Commission where I once worked, the Antitrust Division, where I once worked for not doing it exactly right. But I think they have used the resources Congress has appropriated them yeah in most cases quite appropriately.  </p><p>The problem is those resources are so small in--in comparison to the size of the economy to the number of acquisitions going on to behaviors this subcommittee is properly investigating and probably concerned about. So you look at as--at the ratio. The ratio suggests we need to strike the balance a little differently. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you. Mr. Kades. You talked about the need for reform and not just by enforcement. And thinking about legislation to revitalize our countries antitrust law, what do you think are the most important principles right now that Congress should consider?  </p><p>KADES: (OFF-MIC) I should remember that. Thank you, Congresswoman.  </p><p>[*]KADES: I think you want to think about this in--in the big picture as you have a court that continually doesn't want to enforce the law I think the way the--the bipartisan this committee thinks it should be enforced. So, the first thing you have to do is you need laws that will strip back decisions that limit--limit antitrust enforcement. Professor Teachout talked about Trinko. There is a whole list. </p><p>The second thing you want to do is something along the lines of what Bill Baer suggested, is you want to tweak the statute because at least that sends a signal you're doing it wrong. And then the third thing I think you want to do where you can, this is not--this may sound small but is very powerful, is you create presumptions where you are more concerned about the harm from the conduct that under--than the potential costs of over enforcement. </p><p>And so, in that sense, it's--you know, the way you deal with what Congressman Armstrong has to deal with, you want the FTC to be more aggressive. When they see something like a double-click that looks new, you--you give them the tool that they don't have to go in and disprove every potential benefit. The company has to come forward and say, yeah, we--we understand there's a problem. We have to show you it's a good thing.  </p><p>DEMINGS: Could you-- </p><p>KADES: --So, I think it's those three things. </p><p>DEMINGS: Could you also finally talk a little bit about how you believe interoperability could help? </p><p>KADES: Right. So, I think the--the interesting thing about interoperability is not as a solution itself.  </p><p>DEMINGS: Um-hmm. </p><p>KADES: You know, and it's one of these things--and I know Professor Yoo talked about how--how hard it is. But, you know, it's amazing the way companies can find interoperability when it suits their purposes. So, right--I can call you on the telephone. I can text you. We don't have to be on the same--we don't have to be on the same system.  </p><p>But if you were on--if you're not on Facebook, somehow it's--you know, I can't put up a post on Facebook that goes to you if I want to friend you. Like, that's apparently technologically impossible. But if I could, it means if you don't like Facebook, if--or as--as Congressman Jordan talks about not liking the--the way they engage in censorship, you can walk away from Facebook and you don't lose contact with all your friends, right? And so, that allows competition to occur and that has the benefit of reducing the incentives and the ability to exclude competition. </p><p>DEMINGS: Thank you so much. I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Steube, for five minutes. </p><p>STEUBE: Thank you, Mr. Chair. My questions are for Ms. Bovard. In May of this year, President Trump issued an executive order to prevent online censorship. The executive order discusses Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Ms. Bovard, have a big tech companies abused section 230 to their advantage? </p><p>BOVARD: Well, thank you for the question, Congressman. And the short answer, I believe, is yes. When conservatives think about Section 230, I think it's important to point out that the statute, kind of reflecting the conversation we're having here, has become so judicially distorted from what Congress initially passed that what we rely on for its application today is--is very bloated and the--and a bulletproof immunity exists where a porous, narrow one was originally passed. So, it is my view that, yes, the companies have abused this practice to the extent that is now referred to as an implicit financial subsidy to these companies. </p><p>STEUBE: Well, so you kind of touched on it there. Can you--can you explain other ways that Section 230 has been misused and wrongly applied? </p><p>BOVARD: Well, I think as I outlined in my written statement, Section 230 has--originally passed as the good Samaritan standard has--has actually a lot a lot of bad Samaritans a lot of cover. There has been well documented evidence of the fact that, you know, sex trafficking, all kinds of human trafficking, terrorism, revenge pornography all flourishes on these platforms. And the companies are immune from any liability for it. </p><p>In 2018, Congress passed FOSTA-SESTA to--to make them liable for knowingly participating in the facilitation of sex trafficking, but there's a whole lot of other criminal and--and lewd and harassing content that occurs. And these companies, as opposed to being the good Samaritan that could, you know, walk by and help the guy out of the ditch, they can walk right by and there's no consequence. </p><p>STEUBE: How does the president executive order seek to promote free speech and rectify this online censorship issue that's been discussed? </p><p>BOVARD: So, the president's executive order does two things that I think are very important. The first is that it, you know, petitions--has NITA petition the FCC to bring Section 230's application back to its original intent, which as we discussed is a very narrow immunity focused on the original title of the amendment itself, which is the Family Online Empowerment Act, allowing basically you to clean up the Internet. </p><p>And the second thing it does that I think is really important is it enforces a measure of transparency onto these companies. A lot of the censorship and--and bias they get away with happens because they don't have to tell us what they're doing. They've never popped the hood and let us look in. And they could. They could put allegations of bias to--to bed if they let us look under the hood of what they're doing, but they don't. So, I think that transparency is also very important. </p><p>STEUBE: Do you believe that Section 230 reform is an avenue for addressing some of these online censorship issues? </p><p>BOVARD: I do because it enforces accountability and transparency on companies who right now have none of it. And I think companies that can upset half of their user base without consequence because they know they have nowhere else to go deserve a little bit of accountability and transparency requirements for a substantial benefit, a government mandated privilege that they receive. </p><p>STEUBE: What specific reforms should Congress consider when examining ways to address the pitfalls with Section 230? </p><p>BOVARD: So, I think--the proposal that Ranking Member Jordan mentioned in his opening statement I think sounds like a very good place to start. It deals with the otherwise objectionable part of Section 230, which again has become this sort of massive catchall for the companies to enforce against viewpoints they don't like without any consequence. I think addressing that particular part of the law I think will be very useful.  </p><p>And again, I think the transparency--when you have to show what you're doing, when you have to show your work, it's a lot harder just to say trust me to no consequence. You actually have to show conservatives that you're listening to them.   </p><p>STEUBE: Thank you for your time. Thank you for being here today. I'd yield any of my remaining time to Ranking Member Jordan.  </p><p>CICILLINE: (OFF-MIC) yield back. I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I recognize the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Raskin, for five minutes. </p><p>RASKIN: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I want to come to Ms. Teachout. I welcome Professor Teachout. In your testimony, you advocate for what you call structural separation, a Glass-Steagall approach to antitrust in this field. Why has Congress approached concentrated markets like financial services or telecom this way in the past, and what is its resonance with American constitutional principles of structural separation of powers? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Thank you for your question. What we have seen in the past--you mentioned Glass-Steagall, which I also mentioned in my written testimony. You also see laws like the Public Utility Holding Act, which prohibits companies who are subject to the act, who play the sort of central public utility role, from engaging in acquisitions unless there's an SEC approval.  </p><p>And--and the key theory here is that you don't want conflicts of interest at the heart of your economy with essential infrastructures. You don't want your pipelines have a conflict with what is going through those pipelines. And decentralizing that power instead of having platforms that enable competition on those platforms, instead of using those to kill, acquire, or copy, as you shown in your investigation, is the--is really important for--both for allowing the thriving of small businesses, but also--also from stopping these platforms from be--becoming a form of private government. </p><p>And this is something that Justice Douglas spoke about, the inevitable tendency of all private power to form a government in and of itself. Structural separation is one of the key tools to prohibit these private powers from becoming private governments that coexist with our democratic government. </p><p>RASKIN: Well, would that undermine innovation? Would it undermine competition? Would it harm consumers? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Well, I--in--in general, I would say that the more feudal a system is, the less innovation you're going to see. And what we're talking about, you know, when you talk about the democratic threat, it's essentially a feudal threat, that you see Amazon playing a feudal role, Facebook playing a really dangerous feudal role of deciding which newspapers get prioritization in your newsfeed, YouTube playing this role. And the more you see a feudal system, actually the more you see a closed and fearful system and a less innovative system, so yes.  </p><p>RASKIN: Well, tell us about what you think the role of Congress is today and historically in the development of antitrust principles. If Congress doesn't do it, what happens if we're not updating and modernizing the antitrust laws? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Yeah. I mean, Congress for--from the 1890s, 1880s onward has played--played this a really central role, recognizing that--  </p><p>[*]TEACHOUT: --protecting fairness in a thriving economy is the quintessential congressional role and also protecting our democracy and protecting the corruption of the takeover of these forms of private government is a quit--a quintessential congressional role. And then starting in the 80s you saw Congress really step back from this role. </p><p>You saw this deep, deep politicization. Instead when--when these cases came down, cases we have been talking about today whether the case is involving predatory pricing or changes to merger law you didn't see Congressional hearing, there was a kind of tacit acceptance that the Supreme Court was the right institution to be making decisions about the shape of our economy. There couldn't be this is a terrible institution to be making decisions about the shape of our economy. </p><p>That said, I do want to address some of the--something that has not been addressed enough I think. I think we--Congress other role is to light a fire under enforcement agencies. I would not allow enforcement agencies to get away with saying that although the laws the court has made these laws harder to enforce, the FTC can engage in much more aggressive rulemaking, much more aggressive enforcement. In fact I would say that your investigation has shown some really deep failures in the aggressiveness of the FTC. So I think there is a double role, one is ongoing investigations and ongoing responsibility taking for the structures of power and the structures of the economy here in Congress and second is ongoing oversight and lighting a fire under the agencies in an ongoing way. </p><p>RASKIN: Well, are there benefits to a regime where you have multiple levers of enforcement in the federal bureaucratic context state attorneys general private plaintiffs? Do you want to try to multiply the different sources of enforcement? </p><p>CICILLINE: Yeah, the time of the gentleman has expired but the witness may answer the question. </p><p>TEACHOUT: It is absolutely essential to multiply levers of enforcement. In fact in the first Congress of this country about half of the laws had key timbre revisions because there was concern about capture or corruption of--of--and possible enforcement agencies. So you need to have a dynamic interaction with broad private rights of action, state attorneys general agencies and Congress all constantly engaging and instead of passively accepting the Supreme Court and big companies taking over this area. </p><p>RASKIN: I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Ohio for five minutes. </p><p>JORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Bovard, is cancel culture real? </p><p>BOVARD: It certainly is, sir. </p><p>JORDAN: 62--per a recent survey 62 percent of the American people said they are afraid to freely express their thoughts and opinions. I think most Americans agree that it is darned real, it is scary. I think Professor Teachout just I think the quote she just said closed and fearful system that we find ourselves in if 62 percent of the American people are afraid to express themselves do you have a functioning First Amendment? </p><p>BOVARD: You don't. It would seem that would violate the very intent of the First Amendment which is to provide a robust protection for speech of all kinds. </p><p>JORDAN: Yes, silence is not the first amendment and that is exactly what the cancel culture mob is one thing. They are wanting us to be silent. In fact I think it's even worse they want us to agree with them. Do you have free speech if only one side is allowed to talk? </p><p>BOVARD: You--you do not. You have one source of information only. That is not free speech or free thought I would add. </p><p>JORDAN: Yeah, so if you don't have free thought, you don't have free speech you have a closed and fearful system, you have a system where exceed 2 percent of the American people are afraid and reluctant to express their thoughts, their opinions. That's a dangerous--that's a dangerous place to be. Is big tech a part of this phenomenon we now find ourselves in? </p><p>BOVARD: I would say absolutely. I think that the bias that we have discussed is a symptom actually of its market power. Google filters information for 92 percent of the world, 87 percent of America. So whatever they choose to amplify or suppress is what billions of Americans or I'm sorry, billions of people around the world see that's a problem. </p><p>JORDAN: It strikes me as--it strikes me as twofold. One, they can censor themselves we know about that, we know what Google tried to do to the Federalist, we know what Twitter will do to the president of the United States but yet then turn around and let the Ayatollah of Iran spew the things that he wants to spew. So they can engage in it themselves but then they also provide a platform for other people to attack and--and tried to cancel opinions they disagree with. </p><p>Now I don't know how we deal with that, we just got to fight back and be able to use the platform and fight back with that but that second part Barry Weisz(SP) actually--Barry Weisz the individual that had to re-sign or who did re-sign I don't know she had to she re-signed from the New York time she called that second phenomenon the digital thunder dome a term that I just thought struck me as exactly what happens when the mob starts attacking positions they don't like. </p><p>So it seems to me we come to the critical question what's the answer? How do we address it? </p><p>BOVARD: Well, I think I would actually go back to something that Ms. Hubbard actually referenced in her opening statement which is that the answer, the antidote to bad speech and suppression of speech is more speech and I think-- </p><p>JORDAN: Always has been in this country, always has been. </p><p>BOVARD: So whatever incentives that Congress can give through the tools that you know they already are involved with these tech companies with section 230 with these antitrust immunity that they have given these tech companies whatever incentives that Congress can give these companies to abide by what we in section 230 designed for right, which is robust political debate and diversity of views I think it is incumbent upon Congress to do that. </p><p>JORDAN: It seems to me that--it seems to me--I agree with that and I want you to take a good look at the legislation I briefly referenced in my opening comments, legislation that we have introduced today. It seems to me that would be something we could all agree on because there is definitely some disagreement. We heard what the ranking members Sensenbrenner said, we heard what folks on the Democrat side said about is the existing antitrust law good enough or the truth is I don't know it may be it may not be do we have to change it? We will look at that. Is a more robust action as some of the Democrat witnesses have said from the agencies? Probably all--all of that is important but it seems to me we should be able to agree on section 230 and what needs to be changed there to foster more speech and not allow these big tech companies to censor particularly I think censor conservatives. Would you agree with that? </p><p>BOVARD: I would. I think there saw a lot of proposals to reform section 230 which I think reflects the sentiment that you just suggested which is that they all have one goal which is to force more accountability on these platforms for speech, for the criminal acts that flourish there and I think it's a very important area to address. </p><p>To your point I do think this is a multi-prong problem that is going to probably require multi-pronged approach is across different sectors of policy making. Section 230 is one of them. </p><p>JORDAN: And--and you know what else I think is important, I think you have to call it out every single time you see it. Every time big tech sensors somebody it should be called out particularly now. I mean particularly now, 4 and a half weeks before a major election I mean may be the biggest election and--and we know what happened in 2016, we know what Google tried to do to help the Clinton campaign so you have to call it out every single time and then hopefully we can get some bipartisan support for the section 230 changes that I think everyone, if we all just sit down and work, we all agreed need to happen. I will give you the last word for the last 15 seconds. </p><p>BOVARD: I would agree with that because I would like to get to a point where these big tech giants don't have nearly the power they have over speech, over election, over independent behavior. I do not think we can function as a free society when we are ruled by tyrannical corporations. </p><p>JORDAN: Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentleman yields back up. I now recognize the gentle lady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Scanlon, for five minutes. </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you, Chairman. I want to start by commending the members and the staff of this committee for the incredible work they have done over the course of--of this hearing series. It is an historic investigation. The report coming forward is shedding light on the crushing power of big tech and has really brought before the American people a desperately needed conversation on what do we need to do to reform our antitrust laws though I am proud to have been a part of this process, very grateful to the chairman for having initiated it and--and walked us all through this. </p><p>You know over the course of the last year we have laid out how Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and others have used monopolistic tactics to exert undue market power. In doing this these companies stifle innovation, kill competition, and harm the American public. We certainly hear about it every day from our constituents. </p><p>I have little reason to believe that without regulatory intervention these companies will continue to act in their self-interest rather than in the interest of free and fair competition or privacy. Over the course of the investigation it became clear a conversation on rethinking traditional antitrust law is needed. Companies competing in the digital marketplace on the scale we see today could not have been conceived of when the Sherman Antitrust Act and our other anti-monopoly laws were created and decades of court rulings have obviously made it harder and harder to use traditional antitrust laws to bring enforcement measures against these companies. So in addition to looking at how we can use traditional antitrust law to bring companies to heal we also have to identify the areas where we can make reforms to better regulate and police the digital marketplaces. </p><p>So looking forward to how we develop a modern antitrust code that can respond to the major competition issues of this time I am hopeful that our report and the expert testimony of our witnesses today will serve as a launching point for enforcement and reform legislation. </p><p>[*]SCANLON: Now using the predatory pricing models to drive out competition is a classic monopolistic tactic and in our hearing in July, I raised concerns with Amazon's scheme to artificially lower the prices of diapers in order to drive down a competitor's profits until they could acquire that competitor. This had a real impact on parents who saw, after the acquisition, saw the cost of Amazon diaper product rise as a result. So Ms. Teachout, do you see this predatory pricing scheme as a symptom of a company that's grown so large they no longer care about what's best for consumers? </p><p>TEACHOUT: As a--as a mother of an almost two-year-old, I feel the diapers problem on it a regular basis, so thank you for raising it. Look, it's a--it's a--the diapers acquisition--and thank you for your line of questioning, which was very powerful as an example of the moment--of one of the moments where great research and great preparation really revealed something powerful. Is it showed that--I believe you uncovered just how much Amazon was willing to lose to--in order to govern that market.  </p><p>And I think one of the things it showed is the really deeply problematic nature of court driven antitrust policy because what we saw in Brooke Group and Weyerhaeuser and these series of Supreme Court antitrust cases is a statement that predatory pricing of exactly this kind was really unlikely to happen. It was a statement based in economic theory, but not in the economic realities.  </p><p>And it's just an example of how incredibly important it is for this body to act to make it clear that that kind of predatory pricing cannot happen going forward. Right now, we do not know the full scope and range of, I'll be quick, of predatory behaviors going on, but we have reason to suspect it's far broader than anything we know. And the opacity of these companies makes it very easy to cross-subsidize in ways that really crush competition.  </p><p>SCANLON: And do you have suggestions about how we can use reform to combat this? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Well, sure. Overturn the trio of cases that changed that predatory pricing laws. I mean, this is something Congress does in other areas. When President Obama became president, his first bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Act which overturning bad Supreme Court interpretation of congressional statutes. So here again, it is your responsibility to take this moment and overturn bad Supreme Court interpretation of congressional statutes.  </p><p>SCANLON: Thank you. I appreciate that and I do have to say I'm struck by the fact that when they passed the Sherman Antitrust law, they probably were not thinking about diaper pricing and did not have witnesses like yourself or representatives like myself. Thank you to all of our witnesses. We really appreciate your insights today and I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: The gentle lady yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse for five minutes. </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman-- </p><p>CICILLINE: --And the vice chair--oh, I'm sorry. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>NEGUSE: Thank you. Mr. Chairman. I want to thank each of the witnesses for their testimony today. Very thoughtful presentations with respect to the legislative recommendations that this committee is poised to potentially make to the full Congress. I would be remiss if I didn't say first and foremost just how much I've appreciated serving as the vice chair of this committee, particularly given the investigation that we have undertaken.  </p><p>And I wanted to give my gratitude to the chairman, to Chairman Cicilline for his thoughtful leadership. I think the way that he has approached this investigation in leading of course our counsel and the staff of the committee and on a bipartisan basis working to try to get to the bottom of these very serious, vexing issues of impact every consumer in our country, in my view has just been a tremendous example of how Congress can work well when we are working at our best. And so I want to say thank you again, Chairman Cicilline and with the ranking member of the subcommittee as well. We appreciate his leadership and of course wish him well in his--in his retirement.  </p><p>I want to--I guess perhaps end the hearing in a similar way in which we started it. The ranking member asked a series of questions around Facebook in particular and I think that Facebook provides perhaps one of the best examples for this committee and for the country really to consider in terms of acquisitions of competitive and massive threats, you know, undeniably helping a company amass and maintain market dominance. And I think that was exposed during the course of the hearing, of course, that we held in July with the CEO and the documentary evidence that this committee was able to compile during the course of our investigations.  </p><p>Ms. Hubbard, in your prepared testimony, I believe you argue, I think I'm quoting this accurately, that enforcers should unwind illegal mergers the date didn't catch and you cite Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram as examples of what you believe could be illegal mergers. I wonder if you could expound a bit on why in your view antitrust enforcers didn't catch these anticompetitive acquisitions in real time because I think it's fairly clear from the documentary evidence that we've compiled that it was in fact an anticompetitive acquisition and it was consistent with Facebook's, you know, kind of modus operandi, if you will, which Professor Teachout articulate really well in terms of, you know, copying competitors, acquiring competitors, or eliminating them. </p><p>HUBBARD: Thank you for the question. I think in this hearing, we've let the enforcer's off the hook a little too lightly to hear the conversations we've had about the Google DoubleClick merger, for example and we've said how can we have foreseen that. All you need to do is read the dissenting statement of Pamela Jones Harbour. She foresaw everything.  </p><p>So who is in the majority matters, okay? If we had three Chopras (SP) or Slaughters (SP) running the FTC right now, we'd be having vastly different enforcement. So people matter. If Pamela Jones Harbour had been in charge, that deal may have not gone through. She was urging for greater scrutiny.  </p><p>So you know, why did they miss these mergers? I think they were trained in the Chicago School ideology, which has been a failure at enforcing the antitrust laws in a way that protects anybody. It's the consumer welfare standard, but it hasn't protected consumers at all. And that ideology is incredibly narrow and they look at oh, Facebook is this kind of a product and Instagram is photo sharing app and they don't do any kind of a real thoughtful analysis that hey, is this a competitor that they are acquiring?  </p><p>I didn't see any--any of the, you know, discussion of wow, this is a really hard case to win and so, you know, even though we think it's a problem, we are not going to do it. What I saw is they didn't do a thorough enough investigation. They didn't get the documents--the documents that your investigation has shown. If--if any antitrust enforcement was presented with those documents, you need to try to bring that case, even if you think you might lose. You need to bring that case.  </p><p>So it is a failure. But the good thing is that it's not too late because there's no rule that you can't undo unwind an illegal acquisition later in the future. So that should still happened. It's very critically important for our democracy, for elections, for all kinds of the problems that we're seeing that result from the Facebook not having any anti-competitive threat because it acquired its top competitors. </p><p>NEGUSE: Well, thank you. You know, I couldn't agree with you more. And obviously, there's been public reporting, as you know, at the FTC's that the FTC is certainly investigating whether Facebook illegally maintained its dominance in the social media market through those acquisitions of, you know, 80 some odd companies over the course of 15 years. So in any event, I certainly share your sentiments and as somebody who previously served in a gubernatorial administration in Colorado prior to coming to Congress running the states Regulatory Department back there, I certainly can attest that personnel is policy in every sense of that phrase. And so if your--your point is a salient one.  </p><p>And I--I guess I'm running out of time here, but the last question I would have for you, Ms. Hubbard to the extent--Professor Teachout wishes to opine on this as well, I certainly read her report with Mr. Stahler (SP) in depth and think their recommendations are very thoughtful. Just what statutory changes in addition to potentially overturning, of course the presidents that were referenced by Professor Teachout to federal antitrust law should Congress pursue to ease challenging dominant firms from--rather, it is the dominant firms acquisition of nascent competitors? </p><p>CICILLINE: The time of the gentleman has expired, but the witness may answer the question. </p><p>HUBBARD: Thank you. Yes. So I think for--when it comes to acquisitions of nascent competitors, we definitely need to reform the standards that are completely broken. But the easiest way would be to go through a bright line rules process for mergers.  </p><p>We can look at the 1968 merger guidelines as a model for how to do that where it just says if you have a certain amount of market power, you are not allowed to acquire any further companies. And if you want to grow your market power, you need to do it by investing in products and your workers and you need to grow organically. You're not allowed to do any kind of a merger once you have a certain size.  </p><p>And these clear thresholds would get rid of the burdens on enforcers that make it too hard and too expensive to win mergers. It would also create very clear rules for the marketplace so that everyone knows what's acceptable and would help, you know, and we need to go further than just little tweaks here and there. We need actually bright line rules.  </p><p>[*]CICILLINE: Thank you. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. McBath, for five minutes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much for continuing to bring these important measures before the body today. And thank you so much for--each of you. We're really glad to be hearing from you today as we continue to examine the antitrust and also the anticompetitive nature of big tech. </p><p>When I had the opportunity to ask questions of the CEOs of big tech companies, I focused on the harms that were faced by small businesses. I asked Mr. Bezos about Amazon's treatment of third-party sellers, small businesses who want to sell on Amazon. I asked Mr. Cook about developers who want to make their apps available in the App Store and the users who were disappointed when their favorite apps just suddenly disappeared. </p><p>In both cases, Amazon and Apple both exercise immense control over whose products, whether physical or digital, are available in their marketplaces. And this leaves small businesses beholden to their whims as they try to maintain a business, create jobs, and provide for their own families. After our last hearing, even more Amazon sellers reached out to this committee and to my office with the same similar concerns. Sellers have told us over and over again that they feel that they are dispensable. </p><p>So, Ms. Teachout, you made recommendations in your testimony about reforms that we could take, reforms that we could make. Do you have anything to add on to those reforms that can help third-party sellers or app developers? </p><p>TEACHOUT: Thank you. And thank you for your very powerful questioning. As you saw in response to questions, the--the CEOs will always have some reason for kicking off their competitors because it's better for consumers. But it looks from the outside like they are using their platform power to really squeeze and really hurt small businesses. </p><p>And I--I just want to add one thing. I--we are in the middle of a global pandemic where small businesses are facing a--a true catastrophe. And it is more important than ever that we support those small businesses in this moment during a time when margins are tight, if they're there at all.  </p><p>So, the most important thing to protect small businesses is structural separation. Is--the most important thing for those Amazon sellers is that they are able to go to Amazon as a place where they sell their wares but not feel like they are then obliged to go to the feudal lord of Amazon and say, to get prioritization, I will use your advertising, to get prioritization, I will use your fulfillment services, and those sellers are not legitimately fearful that their--their brilliant creative ideas will be ripped off and then used by Amazon to compete against them. So, structural separation to me is the simplest and most powerful tool for supporting small businesses at this moment. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you so much for the answer. And Mr. Kades, to the reforms that you are supporting actually--do they have a risk of unintended consequences? Could you--and if they do, why--why or why not? </p><p>KADES: Okay. So, I think I actually forgot to turn it off last time, but--so I'm 0 for 3 today. </p><p>Thank you for that--for that question. I think it's foolish for anyone to say I have an idea for reform and it's totally costless and there never will be unintended consequences, so that's true. But what I think is also true is when you look at the situation of where the law is, the cost of doing nothing is tremendous.   </p><p>And this committee--in some sense when we address the question of whether the antitrust laws are in the right position, this committee in a bipartisan way, already answered yes. Earlier this--in this Congress, you passed bills directly trying to address the failure of the courts to go--to condemn clearly anticompetitive activity in the healthcare field, both the pay for delay and the CREATES Act, right?  </p><p>That's--those were much simpler issues than the types of issues that are flowing around with tech. Those are cases involving price, and still the courts are getting them wrong. So, I think if we do nothing, what we mean--what we're saying is the government is no longer concerned about regulating dominant companies, and it's just free reign. Can the reforms have un--negative consequences? I said yes, but I think that's always the--that's the decision Congress always makes. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you very much. And one last question for Ms. Hubbard. Of the reforms that you are recommending, which ones do you think will do the most to address the harms that have been faced by the small businesses? As you know, one whose been working in gun safety, I know that there's not one solution to the expansive culture of gun violence. But what do you believe a--a reform that will do the most effective, efficient expedient change? </p><p>HUBBARD: Yeah, I'll have to agree with Professor Teachout early--her comment earlier about structural separation. It's just the most administrable. It is a, you know, preventative solution that just eliminates the conflicts of interest and creates a playing field that's level. It just doesn't work to have dominant corporations, you know, playing the game and controlling it too, right?  </p><p>They have to do one of the other. And you just can't police every little incident because there are so many opportunities for them to favor their own products and services and so many opportunities for them to put the thumb on the scale that we just can't even see. It's just not possible to get at all of those through individual enforcement actions. And that's why I think the structural separation, which has been done in American history many times in many industries, is the best solution. </p><p>MCBATH: Thank you. And I yield back. </p><p>CICILLINE: I thank the gentlelady for yielding back. I now recognize myself for five minutes. </p><p>Professor Teachout, I'd like you to respond to an argument that we have heard during the course of this investigation that--that Congress suddenly becoming active in this antitrust space risks rendering antitrust laws dangerously political and that somehow our efforts to sort of get the policy around antitrust modernized and updated creates some perception that we are politicizing antitrust. I wonder if you'd respond to that argument. </p><p>TEACHOUT: Economic policy and anticorruption policy are arguably the core jobs of Congress, protecting the people of this country from tyrants and allowing for a thriving economy. There is recent research that Mr. Rahman alluded to showing that corporate concentration is leading to a transfer of as much as $14,000 per year from workers to investors. This is a major driver of any quality. </p><p>Nobody doubts that labor law is your job, that tax law is your job, that campaign finance law is your job. And when it comes to antitrust, antitrust and antimonopoly law is about the country sharing its vision of what a moral, fair, and thriving economy looks like. There is nothing more Congressional than antitrust law. </p><p>CICILLINE: I couldn't agree with you more. Thank you. You said it much more articulately than I could have. </p><p>Ms. Hubbard, I'd like to now ask you. There obviously is significant reporting that--and--and we're all aware that the state attorneys generals, the FTC, and the DOJ are all pursuing antitrust investigations into the major dominant technology platforms, and some reporting that lawsuits may be filed very soon. Some have also suggested that, you know, Congress should just wait to see how these cases turn out before pursuing legislative reform. </p><p>I, of course, have suggested that they are two very different proceedings. One is an enforcement proceeding, which we are not at a--we are not prosecuting an enforcement action. But ours is--as Professor Teachout just mentioned, ours is public policy development and the urgency of doing our work cannot be overstated. And so, of course, we shouldn't await those. I just want to be sure that I'm not a course without thinking. </p><p>HUBBARD: Right. And as you know, I was at the New York AG's office, and they're part of these investigations. So, I--I still don't think you should wait for them. And the reason is there is so much conduct--so much anticompetitive conduct to go after that the agencies are just trying to bite off little tiny pieces that they can work on that are just a tiny fraction of the anticompetitive conduct that's going on. So, they're not, you know, getting the whole landscape of all the different ways that these companies are abusing their monopoly power to exclude competition. </p><p>The other thing is that antitrust cases take years. So, we have very pressing issues here about small business, about citizens, about democracy, that speech. We need urgent action right now in the middle of this global pandemic. We can't wait five, 10 years for an antitrust case to--to finish up. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. </p><p>HUBBARD: And the last thing is we have seen some strong antitrust cases lately that the judges just completely screw up. I mean, the New York State AG sued to block the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. That was a classic antitrust case of 3 to 2 major competitors. It should have been blocked. The evidence was overwhelming that it would lead to a price increase under the Chicago School theory of consumer welfare, and they still didn't win. </p><p>So, we just can't put this in the--in the hands of the courts. It's too important and too urgent. I do urge those enforcers to carry on and do their job, but we need you as well. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you. And Professor Rahman, in your written statement you note that tech platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple referees send essential infrastructure just like the railroads, the bridges and telegraph lines of a century ago and you write about the dangers of unchecked private control over social economic and political infrastructure and I wonder if you could just speak a little more about want that kind of infrastructure and the power that accompanies it means and why our responsibility in terms of developing good public policy in this context is so important. </p><p>RAHMAN: Thank you very much chairman. I think like a lot of the other speakers today have alluded this--we are in such a crisis moment right now in our country and a central piece of this is that we--if Congress doesn't act what that means is that we are actually living under the Private government as professor Teachout said the private government of these private firms and the misapplication of law that we are seeing from the reports and so the essential infrastructure is exactly that, it is essential if we don't update the rules of the road to make sure everybody can actually access that infrastructure, build businesses and engage in the social activities that it enables then we are not creating the kind of economy that we need to be equitable and inclusive and to create new types of innovation in the future. </p><p>CICILLINE: And so if I just asked for all of the witness says as I kind of review both the testimony of this hearing today which has been incredibly useful and your written testimony it seems as if the reforms that you have all recommended are some part of these. They are kind of in five different areas and I want to be sure that I haven't missed one. The first is a change of some presumptions and statutes to shift burdens two parties that both may be engaging in misconduct but also have easier access to the information. Two, this whole notion of separation of lines of business that is sort of structural change so we eliminate what professor Teachout has described as this extraordinary conflict of interest, which is bad for our economy, bad for innovation, bad for a whole range of other things. </p><p>Three, more rigorous enforcement which of course we recognize means more resources, staff, and leadership that enthusiastically and creatively promote competition policy and believe in this stuff and will work aggressively. The fourth area is a reversal of a number of court decisions that have either kind of misinterpreted or frankly just changed the intention of Congress as it relates to important competition policy and then fifth a set of provisions that may just explicitly prohibit discriminatory behavior so have I missed, are there other kind of--other--you know and those obviously have some permutations but are there other general areas that we ought to be looking at in this final part of our investigation in terms of recommendation or does that--yes, Mr. Baer? </p><p>BAER: I agree with I think that aptly summarizes the points. I do think in looking at prohibitions we also ought to be thinking at forward-looking roles you know interoperability, portability and it may well be we need to invest whether it's Federal Trade Commission or a new agency with the authority to do targeted rules that actually will promote competition so that's kind of an addendum 2.5. </p><p>CICILLINE: Great, thank you. I will make that point 6, it deserves its own. Anyone else? Yes, sir? Mr. Kades? </p><p>KADES: Yeah, I just want to echo what--what Bill Baer just said. I mean I do think it's really important to think about part of what-- </p><p>BAER: That's why I promoted you back then. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KADES: I know. Too often we see when people say regulation they have these--this theory of burdening commerce where in fact regulations is just a kind of jargon way to say these are the rules of the marketplace. </p><p>CICILLINE: Right. </p><p>KADES: So the FCC right, the reason they decided at some point that long-distance monopoly didn't mean you have to have monopoly on phones know, now you have to have interconnection and I think a lot of the problems we are dealing with whether it be with any of these companies is better regulatory rules really will unleash competition and unleash it along the lines we want to see. </p><p>CICILLINE: And I'm just with the indulgence of my colleagues I'm just going to ask Professor Rahman, I think he had his hand up also. </p><p>RAHMAN: Yeah, thank you Chairman. Very quickly I just had one piece which is important to clarify that rulemaking authority that the FTC will also need in order to be an effective enforcer going forward of the kinds of issues that we have talked about today. That is a dispute right now and Congress could help implement that. </p><p>CICILLINE: Well, I thank you. I have gone way over my time so I appreciate the indulgence. </p><p>Before closing today's hearing though I would like to first just think the chairman of the full committee, Chairman Nadler who has been an extraordinary supporter of this investigation and an active participant and it would not have been permitted to proceed in the kind of robust nature that it did without his support so I want to thank Mr. Nadler for that. </p><p>NADLER: Let me thank Mr. Cicilline for--for his role in this. Without your efforts this would not have occurred. </p><p>CICILLINE: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I also want to take a moment as a point of personal privilege to thank the members of the subcommittee on both sides of the aisle who have taken this work seriously, invested extraordinary amounts of time to conduct a really thorough investigation. I am really grateful for that and also want to take a particular moment of privilege to extend my thanks to our extraordinary staff of the subcommittee for the work that they have done and will continue to do. </p><p>I have said this many times before, this is a mighty staff of five or six that has done the work of 30 or more and that is (INAUDIBLE) Nikon(SP), Amanda Lewis(SP), Phil Byrnebot(SP), Anna Lenhart(SP) and Joe Fernbach(SP) and they have just been extraordinary and I know all of my colleagues will join me in thanking them. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I think you know they have obviously been really important and indispensable part of this process and every member on this dais is grateful on both sides of the aisle for all of the work that has been put into it. I also want to just take a moment to thank my chief of staff Peter (INAUDIBLE) and my communications director Richly Chetty(SP) for their diligence and commitment during this investigation. And finally, to our witnesses, thank you again. </p><p>You have all informed this work throughout and given us a lot to think about today and we are grateful for that and I will end by just reminding everyone the reason that this investigation is so important to the future on our country is because our country has a history of this battle between concentrated economic power, monopolies and democracy. We are seeing that play out in the most extraordinary way and frankly in a dangerous way and it is incumbent on the Congress of the United States to fulfill our responsibility to make sure our economy works and we safeguard our democracy and this investigation is a critical part of that so thank you all. And with that, the hearing is adjourned. I'm sorry, members have five legislative days to enter into the record materials and extended remarks. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-C0D1-F15W-H02K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

My name is Harmeet K. Dhillon, and I am a trial lawyer in private practice in California, with a focus on technology and employment issues. In my 25-year career, I have represented numerous clients subjected to discrimination in academia, the workplace, consumer markets, and in civil rights matters. I have been called before you today to discuss the rampant and systematic discrimination of certain classes of conservative Americans that is occurring within, and perpetrated by, certain elements within the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, I will endeavor to describe the anti-conservative discrimination, harassment, and institutionalized bias faced by many conservative Americans at the hands of large technology companies. I will begin by discussing Big Tech's discriminatory employment practices, with an emphasis on Google, which I have sued in a class action lawsuit on behalf of conservatives, men, and white or Asian employees and job applicants. n1 Next, I will discuss how Big Tech companies, particularly social media companies, discriminate against conservatives in the products and services they offer. I will also discuss the overt and embedded political biases found at these companies. Finally, I will touch upon the negative impacts of these practices on business innovation, growth, and consumer choice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. Big Tech's Employment Practices Discriminate Against Conservatives.</p><p>Through my employment law practice, I have learned that Big Tech firms systematically and illegally engage in widespread discrimination against American workers on the basis of their gender, race, religion, values, and political affiliations. Specifically, men, whites, Asians, Christians, those with conservative family values, and political libertarians/conservatives are daily punished for who they are and what they believe. Big Tech companies - even while they compete with one another in certain markets - employ the same tactics in varying degrees: hiring quotas and preferences, and the silencing of questions and heterodox viewpoints through harassment, blacklisting, and firing critics who make it past the employment barricades. Employees who dare to dissent are not only fired, but publicly shamed, humiliated, labeled, and cast out.</p><p>James Damore is one such client to have experienced this perverse treatment. James was fired by Google because he dared to share, internally within Google, a memorandum he created in response to his employer's request for feedback. His memo reflects and discusses widely held views, supported by published research, about differences between men and women, and his thoughts about how those differences may be relevant to making the workplace more attractive for women. James fell victim to Big Tech's war of political correctness and social engineering.</p><p>Many other workers who dare to speak out against these practices are similarly disciplined, fired, and shunted into secretive arbitration proceedings with limited rights and no appeal. For every James Damore and his colleagues at Google who are publicly seeking protection against these abusive practices, there are thousands more whose names the members of this committee will never hear. Indeed, shortly after I filed the lawsuit on behalf of James Damore Google moved swiftly for a protective order censoring what information may be publicly disclosed in court filings, and by demanding that Damore and two of his colleague's claims be submitted to separate, individual, secretive arbitrations closed off from public view and press reporting. As a result, most of the important employment issues implicated by the Damore lawsuit will never be heard in open court, and both the public and government may never learn the truth of what occurred,or be allowed to consider whether action should be taken to prevent more of the same.</p><p>Objection to Big Tech's discrimination comes from more than one political persuasion. I represent a significant cross-section of the American workforce which includes white men, Asian men, libertarians, Republicans, economic conservatives, social conservatives, Christians, and people with no political or lifestyle affiliation whatsoever. Workers who question Big Tech's unworkable and impossibly rigid orthodoxy are criticized, ostracized, demonized, threatened, and fired, often for the smallest and frequently fabricated infractions. Indeed, I have represented employees chastised for a wide variety of innocuous activities, including: asking how to address someone based on their gender preference; joining 62 million other Americans in voting for President Trump; and suggesting that there may be differences between men and women that should be considered in designing a workplace friendlier to women.</p><p>The employer's motivation across each of these cases appears to be the same: to impose upon their employees only those progressive values that dictate a redistribution of opportunities and benefits to certain defined classes, with no regard to the human carnage meted on innocent workers who have not, themselves, discriminated against others. I want to be clear, however, that this problem is not restricted to Silicon Valley. The tech giants in California were, as they very often are, the first movers within corporate America to adopt these new, and increasingly aggressive tactics. Unfortunately, they were not the last to do so, and I have spoken with or represented employees across the United States facing similar issues - usually at the hands of America's largest and most successful corporations, where the disease of political correctness has firmly taken root, and is metastasizing</p><p>These are career-limiting employment challenges for my clients and many other free-thinking individuals, but they have broader consequences for all of us, in terms of slowed innovation, denial of social media services to many Americans, and ultimately a lack of competitiveness. Simply put, Big Tech's obsession with re-engineering society is costing jobs, information, rights, opportunities, and money. In fact, there is a growing trend within technology companies to increase hiring for \"Diversity and Inclusion\" departments, taking away resources from economic drivers and instead devoting those resources to making decisions about quotas, executive performance at hitting those quotas, how to punish people who question or fail to meet the quotas, and how to placate the social justice warriors within and outside the corporations.</p><p>I would like to share with the committee some of the examples of political bias in the workplace that I have come across in my law practice, from the over 100 current and former Big Tech employees who have contacted me in the past several months in the wake of the James Damore lawsuit:</p><p>1. One Google employee was fired as a direct result of his cooperation with a federal investigation into the company's illegal labor practices, including work rules that bar employees from discussing their working conditions with one another or with third parties, in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, as well as bullying and retaliation related to protected labor activities. When Google found out that this employee was talking to the government and seeking legal counsel from my law firm, they printed out two years of his search history and interrogated him on search queries relating to employee rights issues, on multiple occasions over the course of several months. Google abruptly suspended and then fired him days after the NLRB's national policy office announced it was moving forward with his case, after over two years of investigation and policy analysis during which time Google consistently opposed his claims and sought to narrow the same, urging the NLRB to overturn existing precedents protecting worker rights. Relatedly, government investigators have complained that Google's repression of worker dissent has impeded the government's ability to investigate pay disparity claims at Google. n2</p><p>2. Google's heavy-handed approach to employee rights has implications far beyond the Google headquarters, and beyond the rights of conservative workers. In a filing from April, 2017 in response to worker complaints about confidentiality policies that sought to interfere with protected concerted labor activities, Google lobbied the NLRB to reverse the pro-worker Purple Communications and William Beaumont Hospital precedents. Purple Communications protected the right to use corporate email to organize; and William Beaumont Hospital prevented employers from making handbook rules that prohibit employee decision-making and rallying regarding working conditions. Most Google employees are probably not aware that Google quietly but aggressively seeks to change the law to restrict worker rights, even as it publicly placates its workers with \"diversity and inclusion\" rhetoric.</p><p>3. Google has held forums where the public booing of employees in favor of traditional marriage was encouraged.</p><p>4. Shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Google leadership, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Kent Walker, Eileen Naughton, Ruth Porat, and Sundar Pichai, fomented anti-conservative outrage and vocalized their disgust at the election of President Donald J. Trump's at a company-wide \"TGIF\" meeting. n3 Co-founder Sergey Brin opened the meeting by stating that he found the election to be \"deeply offensive\" and later compared Trump supporters to fascists and extremists, arguing that Trump voters were motivated by \"boredom,\" which, Brin argued, has led to fascism and communism in the past. Vice President Kent Walker also argued that Trump supporters were motivated by \"fear, xenophobia, hatred, and a desire for answers that may or may not be there.\" CEO Sundar Pichai even suggested that Google would develop machine learning technology capable of combating what an employee described as \"misinformation\" shared by voters.</p><p>5. Google hosted an all-hands forum where various business units that had failed to achieve gender parity staffing goals, were called out and publicly shamed for falling short. Given that Google remains about 70% male in many key departments, this means that a majority of the company's 88,000 employees are regularly subjected to an atmosphere where they are told they are less desirable for hiring.</p><p>6. A Google employee whose daughter suffers from gender dysphoria was disciplined for asking fellow parents for advice on treating the condition. Another employee was scolded by HR for saying he wanted to raise his children according to traditional gender roles.</p><p>7. Another employee was fired after stating that \"Trump supporters are a hated and despised minority at Google\", and pleading for better treatment.</p><p>8. Several other employees were disciplined for expressing concerns that Google's employment practices are unfair to white and Asian males.</p><p>9. Another Google employee was told by a manager that \"you are doing enormous damage to your career\" by coming out as a conservative at Google.</p><p>10. Google is not just largely comprised of a workforce that leans left, but maintains a company culture that demands it. High-ranking Google Directors are allowed to openly and publicly threaten conservative employees with impunity. Indeed, one employee received a bonus for her anti-James Damore-social media attacks.</p><p>11. Google Managers openly mock and denigrate employees for voting Republican. It is illegal for them to do this in California, but they do it nonetheless.</p><p>12. On January 30, 2017, a senior Google software engineer posted a list of suggestions in response to a town hall meeting where CEO Sundar Pichai and Founder Sergey Brin asked Googlers what things they could do to support employees. The senior engineer suggested Google should blacklist conservative publications such as Breitbart and \"[d]elete Donald Trump's and his administration's and his aides' Gmail accounts for abuse.\" The employee also suggested Google abuse its power and completely immobilize Mr. Trump's Android phone by turning it into a \"brick.\" n4 These recommendations were among a list of six made by Alon Altman, and a number of them were followed by Google.</p><p>13. Employees who want to be promoted at Google are required to go through training conducted by the company's \"Unbiasing Group\" - where biases are, in fact, inculcated into attendees, including biases against whites, men, and anyone who challenges the leftist, progressive orthodoxy. n5</p><p>14. When Google finds out that an employee is a Trump supporter, managers will frequently launch an internal HR investigation to review the past few years of the employee's emails, in an attempt to find policy violations. They have interrogated several conservative employees over long-forgotten posts going back two years or more. Employees are sent home in disgrace until they are cleared of the charges, usually after a warning not to transgress again - or they are fired.</p><p>15. A 31-year-old told the Wall Street Journal that he left his job as an engineer at Google after growing frustrated with a lack of tolerance for conservative views at the company. He said he was surprised when, shortly after Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016, the firm canceled a companywide product demonstration and instead held an all-hands meeting to talk about the results of the election, at which those results were characterized by Google managers as a tragedy of epic proportions. n6</p><p>16. Google managers are instructed to evaluate employees on the basis of so-called \"inclusive perf\" or \"inclusive performance\" factors. They are warned not to succumb to judging employees according to racial stereotypes that Google ascribes to racial groups - such individual achievement and objectivity being examples of \"white dominant culture,\" and various other shocking and disparaging stereotypes of all racial groups with implication that other racial groups, in fact, are not capable of individual achievement and objectivity. n7</p><p>17. Google's most vocal social justice warriors, who have themselves loudly complained about being \"outed\" for their vicious behavior as described in the Damore lawsuit, spend significant amounts of their time at work and online whipping up hysteria against their perceived enemies: conservatives, men, Asians, whites, Christians, and worst of all Republicans who share any of the other disfavored characteristics. The moment any employee in their crosshairs dares to raise a mild protest to their labeling, characterizing, and shaming, those employees are accused by their colleagues of \"derailment\" - i.e. changing the subject.</p><p>18. Google has responded to the exposure of its invidious employment practices by continuing to harass conservatives, continuing to lobby the NLRB to curtail worker rights, and, most tellingly of all, seeking to seal the complaint and amended complaint in the Damore lawsuit. n8 As we speak, Google is spending tremendous resources to bully and bankrupt conservative whistleblowers through secret arbitration proceedings designed not only to punish these brave employees, but also to serve as a dire warning to other employees who might dare to speak out. A complicit media is silent about these bullying and censorship tactics.</p><p>19. Google and other tech companies employ explicit quotas that their recruiters are given and ordered to meet. Because this practice is distasteful and illegal, Google and the others often deliver these instructions orally to groups of recruiters. Certain jobs are made available to Google-favored minorities, exclusively (note that Asians are the one minority group not favored by Google). Sometimes, Google creates jobs (what they refer to as \"headcount\") if they find a potential hire in a favored class - which they make available only to these favored-class employees. This practice violates EEO practices mandated by Title VII and related state law statutes, but few question these practices or hold Google accountable - or if employees do dispute such policies, the public remains ignorant of such disputes because Google, like many large companies, forces its employees to resolve their claims in private arbitrations with secret results.</p><p>20. A recent survey of tech workers in Silicon Valley conducted by Lincoln Network found that a substantial majority of conservatives were afraid to \"be themselves\" at work for fear of retribution, while liberals and progressives felt no such fear. The findings are striking n9: 31% of the 387 tech workers polled stated that they know someone who either did not pursue or left a career in tech because they saw a conflict in viewpoints with their employer or colleagues. Among respondents who identified themselves as \"very conservative,\" that number was 59%.</p><p>21. In addition to employing quotas, Google hires a cadre of political correctness police described euphemistically with titles such as \"Racial Equity Strategist,\" whose job qualifications include \"Experience with racial frameworks (i.e. structuralists, belief-centered, critical race theory, intersectional race studies, queer theory) and responsibilities include \"Use subject matter expertise on race, intersectionality, and adaptive leadership to set the strategy for shifting cultural norms and revising it based on feedback, organization cultural norms, and persistent dynamics.\" n10</p><p>22. Although Big Tech's discrimination against conservative and religious Americans is no joke, its existence is so widely acknowledged that the issue has become part of the pop culture associated with the industry, as demonstrated by a recent episode of the HBO comedy \"Silicon Valley\" which questioned whether one could openly be a Christian in Silicon Valley. n11</p><p>23. Google is not the only Silicon Valley company out of touch with mainstream America. Earlier this year a controversy erupted at Twitter after Twitter/Square CEO Jack Dorsey posted a photograph of his savings after paying for a Chick-Fil-A order with his Square card. Because six years ago the fast food chain's CEO had posted about his support of traditional marriage, Dorsey quickly backtracked and apologized publicly for patronizing the Christian-owned chain. n12 Imagine the effect of this on Twitter/Square employees of faith who support a traditional definition of marriage - as many Americans do.</p><p>24. While this phenomenon of ideological persecution has received attention recently in the wake of the Damore lawsuit, it is not new. In 2014, Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and longtime Valley tech executive, was forced to step down from the CEO role at Mozilla, the Internet browser company he originally helped to co-found, after it was revealed by social justice activists that he had contributed $1,000 to Proposition 8, the traditional marriage initiative in California, which passed but was later struck down by the courts. Eich was hounded out of his job for the private act of supporting a ballot measure that the majority of California voters supported, but which later fell out of favor. His downfall foretold the current situation.</p><p>II. Big Tech's Products Systematically Discriminate Against Conservatives</p><p>Big Tech's anti-conservative bias extends far beyond the confines of labor and employment law. The discriminatory attitudes described in this testimony are pervasive and nationwide in scope. Moreover, these attitudes infect the products that Big Tech companies offer their customers, and thus affect American consumer choice. In some markets, such as digital advertising, Big Tech companies have near-monopoly or duopoly power, n13 such that the lack of competition means consumers are stuck with biased and even discriminatory product offerings. The examples are manifold.</p><p>1. In June 2018, Google listed \"Nazism\" as the ideology of the California Republican Party. Google blamed Wikipedia for the mess, but Google selected Wikipedia (which is readily manipulated by miscreants) as the input for this information. n14</p><p>2. In June 2018, just after the \"Nazism\" scandal discussed above, Google apologized after a top search result for North Carolina Republican State Senator Trudy Wade yielded a photo labeling her as a bigot. n15</p><p>3. Following President Donald J. Trump's implementation of a \"travel ban\" in January 2017, Google-employees discussed internally how to leverage Google's search functions to counter undersired political viewpoints, while promoting pro-immigration organizations and advocacy. n16</p><p>4. In September 2018, it was widely reported that a confidential Google memorandum concerning project \"Dragonfly,\" was internally leaked to Google employees, revealing Google's plans to create and implement a censored search engine in the People's Republic of China. According to reports, a new Google app for Androids and iOS devices would enable the censorship of search results and the collection of private user data, including the tracking of physical movements, IP addresses of the devices being used, and the history of all links clicked. The proposed implementation of such capabilities flies in the face of Google's public philosophy of an open internet. n17</p><p>5. Google's downtown Washington, D.C. office recently was slated to host a June 6 party called \"Run for Something,\" seeking to help build a \"bench\" of low-level elected politicians within the Democratic Party. n18 The event was moved after media drew attention to the one-sided promotion of liberal candidates only.</p><p>6. As early as 2010, researchers at Harvard University started finding evidence that Google's search rankings were not so objective, favoring its own products over those of competitors. n19 The FTC followed up with related findings in 2012. n20 A recent piece in the New York Times Magazine went into devastating detail about how Google's self-slated search results have crippled a generation of small competitors. n21</p><p>7. Besides favoring itself, Google's search results have been shown to favor Democrats in a 2015 report in Slate. n22</p><p>8. WikiLeaks released an email showing that Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt was working directly with the Clinton Campaign n23 and was seen wearing a \"staff\" badge at the Clinton Election Night Party. n24 Schmidt is an investor in and board member of Civis Analytics, a company that has been paid millions by Democratic committees, Federal Election Commission findings show. n25</p><p>9. An email published by WikiLeaks from John Podesta shows that Google loaned a company jet to the Democratic Party on an official trip to Africa, and how Schmidt himself wanted to be \"head outside advisor\" to any future Democratic presidential candidate. n26</p><p>10. In an email bulletin to 10 Google VPs, Google's Head of Multicultural Marketing described how the company's Spanish-language voter education efforts were specifically designed to drive higher turnout for Hillary Clinton in key battleground states. She expressed remorse that \"only 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn't enough.\" She also described Google's unadvertised partnership with Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states.</p><p>11. In May, several Google employees resigned, citing ethical concerns in leveraging artificial intelligence in drone warfare, as well as more general concerns about Google's decisions in the political arena. Over 4,000 Google employees demanded that Google stop work on the DoD's Project Maven, which focuses on the use of artificial intelligence in warfare. n27 Of course, at the same time, Google was accelerating its move into China, where it will partner with the Chinese government to spy on, censor, and suppress Chinese citizens and dissidents.</p><p>12. YouTube censored free, short videos put out by Dennis Prager's \"PragerU\" on the restricted list. \"'They have decided that they will put, in this case, 40 of our 300 videos on the restricted list, meaning it joins pornography and violence,' Prager said, revealing that even a video by lifelong Democrat Alan Dershowitz on the legal founding of Israel was placed in \"restricted mode.\" n28</p><p>13. Google maintains at least nine different blacklists that impact our lives, generally without input or authority from any outside advisory group, industry association or government agency: the autocomplete blacklist; the Google Maps blacklist; the YouTube blacklist; the Google account blacklist; the Google news blacklist; the Google AdWords blacklist; the Google AdSense blacklist; the search engine blacklist; the quarantine list. n29</p><p>14. In March 2018, conservative broadcaster Alex Jones announced that YouTube had frozen his video channel and would delete it later that week, after CNN pushed Google and its advertisers to make the move. n30</p><p>15. During the last presidential election, Google was accused of deliberately filtering autocomplete suggestions to favor Hillary Clinton. According to one source, \"Type 'lying' into Google, and it would suggest 'Lying Ted,' the moniker US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump placed on his onetime rival, Ted Cruz. But type 'crooked' into Google, and it didn't bring up the 'Crooked Hillary' label that Trump had attached to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\" n31</p><p>16. YouTube banned a pro-life music video called \"what was your name\" by Joyce Bartholomew, claiming it was in violation of its \"terms of service.\" n32</p><p>17. Google's YouTube unit has also attempted to shut down or penalize content creators who posted in support of James Damore, including Jordan Peterson and authors on Blogger. Other documents we have reviewed include Google employees working together to concoct purported violations of terms of service to prepare for a takedown of blogs with disfavored content, or to demonetize content creators with disfavored views - including views critical of Google. Google advertising sales employees have gone out of their way to inform AdWords customers of sites they should avoid advertising on because the content is \"unsafe,\" such as Breitbart.</p><p>18. In May 2016, Google banned all ads by payday lenders, even though it invested in LendUp, which is in the same industry. n33 It has taken similar action with respect to bail bondsmen, blocking hundreds of thousands of arrestees and their families from easy access to an integral element of the criminal justice system, under the guise of protecting users from \"harmful\" products. n34</p><p>19. Over the years, Google has been exposed for censoring information procured through its searches, utilizing methods of: blacklisting phrases suggested by autocomplete n35, blocking conservative YouTube videos (including, most recently, videos by PragerU - currently suing YouTube for the censorship in a case that is now on appeal) n36, and even blacklisting or falsely suppressing articles and websites. n37</p><p>20. Google and its subsidiaries are not alone in their discrimination against conservatives. In January, undercover journalists from Project Veritas exposed Twitter for \"shadow-banning\" conservative profiles. n38</p><p>21. Our firm's client True Pundit, a popular conservative blog which had approximately 270,000 followers on two Twitter accounts when we started our representation, has persistently suffered from Twitter's shadow-banning, outright banning, and follower-deleting practices. True Pundit literally sees this practice ramp up on a per-story basis. If the story is critical of top FBI leaders, they experience censorship. Critical of the Clintons? Censorship and banning. When True Pundit criticized the FBI's response or failure to respond the Florida school shooter, Twitter cut the site's engagement by 30%. Thousands of the site's followers have complained that they are unable to see many of its posts on Twitter, or if they see them, are unable to respond to or retweet them. Of its 270,000 followers, True Pundit estimates that some of their posts reach only 10,000 followers due to censorship.</p><p>22. Major tech platforms including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter all defer to the Southern Poverty Law Center in \"moderating\" (a/k/a banning) content. n39 The SPLC has faced criticism across the political spectrum for smearing conservatives and even moderate liberals as racists and extremists. n40 On June 18, 2018, SPLC announced that it had to reach a settlement with Maajid Nawaz and his organization Quilliam for falsely labeling them as an anti-Muslim hate group; the settlement included paying them $3.375 million. n41 Yet Big Tech social media censors continue to employ the SPLC's overbroad hit list as a basis for censoring online speech in America, hiding behind the Communication Decency Act's Section 230 safe harbor provision, refashioned as a license to defame. n42 Big Tech has targeted our client David Horowitz Freedom Center, using the SPLC's vicious and defamatory smears and attacks as an excuse to cut off payment processing and fundraising efforts, and threatening public figures that attend DHFC events with crowdsourced social media boycotts. The monopolistic practices of the social media giants make one-stop shopping for political censors much easier - they just have to convince a Google or one of its official censors such as the SPLC that a certain speaker or viewpoint is \"dangerous,\" or \"hateful,\" or \"undesirable,\" and that voice is effectively silenced, unable to raise money or even to be heard.</p><p>23. Early last year, under the guise of eliminating \"fake news,\" Facebook began flagging news articles that it deems \"disputed\" - and allowing users to do the same. Flagged content subsequently appeared with a disclaimer. n43 However, in October 2017, Facebook halted its public \"fake news\" identification system and switched to a new algorithm, under which news and articles which Facebook engineers have deemed as fake gets \"deprioritized\" in users' news feeds, making it harder to find on the platform. n44 Facebook has outsourced its approval of fact-checking organizations to the Poynter Institute, n45 which is funded by politically motivated foundations such as Pierre Omidyar's Omidyar Network, and George Soros' Open Society Foundation. n46</p><p>24. Big Tech's extremism is driving innovators and their capital from Silicon Valley. Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire who supported President Trump's election, left Silicon Valley earlier this year due to his frustration with the region's and the industry's left-leaning politics. Thiel told Fox Business News earlier this year that \"When people are unanimously on one side, that tells me not that they've all figured out the truth but that they are in sort of a totalitarian place, that they are in a one-party state where they are not allowed to have dissenting views.\" n47 Similarly, in January 2018, Mike Moritz, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm partner, wrote that the local tech culture has descended into \"soul-sapping discussions\" about \"the inequity of life,\" and that Silicon Valley's culture is becoming \"unhinged\" with discussions of things like the politics of speakers at tech companies. n48 Angel investor Tom McInerney, who fled Silicon Valley a decade ago, told the Wall Street Journal that \"the politics of San Francisco have gotten a little bit crazy.\" n49</p><p>III. Big Tech Employees And Managers</p><p>Disproportionately Support Democrats For Election</p><p>When seeking explanations as to the source of Big Tech's ideological biases, one need look no further than political affiliation, as measured by campaign contributions.</p><p>1. Since George H.W. Bush won Napa County in 1988, Republican presidential nominees have lost every county in the Bay Area. n50</p><p>2. In 2012, President Obama won 84% of the vote in San Francisco, and raised more money in the Bay Area than in New York or Hollywood. n51</p><p>3. In 2016, President Trump received just 9% of the vote in San Francisco. n52</p><p>4. These figures represent the ambient liberal bias in the region, but when considered in conjunction with campaign contributions by Big Tech employees and managers, as we did recently, n53 the results are even more extreme:</p><p>5. In the 2016 campaign, Google employees gave $31.38 to Democrats for every $1 to Republicans.</p><p>6. A stunning 35 times more Google employees contributed to Clinton than Trump.</p><p>7. The odds of dying in a pedestrian incident (1 in 647) were greater than the odds of a U.S.-based Google employee having contributed to Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign (1 in 875).</p><p>8. Of the 39 Google employees who contributed to Trump, 48.7% did not reside in the Bay Area of California where Google is headquartered. None of Google's Trump supporters listed themselves as executives, and 76.9% of them disclosed that they were in technical roles such as software engineers or developers.</p><p>9. In the 2016 presidential election nationally, Google employees contributed to Democrats versus Republicans at 19.9 times the national rate.</p><p>10. In the 2016 campaign, Google employees contributed to Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump at 21.1 times the national rate.</p><p>11. Total individual campaign contributions across the U.S. were 60.0% ($672.5 million) to Democratic Party candidates, 38.0% ($425.7 million) to Republican Party candidates, and 2.0% ($21.7 million) to other party candidates.</p><p>12. By contrast, Google employees' total individual campaign contributions were 94.7% ($1,986,768) to Democratic Party candidates, 3.0% ($63,319) to Republican Party candidates, and 2.3% ($47,393) to other party candidates.</p><p>13. In sum, it is statistically implausible for this level of bias to occur at a company the size of Google without active selection of employees by political views, or the corollary: without active discrimination to drive out conservative or moderate employees. Even a cursory examination of campaign contributions confirms employees, and especially management, of Big Tech to be overwhelmingly in the Democratic party camp.</p><p>IV. CONCLUSION</p><p>I respectfully submit to this committee that the coordinated, discriminatory actions of the social media giants steer us far away from our Constitution, far away from the rights we hold sacred, and far away from the ideals with which we seek to govern our lives. We hear a great deal about diversity these days. Well, diversity also includes diversity of thought. No one should be fired for the sin of disagreeing with his or her employer about something unrelated to job performance. No one should be denied employment or promotion because he or she was born into a now-disfavored demographic group, or should be made to answer in the workplace for the sins of others who came before them.</p><p>Big Tech has become an insular fortress of thought coercion and vindictive behavioral control, where instead of robbing individuals of their lives, it seeks to rob them of their ability to exercise independent judgement and free will. The culture and tactics of some companies would make Orwell's Big Brother proud, as they often surpass the cult-like thinking described in his book 1984. These actions are not just a form of private censorship carried out against isolated individuals or groups by a lone manager or director, but are broad-based attempts to completely reclassify or dispense with reason and logic, and reshape our economy and our society into a progressive, utopian form. This thought control manifests itself in the illegal discrimination against employees, in manipulation of data, in censorship of consumers, and in meddling with our elections, and it should not stand.</p><p>Thank you for inviting me to share my views and the experiences of our clients, and I look forward to answering any questions from the committee.</p><p>n1 Timothy Lee, Don't Be Evil - Google fired James Damore for a controversial gender memo--now he's Suing, Ars Technica (Jan. 9, 2018), <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/lawsuit-goes-after-alleged-anti-conservative-bias-at-google/\">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/lawsuit-goes-after-alleged-anti-conservative-bias-at-google/</url>.

Hope you will join us, a reminder follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, Facebook and Instagram @LouDobbsTonight. Thanks for joining us, good night from Sussex.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS HOST: Good morning TGIF. Good morning, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us. It is Friday, May 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 am on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Riots on the streets of Minneapolis this morning, a police precinct set ablaze as protests over the death of George Floyd intensify there and across the country. We have a live report from the ground coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, President Trump's tweet on the riots flagged by Twitter, the company censoring his post claiming it glorifies violence this after the President signed an Executive Order limiting protections for social media giants.</p><p>U.S.-China tensions are raising meanwhile, President Trump say he will hold a news conference today on China after Beijing's moves to clamp down on Hong Kong's freedoms. China is threatening counter measures this morning.</p><p>The growing tensions pushing Futures toward a lower opening this morning take a look at stocks, with the DOW Jones Industrial average right now down 100 points, the S&amp;P is down 9 and the NASDAQ down better than 32 points.</p><p>This after U.S. markets finished in the red yesterday but for the month, the DOW, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 are up better than 4 percent on the month of May. Plus, helping America's small businesses, the House is easing rules for the Paycheck Protection Program. \"Mornings with Maria\" is live right now.</p><p>And global markets this morning continue to reflect the concerns going over across the world, concerns about China's action against Hong Kong's freedoms and how the world will react leading to losses across the board in Europe. Take a look. FTSE100 down 58 right now, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 35 and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 127.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed. Investors are waiting for President Trump's press conference and what he has to say about China tightening its grip on Hong Kong. What will be the real repercussions to that?</p><p>Markets are mixed as you see SHANGHAI Composite was actually up a quarter of a percent, HANG SENG in Hong Kong down three quarters of a percent. Now some of the top stories that we're watching this morning Minneapolis on fire after another night of violence across the city the National Guard called in after rioters seize the city's third precinct, setting it on fire.</p><p>Protesters are demanding charges against the officers involved in the death of George Floyd. The riots sparking protests across the country people want justice. In Denver in riot gear trying to contain angry crowds as they knock down police barriers and vandalize cars.</p><p>In New York, at least 40 protesters were arrested after clashing with police there as well. President Trump is promising justice for Floyd while slamming the Mayor of Minneapolis for his handling of looting and rioting in the city the Mayor firing back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACOB FREY, MAYOR, MINNEAPOLIS: Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damned sure that we're going to get through this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Mayor claiming he's doing everything he can to control the violence, saying that this is the most difficult thing the city has ever gone through in Minneapolis. President Trump cracking down on social media companies as well the President signing an Executive Order yesterday that curtails legal protections for the company's platforms, accusing them of having an unchecked power to censor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: My Executive Order calls for new regulations under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make it those social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act indemnifies companies like Twitter and Facebook for any action taken in good faith. Twitter reacting to the new order tweeting this, this Executive Order is a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.</p><p>Section 230 protects American innovation and freedom of expression and is underpinned by Democratic values. Attempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and internet freedoms. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg adding the Executive Order is the wrong move.</p><p>Well, President Trump is set to announce new U.S. policies on China at a news conference today. We are all waiting to see what the news conference is. It comes after Beijing approved a new national security law that overrides Hong Kong's autonomy the President adding that he will release more details about the possible impact of the new law on the U.S.-China trade deal to reporters.</p><p>You're looking at violence happening in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The President is also expected to sign a bill that punishes China for torturing the Uyghur Muslims which are currently locked up in camps in China at least one million of those Muslims wanting to practice their own religion.</p><p>Nine states and Washington D.C. easing several restrictions today D.C. reopening outdoor dining as well as hair salons and barber shops. Illinois, Maryland and Virginia also allowing outdoor seating at restaurants beginning today. In the south sports fans get the go ahead to attend outdoor games this weekend in Texas, then use must limit capacity though to 25 percent.</p><p>And a sense of normalcy in Mississippi, Oklahoma and Arkansas, people flocking to restaurants and mall as those states lift restrictions as well. More than 40 million people have filed for unemployment benefit since states issues stay-at-home orders and forced businesses to close. That number has not been seen since the great depression.</p><p>Well, markets are pointing to a decline this morning ahead of the opening of trading. Today is the final trading day of what's been a volatile month for the markets, the month of May. Investors are heightened trade tensions with China now on rest in Hong Kong, the reopening of the economy as we move into June a lot of things consider.</p><p>Let's talk right now with CFRA Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall and also joining the conversation this morning Fox Businesses' Dagen McDowell, Pollster and the President of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter and Real Clear Politics White House Reporter Philip Wegmann. Great to see you everybody this, thanks so much you for being here.</p><p>Sam, let's kick it off with you. Give us your assessment of where we are and what things might look like come six months, now that we are seeing all 50 states open and more reopenings of businesses this weekend?</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CFRA CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Good morning, Maria. Well, I think what we're going to be experiencing is that V-shaped recovery that economists are calling for, expectations for a 37 percent decline in second quarter GDP followed by a 28 percent surge in the third quarter and a double digit gain in the fourth quarter as well.</p><p>And I think that investors realize that the second quarter earnings picture is dismal at minus 44 percent, but expectations are that things could end up coming in better and that's why the market will likely continue to march its way higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen McDowell.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Sam, I was looking at a note that U.S. corporate bond sales have hit $1 trillion. They're running at the fastest pace ever and this is without the Federal Reserve even directly buying any fixed income.</p><p>Of course, bond ETFs, yes. But this is literally just the Fed being that backstop. How do we solve what many call - I know Stephanie Pomboy is coming up later - a corporate debt bubble with more debt. Is this still a problem months, even years for now, for the stock market?</p><p>STOVALL: I think it's something that will be in the background for quite some time. Yes, we're dealing with a debt level that really was unseen before but we realize that it's as if we're in World War II. We've got to be spending the money in order to support the economy.</p><p>And I think the Fed basically says that with the monetary stimulus, Congress says with the fiscal stimulus, that the debt is something that we will have to manage later on but right now the focus is on supporting the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I tell you, it feels like we've seen the worst in terms of the economic story but you've got a lot of companies that won't make it here, Sam. Coronavirus and the business impact have been significant. Costco now one of the major retailers open during the pandemic reporting higher revenue and an increase in same store sales during the third quarter.</p><p>The company also said they are re-evaluating its food sampling once the pandemic ends. One of the most popular features in their stores is coming as UPS is announcing peak surcharges for companies like Amazon and Target. They're sending more packages during the Coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Walk us through the industry here, Sam, that you think will be poised to lead us out of this recovery and which areas do you think that will be taking longer and harder hit?</p><p>STOVALL: Right now, we're looking at about 34 percent of the sub industries and there are about 150 sub industries in the S&amp;P 1500, about one-third of them are above the 200 day moving average. So what we're basically seeing are the sectors such as consumer discretionary, we're looking at financials, we're looking at some of the other cyclical areas that are working their way higher as investors anticipate a turnaround.</p><p>The best performing groups over the last week were your discount department stores, were your airlines, leisure facilities, et cetera. So the areas that were hit the hardest investors believe if they have not gone out of business already they probably won't and will be able to eek by.</p><p>So a lot of those companies that in the hotel hospitality space, et cetera, that we've been quite worried about could end up surviving and representing good investment opportunities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I think the big story this morning is going to be the President's press conference on China. I'm hearing that they're going to go big in some way in terms of holding China accountable for breaking another promise with Hong Kong.</p><p>Philip Wegmann, tell me your thoughts on the President's policies and what could come out of this? We may very well see sanctions on individuals from the Communist Party. What else can the President do at this press conference to hold China accountable?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, he could finally tip his hand. For months we've been asking the President and the press corps what kind of repercussions China should face for their lack of transparency when it came to COVID-19 and each time he declined to answer.</p><p>He said he would deal with that at a later date. So now after about two and-a-half months of having that question put to him, he's finally going to give us some kind of answer. What I'm looking at right now is the clearest indication of what we can expect is last week Larry Kudlow said that the President was miffed at China.</p><p>And that he is no longer as enamored with the possibility of the U.S.-China trade deal. He could perhaps change something in that area perhaps there will be you know human rights elements to this, anything to push back against China. Right now, the mood is very, frankly negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And by the way just like China pushed ban on the CDC to investigate what's happening in terms of the origins of the COVID-19, they also pushed back on the UN. America's mission to the United Nations revealing that it had requested a Security Council meeting to discuss China's unlawful moves over Hong Kong but as China, one of its most powerful members on the council, blocked that meeting.</p><p>So China and the Communist Party not allowing anybody in to see the plans for Hong Kong, just the way they did not allow anyone in to see the origins of Coronavirus. Sam Stovall, thank you for your insights this morning. We're expecting a flat opening this morning for the broader averages. But the rest of the year it's going to be important to watch the economy. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Coming up, riots raging across the country this morning over the death of George Floyd, one police station in Minneapolis engulfed in flames right now and at the risk of exploding. We're live in Minnesota when we come back.</p><p>The protests fueling a social media fight meanwhile as Twitter takes action against President Trump's tweet overnight again. We're bringing you the very latest. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Social media crackdown, President Trump responding to violent protests in Minneapolis overnight, the President tweeted this. These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd. I won't let that happen. Just spoke to the Governor Tim and told him that the military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you.</p><p>Twitter hid the tweet claiming that it glorified violence, days after flagging the President's tweets on mail-in ballot fraud. Joining me right now is media reporter for the Hill, Joe Concha. Joe it is great to have you this morning, what do you think of this?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. I think that Twitter is probably going to have to hire several thousand more people Maria because if we're just going to be fact checking misleading or lies on Twitter or what is deemed as lies - that last tweet that you just read from the President that is a subjective thing. I don't think that is something that you necessarily would fact check.</p><p>Then we better start checking that top Chinese officials are still saying on Twitter that the Coronavirus originated in the United States. We'll have to fact check that Joe Biden, the Presumptive Democratic Nominee said this just yesterday, we're in the middle of a global pandemic and is not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he's also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.</p><p>So we better start fact checking the Democrat as well as Republican as well as the Chinese as well as, say, the leader of Iran who again called Israel basically a plight on this planet. You're going to have to get a lot of people to fact check a lot of things.</p><p>And then you're also going to need the real names of people instead of all these bots that are on that are spreading information as well. That is something that probably I would think, Maria, from a PR perspective Twitter is in big trouble now because you've now alienated half of your potential audience.</p><p>The only question is what's the competition? Where are you going to go if Twitter isn't an option?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You make really good points, Joe. That's not happening. You've got Twitter targeting the President. You see that tweet that he made about the violence in Minneapolis and yet that - how does that glorify violence? Dagen McDowell, let's talk about this tweet that the President put out and what Twitter is doing right now. What's your take on this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, to say when the looting starts the shooting starts, that's disturbing. To call - refer to people as thugs, many would see that as a racist comment. However, Twitter left it up there. It's covered up with a warning but he has left it up there.</p><p>President Trump in this instance is his own worst enemy, that he is basically handing Joe Biden win after win, using that kind of language, because the only thing that Vice President Biden has going for him, among a few things, is his empathy and sympathy and people have referred to him as a grief whisperer because of the loss he's experienced throughout his life.</p><p>Lee Carter can speak to this. But the President, what is he accomplishing with that kind of language?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, look at Twitter. Look what Joe just said. Twitter is now like Mark Zuckerberg said the other day the arbiter of truth. It's ridiculous that they're just focusing on what the President says and no other honesty in any of these other tweets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Jack Dorsey is not running for President. Jack Dorsey is not running for re-election. Quite frankly, Facebook - Twitter is worth, what, $25 billion. Facebook is worth $651 billion. You mentioned Mark Zuckerberg's comment. Twitter is Zuckerberg's like after lunch snack in terms of its size.</p><p>And I think that we place a lot of attention to it but in the grand scheme of things, it's not that important in terms of the scope of social media. But I - you know, the President can say whatever he wants to but I think they--</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't think the president should be remarking about this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: --what he said overnight, it doesn't help us grieve. It doesn't help us heal. It doesn't help stop the violence in Minneapolis and in other cities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's right after Executive Order, Joe. I mean, it comes after the President signed this Executive Order to combat social media censorship. Here's what he said yesterday at the signing. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're here today to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it's faced in American history. The choices Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress and it black lists, shadow bans editorial decisions, pure and simple.</p><p>They're editorial decisions. In those moments, Twitter ceases to become a neutral platform and they become an editor with a viewpoint, I think we can say that about others as well, whether looking at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook and perhaps others.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about that? I mean, Joe, these liability shields were in place in the Telecommunications Act to assume that a platform, \"Would be a neutral actor\". Twitter is not neutral.</p><p>CONCHA: No, Twitter is not neutral. I mean, think about the people that work at Twitter Maria its basically at Silicon Valley that's a lot of a young people that work there. I doubt there's too many people that lean to the right that work at Twitter and if you look at the political donations from all the big tech companies they're overwhelmingly to Democrats.</p><p>Then we look at the head of site integrity, this is the head fact checker over at Twitter. His name is Joe. He has called President Trump on Twitter mind you, a racist tangerine. He said there are actual Nazis in the White House, that's a quote called the Senate Majority Leader McConnell a bag of farts sorry I - breath this right now.</p><p>The point is that if this is the person that's doing the fact checking, then you have to assume that the fact checks are going to go one way and we're already seeing it as I pointed out before. You could argue what the President said about Minneapolis, should he have said it or not have said it, that's a political kind of debate.</p><p>But for him to make that statement and not to fact check Joe Biden or Adam Schiff, you're going to hire another thousand people for everything that he puts up there. Then that's where you see the unfairness comes from. I just don't know how we handle this after we've gone down this slippery slope in terms of really being fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Bingo. Joe Concha, thank you sir. We will be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Minneapolis is on fire this morning riots are raging across the city over the death of George Floyd. Officials are warning the third police precinct engulfed in flames could explode. Lee Carter, want to get your take on all of this.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER &amp; PRESIDENT OF MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Yes. I think that our country is united in one thing. What's happened in Minnesota is absolutely - outrageous and we stand with the city, we stand with the people, and there's so much confusion out there.</p><p>I think that what we're seeing right now is this is going to be a moment. Will Smith, when he talked about this, there's always been racism and now it's just being filmed, I think we can't ignore it. I think we can't walk away from this and we have to stand united against this.</p><p>It's absolutely outrageous. The news that's breaking now that there are 18 complaints filed against this police officer, we can't stand for this and this has to change and we have to help the city. The city can't - the protests, it's a terrible, terrible thing. You can understand the outrage and the feeling people have right now and we just need to stand and get through this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean do we have any sense of when charges will be brought against the people who killed George Floyd?</p><p>CARTER: I don't think that we do at this moment, no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Philip Wegmann.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey Maria, sorry. I will just add one quick thing that the Justice Department is looking into this in terms of federal charges against not just this one police officer, but the four police officers that were involved in George Floyd's death, murder.</p><p>The bar there is high in terms of bringing charges the burden of proof. You have to prove that George Floyd's constitutional rights were also violated. But it's important to note that the Justice Department is on that case.</p><p>But historically, in recent instances of police violence in the murder of individuals or the death of individuals, that the Justice Department has not been - has not or chosen not to bring federal charges. But that is part of the justice that people expect and certainly would help with healing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Definitely for sure. We'll take a break. When we come back, we are looking at cities in crisis this morning. San Francisco enforcing socially distancing campsites for the homeless population and it's sparking a fresh debate over the city's spiraling housing crisis.</p><p>We'll take a closer look at the controversy as its gotten worse with COVID- 19. Then the hospitality industry, one of the hardest hit amid COVID-19, how the industry is adapting as America begins reopening once again. Stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS HOST, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back. Good Friday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it Friday, May 29th. Your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East coast.</p><p>Growing tensions between the United States and China coming to a boiling point. It is putting pressure on futures this morning. We're expecting a lower opening for the broader averages. Dow futures down 86, S&amp;P down 7 and NASDAQ futures down 21, on this the last day of the month. This after US markets finished in the red yesterday for the month. The Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 up, better than four percent on the month. As you can see, yesterday's close was a decline of 147 points.</p><p>Global markets this morning also showing some weakness. Concerns over Beijing's actions against Hong Kong's freedoms and how the world will react leading to losses across the board. European indices down. FT100 down 57. Quatre Quarante in Paris down 35 and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 104. Consumer prices in the Eurozone coming in at 1/10th of a percent for Month of May. That is a four year low. It is well below the European Central Bank's target of almost two percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mixed there. Investors are awaiting to hear what President Trump has to say. He is holding a news conference this morning about China, and we expect it to be China deepening its grip on Hong Kong and action to be taken as a result of that.</p><p>History will be made again at this year's Boston Marathon. Meanwhile, Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria. Good morning. So, for the first time in its 124 year history, the Boston Marathon has been cancelled. The race was originally supposed to be held April 20th. Then it was postponed until September due to COVID-19 concerns, but the Mayor says it will not be safe enough this Fall. Instead, this year for the first time ever, it's going to be a virtual race, which is quickly becoming the new trend for runners. Runners who verify that they ran 26.2 miles on their own within six hours can still get a medal and there will be several virtual events and activities during race week. That's going to be September 7 through the 14th. Get your Strava app uploaded runners.</p><p>Alright, Nordstrom, like many other retailers, has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly sales plunged 40 percent in the company's latest quarter, but Nordstrom says its finances are strong enough to work through the outbreak. About 40 percent of Nordstrom stores are actually now open. And William-Sonoma reported breakout growth in its online sales late in the first quarter and those sales are accelerating now. Same store sales unexpectedly rose by more than 2 1/2 percent. Shares of both companies are higher. While Nordstrom's was higher, it actually just ticked lower, it's about 1/2 percent down now. William-Sonoma still in the green, though, and look at that, it's up almost eigth percent. Strong numbers, really, from William-Sonoma.</p><p>And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. The NBA's highest paid players. Steph Curry and Chis Paul top the list for the 19, 2020 season. Most expensive beach towns in the US offer luxury for a price. Massachusetts and Florida dominate the top five. And finally, this one, it's a good one. Happy marriages encourage creativity and innovation at work. When workers are happy in their marriages, they have positive spillover of psychological resources into that work. Maria, an unhappy marriage, well researches say, it has the opposite effect. There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Makes sense. Alright Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, helping the backbone of America's economy. We are looking at House lawmakers approving changes to the Paycheck Protection Program today. Giving it more latitude in an effort to help small businesses. Loan recipients now only have to spend 60 percent of the funds on payroll, as opposed to the original 75 percent. Borrowers also have 24 weeks to spend the money, up from 8 weeks. The bill now headed to the Senate for approval. This is something certainly I've been railing on. I'm glad that they're making this change, because this is going to make it easier for small businesses to actually get through this. Joining us right now is the former President and CEO of CKE Restaurants, Andy Puzder. Andy, it's great to have you this morning. What's your reaction to these changes on the Paycheck Protection Program plan?</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, FORMER PRESIDENT AND CEO, CKE RESTAURANTS: It's great to see you Maria, and the changes are great. They're just what was needed. You had to spend your loan funds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>PUZDER: 75 percent on payroll, which obviously, employee salaries. And you had to do it within eight weeks. Well, with the economy shut down, you know, with nobody going to work, with customers not showing up at the restaurants, it was very difficult for businesses to meet those deadlines. So, they've extended the time in which you have to spend the money to 24 weeks. And they lowered the amount you have to spend on payroll down to 60 percent, so now people can pay rent and utilities and other expenses. So, it is very positive for the restaurant industry in particular.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, the only other issue that we're still waiting on whether or not we're going to see change is the unemployment benefit of the $600 dollars being given to people who are staying home, ultimately meaning that some people are going to be making more money to stay home than they are actually to go back to work. Do you think we'll see a change there?</p><p>PUZDER: God, you know, I hope not. I hope that expires in July. It's gone on longer than it needed to go on. We need people going back to work. You can't pay people not to work and then complain about a high unemployment rate, which is what the people who support extending the benefit seem to want to do. We need that benefit needs to end. People need to get to back to work. We need to start to normalize the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, restaurants were sounding the alarm on all of these programs. Owners across the country saying that COVID-19 precautions, social distancing and putting caps on the number of customers could wipe them out, Andy. So, how serious is this concern? I mean, when you don't have the foot traffic and you know this firsthand, you know, how much of an issue is this for the bottom line? You're talking about these companies living on cash flow and they don't have any right now Andy.</p><p>PUZDER: Well, let me tell you, it depends by sector, Maria. And this is not something that's out there very broadly yet, so I'm glad I get to talk to you about it. But, the quick service, the fast food restaurant CEO's that I've talk to, my friends in the industry, are telling me that their sales are positive over last year. So, they're doing better than they were doing before the pandemic, because not only because the third party deliver service, which is up. But the drive throughs. Quick service restaurants have drive throughs. And if you go by a quick service restaurant, you'll see the drive through is packed. Now, fine dining restaurants that count on dining rooms being packed and people ordering steaks and bottles of wine, they're going to have a problem with social distancing. They're going to have a problem with it even when the economy reopens. If they can't fill their restaurants, they'll have problems. But right now the quick service industry seems to be doing pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, what about this coronavirus tax proposal in California? The state weighing a levy on some of its largest businesses to raise money for the COVID-19 relief legislation. Andy, this is billionaire's Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, consider taking their own companies elsewhere. They say we'll move out. What's your reaction?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, it's like the unemployment insurance benefits. You know, paying people not to work. At a time when we need jobs, when people need to return back to work, the unemployment rate in California's about 15 percent. They need people going back to work, so what do they do, they want to tax jobs. I mean it makes absolutely no sense. Businesses like Tesla, like Peter Thiel's company, will leave the state. Our business left California because it was unfriendly before all of this. Now there will be other companies leaving. And secondly, employees don't have to work in California anymore. If you work for one of these Silicon Valley companies and you can work remotely, you can live in Lake Tahoe on the Nevada side. You don't even have to be in California, so you can avoid state income tax and your company won't have to pay the head tax. They've tried this in Seattle.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>PUZDER: Starbucks and Amazon objected and threatened to move. It didn't work. It's a terrible idea, but it's a typical California idea. Let's kill businesses and then expect them to pay more in taxes. It doesn't make any sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah right. Any, real quick before you go. When we get out of this pandemic and this shutdown altogether, do you think the restaurant business will look a lot different given the fact that, you know, people behavior will likely change? They're going to want to social distance even more. And what's the expense of that? How much expense are these restaurants going to be taking on to retrofit and change the way their setups are?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, you're going to have to, again, with fine dining, with sit down restaurants, there's going to be a lot of change, there will be a lot of expense. There won't be as many people in the dining rooms. So, there going to have to increase prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Okay.</p><p>PUZDER: If they're going to stay open, they're going to have to increase their prices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>PUZDER: Quick service restaurants, they're doing fine. They may even do better with just drive through. They don't really need the dining rooms.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, we'll expect prices then. Andy, it's good to see you this morning as always. Thank you, sir.</p><p>PUZDER: Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy Pudzer joining us there.</p><p>PUZDER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break and then cities in crisis. San Francisco enforcing socially distancing campsites for its homeless population. It is sparking a fresh debate over the cities spiraling housing crisis. We take a closer look at the controversy. We took the show to San Francisco. We're going to show you what we found. And then American's eager to get back to work. What's at stake for small business as the nation fights to safely reopen. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well the homeless crisis in San Francisco, residents now poised to sue the city to stop officials from opening a sanctioned homeless camp in a vacant city lot. They claim it could destroy businesses and put people at risk of contracting the coronavirus. Earlier this year I was in San Francisco reporting on the homeless problem. We got on the ground. We got insight into the growing problem with Alan Byard, a private officer patrolling the streets, take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you think they got to this, officer, I mean, when you look at the number of homeless here, how did they get there?</p><p>ALAN BYARD, PRESIDENT, SAN FRANCISCO SPECIAL POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION: People lose their jobs. They get hurt. They, you know, get kicked out from their family. There's a lot of reasons behind it. They have a mental problem that they don't think that they have, but other people are telling them that they do have. You see how they completely blocked the sidewalk. And somebody with a wheelchair can't even get down the sidewalk, because the tents are in the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a shame. I mean, you grew up here. You've worked on the job 43 1/2 years. This has to be somewhat personal to you, because this is your city.</p><p>BYARD: It is. It is my city. I don't like what I see. I don't like that there's no accountability for what they do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They can't be put in jail just for being on the street.</p><p>BYARD: No. No, the Supreme Court says you can sleep on the street.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do they get the drugs? I mean, what about the drug dealers? They can't be held accountable either?</p><p>BYARD: Not in this city. The homeless know that they can come here. The criminals know that they can come here and the odds of them getting arrested are very very low.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've traveled now to Pacific Heights, San Francisco. This is a residential area. It's obviously much cleaner, and calm and quiet. Where families are living here. But it's only a mile and half away from where the heavy tents are in downtown San Francisco. And crime and homelessness. So, the worry is, is that the crime will infiltrate into this area and the tents will follow.</p><p>BYARD: This is part of my beats up here. This is a part of the city that a lot of tourists don't see. They see the homeless on TV. They hear about the stories. They don't come up here and see this. This is absolutely wonderful area. These are all working people too. You know, they leave their homes every day and go to work. Come back every night, they have families to raise. They just want to be safe. They want to have a nice place to raise their kids, just like everybody else does. You know, I see it getting worse before it gets better. City Hall has to change.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now, San Francisco politician, former Mayoral candidate, Richie Greenberg. Richie, thanks very much for being here. What do you say about the problem, which seems to be getting worse? How did this start, and how do you handle all of this homelessness on the street?</p><p>RICHIE GREENBERG, SAN FRANCISCO POLITICIAN, FORMER MAYORAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you again for having me here. It's a pleasure. It's a multifaceted problem. We've had a tradition over decades of welcoming people who are the downtrodden. And that's been ingrained in the political life for as long as I've been alive. The difference now, though, is that there seems to be a much more influential activists, homelessness outreach organization activism. And they want to keep their pockets lined. They want to keep in business. They want to make sure that their employees and their headquarters are nice. They lobby, they put ballot measure on the ballot and they do what they can under (INAUDIBLE), not the best circumstances in terms of misleading the voters to vote for ballot measure, and this is what happens, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How much of this is because of policies? How much of this is because of policies, San Francisco is a sanctuary city. The policies in many cases blow off Federal policy when it comes to immigration. Is that part of this? The policies in San Francisco are doing the people wrong frankly.</p><p>GREENBERG: Absolutely. Correct. Absolutely. And I'll give you one example. It's how the drug dealers themselves are most likely illegal aliens. They're not, they're undocumented. They shouldn't necessarily be here. They have broken laws to get here and these dealers themselves are the ones that are fueling the addicted, homeless. And because of sanctuary city policy, they, themselves, would not necessarily be arrested, turned over to ICE, and this is a big problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>GREENBERG: In fact, what we're find now is that the local politicians, City Hall, the Mayor, the Board of Supervisor, which is our City Council, they don't even mention the word drug dealers. They won't even address it. Not at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah. I mean, the Mayor, she London Breed, announced a staggered reopening of the city, beginning June 15. It includes a modified reopening of businesses and outdoor activities like fitness classes. Will the homelessness affect the reopening, because SanFran is charting its own course on how to reopen, differentiating itself from the other five bay area counties? What do you think?</p><p>GREENBERG: Yeah, you're right as well. And certain areas of this city, what's called district six, and that is the tenderloin area that's Soma south of Market, that's the most heavily hit. That's the area that has the most number of tents. The most number of mentally ill and drug addicts that in the tents on the street, blocking the streets. They block storefronts. They block residents. The block condos. A lot of residents in that area feel that they are trapped within their own home. They have families, there are kids that are afraid to actually venture out onto the street to get to parks, for example.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>GREENBERG: And this is really problematic as well. I mean, its a compounding problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>GREENBERG: That the COVID, the virus has actually exacerbated multiple times.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure. And you would expect that. You get thrown this curve ball. You've got to deal with it, but when you've already got bad policies in place, and have this homeless problem. It's going to get worse. Richie, thank you. We'll keep checking back. Richie Greenberg there. Stay with us. We've got a lot to come. We have full panel reaction to the ongoing crisis in San Francisco. What's being done to stop it. So stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well the city of San Francisco struggling to control its homeless crisis. I walked the streets to see it for myself earlier this year. Moments ago, we showed you on the ground footage. Dagen McDowell, you've lived in San Francisco. How different is what you're seeing today on these pictures from when you lived there?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: It's worse, Maria, but the problem of these homeless encampments was a problem 20 years ago when I lived in San Francisco. It's been a problem there and some other major cities for literally decades. This is what happens when government officials, local officials don't do anything about it, and they act like its okay. Many of these individuals, its not an issue of affordable housing, which seems to be a crutch that many people use, it is because they are dual diagnosis individuals. They have both mental illness and drug or alcohol addiction problems. And this issue, nationwide, goes really back to the early 60s, and the beginning of the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill in this country. They weren't in institutions. They were left out and put in outpatient treatment. But, this, done for the right reason, but it's headed in the wrong direction, where people who are at risk to themselves or others and gravely mentally ill and drug and alcohol addicted are not getting treatment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Instead, they're living on the street, and it's tragic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we should point out that California's 12th Congressional District is a Congressional District represented by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She's been representing that district since 2013 at least in San Francisco.</p><p>Still ahead my interview with President Donald Trump, Presidential Campaign Adviser Lara Trump next hour. She's going to give us some details on what she's expecting for the convention when we come right back. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the panel's top Republican. \"Some politicians want us to live in a permission-based society. ... Those are the politicians who would rather kill it before it grows.\"</p><p>Marcus told the committee that he would commit to ensuring that Facebook satisfies regulatory concerns, but stopped short of committing to stop the Libra project until Congress fully investigates its plans.</p><p>\"I agree with you that this needs to be analyzed, understood, and the proper oversight needs to be set up before Libra can launch,\" Marcus said, responding to Waters. \"And this is in this spirit that we released a white paper very early, before any launch, so that we could have the time to engage with all of the proper regulators and central banks and lawmakers to ensure that we will get this right. And this is my commitment to you, chairwoman. We will take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>When Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., went further to ask Marcus if Facebook would conduct a pilot for Libra limited to \"no more than one million users,\" Marcus said only that he would remain in contact with regulators.</p><p>\"Congresswoman, we will continue to engage with regulators and the working group at the G-7 that is notably looking after the issues that you raise to ensure that however we launch this it is responsibly and it is with the appropriate oversight and in a very responsible way,\" Marcus said.</p><p>Maloney said that if Facebook does not commit to conducting a pilot program for Libra, then \"Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters has already floatedlegislation to block big tech companies from operating as banks.</p><p>But Republicans on the committee echoed McHenry's comments, and said Congress should allow the private sector to innovate.</p><p>\"There's always a presumption that the private sector innovating is a bad thing,\" said Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky. \"I think the presumption should be totally reversed. I think we should presume that innovation is good. It presents enormous opportunity for financial inclusion, reducing friction in transactions. The opportunities that are created by this innovation is laudable. It's to be commended. That's not to say we shouldn't ask questions, but the presumption in this hearing room today seems to be in the wrong place.\"</p><p>Lawmakers' concerns on Marcus'second daytestifying on Capitol Hill ranged from the cryptocurrency's potential to be used for illicit finance to questions about how Libra should be defined by regulators.</p><p>Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., said Facebook's white paper did not properly address how Libra would comply with anti-money-laundering laws.</p><p>\"I want to call your attention to the fact that neither your white paper nor your subsequent Facebook posts offered any concrete details as to how you plan to implement or enforce strong anti-money-laundering, how you plan to enforce know-your-customer protections and, most importantly, to ensure \" the safety of our financial system,\" Scott said.</p><p>Marcus said Libra will register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which has an AML regime in place.</p><p>Other lawmakers raised questions about what type of product Libra is. While Marcus continuously said that Libra will be a \"payment tool,\" some lawmakers questioned whether it is potentially just an investment instrument.</p><p>\"This looks to me exactly like an exchange-traded fund backed by a series of short-term instruments and foreign currency, it looks exactly like an ETF,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. \"The SEC says if you have a security that is backed \" by other securities you are an exchange traded fund.\"</p><p>Marcus told Himes that Libra is backed by \"mainly currencies\" and that \"no one will buy Libra as an investment.\"</p><p>Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, further suggested Libra could be regulated as a security.</p><p>\"You intend to have it pegged to not just a bundle of currencies, but in the white paper, short-term securities,\" Davidson said. \"Well currently under U.S. law, if you're trading in securities as the underlying basis for the asset that you're selling, that's regulated as a security.

Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the panel's top Republican. \"Some politicians want us to live in a permission-based society. ... Those are the politicians who would rather kill it before it grows.\"</p><p>Marcus told the committee that he would commit to ensuring that Facebook satisfies regulatory concerns, but stopped short of committing to stop the Libra project until Congress fully investigates its plans.</p><p>\"I agree with you that this needs to be analyzed, understood, and the proper oversight needs to be set up before Libra can launch,\" Marcus said, responding to Waters. \"And this is in this spirit that we released a white paper very early, before any launch, so that we could have the time to engage with all of the proper regulators and central banks and lawmakers to ensure that we will get this right. And this is my commitment to you, chairwoman. We will take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>When Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., went further to ask Marcus if Facebook would conduct a pilot for Libra limited to \"no more than one million users,\" Marcus said only that he would remain in contact with regulators.</p><p>\"Congresswoman, we will continue to engage with regulators and the working group at the G-7 that is notably looking after the issues that you raise to ensure that however we launch this it is responsibly and it is with the appropriate oversight and in a very responsible way,\" Marcus said.</p><p>Maloney said that if Facebook does not commit to conducting a pilot program for Libra, then \"Congress should seriously consider stopping this project from moving forward.\"</p><p>Waters has already floatedlegislation to block big tech companies from operating as banks.</p><p>But Republicans on the committee echoed McHenry's comments, and said Congress should allow the private sector to innovate.</p><p>\"There's always a presumption that the private sector innovating is a bad thing,\" said Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky. \"I think the presumption should be totally reversed. I think we should presume that innovation is good. It presents enormous opportunity for financial inclusion, reducing friction in transactions. The opportunities that are created by this innovation is laudable. It's to be commended. That's not to say we shouldn't ask questions, but the presumption in this hearing room today seems to be in the wrong place.\"</p><p>Lawmakers' concerns on Marcus'second daytestifying on Capitol Hill ranged from the cryptocurrency's potential to be used for illicit finance to questions about how Libra should be defined by regulators.</p><p>Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., said Facebook's white paper did not properly address how Libra would comply with anti-money-laundering laws.</p><p>\"I want to call your attention to the fact that neither your white paper nor your subsequent Facebook posts offered any concrete details as to how you plan to implement or enforce strong anti-money-laundering, how you plan to enforce know-your-customer protections and, most importantly, to ensure \" the safety of our financial system,\" Scott said.</p><p>Marcus said Libra will register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which has an AML regime in place.</p><p>Other lawmakers raised questions about what type of product Libra is. While Marcus continuously said that Libra will be a \"payment tool,\" some lawmakers questioned whether it is potentially just an investment instrument.</p><p>\"This looks to me exactly like an exchange-traded fund backed by a series of short-term instruments and foreign currency, it looks exactly like an ETF,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. \"The SEC says if you have a security that is backed \" by other securities you are an exchange traded fund.\"</p><p>Marcus told Himes that Libra is backed by \"mainly currencies\" and that \"no one will buy Libra as an investment.\"</p><p>Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, further suggested Libra could be regulated as a security.</p><p>\"You intend to have it pegged to not just a bundle of currencies, but in the white paper, short-term securities,\" Davidson said. \"Well currently under U.S. law, if you're trading in securities as the underlying basis for the asset that you're selling, that's regulated as a security. Why would it not be considered a security?\"</p><p>Marcus again said that Facebook does not believe Libra would be a security \"because it is designed as a payment tool.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, several committee Republicans questioned whether Facebook would make Libra available to users independent of their political views - even if those views are controversial.</p><p>Rep.

The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission recently divided oversight over Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, increasing scrutiny of the tech giants and how their businesses may be harming rivals and consumers. European regulators have already taken a tough stance against the titans of Silicon Valley, investigating companies for how they handle user data, police speech, and limit competition.</p><p>The House committee plans several hearings, depositions, and interviews with competitors over the next 18 months as part of its investigation.</p><p>Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, leading the investigation, has said it would explore a diverse range of issues related to the industry. He said it would look into whether the dominant social network, Facebook, had harmed consumers with its handling of data, for example. He said it also planned to look into whether Amazon had harmed smaller retailers.</p><p>Tuesday's hearing gives publishers a platform after years of complaining about big tech's. The News Media Alliance has argued that Facebook and Google have become the biggest online advertising companies at the expense of publishers, which now rely on the platforms to find audiences.</p><p>The hearing is expected to focus in part on a bill introduced by Cicilline and Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, that would give publishers the ability to jointly negotiate with Google, Facebook, and other platforms for better terms. The law would exempt the publishers from antitrust rules for four years, protecting publishers from charges of price collusion.</p><p>Cicilline said in his opening remarks that 2,900 reporters and other news staff had lost their jobs this year and that news ad revenue had dropped to $15.6 billion in 2017 from $49 billion in 2006.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-683931d8-8c87-11e9-83c8-ce73d350c92f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB0-MVK1-DYHJ-301N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0004JOZ</classCode><className>ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>COMPUTER &amp; COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\" </p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\" </p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business. </p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously. </p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association. </p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\" </p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\" </p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said. </p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\" </p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. </p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators. </p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment \u2014 with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies. </p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices. </p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department. </p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data. </p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies. </p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC. </p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\" </p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations. </p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated. </p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\" </p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PGRAPH-192252856</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PGRAPH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB2-C181-DY7J-F058-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156859</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Pantagraph</copyright><publicationName>The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That is how Gmail was created. Google says they no longer read your emails, but they allowed third parties to do it. [...] When I'm on Facebook, I'm not the customer, I'm the product.\"</p><p>On the Future of Cryptonetworks:</p><p>\"We shouldn't be afraid of technology, but we should understand it so we can get a greater sense of how we can prepare for tomorrow to be better than today...</p><p>\"When I look at the rest of the world, and yes, we want our currency to be the strongest -- but when you look at technology and where it's going, and you think about China and these other countries and what they're trying to do, we cannot keep our heads in the sand. How can we be more secure? How can we protect our own privacy? Privacy is the real concern.</p><p>\"[Bitcoin presents] challenges, but that is why we should have hearings, that's why we should discuss this, and that's why we can solve these problems.\"</p><p>On the Upcoming Congressional Hearing on Facebook's Libra:</p><p>\"Now [Facebook] wants to get into the [financial] business, but [Libra] is not bitcoin....they're not decentralized. What I'm really looking for in this hearing is how and when will Libra actually become decentralized.</p><p>\"Companies have to pay $10 million to get into this Libra and there's only a few selected? So a small business couldn't get in? So then you're concerned about competition -- is it really an open and free market? [...] These are questions and it's right that Washington asks these questions of where we're going.</p><p>\"What Facebook is doing -- and you can't argue against them, they're trying to keep a monopoly -- they're trying to keep control. So they went to their biggest customers, and they've got a base to start with -- millions of people on the platform -- so let's control another element of what they're doing. Why?

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\"</p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he might take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-9263462</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB1-XW21-F039-F194-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And what I would say is, all you need to do is go to some of these ports around Europe and you will see the yachts there and they are all flying the flags of convenience, they are all UK flags or UK territories or Crown dependencies, there are no German, Dutch, or French flags, either we are renowned for our sailing, or is it that a lot of Germans like to fly the British flag or other nationalities because, I don't know, they sail better or something like that, but the same could be said of personal jets and where they are domiciled as well. Let me just say that tax is good. It is a contribution to a better society and we must think about what that society looks like. </p><p>If you look at the words of Elizabeth Warren, let me paraphrase, she basically said, why is it that people should simply want to avoid paying tax and afford to buy a Ferrari, because there is no point in buying a Ferrari if you don't have a road to drive it on? Get a good car, but drive on a beautiful smooth road that has been paid for out of your taxes, that is the sort of society we should look for, not people to avoid tax, living behind gated communities, owning Ferraris and having roads full of potholes. The government needs to turn up on this issue, needs to go to Davos in places like that and make the case for why international intervention and regulation needs to be introduced and I agree with the member for Amber Valley when he spoke earlier about full disclosure and we need to see that across the entire business sector, whether it be small or large businesses and consumers, when we talk about consumers being given an informed choice, I think the consumer should know that if it is cafe Nero not paying any tax at all or Costa coffee who are paying tax, then you should have the informed decision about where you want to buy the coffee from, or whatever the product or service may be. Just to close with, the issue of tech titans and I would say this to them, Amazon. You have your warehouses. Your warehouses need securing, they need protection from fire. Who will show up? Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service have had significant cuts. They need the money out of taxation to pay and provide for the Fire and Rescue Services. Facebook and other social media companies. I will indeed give way. It is estimated that five of the big tech companies paid an effective UK tax rate of just 2.9% in 2018. They avoided paying #1.3 billion in tax. Does he agree with me that the government needs to get that money back? Indeed. I was just about to say, companies like Facebook and others, their services impact on mental health. We need those services, they need to be paid for four young people. Apple and Google,... This leads to huge waste and recycling, you must pay your taxes, it is a responsibility that we deserve from you to pay for our society. Thank you very much. There have been some very thoughtful speeches on both side of the House today but I must open by commending the maiden speeches from my honourable friend the member for West Bromwich East. The idea that the government has failed to address tax avoidance and evasion is not borne out by fact. The range that the opposition is stated here, 35 billion to 90 billion, while 35 billion is the HMRC's estimate, the 90 billion though, is rather less certain and I spent some time searching for that before I came in here. The only reference I can find to that is a blog post from Professor Richard Murphy. Now, members will remember that Richard Murphy was previously hailed as the founder of Corbyn Onyx and was held up in lights by the opposition as the answer to all the economic problems that we had. That was of course before he made the mistake of criticising the Leader of the Opposition. Stating that he had no policy direction, no messaging, no direction, no coordination, no nothing, and of course, in true Corbyn is to style, he was purged and the Shadow Chancellor later</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-c9c41b7d6d4945f3bcbd9cddb81aaa04</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y92-3111-DY08-30F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Minister people largely believe that WhatsApp was safe, being encrypted and now we suddenly discover perhaps it is not after all. This is deeply worrying and has caused deep unease and society. What is the Minister doing to restore the public confidence in data protection?</p><p> I know we have various acts in place but we have got to restore that and can she give assurances that Mark Zuckerberg has fixed the flaw added being brought to task two I will answer the questions that I can answer from from my honourable friend. I cannot speak for Facebook and WhatsApp about what they are doing. But I can assure my honourable friend that the Data Protection Act that we passed last year has put in place the strongest privacy standards and rules and laws as part of GDP are across Europe, that exists anywhere in the world and we having our own information Commissioner's office, we have the best resourced across Europe and we also gave her in fat -- enhanced powers last year and her office has shown itself to be superb in utilising those powers. And this WhatsApp scandal demonstrates again that the online government harm paper is too little too late. Dealing as it does only with harms that arrive out of user generated content. We need a robust relative framework that... And on that, as the Minster said, it is essential to install and update as quickly as possible. Too many of our citizens do not still have access to broadband, fixed wireless broadband. They have been obliged to install this over mobile network, incurring charges. Who should play those -- pay those charges because you mark we have very robust legislation already in place through the introduction of GDPR. Indeed, the benches opposite usually complain we have two many regulatory bodies in this space. We have the CMA, we have Ofcom, the information Commissioner's office. And we will be setting up a fowl -- powerful regulator on the back of the White Paper. People should be taking responsibility for the security of the devices and the NCSC have very good user advice on their website. No government will find it easy to cope with the rapidly changing character of technology and the protocol is associated with it. I congratulate this Minister on both her diligence and commitment. As the former minister responsible, I was pleased to put into place the means and methods to deal with this in the strategy and security centre. However, will the Minister acknowledge now that for too long, we assume that these big tech companies could be asked, not told, requested not obliged, and you cannot be too tough with dealing with these matters, for at risk is the welfare of our citizens and our nation? I thank my honourable friend and congratulate him on the work he has done previously. I agree with him strongly in his thesis that a voluntary approach and asking companies for cooperation has not produced the change that is needed in a timely manner, which is exactly why in our white Paper published last month, we have decided that statutory regulation that obliges companies to place... Places a duty of care on companies for the users, backed up by a powerful regulator is the answer to these problems. I am sure the Right honourable gentleman will be delighted to have been congratulated on the delivery of his thesis. He is a noted academic and some would say he is even of a philosophical bent. Following the very serious WhatsApp security breach, what assurances can be Minister provide that social media companies in the UK will ensure products that they are exporting cannot be misused to track or monitor Human Rights Act of us and others who themselves might also subsequently face human rights abuses customer can be Minister also inform the House specifically whether any MP has been targeted? I cannot give him that assurance. But I can say the early indications to point to this being a highly</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-1b5d55db3bd9463d99e8ab7640e5dd5a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-XJ81-JBH6-C1C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The evidence we heard made a compelling and urgent case for a new approach to regulation.\u201cWithout intervention, the largest tech companies are likely to gain ever more control of technologies which extract personal data and make decisions affecting people\u2019s lives. Our proposals will ensure that rights are protected online as they are offline while keeping the internet open to innovation and creativity, with a new culture of ethical behaviour embedded in the design of service.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-32ABEEFFF2A74FD782BEE1A5984D9128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMF-18W1-JC0X-H325-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The evidence we heard made a compelling and urgent case for a new approach to regulation. Without intervention, the largest tech companies are likely to gain ever more control of technologies which extract personal data and make decisions affecting people's lives.\"</p><p>The Digital Authority should be guided by a charter of 10 basic principles of online regulation, the lords say. These include:</p><p> Parity: \"There should be the same level of protection online as offline.\"</p><p> Transparency: \"Powerful businesses and organisations operating in the digital world must be open to scrutiny.\"</p><p> Recognition of childhood: \"The most vulnerable users of the internet should be protected.\"</p><p>The main role of the authority would be hands-off, leaving the existing regulators, such as the ICO, Ofcom and the Advertising Standards Authority, to continue their work. Instead, its function would involve oversight of the full spectrum of regulation, recommending new legislation when there are clear gaps, mediating when there are overlaps, and reporting to parliament periodically on the state of regulation of the internet.</p><p>\"We recognise that this would give the Digital Authority significant powers,\" the report says. \"This is necessary because of the magnitude of urgent social and political problems caused by regulatory fragmentation in the digital world. These problems are likely to become more complex as technology develops.\"</p><p>The report also recommends a plethora of smaller changes to existing regulations, whether or not the Digital Authority is created. These include a new public interest test for data-driven mergers and acquisitions, to protect the public from having data bought and sold without consent, and new powers for the ICO to audit technology companies' use of algorithms in decision making.</p><p>The Lords also called for a requirement for services to default to strictest privacy and safety settings, which users can then voluntarily lower, rather than the current norm of opting users in to the settings that make most financial sense for the business itself.</p><p>\"The Information Commissioner's Office should provide guidance requiring platforms to provide greater choice to users to control how their data are collected and used,\" the Lords add.</p><p>The report has harsh words to say about major technology firms including Google, Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>\"Major platforms have failed to invest in their moderation systems, leaving moderators overstretched and inadequately trained,\" it concludes. \"Online platforms should make community standards clearer through a new classification framework akin to that of the British Board of Film Classification.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52434394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-WW21-JCJY-G2NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

They said they were troubled that the online digital advertising market, which is dominated by Google and Facebook, had siphoned off too much revenue from news organizations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cConcentration in the digital advertising market has pushed local journalism to the verge of extinction,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island.</p><p>The hearing was the start of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s inquiry into possible anticompetitive behavior by big tech companies, part of a rising wave of federal scrutiny of the industry.</p><p>The House committee plans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust.html\">several hearings, depositions and interviews with competitors over the next 18 months</url>. In addition, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the two top antitrust agencies, recently divided antitrust oversight over Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>The close reviews could lead to years of troubles for the companies, through lawsuits or new laws. European regulators have already taken a tough stance against the companies, investigating how they handle user data, police speech and limit competition.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline, who is leading the Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation, said he would explore a variety of issues. He said the committee would look into whether the dominant social network, Facebook, had harmed consumers with its handling of data, for example. He said it also planned to look into whether Amazon had hurt smaller retailers.</p><p>The House investigation will look into whether the Justice Department and F.T.C. have adequately enforced antitrust laws. Mr. Cicilline said Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of WhatsApp in 2014, for instance, now appeared anticompetitive, even though federal regulators had approved it.</p><p>\u201cI have very serious concerns about the F.T.C.\u2019s commitment to these issues,\u201d Mr. Cicilline told reporters after the hearing.</p><p>Tuesday\u2019s hearing gave publishers a microphone after years of complaining about the big tech platforms. The News Media Alliance, a trade group representing 2,000 news organizations, including The New York Times, has long argued that Facebook and Google have become the biggest online advertising companies at the expense of publishers, which now rely on the platforms to find audiences.</p><p>Leaders of the committee have pushed for passage of a bill that would give news organizations the ability to band together to negotiate greater compensation from online services that distribute their news. Lawmakers of both parties pointed out how some of their local newspapers had shut down in recent years.</p><p>\u201cSmaller news organizations don\u2019t stand a fair negotiating chance when they try to negotiate deals with the platform giants,\u201d said Representative Doug Collins, a Republican from Georgia and a co-author of the bill with Mr. Cicilline. \u201cThese giants stand as a bottleneck \u2014 a classic antitrust problem \u2014 between consumers and the producers of news content.\u201d</p><p>David Pitofsky, the general counsel of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, said that \u201cthe marketplace for news is broken.\u201d Online platforms are \u201cfree riding\u201d by selling ads tied to News Corp\u2019s content without paying to create it, he said. Those ads take money away from publishers\u2019 individual sites, Mr. Pitofsky said, because advertisers now prefer services that aggregate news.</p><p>News Corp supports Mr. Cicilline and Mr. Collins\u2019s Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. The law would exempt the publishers from antitrust rules for four years, protecting them from charges of price collusion.</p><p>\u201cWe are not losing business to an innovator who has found a better or more efficient way,\u201d Mr. Pitofsky said.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline said that 2,900 reporters and other news staff had lost their jobs this year, and that news ad revenue had dropped to $15.6 billion in 2017 from $49 billion in 2006.</p><p>Matt Schruers, a vice president at the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said at the hearing that his tech industry trade group accepted additional scrutiny because of the size of the companies being reviewed by Congress. And he said the industry wanted to encourage good journalism.</p><p>But Mr. Schruers said giving antitrust exemptions to publishers was risky and could ultimately harm consumers and the economy.</p><p>Google, in a statement, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry as it works to adapt to the new economics of the internet.\u201d</p><p>Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Lawmakers also heard from David Chavern, the chief executive of the News Media Alliance. He encouraged lawmakers to support the proposed antitrust exemption for publishers.</p><p>And Kevin Riley, the editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, testified that if the news industry continued on its current trajectory, many important local stories would not be adequately covered.</p><p>\u201cSocial media and technology companies have enormous influence on the distribution and availability of news,\u201d Mr. Riley said in his prepared remarks. \u201cBut we should be worried about losing newspapers, the fountainheads within the local news ecosystem.\u201d</p><p>Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @ceciliakang. </p><p>PHOTO: David Pitofsky, the general counsel for News Corp, left, and Kevin Riley, editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, were among the news media executives who testified at the hearing.

The worry is companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are more focused on growth than oversight and user support functions, said Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va. Platforms disclaim responsibility for user content and have a disincentive to purge fake and bot accounts, she said. Wexton cited a July 2018 report on how Twitter's stock dropped 8.5 percent after it purged 70 million suspicious accounts over two months. Twitter shares increased about 20 percent between January and December 2018.</p><p>The bad news is some have been \"slow to respond\" for decades, from child sex abuse to terrorism to illegal item sales, testified University of California-Berkeley electrical engineering professor Hany Farid. Companies fought against change because their business models rely on data, which is reduced when content is removed, he said. House Science Committee ranking member Frank Lucas, R-Okla., asked how Congress can get companies \"to the table.\" Regulatory pressure is the key because self-regulation doesn't work, Farid said, suggesting looking to partners in the UK, EU, Canada, Australia and abroad.</p><p>Online hoaxes spread six times as fast as true stories, said subcommittee Chair Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. Users are more likely to believe sensational stories if the content supports their political narrative, she added. She called the hearing a start to understanding how fraudsters are behaving and how to respond.</p><p>Deepfake technology is getting more sophisticated and easier to use, said Lucas. Soon, anyone with a decent computer and access to basic software will be able to spread false and misleading content, which is disruptive for society, he said. He noted the committee passed bipartisan legislation Wednesday to improve technology for detecting deepfakes. HR-4355, the Identifying Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks Act from Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio, has the support of Reps. Jim Baird, R-Ind.; Haley Stevens, D-Mich.; and Katie Hill, D-Calif.</p><p>Panel members cited threats from Russia and China. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said they can \"wreak havoc\" with deep fake technology. The U.S. risks falling behind on the detection front, said Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla. A potentially large problem is people pointing to real content as fake, said Farid. Once fake material is disseminated, it's very hard to know what's real, said Farid.</p><p>Since October, Twitter has published information on 25,084 potentially fake accounts associated with information operations in 10 different countries, testified Graphika Chief Innovation Officer Camille Francois. In the past two years, Facebook has taken down \"12,085 accounts, pages, groups and Instagram accounts for engaging in what it calls 'coordinated inauthentic behavior,'\" she said. About 40 million accounts followed one or more of the accounts in question.</p><p>The U.S. should establish a program at the National Science Foundation dedicated to similar emerging technology, said University at Albany, State University of New York computer science professor Siwei Lyu. He said investigators should be trained and educated on deepfake technology. Farid urged education of students and the next generation of internet users.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5R-MRJ1-JC8G-9015-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The worry is companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are more focused on growth than oversight and user support functions, said Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va. Platforms disclaim responsibility for user content and have a disincentive to purge fake and bot accounts, she said. Wexton cited a July 2018 report on how Twitter's stock dropped 8.5 percent after it purged 70 million suspicious accounts over two months. Twitter shares increased about 20 percent between January and December 2018.</p><p>The bad news is some have been \"slow to respond\" for decades, from child sex abuse to terrorism to illegal item sales, testified University of California-Berkeley electrical engineering professor Hany Farid. Companies fought against change because their business models rely on data, which is reduced when content is removed, he said. House Science Committee ranking member Frank Lucas, R-Okla., asked how Congress can get companies \"to the table.\" Regulatory pressure is the key because self-regulation doesn't work, Farid said, suggesting looking to partners in the UK, EU, Canada, Australia and abroad.</p><p>Online hoaxes spread six times as fast as true stories, said subcommittee Chair Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. Users are more likely to believe sensational stories if the content supports their political narrative, she added. She called the hearing a start to understanding how fraudsters are behaving and how to respond.</p><p>Deepfake technology is getting more sophisticated and easier to use, said Lucas. Soon, anyone with a decent computer and access to basic software will be able to spread false and misleading content, which is disruptive for society, he said. He noted the committee passed bipartisan legislation Wednesday to improve technology for detecting deepfakes. HR-4355, the Identifying Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks Act from Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio, has the support of Reps. Jim Baird, R-Ind.; Haley Stevens, D-Mich.; and Katie Hill, D-Calif.</p><p>Panel members cited threats from Russia and China. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said they can \"wreak havoc\" with deep fake technology. The U.S. risks falling behind on the detection front, said Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla. A potentially large problem is people pointing to real content as fake, said Farid. Once fake material is disseminated, it's very hard to know what's real, said Farid.</p><p>Since October, Twitter has published information on 25,084 potentially fake accounts associated with information operations in 10 different countries, testified Graphika Chief Innovation Officer Camille Francois. In the past two years, Facebook has taken down \"12,085 accounts, pages, groups and Instagram accounts for engaging in what it calls 'coordinated inauthentic behavior,'\" she said. About 40 million accounts followed one or more of the accounts in question.</p><p>The U.S. should establish a program at the National Science Foundation dedicated to similar emerging technology, said University at Albany, State University of New York computer science professor Siwei Lyu. He said investigators should be trained and educated on deepfake technology. Farid urged education of students and the next generation of internet users.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5R-MRJ1-JC8G-8008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4134111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB5-D881-JCDM-J10B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Woodward Communications, Inc.

True to their word, four years later, Google is deliberately working to interfere with the reelection of Trump in 2020. There are several ways in which Google is interfering in the 2020 election, but this article will focus primarily on one of them: political search bias.

The chief executives of four of the most prominent technology firms in the world \u2014 Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook \u2014 were prepared for questions about their business practices and market dominance. Though their companies represent new-age innovations, including search engines, smartphones and social media, the criticisms they face bring to mind those lodged by \"trustbusters\" against late 19th-century industrial barons.   Since last June, the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust issues has been investigating \"the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\" as a joint statement from committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., put it. The panel is one of several fronts on which the tech industry is battling against the prospect of government regulations.      As the hearing was about to get underway, President Donald Trump expressed some conservatives' separate complaint that the large social media firms are biased against them in censoring users on the political right, which the companies deny. He told reporters as he left for a fundraising trip to Texas, \"We're going to be watching the hearings today very closely, because there is no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad.\" Once on Air Force One, he repeated his displeasure in a tweet.   Critics of the technology giants also welcomed the scrutiny in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. The hearing \"comes on the heels of a yearlong investigation that is looking deeply into the market power and the business models and the conduct of these four corporations,\" said Sarah Miller, co-chair of the advocacy group Freedom From Facebook &amp; Google. \"And that is something that has not really been done in decades.\"   The subcommittee members could go beyond the topic of antitrust regulation and digital monopolies. The four companies are implicated in a host of other issues \u2014 including labor practices, domestic surveillance and online censorship \u2014 some of which have become increasingly contentious in an election year that has had both parties taking shots at Big Tech.   When Zuckerberg testified before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees in 2018, for instance, the discussion touched not only on data privacy \u2014 the focus of the hearing \u2014 but also on disinformation, political bias and even the basics of Facebook's business model.   The scope of the House hearing could easily expand because the four CEOs lead radically different companies. With all four being questioned at once \u2014 and remotely given the pandemic \u2014 some have worried that the committee members won't be able to question the witnesses as aggressively or in as much depth as they otherwise might.   \"The weirdness of the hearing is that we'll have all these four CEOs together,\" Fordham Law School associate professor Zephyr Teachout said on the press call. \"I think of the great 1950s hearings into the mob ... having the heads of four families all lined up together on a livestream, all answering questions at the same time.\"   All four companies face complaints of monopolistic behavior, though the practices in dispute vary greatly.   Facebook is criticized for its acquisitions of other social media and messaging firms, expanding laterally with strategic purchases of platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Giphy. It's also drawn fire for practices viewed as unfairly targeting competing platforms, such as copying core features of photo-messaging app Snapchat or preventing users of a short-lived video app, Vine, from using Facebook data to find their friends.   Zuckerberg defended the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions in his prepared statement in advance of the hearing, and cited Facebook's improvements to each platform's infrastructure and features. \"Our acquisitions have helped drive innovation for people who use our own products and services and for the broader start-up community,\" he said in his statement.      He also reiterated his past calls for more active government regulation of the tech sector while arguing that Facebook's size has benefits in addressing issues \"from election security to building more privacy-protective products.\"   Google and Amazon are under scrutiny for their roles in specific online marketplaces \u2014 Google with its various digital advertising services and Amazon with its massive shopping platform, where it also sells its own goods in competition with third-party retailers.   Amazon's Bezos, in his prepared statement, recalled at length Amazon's humble origins \u2014 and his own \u2014 as a preface to justifying the mammoth company that it has become. \"I love garage entrepreneurs \u2014 I was one,\" he said in the statement. \"But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do. I don't care how good an entrepreneur you are, you're not going to build an all-fiber Boeing 787 in your garage.\"   Pichai, meanwhile, used his own statement to tell a series of anecdotes about small businesses that have benefitted from Google's advertising technology and argued that Google faces stiff competition within the online ad and information-search industries.   The swipes at Apple are more narrow, concerning the company's dual role in both selling hardware such as iPhones and operating the marketplace for software for the devices. In May 2019, the Supreme Court cleared the way for lawsuits against Apple for compelling its users to buy apps through its App Store, and taking a 30% commission in the process.   Cook defended the App Store in his statement, emphasizing that the platform improved on earlier software-distribution systems like shipping CDs or physical stores. \"After beginning with 500 apps, today the App Store hosts more than 1.7 million \u2014 only 60 of which are Apple software,\" Cook's statement said. \"Clearly, if Apple is a gatekeeper, what we have done is open the gate wider.\"   Notably absent from the proceedings is Microsoft. The company and CEO Satya Nadella have escaped some of the \"techlash\" of recent years. However, the messaging platform Slack recently filed an antitrust complaint in Europe over Microsoft's competing platform Teams, and hasn't ruled out pursuing action in the United States.   Europe has aggressively regulated tech platforms. The European Union launched antitrust investigations into Apple's Apple Pay platform and App Store in June, has also targeted Amazon and Facebook, and hit Google with a $2.6 billion antitrust fine.   \"U.S. antitrust authorities need to consider whether these or other digital service companies are protected by barriers constructed by anti-competitive behavior, and take appropriate remedial action where required,\" wrote Marc Jarsulic, chief economist at the liberal Center for American Progress.   As concern has grown among Democrats and Republicans about the power and scale of the tech giants, the House Judiciary Committee has not been the only governmental body hinting at aggressive regulations of the industries.   Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission issued orders to all four companies as well as Microsoft for information on their acquisitions of start-ups between 2010 and 2019, suggesting concern that the tech giants bought up potential competitors early to keep the playing field clear.   Last summer the Department of Justice began another antitrust investigation, citing widespread concerns about reduced competition and innovation in the online \"search, social media, and some retail services\" sectors. And state attorneys general across the country also have opened joint investigations into potentially monopolistic behavior at Google and Facebook specifically.      #inform-video-player-3 .inform-embed { margin-top: 10px;

Though their companies represent newage innovations, including search engines, smartphones and social media, the criticisms they face bring to mind those lodged by \"trustbusters\" against late 19th-century industrial barons.</p><p> Since last June, the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust issues has been investigating \"the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\" as a joint statement from committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, DR.</p><p> I., put it. The panel is one of several fronts on which the tech industry is battling against the prospect of government regulations.</p><p> As the hearing was about to get underway, President Donald Trump expressed some conservatives' separate complaint that the large social media firms are biased against them in censoring users on the political right, which the companies deny. He told reporters as he left for a fundraising trip to Texas, \"We're going to be watching the hearings today very closely, because there is no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad.\" Once on Air Force One, he repeated his displeasure in a tweet.</p><p> Critics of the technology giants also welcomed the scrutiny in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. The hearing \"comes on the heels of a yearlong investigation that is looking deeply into the market power and the business models and the conduct of these four corporations,\" said Sarah Miller, co-chair of the advocacy group Freedom From Facebook &amp; Google. \"And that is something that has not really been done in decades.\" The subcommittee members could go beyond the topic of antitrust regulation and digital monopolies. The four companies are implicated in a host of other issues - including labor practices, domestic surveillance and online censorship - some of which have become increasingly contentious in an election year that has had both parties taking shots at Big Tech.</p><p> When Zuckerberg testified before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees in 2018, for instance, the discussion touched not only on data privacy - the focus of the hearing - but also on disinformation, political bias and even the basics of Facebook's business model.</p><p> The scope of the House hearing could easily expand because the four CEOs lead radically different companies.</p><p> With all four being questioned at once - and remotely given the pandemic - some have worried that the committee members won't be able to question the witnesses as aggressively or in as much depth as they otherwise might.</p><p> All four companies face complaints of monopolistic behavior, though the practices in dispute vary greatly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS \u25aaFrom left.

The hearing followed a discussion at CES about whether the government should break up dominant platforms (see 2001100007). The hearing was streamed from the University of Colorado Law School.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Companies across the online ecosystem, both large and small, have found themselves dependent on the arbitrary whim of these platform giants, one algorithm tweak away from ruin,\" said Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I. \"It has become clear that these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online.\"</p><p>\"We have seen the largest platforms continue to expand and increase their market power,\" raising concerns \"about how that power is being used,\" said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.Congress shouldn't forget benefits innovation has brought for consumers and that big isn't always bad, he said. \"Any legislative proposals ... should be consistent with maintaining a free and competitive marketplace. Proposals to create broad new regulatory regimes must be viewed with caution. ... Burdensome regulations often miss the mark.\"</p><p>\"The market conditions that allowed us to innovate and thrive over the past two decades are being endangered by the rise of a small group of dominant companies with unprecedented power,\" said Patrick Spence, CEO of smart speaker company Sonos. \"We believe that this committee needs to act urgently to rein in the power of these dominant companies.\" The company is suing Google (see 2001070041).</p><p>Big players so dominate the market, \"they have become essential business partners for every company,\" Spence said. Getting access to their platforms is becoming \"more and more of a take it or leave it proposition.\" The companies have even asked Sonos to suppress its inventions, he said. \"The most recent example of this is Google's refusal to allow us to use multiple voice assistants on our products simultaneously,\" he said: \"We need to rethink existing laws and policies.\"</p><p>PopSockets had enormous success initially when it sold on Amazon, said David Barnett, CEO of the company, which makes removable grips for smartphones. Then, counterfeits became an issue and \"we discovered that Amazon itself had sourced counterfeit product and was selling it alongside our own products,\" he said. \"At one point, we were recording a thousand listings a day of fakes.\"</p><p>Amazon bullied PopSockets, Barnett said. Amazon sets the price and \"they come back to us and demand funding for their lost margin when they lower their price.\" Barnett said at that point, the \"bullying begins.\" PopSockets decided to end the relationship. Amazon's response \"was, 'No, you're not leaving the relationship,'\" he said: \"I found that unbelievable ... after we told them that bullying was the main reason we were leaving.\" The company left anyway and Amazon removed listings of its PopSockets' resellers, he said. Other companies continue to do business with Amazon, he said: \"It's because of the power asymmetry that companies tolerate this, they have to tolerate it.\"</p><p>\"PopSockets has been a valued retail vendor at Amazon and also supplies its products directly to other major retailers,\" an Amazon spokesperson emailed. Like any brand, the company is \"free to choose which retailers it supplies and chose to stop selling directly through Amazon. Even so, we've continued to work with PopSockets to address our shared concerns about counterfeit, and continue to have a relationship with PopSockets through Merch by Amazon, which enables other sellers to create customized PopSockets for sale.\"</p><p>David Hansson, chief technology officer of software company Basecamp, said that when company launched in 2004, the internet offered a largely free and open market. That's \"no longer true,\" he said: \"The internet has been colonized by a handful of big tech companies that wield their monopoly power without restraint. This power allows them to bully, extort, or, should they please, even destroy our business.\" Big platforms control whether \"customers are able to find us online\" and \"can access our software using their mobile devices,\" Hansson said. \"The promise that the internet was going to cut out the middleman has been broken.\"</p><p>Google has an almost complete monopoly over internet searches, Hansson said. \"Their multibillion dollar bribes to browser makers like Apple ensure no fair competition will ever have a chance to emerge.\" With its app store, Apple owns \"one of the only two mobile application stores that matter\" and the other belongs to Google, he said: This \"cozy duopoly\" means Apple can charge \"exorbitantly high\" 30 percent fees for processing payments. \"Help us, Congress, you are our only hope,\" Hansson said.</p><p>\"We created the App Store with two goals in mind: that it be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers,\" an Apple spokesperson emailed. \"We continually work with developers and take their feedback on how to help protect user privacy while also providing the tools developers need to make the best app experiences.\" Google didn't comment.</p><p>Cicilline has heard too many \"horror\" stories from small companies that an abrupt change from one of the platforms has destroyed their business. \"It is apparent that the dominant platforms are increasingly using their gatekeeper power in abusive and coercive ways,\" he said: \"Because these platforms function as bottlenecks for online commerce, they are able to set the terms and conditions of competition, giving them immense power to pick winners and losers in the online economy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y24-DND1-JC8G-90MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
