We are on the down side, and then that's  a big time, 29 of 30 Dow stocks are in the red. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It could be more of the trade fears, China does cheat  in trade and we need a bear relationship with that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  I'm cautiously optimistic  about the meetings. I don't really want to predict what's going to happen  or what's not going to happen. We're going to go over there and we are  going to have a very frank discussion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are issues that President Trump has been focused on for over the last  year, and hopefully we'll make significant progress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FBN HOST:  A massive 180, the Dow closing slightly higher,  erasing earlier losses of nearly 400 points. With technology and industrial  stocks leading the turn around, the market watching the U.S.-China trade  talks closely, which are now underway. </p><p>Our U.S. trade delegation arriving in Beijing led by Treasury Secretary  Steve Mnuchin. </p><p>Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm John Layfield. I'm in for Liz  MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts now. </p><p>The Dow ending five points higher to 23,930. The day's volatile swings  reflecting uncertainty over the trade meetings between the U.S. and China  that begins today in Beijing.</p><p>With me now is Nicole Petallides live from the floor of New York Stock  Exchange. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, John. So what you saw was the  market that was down about 400 points, turned and finished in the green. We  can see it right there with that chart that moved into green late in the  day. We could thank some of those industrials like Boeing and 3M. </p><p>So there is the look. The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ tough weren't able to squeeze  out those gains but not too far off that unchanged line. Here are winners  and losers as I noted, Boeing was a big mover and that's heavily weighted  in the Dow, up 2 percent. Nike and G.E. coming under pressure. </p><p>Apple, you know, Apple had a great week up about nine percent announcing  that share buyback after their quarterly numbers. Take a look up. It's up  100 -- it's at 176.89. But again, up about 9 percent this week.</p><p>Tesla on the other hand, the analysts are saying they've never heard a call  like this one, in fact that Elon Musk saying that he was bored, that they  were killing him with the questions, they call it bizarre and unorthodox as  he interrupted analysts who were asking about profits for the company. The  stock finished down 5.5 percent. </p><p>Twitter right at the closing bell we heard from Twitter that in fact, they  had a glitch that your passwords may have been unmasked and they are urging  everybody to change your password. Stocks finished down 1 percent. </p><p>And CBS just was on the conference call since 4.30 for the last half hour  at least is the conference call the stock did beat the street for the  company. But we were listening for anything else. Viacom, they said they  will not be speaking about Viacom, anything Charlie Rose they have not  acknowledged it, the conference call is still going on, but it was a great  quarter for CBS. Back to you.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Elon Musk conference call was a must-listen, it was wild. </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Wild.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  We're going to have more on that later. Nicole, thank you very  much. </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Thank you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  President Trump praising his relationship with Chinese President  Xi Jinping as the U.S. team arrives for two days in trade talks.</p><p>With me now is Connell McShane in Beijing, China with the latest. Connell? </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, there, John. Mnuchin is getting  set for the second and the final day of his talks with counterparts from  China, and he's brought along a large contingent from United States, a team  of rivals some are calling it. </p><p>In addition to the treasury secretary, and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross  here, the trade rep, Robert Lighthizer, Ambassador Brandstad, economic  advisor Larry Kudlow, and Peter Navarro all are on hand. That group already  holding talks at a place called the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, which is  used often as a meeting place for foreign dignitaries.</p><p>Now, it's not clear how much can really be accomplished. Just over the  course of a couple of days, there is some concern building though, that the  tensions over trade dragged on and nothing has accomplished. A growing  anti-American sentiment will build up here in China that could cause real  problems for American companies. </p><p>There are stories swirling about China cutting back on buying U.S. soybeans  so that would kind be an example of that. We found out about it ourselves  on a visit we took to a local food market here in Beijing, we found out  about worries building about supply disruptions. </p><p>With the help of our translator, I spoke to one of the merchants there  about fish that she was selling here that was brought in from the Boston  area. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Is she worried at all that the supply might go down as that  conflict continues? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'll ask her? </p><p>(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She said, yes, I really have this kind of concern,  and maybe two weeks ago, there were some, yes, there was a period, a short  period that kind of lacked a little bit of the supply. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  So similar comments that you heard there, to what we see many  times from farmers and others back in United States. So with these talks we  have day one in book, as we get set for day two, we're hoping to get some  sort of an update from Secretary Mnuchin or somebody else in the U.S.  delegation before they all fly black on Friday evening.</p><p>With that, from here in Beijing, John, back to you in New York. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, thank you, Connell. It's 5 o'clock in the morning in  Beijing right now, so please go to bed. Great work. Thank you.</p><p>Sign of progress, Switzerland UBS is now testing China's promise to allow  foreign owned banks saying today it's seeking control of its joint venture  in China, but upping its stake in the business to 51 percent. It would be  the first financial firm to take advantage of Beijing's decision to relax  investment rules on foreign banks. </p><p>UBS stock ending the day in the green to a little more than $16 a share. </p><p>Joining me now is former deputy assistance to George W. Bush, Brad  Blakeman. Brad, this seems like a step in the right direction. You were  with the Bush administration who last tried steel tariffs. They ended up  most those administration officials admitted that it was a mistake. </p><p>We first started to go after China. We started to go after them with steel  tariffs. Once again, we import about 2.2 percent of steel from China.  That's not the real issue. The real issue is theft of intellectual property  and there's one belt -- one road in this trip where they're loading up  these countries around the world with too much debt that they can handle,  and a need for China to expand their global dominance right now. How do you  deal with the real issues specifically the theft of intellectual property? </p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT:  We got  to hold China's feet to the fire, they know what they are doing, they are a  country of makers, takers and fakers. And it's unacceptable. If they want  to be a first world country, they have to stop acting like a third world  country.</p><p>The president is only asking for them to respect our ownership of things  that we own and not to take it, not to fake it and not to make it. So I  think carrots and sticks are makes trade effective. Right now we're using  sticks. And by sending our big guns over there it's not to start a war,  it's to prevent one from happening. </p><p>When America is at our best, when we stand on principle, when we stood on  principle with China we have an effect with North Korea. We have to do the  same thing for things that are absolutely in our interest to protect jobs  here at home. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Brad, what can really be done? You know, President Xi over  there, you know, he's a forever chairman right now, be he is still is  having a hard time with this made in China 2025. He's got a terrible  problem with a coastal economy, the bifurcation of the rich and the poor  over there. They have 260 percent right now debt to GDP that they just  reported. </p><p>He's in a bind himself, with this own Chinese media saying don't give in  to, quote, \"the bullying tactics of President Trump.\" It seems like he  can't back down. It seems like the Trump guys can't back down. It seems  like what we're getting out of this is probably just window dressing like  we got with some of the tariffs on the South Korean deal that really didn't  meter that much. The quotas did, the tariffs didn't. Do you expect  something substantive? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  To come out of this China meeting.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  I do, but I don't think it's going to come right away. This is - - this is a breaking of the ice. We've sent the best and brightest there,  they know that they speak to the president, President Xi knows that, and  this is going to be a long process, but China has got to change their  behavior. </p><p>We're not going to be extorted anymore and we're not going to be taken  advantage of. It's not in China's interest, it's not in the United States'  interest to have a trade war, and we've got to use every tool in the tool  box to make the Chinese understand that it's going to be business as usual. </p><p>A deal is only as good as it is for both parties if one party thinks they  are getting a raw deal then it's going to be honored in the breach. Stand  on principle, China will find an accommodation, we'll compromise, and we'll  be much better off dealing with China out of strength than out of weakness. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  How can we deal with the amount of strength, what is the main  thing we can do that to deal with theft of intellectual property in what  China is trying to do in the global scenario right now. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  We can punish China directly. We can punish the companies in the  private sector of China. There is a lot that we can do, and we can also use  the clout of our business sector. Apple would love us to start sticking up  for their intellectual property. </p><p>There are other companies that do business with China who have been the  victims of theft. So, yes, we've got to stick with the American companies.  We've got to stand up for them. We've got to protect our property. And we  got to punish China when they act in our -- when they act -- I would say as  criminals, in stealing property that doesn't belong to them. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  China is reportedly ordering a recording ban on the Mnuchin led  trade talks. Isn't this part of the problem?</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I mean, they control the media. It's a dictatorship effectively,  President Xi is there forever. They control this and they have not been  honest with their dealings, same as North Korea. How do you know that we  can get a deal, and they will adhere to this deal? </p><p>Because when you have Chinese companies right now that are listed, they  have listed assets that don't exist. And there is no recourse for investors  that have invested in these Chinese companies, they are able to lie and  have no follow-up. How do you handle that? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, first of all, with regard to their own media, it doesn't  matter what they control their media inside their country, what matters is  what the rest of the world does, that's where the leverage comes in. The  United States should not go alone with their tax on China. There are  thousands of companies that are outside our borders in friendly nations to  us, and allies who should join us in putting the screws to China. </p><p>And guess what? China will back down. They don't want their people to know  what they are doing, that's fine. As long as we know what they are doing,  and we can verify the concessions that they'll make. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Brad, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. That's  going to be very interesting on the next couple of days--</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- on what the Trump administration can get done with the  Chinese officials. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Pleasure. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 million users  a glitch has now exposed. Substantial number of user's password. It's  stocks is now down slightly afterhours. Coming up, we have the details and  the developing story. </p><p>A new report accusing Disney on CBS of knowing about former anchor Charlie  Rose's sexual harassment and doing nothing about them. Coming up, we have  the details.</p><p>Plus, the embattled media company just reporting after the bell. We're  monitoring the CEO's earnings conference call for any response. </p><p>But first, NBC reporting federal investigators wire tapped the phone of  President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen, and at least one of his  phone calls was with White House was intercepted. </p><p>My next guest is an attorney who says that's not legal. Harmeet Dhillon  joins me next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And now this, NBC reporting federal investigators wiretapped the  phone of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen. And at  least one of his calls with the White House was intercepted. </p><p>According to report, the wiretap was in place leading up to the raids on  Cohen's home and offices last month. And it's unknown if President Trump  was heard in the wiretaps, this according to two anonymous sources. </p><p>Giuliani telling now the Daily Beast he doesn't think Michael Cohen was  wiretapped because it would be highly. </p><p>With me now is attorney Harmeet Dhillon. Harmeet, this appears to me to be  one of the biggest messes I've seen in recent political history. You've got  Mr. Cohen who says that he was not paid back. He stands by that. </p><p>Now you have Mayor Giuliani come out last night and say he was. You have  President Trump saying that he did pay him. President -- or Mayor Giuliani  comes out and says that he did but President Trump didn't know about it and  didn't know about what it was for. </p><p>You also have Mayor Giuliani coming out saying that this wiretap was  illegal because of the attorney-client privilege and also if you are  wiretapping and the president is on the call, you have to notify the White  House.</p><p>Was this illegal if this wiretap did in fact exist? </p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY:  Well, I think it's too early to say whether or  not it is illegal, at least for me, I don't know all the details. But what  we do have is this coming in the setting of evidence that that same people  involved in this DOJ investigation have sought warrants to wiretap people  through the FISA court that were not truthful with the court about all the  circumstances. </p><p>And it's, you know, really the same sort of group of high level FBI and DOJ  individuals who have been involved in getting this particular set of search  warrants. </p><p>And we've already known, for example, that Michael Cohen's e-mails have  been intercepted, so it's not surprising that there is a wiretap order as  well. The real question is, what was the court told in order to get the  subpoena in order to get that wiretap, in order to get that warrant,  rather. And we don't know that.</p><p>But it is true that courts generally require the prosecutors to take great  care and not to intercept attorney-client communication unless there is  already evidence of an attorney-client exception relating to a crime, and  that has not been allege yet in this case.</p><p>So if it is true that the president or somebody close to the president on  his behalf communications with his lawyer had been intercepted that is a  very serious matter. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  NBC News this breaking news has just released a report that  they, in fact, did not listen to the calls. I'm not sure if they said  whether the wiretap was still in existence or not but NBC at least saying  they did not listen to those calls. That's the newest report.</p><p>And it's just a new web that's being built right now. This whole thing is  just crazy to me. Now it seems to me with plausible deniability that the  Trump administration whether true or not has to at least say that they paid  back Mr. Cohen because if not that looks like a campaign finance violation  which is a violation of the federal law. Is that correct? </p><p>DHILLON:  Well, I think Rudy Giuliani already has addressed this issue. And  you know, some people have said maybe he went on Hannity show last night,  and had a slip of the tongue. No, I think Rudy Giuliani knows exactly what  he is doing and that was thought out carefully. You know, obviously when  you are making a payment like this to settle a disputed claim, which I do  as a lawyer on behalf of my clients all the time, you know, you don't want  to be talking about it publicly. And so, that's one point.</p><p>And so now they have to do it because of all of the storm of controversy  around it. But number two, it's entirely plausible that somebody of the net  worth of the president would not know the details of settlements like this.  And I'm sure isn't necessarily the only settlement. He's been affiliated  with Michael Cohen for many years. </p><p>And so, you know, surrounding here for somebody who is very wealthy this  amount of money I know it may seem like a lot to most Americans, but in the  grand scheme of things, people who are this wealthy routinely are shaken  down, routinely are approached with these types of threats and routinely  make the calculation that regardless of the merits of these types of claims  it is better economically and better for their peace of mind and their  family's sake to resolve them privately.</p><p>So, we know that Stormy Daniels is not a person who can be trusted because  she breached that agreement so that has to be put in the context of the  rest of the people--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes. But who can be trusted between Michael Cohen and Rudy  Giuliani, because one of them is lying. Look, I can understand the argument  that President Trump if he did in fact spend $100 million on his campaign  didn't know about a $130,000 payment.</p><p>But if you are lawyer, and you said that you made, and I have no reason to  doubt that, payment on behalf of your client. If you're making a payment of  $130,000 on behalf of your client it may not mean something to a person  with a $100 million who does this regularly when people try to sue him for  crazy things, much less some more egregious things like this. </p><p>But if the porn star that involves the president of United States you know  for a fact whether you did this or not and Michael Cohen has denied it. So  somebody is lying here, it's either Michael Cohen or Rudy Giuliani. I mean,  if you are lawyer here, wouldn't you know you made this payment? </p><p>DHILLON:  No, so first of all, I would reject the characterization that  somebody must be lying, I would probably if I were taken depositions I  would ask quite a follow-up questions. </p><p>And so the way that Rudy Giuliani described this was that there were  payments made in the form of retainers of some amount every month, I think  he said $35,000. So that's different than a check for $130,000 being  written to Michael Cohen to reimburse him but that is inconsistent with  reimbursements having been made. So, again--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I'm talking -- I'm talking about -- wait a minute--</p><p>DHILLON:  -- we're talking with lawyers here.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I'm talking about -- I don't mean to interrupt you, I apologize.  I'm talking about Michael Cohen's payment to Stormy Daniels, that was the  one that Michael Cohen says, he was not reimbursed for, wouldn't Michael  Cohen know this? </p><p>Now the president may not because he is a very wealthy man and there's a  lot of these things with very wealthy people. But wouldn't Michael Cohen  know for sure? Because Michael Cohen says he was not reimbursed, Mayor  Giuliani said he was. There's a problem there. </p><p>DHILLON:  Well, I just addressed that, so I think that, you know, there is  a difference between getting $130,000 check, that is a direct, you know,  exact account and retainer payments, which is how Giuliani describe it. </p><p>So, you know, again, you are dealing with lawyers here, and I'm sure the  language was thought about very carefully before each of these two  gentlemen got into the details. </p><p>And you know, it is always awkward when you are a lawyer being asked to  describe the details of your interaction with your client. Lawyers tried to  be very circumspect about that. And so, you know, I mean, any lawyer would  be put in a very difficult position to answer those questions. </p><p>So, without some further follow up on, I don't think anyone can conclude  that there was a lie told here on by either of them.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I understand, but again, I wasn't talking about the retainer to  Michael Cohen. There was not a retainer paid to a porn star. I can pretty  much guarantee you that. </p><p>I do want to follow up a little bit on the NBC story. The NBC story was  that, now they are walking back claims that they indeed listened to these  phone calls. But to go forward now, you have special counsel Robert Mueller  filing a request for 70 subpoenas in the eastern District of Virginia in  the case of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.</p><p>Where does this go from here? This seems like a never ending investigation.  And one of the reasons it seems never ending is because Mr. Mueller is just  not letting go out, like a good investigator would do, but we don't know if  it's an actual witch-hunt or if there is something here. What do you think  this means this 70 subpoenas? </p><p>DHILLON:  Well, first with the 70 subpoenas, we don't know what it means  because the story just broke a few minutes ago. I've seen the cover page of  the request by the special prosecutor. But generally speaking you have to  get a court to issue a subpoena for a trial appearance. </p><p>And the date indicated is that the prosecutor wants people individuals to  come to court in a date in July to testify at a trial. It also says there  is a reference in the news reports about 35 sets of subpoenas, so it could  be that there is a request for two separate hearing dates, it's not clear  from the papers that have been published so far.</p><p>And with respect to so-called they are walking back the wiretapping claims  who are they? You know, we don't know who they are? We don't know where  these leaks are coming from? And we don't know why the people are saying  that they didn't do what they weren't supposed to do because they've been  caught out in doing it. </p><p>But you know, I would need a lot more information and so should your  viewers before you reach any conclusion about whether the calls were simply  monitored as to a call occurred versus the contents of the call being  listened to and who was on the other side of that call at the White House.  I think these are all questions that we don't know as yet. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right. And that's the problem with this entire mess,  there's so many reports there's so many allegations that you don't know  what is fact, especially because Mr. Mueller himself is not letting any  information out until he wants to.</p><p>Harmeet, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate you coming on  tonight. Coming up-</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DHILLON:  My pleasure. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- North Korea may release its three U.S. hostages at any  moment, President Trump hinting at it this moment. </p><p>My next guest has signed a letter formally nominating Donald Trump for the  Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Republican Tennessee Congressman Marsha  Blackburn joins me next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  But in light of all other positive elements between the U.S. and  North Korea, three Tennessee Republicans now signing a letter formally  nominating President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>My next guest is one of those nominating him. Joining me now, Republican  Tennessee Congressman, Marsha Blackburn. And I've got to say this,  congressman because my mom is watching, you were ask to be called you  congressman, my mother will think I'm disrespectful if I say that instead  of congresswoman. </p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNEESEE:  Your mother will know that you are  using the correct title for the job. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Out of respect I will adhere to all your wish and I'm glad to  know that I'm actually correct with my grammar. Being from Texas--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Grammatically correct.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- being from Texas that doesn't happen very often.</p><p>So I want to ask you about this Nobel Peace Prize nomination.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Look, you've had some conflict with the Nobel Peace Prize. There  was a lot of people that was very polarizing, when President Obama was  nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize after only two months into office, you  had Mahatma Gandhi was never given Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yasser Arafat was given the Nobel Peace Prize. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>It seems like this organization does not have a lot of credibility when it  comes at least to the Nobel Peace Prize not the physics prize but the Nobel  Peace Prize. Why would you think it's so important for the president to be  nominated, and I would assume win this Nobel Peace Prize? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  One of the things that I think is significant is that President  Moon of South Korea is who originally said, he thought that the president  should receive the Nobel Peace Prize. </p><p>If this is a president who because of his accomplishment and actions, and  the fact that he is leading through strength if he is able to bring an end  to the Korean conflict and resolve this and have an irrevocable and  complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, that is quite an  achievement. </p><p>And I think this would be something people around the globe would say the  president's peace through strength is paying a dividend, this is something  that should have been done long ago, getting Kim Jong-un to the negotiating  table so that you are going to resolve this and make certain that it is a  complete process. That's noteworthy. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  A few months ago, if you have said that the denuclearization was  on table in North Korea, I think people would have called you crazy. I  agree with you that if something like happens it's certainly worthy of the  Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I want to go to you a little further about both about Facebook  but also to the story that just broke from NBC News and sources now to the  story of wiretapping of Michael Cohen who is President Trump's attorney. </p><p>Sources are now saying federal investigators were monitoring calls but not  listening to calls, so they're saying he was under surveillance but his  phone calls were not recorded as reported by NBC News. </p><p>Everybody was quick to believe NBC News but now they are retracting it. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  This entire investigation, and all of this mess that is going  on. You have Michael Cohen saying one thing, Mayor Giuliani saying  something completely different. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes. And let me tell you something. When I'm talking to  Tennesseans what they will tell me is that they know there's Democrats and  the liberal press are out to get President Trump. </p><p>They voted for President Trump and he was elected so that he would go drain  the swamp, that is what they want to see happen. And all of this talk and  hubbub doesn't do one thing. To create one more job or put one more  paycheck in the pipeline for Tennesseans and that's what Tennesseans are  wanting to see. </p><p>They wants to see more tax cuts, they want more of an economic recovery,  they like what is happening. They want to see the talks with North Korea  succeed, the actions against the new axis of evil, Russia and Iran and  China, and North Korea. They want to see action there so that we do achieve  some peace. They want to see the military rebuild. </p><p>And these are things that Donald Trump is accomplishing. This is something  they want to see more of. And quite frankly they're not paying a whole lot  of attention to all of these different investigations that are the hype of  the day. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Congressman, switching gears a little bit, you know, Mr.  Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill. And you took him to task over Facebook and  their privacy. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  You proposed a BROWSER Act which you mentioned to Mr. Zuckerberg  which he didn't know about at the time. </p><p>But earlier in 2017, the FCC had the Obama era act which you voted against  was a 100 percent partisan, Republicans voting against it, and what it did  was it allowed third parties of information to be sold to from the  telecoms, you voted against that but then you enacted a bill, the BROWSER  Act, which you're the lead sponsor on which basically put that back in  place but it just added to edge providers, which are Facebook and Google,  and things like that. </p><p>Why would you vote against that bill and make it the Wild West instead of  amending that bill and adding others to it? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, I would take issue with your term the Wild West, because  what had happened with the net neutrality roles entitles to and the rate  classification at the internet all was a part of that. What you need is one  set of rules with one privacy regulator for the entire internet eco system. </p><p>And what big tech wanted to do was to carve themselves out so that they did  not have to abide by any privacy rules. And as we have seen, this is  something that is not fair, and it is not right, and it certainly is a  violation of your privacy rights. </p><p>When you talk about this edge providers, which are your social media  providers, YouTube, Google, Twitter, there is a problem with them and their  data mining policies, they go in, they snoop around your post, they view  your videos, then they coalesce and sell the information from your data,  the information from your data, to those that are wanting to advertise to  you, that's why you have pop ups and that's why you have so much spam.</p><p>And this is something that we need one set of privacy rules that stem for  the BROWSER Act. Facebook and the other social media outlets need to get  their act together on protecting people's privacy. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Congressman, I don't mean to cut you off, I only have few  seconds left, but when you put a picture on Facebook -- and I'm sorry, we  got only 30 seconds left. Congressman, I apologize to you. Thank you very  much for your time, and good luck in the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Absolutely, any time. Thank you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- BROWSER Act.</p><p>CBS under fire. A new report from the Washington Post accusing the media  company of being well-aware of former anchor Charlie Rose's harassment  incidents as far back as 1986. </p><p>CBS is reporting an earning beat after the bell. We're monitoring the CEO's  earnings conference call for any response. </p><p>The Federalist Britt McHenry isn't surprised; she is here to react after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  NBC issuing this update that a story on the feds wiretapping  Trump attorney, Michael Cohen. Now, they're saying he was surveilled and  that phone calls were not recorded. </p><p>NBC issuing this statement, editor's note today, \"Earlier today, NBC News  reported that there was a wiretap on the phones of Michael Cohen. President  Trump's long-time personal attorney citing two separate sources with  knowledge of the legal proceeding involving Cohen. But three senior U.S.  officials now dispute that. Saying that the monitoring of Cohen's phones  were limited to a log of calls, known as a pin register, not a wiretap  where investigators can actually listen to calls.\" </p><p>Stay tuned, I'm sure there will be another report soon saying that there  were calls that were listened to or not listened to and nobody listened to.  I mean, this is nuts. It's accusation thirsty here, we are in New York  City. </p><p>A new report from the Washington Post accused the CBS and there were  allegations of knowing about Charlie Rose's harassment incidents as far  back as 1986. And as recently as April of last year, and the company's  managers doing nothing about it. </p><p>This, as an additional 27 men -- women say Rose sexually harassed them.  Charlie Rose, on the other hand, denouncing the Washington Post news story,  telling the newspaper, quote, \"Your story is unfair and inaccurate.\"</p><p>CBS stock shares in the green after hours following an earnings beat. </p><p>Joining me now, Britt McHenry with The Federalist. Britt, the world has  gone crazy. It's accusation thirsty. Before we get to Charlie Rose what do  you make of this NBC? You've got Michael Cohen saying one thing, Mayor Rudy  Giuliani saying another. </p><p>They're saying calls were listened to, calls were surveilled, calls were  not listened to. This world is gone nuts. What do you make of this NBC  fiasco? </p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Well, what we're witnessing is  a discrediting of the media, and no one is doing that to the media other  than themselves. This is why people are losing faith in what they should be  going to know about what's going on in the world. </p><p>The phrase fake news can easily be applied when several media outlets are  in such a rush to denounce President Trump that they're making egregious  errors. A pin register is different from a wiretap listening to every  single word being made on a phone call. It's a log as you mentioned. </p><p>And to make that kind of a report, and then just say, sorry, we didn't  really mean that. That is what is going to lose the faith of your viewers  of your readers, and honestly it's only going to help the president in his  2020 run.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Britt, I don't mean to cut you off, but the difference between a  pin register and a wiretap, that's not a mistake and conflating the two are  confusing the two, right? </p><p>MCHENRY:  They are two separate things. To rush to judgment, as we saw with  ABC News back in December, with CNN when they reported on Donald Trump, Jr.  and WikiLeaks they had the completely wrong dates. These aren't little  errors of mispronunciation of a word here and there, these are conflating  facts and it's irresponsible journalism, and they need to do more to the  public in my opinion than just issue a press release apologizing. They need  to really take action on improving their work. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Wikipedia is not 100 percent correct use as much as school kids  who don't want to read encyclopedias, they do all their homework on  Wikipedia.</p><p>Now to Charlie -- I want to go back to Charlie Rose, CBS News saying it had  no human resources complaints about Mr. Rose. Also saying in a statement,  quote, \"Since we terminated Charlie Rose we were to strengthen existing  systems to ensure a safe environment where everyone can do their best work.  Some of the actions we have taken have been reported publicly, some have  not. We offer employees discretion and fairness, and we take swift action  when we learn of unacceptable behavior.\" Swift action?</p><p>MCHENRY:  Swift action. Some of these allegations dated back to 1986 the  year that I was born, 31 years ago. Now granted, there was a different  culture, hopefully everything we've witnessed in past year will improve the  workplace culture in media. </p><p>But to Charlie Rose was going after the Washington Post. They had 107 women  that they spoke to, you mean to tell you 107 records of firsthand accounts  other things that they've heard that that means nothing? You know, 14 women  at CBS, I believe. There is something there. CBS finally handled it, but it  was too late, and I think it's wrong to say we swiftly handled this when  you could go back 31 years that there were these allegations. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Britt, thank you for making me feel very old right now. </p><p>MCHENRY:  Hey, my birthday is coming up, so I'm getting old too. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  No, you are not. And I want to get to you about the ESPN losses.</p><p>MCHENRY:  Yes. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  But news is so crazy that we don't have much time. Thank you  very much, Brit, for your time.</p><p>MCHENRY:  Thank you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 users a glitch  has now exposed a substantial number of user's passwords. We have the  details. </p><p>But first, Marco Rubio doing a 180, recently criticizing Trump's tax cuts,  now walking back his comments. We have them.</p><p>My next guest is a Florida small business owner who recently sincerely  thanked President Trump for these tax cuts. Irina Vilarino speaks out after  this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio doing a 180, recently  criticizing Trump's tax cut, now he is walking back his comments. Saying  quote, \"Overall, the Republican tax cut has been good for Americans that is  why I voted for it but it could have been even better for American workers  and their families.\"</p><p>Rubio originally blasting the tax law, saying that there is no evidence  whatsoever that money from corporation has been massively poured back into  the American worker. </p><p>My next guest is a Cuban-American small business owner who recently  sincerely thanked President Trump for these tax cuts. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>IRINA VILARINO, CUBAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS OWNER:  Coming from a country that  promise everything and only delivered misery, I knew that eight years of  promoting appeasement, apologizes and entitlement was taking us down a path  of no return. </p><p>Government helps small businesses by letting us do our job and getting out  of the way by unleashing the American spirit. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the politicians are  being beaten today.</p><p>VILARINO:  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Irina, welcome to the show. Is Rubio right to change his stance?  Are these tax cuts -- you run a small business in Miami, a restaurant, have  they affected you? </p><p>VILARINO:  Certainly they have. They have affected us in many ways. And to  err is human. And I think that once people realize that prove is in the  pudding and the results are coming in they are right to understand and  correct their mistakes, I think that that's wise. </p><p>To continue saying that something is not working when clearly it is, well,  I wouldn't think that's too smart of anybody. So I think that it's wise for  Senator Rubio to correct his stance on the tax cuts and to join in and  participate in what we're seeing in the economy right now. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Are you an incorporated company? So the corporate tax cut that  affected you the most? Or are you an LLC so it was a personal tax cut that  affected you the most? </p><p>VILARINO:  We have both, corporate and LLC's.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And that percentage gain that you had that if it's a corporate  tax cut, it can go from something around 35 to 21 percent, what have you  done with that money? Have you hired more people, have you invested in your  restaurant, have you done more marketing, what have you done with that  money? </p><p>VILARINO:  Well, we're definitely investing in our restaurant, but we've  also increased our hourly wage for our current employees, and in order to  obtain new employees we have to increase our hourly wage because there's a  huge demand in labor market right now. So in order to stay competitive and  hire good people you have to increase your salaries which is what we've  seen.</p><p>We've seen an approximate increase of about 20 percent in many cases in a  very short time. And so, we're seeing that this has caused a demand in the  labor market in order to retain our employees and to gain new ones we had  to compete with for those employees. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  In the political crazy world that we're in right now, everybody  is trying to gain an edge. And so you have people who voted against tax cut  saying it didn't had any effect, you have people that voted for it that  said it did. </p><p>Senator Rubio just changed what he said I guess to clarify or correct his  quote. What would you say to these people who say that the tax cut have no  effects, and the people like Ms. Pelosi who said these are just crumbs that  these bonuses that were given out. What would you say to these people who  say tax cuts had no effect? </p><p>VILARINO:  I would say that they are out of touch with every day Americans  with lower level employees that rely on paycheck to paycheck. And that they  should really go out and talk to people. </p><p>And we're not, you know, common Americans we're not worried about the  Russian collusion story. We had so much of that. We're really interested --  maybe if they would have left, you know, left it to the side and focus on  what the president wants to do, which is better our economy, things would  be even better than they are right now.</p><p>They've already gone much better but they could be -- they could even be  even better. So imagine that. </p><p>So, I was just talking to customers today where they were telling me they  own a housing cabinet business. And in this year alone their sales have  increased $3 million in four months. That's -- so that's significant. I  don't that sounds like bread crumbs. </p><p>For these people to go out and hire more people because they have more  demands for their products is significant for our economy. So I think that  Mrs. Pelosi is out of touch, and she would do a great justice to the  American people if she would really stop hijacking every initiative the  president has. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Irina, thank you for coming on the show and good luck to your  restaurant. I look forward to visiting your restaurant when I'm down in  Miami. </p><p>VILARINO:  Absolutely. We look forward to having you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 million users  a glitch has now exposed a substantial number of user's passwords. Its  stock is now down slightly afterhours. Coming up, we have the details. </p><p>Twitter support tweeting out, quote, \"We recently found a bug that stored  password unmasked in an internal log. We fixed the bug and have no  indication of a breach or a misuse by anyone. As a precaution, consider  changing your password on all services where you've used this password  before.\" </p><p>No kidding, Twitter stock down only slightly afterhours. </p><p>But what's great about this is old bulls and bears buddy, the reasons I do  TV. Jonas Max Ferris of Maxfund.com editor and co-founder, and Kadina Group  president Gary B. Smith. </p><p>Age before beauty, so I'm going to start with you, Gary B. So, Gary, look,  these tech stocks, they have been up 28 percent, we're talking about  Facebook, Amazon, Google, they are absolutely on fire. Does this data  breach, does anything derail this tech landslide going on right now? </p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP:  It does not, John, and here is the  reason why. First of all, I just -- as a matter of fact just before we went  on air I tried to sign on to Twitter, and I got that, you know, the whole  gobbledygook, this and that. And you know what I did? I did like a millions  of other Twitter users. I said skip and move on.</p><p>My password is in 27 different locations, I'm sure it's the same password  throughout except for some exceptions. And people are just going to say,  this happened again. I mean, if this happens you know, almost every day it  seems. Maybe it was target at one time, there's been these other sites. </p><p>I think this is a big nothing. I think tech is where it's at. I mean, you  got robotics, you got self-driving cars, you got artificial intelligence,  we've moved away from an industrial society, we're now a tech society, that  is still where I put my money. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And about what I said there with beauty before age because I  want to be Gary B when I grow up because he is a scratch golfer, it's just  everything you want to be in life.</p><p>Jonas, the tech onslaught that's going on right now, you have bifurcated  markets, the tech stocks are on fire, the rest of the market not so much.  Does this continue? </p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MAXFUNDS.COM EDITOR:  I don't think it does continue. And  this is just the very -- the Twitter is not the hottest stock in the world.  And I will say, first of all, everyone is not reading 27-page terms of  service that always comes it keeps throwing you but they are suspicious of  them now more than they ever have been. </p><p>And I think people are getting less happy about the amount of information  these companies have. It's not only their -- I mean, it's their fault that  they log the passwords to appear as text somewhere on their own servers. It  wasn't hacked they don't think.</p><p>I do think there is too much information given to these companies, people  are questioning the business model of collecting more and more and more  information on you, just to put ads between you and content, often content  that you created and your friends created. So, I think the boom is open,  the growth era for these stocks were a little ahead of ourselves. So, I  would say focus more on boring value stocks for little while and so they  can--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Nothing boring about making money. Gary B and Jonas, nothing  boring about you too, guys. Thank you very much both of you. It's the  highlight of my week. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Big day tomorrow, jobs day. Our own Maria Bartiromo will break  down the numbers with expert analysis. It all starts at 8.30 a.m. Eastern  Time on Mornings with Maria right here on Fox Business. </p><p>Thank you for watching. Charles Payne, my pal is here now with Making  Money.

We are on the down side, and then that's a big time, 29 of 30 Dow stocks are in the red.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It could be more of the trade fears, China does cheat in trade and we need a bear relationship with that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY: I'm cautiously optimistic about the meetings. I don't really want to predict what's going to happen or what's not going to happen. We're going to go over there and we are going to have a very frank discussion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are issues that President Trump has been focused on for over the last year, and hopefully we'll make significant progress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FBN HOST: A massive 180, the Dow closing slightly higher, erasing earlier losses of nearly 400 points. With technology and industrial stocks leading the turn around, the market watching the U.S.-China trade talks closely, which are now underway.</p><p>Our U.S. trade delegation arriving in Beijing led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.</p><p>Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm John Layfield. I'm in for Liz MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts now.</p><p>The Dow ending five points higher to 23,930. The day's volatile swings reflecting uncertainty over the trade meetings between the U.S. and China that begins today in Beijing.</p><p>With me now is Nicole Petallides live from the floor of New York Stock Exchange. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, John. So what you saw was the market that was down about 400 points, turned and finished in the green. We can see it right there with that chart that moved into green late in the day. We could thank some of those industrials like Boeing and 3M.</p><p>So there is the look. The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ tough weren't able to squeeze out those gains but not too far off that unchanged line. Here are winners and losers as I noted, Boeing was a big mover and that's heavily weighted in the Dow, up 2 percent. Nike and G.E. coming under pressure.</p><p>Apple, you know, Apple had a great week up about nine percent announcing that share buyback after their quarterly numbers. Take a look up. It's up 100 -- it's at 176.89. But again, up about 9 percent this week.</p><p>Tesla on the other hand, the analysts are saying they've never heard a call like this one, in fact that Elon Musk saying that he was bored, that they were killing him with the questions, they call it bizarre and unorthodox as he interrupted analysts who were asking about profits for the company. The stock finished down 5.5 percent.</p><p>Twitter right at the closing bell we heard from Twitter that in fact, they had a glitch that your passwords may have been unmasked and they are urging everybody to change your password. Stocks finished down 1 percent.</p><p>And CBS just was on the conference call since 4.30 for the last half hour at least is the conference call the stock did beat the street for the company. But we were listening for anything else. Viacom, they said they will not be speaking about Viacom, anything Charlie Rose they have not acknowledged it, the conference call is still going on, but it was a great quarter for CBS. Back to you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Elon Musk conference call was a must-listen, it was wild.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Wild.</p><p>LAYFIELD: We're going to have more on that later. Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Thank you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: President Trump praising his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the U.S. team arrives for two days in trade talks.</p><p>With me now is Connell McShane in Beijing, China with the latest. Connell?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, there, John. Mnuchin is getting set for the second and the final day of his talks with counterparts from China, and he's brought along a large contingent from United States, a team of rivals some are calling it.</p><p>In addition to the treasury secretary, and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross here, the trade rep, Robert Lighthizer, Ambassador Brandstad, economic advisor Larry Kudlow, and Peter Navarro all are on hand. That group already holding talks at a place called the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, which is used often as a meeting place for foreign dignitaries.</p><p>Now, it's not clear how much can really be accomplished. Just over the course of a couple of days, there is some concern building though, that the tensions over trade dragged on and nothing has accomplished. A growing anti-American sentiment will build up here in China that could cause real problems for American companies.</p><p>There are stories swirling about China cutting back on buying U.S. soybeans so that would kind be an example of that. We found out about it ourselves on a visit we took to a local food market here in Beijing, we found out about worries building about supply disruptions.</p><p>With the help of our translator, I spoke to one of the merchants there about fish that she was selling here that was brought in from the Boston area.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Is she worried at all that the supply might go down as that conflict continues?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'll ask her?</p><p>(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She said, yes, I really have this kind of concern, and maybe two weeks ago, there were some, yes, there was a period, a short period that kind of lacked a little bit of the supply.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: So similar comments that you heard there, to what we see many times from farmers and others back in United States. So with these talks we have day one in book, as we get set for day two, we're hoping to get some sort of an update from Secretary Mnuchin or somebody else in the U.S. delegation before they all fly black on Friday evening.</p><p>With that, from here in Beijing, John, back to you in New York.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Well, thank you, Connell. It's 5 o'clock in the morning in Beijing right now, so please go to bed. Great work. Thank you.</p><p>Sign of progress, Switzerland UBS is now testing China's promise to allow foreign owned banks saying today it's seeking control of its joint venture in China, but upping its stake in the business to 51 percent. It would be the first financial firm to take advantage of Beijing's decision to relax investment rules on foreign banks.</p><p>UBS stock ending the day in the green to a little more than $16 a share.</p><p>Joining me now is former deputy assistance to George W. Bush, Brad Blakeman. Brad, this seems like a step in the right direction. You were with the Bush administration who last tried steel tariffs. They ended up most those administration officials admitted that it was a mistake.</p><p>We first started to go after China. We started to go after them with steel tariffs. Once again, we import about 2.2 percent of steel from China. That's not the real issue. The real issue is theft of intellectual property and there's one belt -- one road in this trip where they're loading up these countries around the world with too much debt that they can handle, and a need for China to expand their global dominance right now. How do you deal with the real issues specifically the theft of intellectual property?</p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT: We got to hold China's feet to the fire, they know what they are doing, they are a country of makers, takers and fakers. And it's unacceptable. If they want to be a first world country, they have to stop acting like a third world country.</p><p>The president is only asking for them to respect our ownership of things that we own and not to take it, not to fake it and not to make it. So I think carrots and sticks are makes trade effective. Right now we're using sticks. And by sending our big guns over there it's not to start a war, it's to prevent one from happening.</p><p>When America is at our best, when we stand on principle, when we stood on principle with China we have an effect with North Korea. We have to do the same thing for things that are absolutely in our interest to protect jobs here at home.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Brad, what can really be done? You know, President Xi over there, you know, he's a forever chairman right now, be he is still is having a hard time with this made in China 2025. He's got a terrible problem with a coastal economy, the bifurcation of the rich and the poor over there. They have 260 percent right now debt to GDP that they just reported.</p><p>He's in a bind himself, with this own Chinese media saying don't give in to, quote, \"the bullying tactics of President Trump.\" It seems like he can't back down. It seems like the Trump guys can't back down. It seems like what we're getting out of this is probably just window dressing like we got with some of the tariffs on the South Korean deal that really didn't meter that much. The quotas did, the tariffs didn't. Do you expect something substantive?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: To come out of this China meeting.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: I do, but I don't think it's going to come right away. This is - - this is a breaking of the ice. We've sent the best and brightest there, they know that they speak to the president, President Xi knows that, and this is going to be a long process, but China has got to change their behavior.</p><p>We're not going to be extorted anymore and we're not going to be taken advantage of. It's not in China's interest, it's not in the United States' interest to have a trade war, and we've got to use every tool in the tool box to make the Chinese understand that it's going to be business as usual.</p><p>A deal is only as good as it is for both parties if one party thinks they are getting a raw deal then it's going to be honored in the breach. Stand on principle, China will find an accommodation, we'll compromise, and we'll be much better off dealing with China out of strength than out of weakness.</p><p>LAYFIELD: How can we deal with the amount of strength, what is the main thing we can do that to deal with theft of intellectual property in what China is trying to do in the global scenario right now.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: We can punish China directly. We can punish the companies in the private sector of China. There is a lot that we can do, and we can also use the clout of our business sector. Apple would love us to start sticking up for their intellectual property.</p><p>There are other companies that do business with China who have been the victims of theft. So, yes, we've got to stick with the American companies. We've got to stand up for them. We've got to protect our property. And we got to punish China when they act in our -- when they act -- I would say as criminals, in stealing property that doesn't belong to them.</p><p>LAYFIELD: China is reportedly ordering a recording ban on the Mnuchin led trade talks. Isn't this part of the problem?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I mean, they control the media. It's a dictatorship effectively, President Xi is there forever. They control this and they have not been honest with their dealings, same as North Korea. How do you know that we can get a deal, and they will adhere to this deal?</p><p>Because when you have Chinese companies right now that are listed, they have listed assets that don't exist. And there is no recourse for investors that have invested in these Chinese companies, they are able to lie and have no follow-up. How do you handle that?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Well, first of all, with regard to their own media, it doesn't matter what they control their media inside their country, what matters is what the rest of the world does, that's where the leverage comes in. The United States should not go alone with their tax on China. There are thousands of companies that are outside our borders in friendly nations to us, and allies who should join us in putting the screws to China.</p><p>And guess what? China will back down. They don't want their people to know what they are doing, that's fine. As long as we know what they are doing, and we can verify the concessions that they'll make.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Brad, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. That's going to be very interesting on the next couple of days--</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- on what the Trump administration can get done with the Chinese officials.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Pleasure.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 million users a glitch has now exposed. Substantial number of user's password. It's stocks is now down slightly afterhours. Coming up, we have the details and the developing story.</p><p>A new report accusing Disney on CBS of knowing about former anchor Charlie Rose's sexual harassment and doing nothing about them. Coming up, we have the details.</p><p>Plus, the embattled media company just reporting after the bell. We're monitoring the CEO's earnings conference call for any response.</p><p>But first, NBC reporting federal investigators wire tapped the phone of President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen, and at least one of his phone calls was with White House was intercepted.</p><p>My next guest is an attorney who says that's not legal. Harmeet Dhillon joins me next.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And now this, NBC reporting federal investigators wiretapped the phone of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen. And at least one of his calls with the White House was intercepted.</p><p>According to report, the wiretap was in place leading up to the raids on Cohen's home and offices last month. And it's unknown if President Trump was heard in the wiretaps, this according to two anonymous sources.</p><p>Giuliani telling now the Daily Beast he doesn't think Michael Cohen was wiretapped because it would be highly.</p><p>With me now is attorney Harmeet Dhillon. Harmeet, this appears to me to be one of the biggest messes I've seen in recent political history. You've got Mr. Cohen who says that he was not paid back. He stands by that.</p><p>Now you have Mayor Giuliani come out last night and say he was. You have President Trump saying that he did pay him. President -- or Mayor Giuliani comes out and says that he did but President Trump didn't know about it and didn't know about what it was for.</p><p>You also have Mayor Giuliani coming out saying that this wiretap was illegal because of the attorney-client privilege and also if you are wiretapping and the president is on the call, you have to notify the White House.</p><p>Was this illegal if this wiretap did in fact exist?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY: Well, I think it's too early to say whether or not it is illegal, at least for me, I don't know all the details. But what we do have is this coming in the setting of evidence that that same people involved in this DOJ investigation have sought warrants to wiretap people through the FISA court that were not truthful with the court about all the circumstances.</p><p>And it's, you know, really the same sort of group of high level FBI and DOJ individuals who have been involved in getting this particular set of search warrants.</p><p>And we've already known, for example, that Michael Cohen's e-mails have been intercepted, so it's not surprising that there is a wiretap order as well. The real question is, what was the court told in order to get the subpoena in order to get that wiretap, in order to get that warrant, rather. And we don't know that.</p><p>But it is true that courts generally require the prosecutors to take great care and not to intercept attorney-client communication unless there is already evidence of an attorney-client exception relating to a crime, and that has not been allege yet in this case.</p><p>So if it is true that the president or somebody close to the president on his behalf communications with his lawyer had been intercepted that is a very serious matter.</p><p>LAYFIELD: NBC News this breaking news has just released a report that they, in fact, did not listen to the calls. I'm not sure if they said whether the wiretap was still in existence or not but NBC at least saying they did not listen to those calls. That's the newest report.</p><p>And it's just a new web that's being built right now. This whole thing is just crazy to me. Now it seems to me with plausible deniability that the Trump administration whether true or not has to at least say that they paid back Mr. Cohen because if not that looks like a campaign finance violation which is a violation of the federal law. Is that correct?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, I think Rudy Giuliani already has addressed this issue. And you know, some people have said maybe he went on Hannity show last night, and had a slip of the tongue. No, I think Rudy Giuliani knows exactly what he is doing and that was thought out carefully. You know, obviously when you are making a payment like this to settle a disputed claim, which I do as a lawyer on behalf of my clients all the time, you know, you don't want to be talking about it publicly. And so, that's one point.</p><p>And so now they have to do it because of all of the storm of controversy around it. But number two, it's entirely plausible that somebody of the net worth of the president would not know the details of settlements like this. And I'm sure isn't necessarily the only settlement. He's been affiliated with Michael Cohen for many years.</p><p>And so, you know, surrounding here for somebody who is very wealthy this amount of money I know it may seem like a lot to most Americans, but in the grand scheme of things, people who are this wealthy routinely are shaken down, routinely are approached with these types of threats and routinely make the calculation that regardless of the merits of these types of claims it is better economically and better for their peace of mind and their family's sake to resolve them privately.</p><p>So, we know that Stormy Daniels is not a person who can be trusted because she breached that agreement so that has to be put in the context of the rest of the people--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yes. But who can be trusted between Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani, because one of them is lying. Look, I can understand the argument that President Trump if he did in fact spend $100 million on his campaign didn't know about a $130,000 payment.</p><p>But if you are lawyer, and you said that you made, and I have no reason to doubt that, payment on behalf of your client. If you're making a payment of $130,000 on behalf of your client it may not mean something to a person with a $100 million who does this regularly when people try to sue him for crazy things, much less some more egregious things like this.</p><p>But if the porn star that involves the president of United States you know for a fact whether you did this or not and Michael Cohen has denied it. So somebody is lying here, it's either Michael Cohen or Rudy Giuliani. I mean, if you are lawyer here, wouldn't you know you made this payment?</p><p>DHILLON: No, so first of all, I would reject the characterization that somebody must be lying, I would probably if I were taken depositions I would ask quite a follow-up questions.</p><p>And so the way that Rudy Giuliani described this was that there were payments made in the form of retainers of some amount every month, I think he said $35,000. So that's different than a check for $130,000 being written to Michael Cohen to reimburse him but that is inconsistent with reimbursements having been made. So, again--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD: I'm talking -- I'm talking about -- wait a minute--</p><p>DHILLON: -- we're talking with lawyers here.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I'm talking about -- I don't mean to interrupt you, I apologize. I'm talking about Michael Cohen's payment to Stormy Daniels, that was the one that Michael Cohen says, he was not reimbursed for, wouldn't Michael Cohen know this?</p><p>Now the president may not because he is a very wealthy man and there's a lot of these things with very wealthy people. But wouldn't Michael Cohen know for sure? Because Michael Cohen says he was not reimbursed, Mayor Giuliani said he was. There's a problem there.</p><p>DHILLON: Well, I just addressed that, so I think that, you know, there is a difference between getting $130,000 check, that is a direct, you know, exact account and retainer payments, which is how Giuliani describe it.</p><p>So, you know, again, you are dealing with lawyers here, and I'm sure the language was thought about very carefully before each of these two gentlemen got into the details.</p><p>And you know, it is always awkward when you are a lawyer being asked to describe the details of your interaction with your client. Lawyers tried to be very circumspect about that. And so, you know, I mean, any lawyer would be put in a very difficult position to answer those questions.</p><p>So, without some further follow up on, I don't think anyone can conclude that there was a lie told here on by either of them.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I understand, but again, I wasn't talking about the retainer to Michael Cohen. There was not a retainer paid to a porn star. I can pretty much guarantee you that.</p><p>I do want to follow up a little bit on the NBC story. The NBC story was that, now they are walking back claims that they indeed listened to these phone calls. But to go forward now, you have special counsel Robert Mueller filing a request for 70 subpoenas in the eastern District of Virginia in the case of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.</p><p>Where does this go from here? This seems like a never ending investigation. And one of the reasons it seems never ending is because Mr. Mueller is just not letting go out, like a good investigator would do, but we don't know if it's an actual witch-hunt or if there is something here. What do you think this means this 70 subpoenas?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, first with the 70 subpoenas, we don't know what it means because the story just broke a few minutes ago. I've seen the cover page of the request by the special prosecutor. But generally speaking you have to get a court to issue a subpoena for a trial appearance.</p><p>And the date indicated is that the prosecutor wants people individuals to come to court in a date in July to testify at a trial. It also says there is a reference in the news reports about 35 sets of subpoenas, so it could be that there is a request for two separate hearing dates, it's not clear from the papers that have been published so far.</p><p>And with respect to so-called they are walking back the wiretapping claims who are they? You know, we don't know who they are? We don't know where these leaks are coming from? And we don't know why the people are saying that they didn't do what they weren't supposed to do because they've been caught out in doing it.</p><p>But you know, I would need a lot more information and so should your viewers before you reach any conclusion about whether the calls were simply monitored as to a call occurred versus the contents of the call being listened to and who was on the other side of that call at the White House. I think these are all questions that we don't know as yet.</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's right. And that's the problem with this entire mess, there's so many reports there's so many allegations that you don't know what is fact, especially because Mr. Mueller himself is not letting any information out until he wants to.</p><p>Harmeet, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate you coming on tonight. Coming up-</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- North Korea may release its three U.S. hostages at any moment, President Trump hinting at it this moment.</p><p>My next guest has signed a letter formally nominating Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Republican Tennessee Congressman Marsha Blackburn joins me next.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But in light of all other positive elements between the U.S. and North Korea, three Tennessee Republicans now signing a letter formally nominating President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>My next guest is one of those nominating him. Joining me now, Republican Tennessee Congressman, Marsha Blackburn. And I've got to say this, congressman because my mom is watching, you were ask to be called you congressman, my mother will think I'm disrespectful if I say that instead of congresswoman.</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNEESEE: Your mother will know that you are using the correct title for the job.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Out of respect I will adhere to all your wish and I'm glad to know that I'm actually correct with my grammar. Being from Texas--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN: Grammatically correct.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- being from Texas that doesn't happen very often.</p><p>So I want to ask you about this Nobel Peace Prize nomination.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Sure.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Look, you've had some conflict with the Nobel Peace Prize. There was a lot of people that was very polarizing, when President Obama was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize after only two months into office, you had Mahatma Gandhi was never given Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yasser Arafat was given the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>It seems like this organization does not have a lot of credibility when it comes at least to the Nobel Peace Prize not the physics prize but the Nobel Peace Prize. Why would you think it's so important for the president to be nominated, and I would assume win this Nobel Peace Prize?</p><p>BLACKBURN: One of the things that I think is significant is that President Moon of South Korea is who originally said, he thought that the president should receive the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>If this is a president who because of his accomplishment and actions, and the fact that he is leading through strength if he is able to bring an end to the Korean conflict and resolve this and have an irrevocable and complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, that is quite an achievement.</p><p>And I think this would be something people around the globe would say the president's peace through strength is paying a dividend, this is something that should have been done long ago, getting Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table so that you are going to resolve this and make certain that it is a complete process. That's noteworthy.</p><p>LAYFIELD: A few months ago, if you have said that the denuclearization was on table in North Korea, I think people would have called you crazy. I agree with you that if something like happens it's certainly worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I want to go to you a little further about both about Facebook but also to the story that just broke from NBC News and sources now to the story of wiretapping of Michael Cohen who is President Trump's attorney.</p><p>Sources are now saying federal investigators were monitoring calls but not listening to calls, so they're saying he was under surveillance but his phone calls were not recorded as reported by NBC News.</p><p>Everybody was quick to believe NBC News but now they are retracting it.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: This entire investigation, and all of this mess that is going on. You have Michael Cohen saying one thing, Mayor Giuliani saying something completely different.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes. And let me tell you something. When I'm talking to Tennesseans what they will tell me is that they know there's Democrats and the liberal press are out to get President Trump.</p><p>They voted for President Trump and he was elected so that he would go drain the swamp, that is what they want to see happen. And all of this talk and hubbub doesn't do one thing. To create one more job or put one more paycheck in the pipeline for Tennesseans and that's what Tennesseans are wanting to see.</p><p>They wants to see more tax cuts, they want more of an economic recovery, they like what is happening. They want to see the talks with North Korea succeed, the actions against the new axis of evil, Russia and Iran and China, and North Korea. They want to see action there so that we do achieve some peace. They want to see the military rebuild.</p><p>And these are things that Donald Trump is accomplishing. This is something they want to see more of. And quite frankly they're not paying a whole lot of attention to all of these different investigations that are the hype of the day.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Congressman, switching gears a little bit, you know, Mr. Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill. And you took him to task over Facebook and their privacy.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD: You proposed a BROWSER Act which you mentioned to Mr. Zuckerberg which he didn't know about at the time.</p><p>But earlier in 2017, the FCC had the Obama era act which you voted against was a 100 percent partisan, Republicans voting against it, and what it did was it allowed third parties of information to be sold to from the telecoms, you voted against that but then you enacted a bill, the BROWSER Act, which you're the lead sponsor on which basically put that back in place but it just added to edge providers, which are Facebook and Google, and things like that.</p><p>Why would you vote against that bill and make it the Wild West instead of amending that bill and adding others to it?</p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, I would take issue with your term the Wild West, because what had happened with the net neutrality roles entitles to and the rate classification at the internet all was a part of that. What you need is one set of rules with one privacy regulator for the entire internet eco system.</p><p>And what big tech wanted to do was to carve themselves out so that they did not have to abide by any privacy rules. And as we have seen, this is something that is not fair, and it is not right, and it certainly is a violation of your privacy rights.</p><p>When you talk about this edge providers, which are your social media providers, YouTube, Google, Twitter, there is a problem with them and their data mining policies, they go in, they snoop around your post, they view your videos, then they coalesce and sell the information from your data, the information from your data, to those that are wanting to advertise to you, that's why you have pop ups and that's why you have so much spam.</p><p>And this is something that we need one set of privacy rules that stem for the BROWSER Act. Facebook and the other social media outlets need to get their act together on protecting people's privacy.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Congressman, I don't mean to cut you off, I only have few seconds left, but when you put a picture on Facebook -- and I'm sorry, we got only 30 seconds left. Congressman, I apologize to you. Thank you very much for your time, and good luck in the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN: Absolutely, any time. Thank you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- BROWSER Act.</p><p>CBS under fire. A new report from the Washington Post accusing the media company of being well-aware of former anchor Charlie Rose's harassment incidents as far back as 1986.</p><p>CBS is reporting an earning beat after the bell. We're monitoring the CEO's earnings conference call for any response.</p><p>The Federalist Britt McHenry isn't surprised; she is here to react after this.</p><p>LAYFIELD: NBC issuing this update that a story on the feds wiretapping Trump attorney, Michael Cohen. Now, they're saying he was surveilled and that phone calls were not recorded.</p><p>NBC issuing this statement, editor's note today, \"Earlier today, NBC News reported that there was a wiretap on the phones of Michael Cohen. President Trump's long-time personal attorney citing two separate sources with knowledge of the legal proceeding involving Cohen. But three senior U.S. officials now dispute that. Saying that the monitoring of Cohen's phones were limited to a log of calls, known as a pin register, not a wiretap where investigators can actually listen to calls.\"</p><p>Stay tuned, I'm sure there will be another report soon saying that there were calls that were listened to or not listened to and nobody listened to. I mean, this is nuts. It's accusation thirsty here, we are in New York City.</p><p>A new report from the Washington Post accused the CBS and there were allegations of knowing about Charlie Rose's harassment incidents as far back as 1986. And as recently as April of last year, and the company's managers doing nothing about it.</p><p>This, as an additional 27 men -- women say Rose sexually harassed them. Charlie Rose, on the other hand, denouncing the Washington Post news story, telling the newspaper, quote, \"Your story is unfair and inaccurate.\"</p><p>CBS stock shares in the green after hours following an earnings beat.</p><p>Joining me now, Britt McHenry with The Federalist. Britt, the world has gone crazy. It's accusation thirsty. Before we get to Charlie Rose what do you make of this NBC? You've got Michael Cohen saying one thing, Mayor Rudy Giuliani saying another.</p><p>They're saying calls were listened to, calls were surveilled, calls were not listened to. This world is gone nuts. What do you make of this NBC fiasco?</p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST: Well, what we're witnessing is a discrediting of the media, and no one is doing that to the media other than themselves. This is why people are losing faith in what they should be going to know about what's going on in the world.</p><p>The phrase fake news can easily be applied when several media outlets are in such a rush to denounce President Trump that they're making egregious errors. A pin register is different from a wiretap listening to every single word being made on a phone call. It's a log as you mentioned.</p><p>And to make that kind of a report, and then just say, sorry, we didn't really mean that. That is what is going to lose the faith of your viewers of your readers, and honestly it's only going to help the president in his 2020 run.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Britt, I don't mean to cut you off, but the difference between a pin register and a wiretap, that's not a mistake and conflating the two are confusing the two, right?</p><p>MCHENRY: They are two separate things. To rush to judgment, as we saw with ABC News back in December, with CNN when they reported on Donald Trump, Jr. and WikiLeaks they had the completely wrong dates. These aren't little errors of mispronunciation of a word here and there, these are conflating facts and it's irresponsible journalism, and they need to do more to the public in my opinion than just issue a press release apologizing. They need to really take action on improving their work.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Wikipedia is not 100 percent correct use as much as school kids who don't want to read encyclopedias, they do all their homework on Wikipedia.</p><p>Now to Charlie -- I want to go back to Charlie Rose, CBS News saying it had no human resources complaints about Mr. Rose. Also saying in a statement, quote, \"Since we terminated Charlie Rose we were to strengthen existing systems to ensure a safe environment where everyone can do their best work. Some of the actions we have taken have been reported publicly, some have not. We offer employees discretion and fairness, and we take swift action when we learn of unacceptable behavior.\" Swift action?</p><p>MCHENRY: Swift action. Some of these allegations dated back to 1986 the year that I was born, 31 years ago. Now granted, there was a different culture, hopefully everything we've witnessed in past year will improve the workplace culture in media.</p><p>But to Charlie Rose was going after the Washington Post. They had 107 women that they spoke to, you mean to tell you 107 records of firsthand accounts other things that they've heard that that means nothing? You know, 14 women at CBS, I believe. There is something there. CBS finally handled it, but it was too late, and I think it's wrong to say we swiftly handled this when you could go back 31 years that there were these allegations.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Britt, thank you for making me feel very old right now.</p><p>MCHENRY: Hey, my birthday is coming up, so I'm getting old too.</p><p>LAYFIELD: No, you are not. And I want to get to you about the ESPN losses.</p><p>MCHENRY: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: But news is so crazy that we don't have much time. Thank you very much, Brit, for your time.</p><p>MCHENRY: Thank you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 users a glitch has now exposed a substantial number of user's passwords. We have the details.</p><p>But first, Marco Rubio doing a 180, recently criticizing Trump's tax cuts, now walking back his comments. We have them.</p><p>My next guest is a Florida small business owner who recently sincerely thanked President Trump for these tax cuts. Irina Vilarino speaks out after this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio doing a 180, recently criticizing Trump's tax cut, now he is walking back his comments. Saying quote, \"Overall, the Republican tax cut has been good for Americans that is why I voted for it but it could have been even better for American workers and their families.\"</p><p>Rubio originally blasting the tax law, saying that there is no evidence whatsoever that money from corporation has been massively poured back into the American worker.</p><p>My next guest is a Cuban-American small business owner who recently sincerely thanked President Trump for these tax cuts. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IRINA VILARINO, CUBAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS OWNER: Coming from a country that promise everything and only delivered misery, I knew that eight years of promoting appeasement, apologizes and entitlement was taking us down a path of no return.</p><p>Government helps small businesses by letting us do our job and getting out of the way by unleashing the American spirit.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the politicians are being beaten today.</p><p>VILARINO: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Irina, welcome to the show. Is Rubio right to change his stance? Are these tax cuts -- you run a small business in Miami, a restaurant, have they affected you?</p><p>VILARINO: Certainly they have. They have affected us in many ways. And to err is human. And I think that once people realize that prove is in the pudding and the results are coming in they are right to understand and correct their mistakes, I think that that's wise.</p><p>To continue saying that something is not working when clearly it is, well, I wouldn't think that's too smart of anybody. So I think that it's wise for Senator Rubio to correct his stance on the tax cuts and to join in and participate in what we're seeing in the economy right now.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Are you an incorporated company? So the corporate tax cut that affected you the most? Or are you an LLC so it was a personal tax cut that affected you the most?</p><p>VILARINO: We have both, corporate and LLC's.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And that percentage gain that you had that if it's a corporate tax cut, it can go from something around 35 to 21 percent, what have you done with that money? Have you hired more people, have you invested in your restaurant, have you done more marketing, what have you done with that money?</p><p>VILARINO: Well, we're definitely investing in our restaurant, but we've also increased our hourly wage for our current employees, and in order to obtain new employees we have to increase our hourly wage because there's a huge demand in labor market right now. So in order to stay competitive and hire good people you have to increase your salaries which is what we've seen.</p><p>We've seen an approximate increase of about 20 percent in many cases in a very short time. And so, we're seeing that this has caused a demand in the labor market in order to retain our employees and to gain new ones we had to compete with for those employees.</p><p>LAYFIELD: In the political crazy world that we're in right now, everybody is trying to gain an edge. And so you have people who voted against tax cut saying it didn't had any effect, you have people that voted for it that said it did.</p><p>Senator Rubio just changed what he said I guess to clarify or correct his quote. What would you say to these people who say that the tax cut have no effects, and the people like Ms. Pelosi who said these are just crumbs that these bonuses that were given out. What would you say to these people who say tax cuts had no effect?</p><p>VILARINO: I would say that they are out of touch with every day Americans with lower level employees that rely on paycheck to paycheck. And that they should really go out and talk to people.</p><p>And we're not, you know, common Americans we're not worried about the Russian collusion story. We had so much of that. We're really interested -- maybe if they would have left, you know, left it to the side and focus on what the president wants to do, which is better our economy, things would be even better than they are right now.</p><p>They've already gone much better but they could be -- they could even be even better. So imagine that.</p><p>So, I was just talking to customers today where they were telling me they own a housing cabinet business. And in this year alone their sales have increased $3 million in four months. That's -- so that's significant. I don't that sounds like bread crumbs.</p><p>For these people to go out and hire more people because they have more demands for their products is significant for our economy. So I think that Mrs. Pelosi is out of touch, and she would do a great justice to the American people if she would really stop hijacking every initiative the president has.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Irina, thank you for coming on the show and good luck to your restaurant. I look forward to visiting your restaurant when I'm down in Miami.</p><p>VILARINO: Absolutely. We look forward to having you.</p><p>LAYFIELD: We'll be right back.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 million users a glitch has now exposed a substantial number of user's passwords. Its stock is now down slightly afterhours. Coming up, we have the details.</p><p>Twitter support tweeting out, quote, \"We recently found a bug that stored password unmasked in an internal log. We fixed the bug and have no indication of a breach or a misuse by anyone. As a precaution, consider changing your password on all services where you've used this password before.\"</p><p>No kidding, Twitter stock down only slightly afterhours.</p><p>But what's great about this is old bulls and bears buddy, the reasons I do TV. Jonas Max Ferris of Maxfund.com editor and co-founder, and Kadina Group president Gary B. Smith.</p><p>Age before beauty, so I'm going to start with you, Gary B. So, Gary, look, these tech stocks, they have been up 28 percent, we're talking about Facebook, Amazon, Google, they are absolutely on fire. Does this data breach, does anything derail this tech landslide going on right now?</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP: It does not, John, and here is the reason why. First of all, I just -- as a matter of fact just before we went on air I tried to sign on to Twitter, and I got that, you know, the whole gobbledygook, this and that. And you know what I did? I did like a millions of other Twitter users. I said skip and move on.</p><p>My password is in 27 different locations, I'm sure it's the same password throughout except for some exceptions. And people are just going to say, this happened again. I mean, if this happens you know, almost every day it seems. Maybe it was target at one time, there's been these other sites.</p><p>I think this is a big nothing. I think tech is where it's at. I mean, you got robotics, you got self-driving cars, you got artificial intelligence, we've moved away from an industrial society, we're now a tech society, that is still where I put my money.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And about what I said there with beauty before age because I want to be Gary B when I grow up because he is a scratch golfer, it's just everything you want to be in life.</p><p>Jonas, the tech onslaught that's going on right now, you have bifurcated markets, the tech stocks are on fire, the rest of the market not so much. Does this continue?</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MAXFUNDS.COM EDITOR: I don't think it does continue. And this is just the very -- the Twitter is not the hottest stock in the world. And I will say, first of all, everyone is not reading 27-page terms of service that always comes it keeps throwing you but they are suspicious of them now more than they ever have been.</p><p>And I think people are getting less happy about the amount of information these companies have. It's not only their -- I mean, it's their fault that they log the passwords to appear as text somewhere on their own servers. It wasn't hacked they don't think.</p><p>I do think there is too much information given to these companies, people are questioning the business model of collecting more and more and more information on you, just to put ads between you and content, often content that you created and your friends created. So, I think the boom is open, the growth era for these stocks were a little ahead of ourselves. So, I would say focus more on boring value stocks for little while and so they can--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD: Nothing boring about making money. Gary B and Jonas, nothing boring about you too, guys. Thank you very much both of you. It's the highlight of my week. We'll be right back.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Big day tomorrow, jobs day. Our own Maria Bartiromo will break down the numbers with expert analysis. It all starts at 8.30 a.m. Eastern Time on Mornings with Maria right here on Fox Business.</p><p>Thank you for watching.

We are on the down side, and then that's  a big time, 29 of 30 Dow stocks are in the red. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It could be more of the trade fears, China does cheat  in trade and we need a bear relationship with that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  I'm cautiously optimistic  about the meetings. I don't really want to predict what's going to happen  or what's not going to happen. We're going to go over there and we are  going to have a very frank discussion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are issues that President Trump has been focused on for over the last  year, and hopefully we'll make significant progress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FBN HOST:  A massive 180, the Dow closing slightly higher,  erasing earlier losses of nearly 400 points. With technology and industrial  stocks leading the turn around, the market watching the U.S.-China trade  talks closely, which are now underway. </p><p>Our U.S. trade delegation arriving in Beijing led by Treasury Secretary  Steve Mnuchin. </p><p>Politics, money, we got you covered. I'm John Layfield. I'm in for Liz  MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts now. </p><p>The Dow ending five points higher to 23,930. The day's volatile swings  reflecting uncertainty over the trade meetings between the U.S. and China  that begins today in Beijing.</p><p>With me now is Nicole Petallides live from the floor of New York Stock  Exchange. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, John. So what you saw was the  market that was down about 400 points, turned and finished in the green. We  can see it right there with that chart that moved into green late in the  day. We could thank some of those industrials like Boeing and 3M. </p><p>So there is the look. The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ tough weren't able to squeeze  out those gains but not too far off that unchanged line. Here are winners  and losers as I noted, Boeing was a big mover and that's heavily weighted  in the Dow, up 2 percent. Nike and G.E. coming under pressure. </p><p>Apple, you know, Apple had a great week up about nine percent announcing  that share buyback after their quarterly numbers. Take a look up. It's up  100 -- it's at 176.89. But again, up about 9 percent this week.</p><p>Tesla on the other hand, the analysts are saying they've never heard a call  like this one, in fact that Elon Musk saying that he was bored, that they  were killing him with the questions, they call it bizarre and unorthodox as  he interrupted analysts who were asking about profits for the company. The  stock finished down 5.5 percent. </p><p>Twitter right at the closing bell we heard from Twitter that in fact, they  had a glitch that your passwords may have been unmasked and they are urging  everybody to change your password. Stocks finished down 1 percent. </p><p>And CBS just was on the conference call since 4.30 for the last half hour  at least is the conference call the stock did beat the street for the  company. But we were listening for anything else. Viacom, they said they  will not be speaking about Viacom, anything Charlie Rose they have not  acknowledged it, the conference call is still going on, but it was a great  quarter for CBS. Back to you.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Elon Musk conference call was a must-listen, it was wild. </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Wild.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  We're going to have more on that later. Nicole, thank you very  much. </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Thank you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  President Trump praising his relationship with Chinese President  Xi Jinping as the U.S. team arrives for two days in trade talks.</p><p>With me now is Connell McShane in Beijing, China with the latest. Connell? </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, there, John. Mnuchin is getting  set for the second and the final day of his talks with counterparts from  China, and he's brought along a large contingent from United States, a team  of rivals some are calling it. </p><p>In addition to the treasury secretary, and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross  here, the trade rep, Robert Lighthizer, Ambassador Brandstad, economic  advisor Larry Kudlow, and Peter Navarro all are on hand. That group already  holding talks at a place called the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, which is  used often as a meeting place for foreign dignitaries.</p><p>Now, it's not clear how much can really be accomplished. Just over the  course of a couple of days, there is some concern building though, that the  tensions over trade dragged on and nothing has accomplished. A growing  anti-American sentiment will build up here in China that could cause real  problems for American companies. </p><p>There are stories swirling about China cutting back on buying U.S. soybeans  so that would kind be an example of that. We found out about it ourselves  on a visit we took to a local food market here in Beijing, we found out  about worries building about supply disruptions. </p><p>With the help of our translator, I spoke to one of the merchants there  about fish that she was selling here that was brought in from the Boston  area. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Is she worried at all that the supply might go down as that  conflict continues? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'll ask her? </p><p>(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She said, yes, I really have this kind of concern,  and maybe two weeks ago, there were some, yes, there was a period, a short  period that kind of lacked a little bit of the supply. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  So similar comments that you heard there, to what we see many  times from farmers and others back in United States. So with these talks we  have day one in book, as we get set for day two, we're hoping to get some  sort of an update from Secretary Mnuchin or somebody else in the U.S.  delegation before they all fly black on Friday evening.</p><p>With that, from here in Beijing, John, back to you in New York. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Well, thank you, Connell. It's 5 o'clock in the morning in  Beijing right now, so please go to bed. Great work. Thank you.</p><p>Sign of progress, Switzerland UBS is now testing China's promise to allow  foreign owned banks saying today it's seeking control of its joint venture  in China, but upping its stake in the business to 51 percent. It would be  the first financial firm to take advantage of Beijing's decision to relax  investment rules on foreign banks. </p><p>UBS stock ending the day in the green to a little more than $16 a share. </p><p>Joining me now is former deputy assistance to George W. Bush, Brad  Blakeman. Brad, this seems like a step in the right direction. You were  with the Bush administration who last tried steel tariffs. They ended up  most those administration officials admitted that it was a mistake. </p><p>We first started to go after China. We started to go after them with steel  tariffs. Once again, we import about 2.2 percent of steel from China.  That's not the real issue. The real issue is theft of intellectual property  and there's one belt -- one road in this trip where they're loading up  these countries around the world with too much debt that they can handle,  and a need for China to expand their global dominance right now. How do you  deal with the real issues specifically the theft of intellectual property? </p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT:  We got  to hold China's feet to the fire, they know what they are doing, they are a  country of makers, takers and fakers. And it's unacceptable. If they want  to be a first world country, they have to stop acting like a third world  country.</p><p>The president is only asking for them to respect our ownership of things  that we own and not to take it, not to fake it and not to make it. So I  think carrots and sticks are makes trade effective. Right now we're using  sticks. And by sending our big guns over there it's not to start a war,  it's to prevent one from happening. </p><p>When America is at our best, when we stand on principle, when we stood on  principle with China we have an effect with North Korea. We have to do the  same thing for things that are absolutely in our interest to protect jobs  here at home. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Brad, what can really be done? You know, President Xi over  there, you know, he's a forever chairman right now, be he is still is  having a hard time with this made in China 2025. He's got a terrible  problem with a coastal economy, the bifurcation of the rich and the poor  over there. They have 260 percent right now debt to GDP that they just  reported. </p><p>He's in a bind himself, with this own Chinese media saying don't give in  to, quote, \"the bullying tactics of President Trump.\" It seems like he  can't back down. It seems like the Trump guys can't back down. It seems  like what we're getting out of this is probably just window dressing like  we got with some of the tariffs on the South Korean deal that really didn't  meter that much. The quotas did, the tariffs didn't. Do you expect  something substantive? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  To come out of this China meeting.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  I do, but I don't think it's going to come right away. This is - - this is a breaking of the ice. We've sent the best and brightest there,  they know that they speak to the president, President Xi knows that, and  this is going to be a long process, but China has got to change their  behavior. </p><p>We're not going to be extorted anymore and we're not going to be taken  advantage of. It's not in China's interest, it's not in the United States'  interest to have a trade war, and we've got to use every tool in the tool  box to make the Chinese understand that it's going to be business as usual. </p><p>A deal is only as good as it is for both parties if one party thinks they  are getting a raw deal then it's going to be honored in the breach. Stand  on principle, China will find an accommodation, we'll compromise, and we'll  be much better off dealing with China out of strength than out of weakness. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  How can we deal with the amount of strength, what is the main  thing we can do that to deal with theft of intellectual property in what  China is trying to do in the global scenario right now. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  We can punish China directly. We can punish the companies in the  private sector of China. There is a lot that we can do, and we can also use  the clout of our business sector. Apple would love us to start sticking up  for their intellectual property. </p><p>There are other companies that do business with China who have been the  victims of theft. So, yes, we've got to stick with the American companies.  We've got to stand up for them. We've got to protect our property. And we  got to punish China when they act in our -- when they act -- I would say as  criminals, in stealing property that doesn't belong to them. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  China is reportedly ordering a recording ban on the Mnuchin led  trade talks. Isn't this part of the problem?</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I mean, they control the media. It's a dictatorship effectively,  President Xi is there forever. They control this and they have not been  honest with their dealings, same as North Korea. How do you know that we  can get a deal, and they will adhere to this deal? </p><p>Because when you have Chinese companies right now that are listed, they  have listed assets that don't exist. And there is no recourse for investors  that have invested in these Chinese companies, they are able to lie and  have no follow-up. How do you handle that? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, first of all, with regard to their own media, it doesn't  matter what they control their media inside their country, what matters is  what the rest of the world does, that's where the leverage comes in. The  United States should not go alone with their tax on China. There are  thousands of companies that are outside our borders in friendly nations to  us, and allies who should join us in putting the screws to China. </p><p>And guess what? China will back down. They don't want their people to know  what they are doing, that's fine. As long as we know what they are doing,  and we can verify the concessions that they'll make. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Brad, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. That's  going to be very interesting on the next couple of days--</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- on what the Trump administration can get done with the  Chinese officials. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Pleasure. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 million users  a glitch has now exposed. Substantial number of user's password. It's  stocks is now down slightly afterhours. Coming up, we have the details and  the developing story. </p><p>A new report accusing Disney on CBS of knowing about former anchor Charlie  Rose's sexual harassment and doing nothing about them. Coming up, we have  the details.</p><p>Plus, the embattled media company just reporting after the bell. We're  monitoring the CEO's earnings conference call for any response. </p><p>But first, NBC reporting federal investigators wire tapped the phone of  President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen, and at least one of his  phone calls was with White House was intercepted. </p><p>My next guest is an attorney who says that's not legal. Harmeet Dhillon  joins me next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And now this, NBC reporting federal investigators wiretapped the  phone of President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen. And at  least one of his calls with the White House was intercepted. </p><p>According to report, the wiretap was in place leading up to the raids on  Cohen's home and offices last month. And it's unknown if President Trump  was heard in the wiretaps, this according to two anonymous sources. </p><p>Giuliani telling now the Daily Beast he doesn't think Michael Cohen was  wiretapped because it would be highly. </p><p>With me now is attorney Harmeet Dhillon. Harmeet, this appears to me to be  one of the biggest messes I've seen in recent political history. You've got  Mr. Cohen who says that he was not paid back. He stands by that. </p><p>Now you have Mayor Giuliani come out last night and say he was. You have  President Trump saying that he did pay him. President -- or Mayor Giuliani  comes out and says that he did but President Trump didn't know about it and  didn't know about what it was for. </p><p>You also have Mayor Giuliani coming out saying that this wiretap was  illegal because of the attorney-client privilege and also if you are  wiretapping and the president is on the call, you have to notify the White  House.</p><p>Was this illegal if this wiretap did in fact exist? </p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY:  Well, I think it's too early to say whether or  not it is illegal, at least for me, I don't know all the details. But what  we do have is this coming in the setting of evidence that that same people  involved in this DOJ investigation have sought warrants to wiretap people  through the FISA court that were not truthful with the court about all the  circumstances. </p><p>And it's, you know, really the same sort of group of high level FBI and DOJ  individuals who have been involved in getting this particular set of search  warrants. </p><p>And we've already known, for example, that Michael Cohen's e-mails have  been intercepted, so it's not surprising that there is a wiretap order as  well. The real question is, what was the court told in order to get the  subpoena in order to get that wiretap, in order to get that warrant,  rather. And we don't know that.</p><p>But it is true that courts generally require the prosecutors to take great  care and not to intercept attorney-client communication unless there is  already evidence of an attorney-client exception relating to a crime, and  that has not been allege yet in this case.</p><p>So if it is true that the president or somebody close to the president on  his behalf communications with his lawyer had been intercepted that is a  very serious matter. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  NBC News this breaking news has just released a report that  they, in fact, did not listen to the calls. I'm not sure if they said  whether the wiretap was still in existence or not but NBC at least saying  they did not listen to those calls. That's the newest report.</p><p>And it's just a new web that's being built right now. This whole thing is  just crazy to me. Now it seems to me with plausible deniability that the  Trump administration whether true or not has to at least say that they paid  back Mr. Cohen because if not that looks like a campaign finance violation  which is a violation of the federal law. Is that correct? </p><p>DHILLON:  Well, I think Rudy Giuliani already has addressed this issue. And  you know, some people have said maybe he went on Hannity show last night,  and had a slip of the tongue. No, I think Rudy Giuliani knows exactly what  he is doing and that was thought out carefully. You know, obviously when  you are making a payment like this to settle a disputed claim, which I do  as a lawyer on behalf of my clients all the time, you know, you don't want  to be talking about it publicly. And so, that's one point.</p><p>And so now they have to do it because of all of the storm of controversy  around it. But number two, it's entirely plausible that somebody of the net  worth of the president would not know the details of settlements like this.  And I'm sure isn't necessarily the only settlement. He's been affiliated  with Michael Cohen for many years. </p><p>And so, you know, surrounding here for somebody who is very wealthy this  amount of money I know it may seem like a lot to most Americans, but in the  grand scheme of things, people who are this wealthy routinely are shaken  down, routinely are approached with these types of threats and routinely  make the calculation that regardless of the merits of these types of claims  it is better economically and better for their peace of mind and their  family's sake to resolve them privately.</p><p>So, we know that Stormy Daniels is not a person who can be trusted because  she breached that agreement so that has to be put in the context of the  rest of the people--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes. But who can be trusted between Michael Cohen and Rudy  Giuliani, because one of them is lying. Look, I can understand the argument  that President Trump if he did in fact spend $100 million on his campaign  didn't know about a $130,000 payment.</p><p>But if you are lawyer, and you said that you made, and I have no reason to  doubt that, payment on behalf of your client. If you're making a payment of  $130,000 on behalf of your client it may not mean something to a person  with a $100 million who does this regularly when people try to sue him for  crazy things, much less some more egregious things like this. </p><p>But if the porn star that involves the president of United States you know  for a fact whether you did this or not and Michael Cohen has denied it. So  somebody is lying here, it's either Michael Cohen or Rudy Giuliani. I mean,  if you are lawyer here, wouldn't you know you made this payment? </p><p>DHILLON:  No, so first of all, I would reject the characterization that  somebody must be lying, I would probably if I were taken depositions I  would ask quite a follow-up questions. </p><p>And so the way that Rudy Giuliani described this was that there were  payments made in the form of retainers of some amount every month, I think  he said $35,000. So that's different than a check for $130,000 being  written to Michael Cohen to reimburse him but that is inconsistent with  reimbursements having been made. So, again--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I'm talking -- I'm talking about -- wait a minute--</p><p>DHILLON:  -- we're talking with lawyers here.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I'm talking about -- I don't mean to interrupt you, I apologize.  I'm talking about Michael Cohen's payment to Stormy Daniels, that was the  one that Michael Cohen says, he was not reimbursed for, wouldn't Michael  Cohen know this? </p><p>Now the president may not because he is a very wealthy man and there's a  lot of these things with very wealthy people. But wouldn't Michael Cohen  know for sure? Because Michael Cohen says he was not reimbursed, Mayor  Giuliani said he was. There's a problem there. </p><p>DHILLON:  Well, I just addressed that, so I think that, you know, there is  a difference between getting $130,000 check, that is a direct, you know,  exact account and retainer payments, which is how Giuliani describe it. </p><p>So, you know, again, you are dealing with lawyers here, and I'm sure the  language was thought about very carefully before each of these two  gentlemen got into the details. </p><p>And you know, it is always awkward when you are a lawyer being asked to  describe the details of your interaction with your client. Lawyers tried to  be very circumspect about that. And so, you know, I mean, any lawyer would  be put in a very difficult position to answer those questions. </p><p>So, without some further follow up on, I don't think anyone can conclude  that there was a lie told here on by either of them.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I understand, but again, I wasn't talking about the retainer to  Michael Cohen. There was not a retainer paid to a porn star. I can pretty  much guarantee you that. </p><p>I do want to follow up a little bit on the NBC story. The NBC story was  that, now they are walking back claims that they indeed listened to these  phone calls. But to go forward now, you have special counsel Robert Mueller  filing a request for 70 subpoenas in the eastern District of Virginia in  the case of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.</p><p>Where does this go from here? This seems like a never ending investigation.  And one of the reasons it seems never ending is because Mr. Mueller is just  not letting go out, like a good investigator would do, but we don't know if  it's an actual witch-hunt or if there is something here. What do you think  this means this 70 subpoenas? </p><p>DHILLON:  Well, first with the 70 subpoenas, we don't know what it means  because the story just broke a few minutes ago. I've seen the cover page of  the request by the special prosecutor. But generally speaking you have to  get a court to issue a subpoena for a trial appearance. </p><p>And the date indicated is that the prosecutor wants people individuals to  come to court in a date in July to testify at a trial. It also says there  is a reference in the news reports about 35 sets of subpoenas, so it could  be that there is a request for two separate hearing dates, it's not clear  from the papers that have been published so far.</p><p>And with respect to so-called they are walking back the wiretapping claims  who are they? You know, we don't know who they are? We don't know where  these leaks are coming from? And we don't know why the people are saying  that they didn't do what they weren't supposed to do because they've been  caught out in doing it. </p><p>But you know, I would need a lot more information and so should your  viewers before you reach any conclusion about whether the calls were simply  monitored as to a call occurred versus the contents of the call being  listened to and who was on the other side of that call at the White House.  I think these are all questions that we don't know as yet. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right. And that's the problem with this entire mess,  there's so many reports there's so many allegations that you don't know  what is fact, especially because Mr. Mueller himself is not letting any  information out until he wants to.</p><p>Harmeet, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate you coming on  tonight. Coming up-</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DHILLON:  My pleasure. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- North Korea may release its three U.S. hostages at any  moment, President Trump hinting at it this moment. </p><p>My next guest has signed a letter formally nominating Donald Trump for the  Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Republican Tennessee Congressman Marsha  Blackburn joins me next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  But in light of all other positive elements between the U.S. and  North Korea, three Tennessee Republicans now signing a letter formally  nominating President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>My next guest is one of those nominating him. Joining me now, Republican  Tennessee Congressman, Marsha Blackburn. And I've got to say this,  congressman because my mom is watching, you were ask to be called you  congressman, my mother will think I'm disrespectful if I say that instead  of congresswoman. </p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNEESEE:  Your mother will know that you are  using the correct title for the job. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Out of respect I will adhere to all your wish and I'm glad to  know that I'm actually correct with my grammar. Being from Texas--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Grammatically correct.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- being from Texas that doesn't happen very often.</p><p>So I want to ask you about this Nobel Peace Prize nomination.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Look, you've had some conflict with the Nobel Peace Prize. There  was a lot of people that was very polarizing, when President Obama was  nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize after only two months into office, you  had Mahatma Gandhi was never given Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yasser Arafat was given the Nobel Peace Prize. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>It seems like this organization does not have a lot of credibility when it  comes at least to the Nobel Peace Prize not the physics prize but the Nobel  Peace Prize. Why would you think it's so important for the president to be  nominated, and I would assume win this Nobel Peace Prize? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  One of the things that I think is significant is that President  Moon of South Korea is who originally said, he thought that the president  should receive the Nobel Peace Prize. </p><p>If this is a president who because of his accomplishment and actions, and  the fact that he is leading through strength if he is able to bring an end  to the Korean conflict and resolve this and have an irrevocable and  complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, that is quite an  achievement. </p><p>And I think this would be something people around the globe would say the  president's peace through strength is paying a dividend, this is something  that should have been done long ago, getting Kim Jong-un to the negotiating  table so that you are going to resolve this and make certain that it is a  complete process. That's noteworthy. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  A few months ago, if you have said that the denuclearization was  on table in North Korea, I think people would have called you crazy. I  agree with you that if something like happens it's certainly worthy of the  Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I want to go to you a little further about both about Facebook  but also to the story that just broke from NBC News and sources now to the  story of wiretapping of Michael Cohen who is President Trump's attorney. </p><p>Sources are now saying federal investigators were monitoring calls but not  listening to calls, so they're saying he was under surveillance but his  phone calls were not recorded as reported by NBC News. </p><p>Everybody was quick to believe NBC News but now they are retracting it. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  This entire investigation, and all of this mess that is going  on. You have Michael Cohen saying one thing, Mayor Giuliani saying  something completely different. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes. And let me tell you something. When I'm talking to  Tennesseans what they will tell me is that they know there's Democrats and  the liberal press are out to get President Trump. </p><p>They voted for President Trump and he was elected so that he would go drain  the swamp, that is what they want to see happen. And all of this talk and  hubbub doesn't do one thing. To create one more job or put one more  paycheck in the pipeline for Tennesseans and that's what Tennesseans are  wanting to see. </p><p>They wants to see more tax cuts, they want more of an economic recovery,  they like what is happening. They want to see the talks with North Korea  succeed, the actions against the new axis of evil, Russia and Iran and  China, and North Korea. They want to see action there so that we do achieve  some peace. They want to see the military rebuild. </p><p>And these are things that Donald Trump is accomplishing. This is something  they want to see more of. And quite frankly they're not paying a whole lot  of attention to all of these different investigations that are the hype of  the day. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Congressman, switching gears a little bit, you know, Mr.  Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill. And you took him to task over Facebook and  their privacy. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  You proposed a BROWSER Act which you mentioned to Mr. Zuckerberg  which he didn't know about at the time. </p><p>But earlier in 2017, the FCC had the Obama era act which you voted against  was a 100 percent partisan, Republicans voting against it, and what it did  was it allowed third parties of information to be sold to from the  telecoms, you voted against that but then you enacted a bill, the BROWSER  Act, which you're the lead sponsor on which basically put that back in  place but it just added to edge providers, which are Facebook and Google,  and things like that. </p><p>Why would you vote against that bill and make it the Wild West instead of  amending that bill and adding others to it? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, I would take issue with your term the Wild West, because  what had happened with the net neutrality roles entitles to and the rate  classification at the internet all was a part of that. What you need is one  set of rules with one privacy regulator for the entire internet eco system. </p><p>And what big tech wanted to do was to carve themselves out so that they did  not have to abide by any privacy rules. And as we have seen, this is  something that is not fair, and it is not right, and it certainly is a  violation of your privacy rights. </p><p>When you talk about this edge providers, which are your social media  providers, YouTube, Google, Twitter, there is a problem with them and their  data mining policies, they go in, they snoop around your post, they view  your videos, then they coalesce and sell the information from your data,  the information from your data, to those that are wanting to advertise to  you, that's why you have pop ups and that's why you have so much spam.</p><p>And this is something that we need one set of privacy rules that stem for  the BROWSER Act. Facebook and the other social media outlets need to get  their act together on protecting people's privacy. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Congressman, I don't mean to cut you off, I only have few  seconds left, but when you put a picture on Facebook -- and I'm sorry, we  got only 30 seconds left. Congressman, I apologize to you. Thank you very  much for your time, and good luck in the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Absolutely, any time. Thank you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- BROWSER Act.</p><p>CBS under fire. A new report from the Washington Post accusing the media  company of being well-aware of former anchor Charlie Rose's harassment  incidents as far back as 1986. </p><p>CBS is reporting an earning beat after the bell. We're monitoring the CEO's  earnings conference call for any response. </p><p>The Federalist Britt McHenry isn't surprised; she is here to react after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  NBC issuing this update that a story on the feds wiretapping  Trump attorney, Michael Cohen. Now, they're saying he was surveilled and  that phone calls were not recorded. </p><p>NBC issuing this statement, editor's note today, \"Earlier today, NBC News  reported that there was a wiretap on the phones of Michael Cohen. President  Trump's long-time personal attorney citing two separate sources with  knowledge of the legal proceeding involving Cohen. But three senior U.S.  officials now dispute that. Saying that the monitoring of Cohen's phones  were limited to a log of calls, known as a pin register, not a wiretap  where investigators can actually listen to calls.\" </p><p>Stay tuned, I'm sure there will be another report soon saying that there  were calls that were listened to or not listened to and nobody listened to.  I mean, this is nuts. It's accusation thirsty here, we are in New York  City. </p><p>A new report from the Washington Post accused the CBS and there were  allegations of knowing about Charlie Rose's harassment incidents as far  back as 1986. And as recently as April of last year, and the company's  managers doing nothing about it. </p><p>This, as an additional 27 men -- women say Rose sexually harassed them.  Charlie Rose, on the other hand, denouncing the Washington Post news story,  telling the newspaper, quote, \"Your story is unfair and inaccurate.\"</p><p>CBS stock shares in the green after hours following an earnings beat. </p><p>Joining me now, Britt McHenry with The Federalist. Britt, the world has  gone crazy. It's accusation thirsty. Before we get to Charlie Rose what do  you make of this NBC? You've got Michael Cohen saying one thing, Mayor Rudy  Giuliani saying another. </p><p>They're saying calls were listened to, calls were surveilled, calls were  not listened to. This world is gone nuts. What do you make of this NBC  fiasco? </p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR, THE FEDERALIST:  Well, what we're witnessing is  a discrediting of the media, and no one is doing that to the media other  than themselves. This is why people are losing faith in what they should be  going to know about what's going on in the world. </p><p>The phrase fake news can easily be applied when several media outlets are  in such a rush to denounce President Trump that they're making egregious  errors. A pin register is different from a wiretap listening to every  single word being made on a phone call. It's a log as you mentioned. </p><p>And to make that kind of a report, and then just say, sorry, we didn't  really mean that. That is what is going to lose the faith of your viewers  of your readers, and honestly it's only going to help the president in his  2020 run.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Britt, I don't mean to cut you off, but the difference between a  pin register and a wiretap, that's not a mistake and conflating the two are  confusing the two, right? </p><p>MCHENRY:  They are two separate things. To rush to judgment, as we saw with  ABC News back in December, with CNN when they reported on Donald Trump, Jr.  and WikiLeaks they had the completely wrong dates. These aren't little  errors of mispronunciation of a word here and there, these are conflating  facts and it's irresponsible journalism, and they need to do more to the  public in my opinion than just issue a press release apologizing. They need  to really take action on improving their work. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Wikipedia is not 100 percent correct use as much as school kids  who don't want to read encyclopedias, they do all their homework on  Wikipedia.</p><p>Now to Charlie -- I want to go back to Charlie Rose, CBS News saying it had  no human resources complaints about Mr. Rose. Also saying in a statement,  quote, \"Since we terminated Charlie Rose we were to strengthen existing  systems to ensure a safe environment where everyone can do their best work.  Some of the actions we have taken have been reported publicly, some have  not. We offer employees discretion and fairness, and we take swift action  when we learn of unacceptable behavior.\" Swift action?</p><p>MCHENRY:  Swift action. Some of these allegations dated back to 1986 the  year that I was born, 31 years ago. Now granted, there was a different  culture, hopefully everything we've witnessed in past year will improve the  workplace culture in media. </p><p>But to Charlie Rose was going after the Washington Post. They had 107 women  that they spoke to, you mean to tell you 107 records of firsthand accounts  other things that they've heard that that means nothing? You know, 14 women  at CBS, I believe. There is something there. CBS finally handled it, but it  was too late, and I think it's wrong to say we swiftly handled this when  you could go back 31 years that there were these allegations. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Britt, thank you for making me feel very old right now. </p><p>MCHENRY:  Hey, my birthday is coming up, so I'm getting old too. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  No, you are not. And I want to get to you about the ESPN losses.</p><p>MCHENRY:  Yes. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  But news is so crazy that we don't have much time. Thank you  very much, Brit, for your time.</p><p>MCHENRY:  Thank you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 users a glitch  has now exposed a substantial number of user's passwords. We have the  details. </p><p>But first, Marco Rubio doing a 180, recently criticizing Trump's tax cuts,  now walking back his comments. We have them.</p><p>My next guest is a Florida small business owner who recently sincerely  thanked President Trump for these tax cuts. Irina Vilarino speaks out after  this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio doing a 180, recently  criticizing Trump's tax cut, now he is walking back his comments. Saying  quote, \"Overall, the Republican tax cut has been good for Americans that is  why I voted for it but it could have been even better for American workers  and their families.\"</p><p>Rubio originally blasting the tax law, saying that there is no evidence  whatsoever that money from corporation has been massively poured back into  the American worker. </p><p>My next guest is a Cuban-American small business owner who recently  sincerely thanked President Trump for these tax cuts. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>IRINA VILARINO, CUBAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS OWNER:  Coming from a country that  promise everything and only delivered misery, I knew that eight years of  promoting appeasement, apologizes and entitlement was taking us down a path  of no return. </p><p>Government helps small businesses by letting us do our job and getting out  of the way by unleashing the American spirit. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the politicians are  being beaten today.</p><p>VILARINO:  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Irina, welcome to the show. Is Rubio right to change his stance?  Are these tax cuts -- you run a small business in Miami, a restaurant, have  they affected you? </p><p>VILARINO:  Certainly they have. They have affected us in many ways. And to  err is human. And I think that once people realize that prove is in the  pudding and the results are coming in they are right to understand and  correct their mistakes, I think that that's wise. </p><p>To continue saying that something is not working when clearly it is, well,  I wouldn't think that's too smart of anybody. So I think that it's wise for  Senator Rubio to correct his stance on the tax cuts and to join in and  participate in what we're seeing in the economy right now. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Are you an incorporated company? So the corporate tax cut that  affected you the most? Or are you an LLC so it was a personal tax cut that  affected you the most? </p><p>VILARINO:  We have both, corporate and LLC's.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And that percentage gain that you had that if it's a corporate  tax cut, it can go from something around 35 to 21 percent, what have you  done with that money? Have you hired more people, have you invested in your  restaurant, have you done more marketing, what have you done with that  money? </p><p>VILARINO:  Well, we're definitely investing in our restaurant, but we've  also increased our hourly wage for our current employees, and in order to  obtain new employees we have to increase our hourly wage because there's a  huge demand in labor market right now. So in order to stay competitive and  hire good people you have to increase your salaries which is what we've  seen.</p><p>We've seen an approximate increase of about 20 percent in many cases in a  very short time. And so, we're seeing that this has caused a demand in the  labor market in order to retain our employees and to gain new ones we had  to compete with for those employees. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  In the political crazy world that we're in right now, everybody  is trying to gain an edge. And so you have people who voted against tax cut  saying it didn't had any effect, you have people that voted for it that  said it did. </p><p>Senator Rubio just changed what he said I guess to clarify or correct his  quote. What would you say to these people who say that the tax cut have no  effects, and the people like Ms. Pelosi who said these are just crumbs that  these bonuses that were given out. What would you say to these people who  say tax cuts had no effect? </p><p>VILARINO:  I would say that they are out of touch with every day Americans  with lower level employees that rely on paycheck to paycheck. And that they  should really go out and talk to people. </p><p>And we're not, you know, common Americans we're not worried about the  Russian collusion story. We had so much of that. We're really interested --  maybe if they would have left, you know, left it to the side and focus on  what the president wants to do, which is better our economy, things would  be even better than they are right now.</p><p>They've already gone much better but they could be -- they could even be  even better. So imagine that. </p><p>So, I was just talking to customers today where they were telling me they  own a housing cabinet business. And in this year alone their sales have  increased $3 million in four months. That's -- so that's significant. I  don't that sounds like bread crumbs. </p><p>For these people to go out and hire more people because they have more  demands for their products is significant for our economy. So I think that  Mrs. Pelosi is out of touch, and she would do a great justice to the  American people if she would really stop hijacking every initiative the  president has. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Irina, thank you for coming on the show and good luck to your  restaurant. I look forward to visiting your restaurant when I'm down in  Miami. </p><p>VILARINO:  Absolutely. We look forward to having you. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Social media company Twitter just warning its 330 million users  a glitch has now exposed a substantial number of user's passwords. Its  stock is now down slightly afterhours. Coming up, we have the details. </p><p>Twitter support tweeting out, quote, \"We recently found a bug that stored  password unmasked in an internal log. We fixed the bug and have no  indication of a breach or a misuse by anyone. As a precaution, consider  changing your password on all services where you've used this password  before.\" </p><p>No kidding, Twitter stock down only slightly afterhours. </p><p>But what's great about this is old bulls and bears buddy, the reasons I do  TV. Jonas Max Ferris of Maxfund.com editor and co-founder, and Kadina Group  president Gary B. Smith. </p><p>Age before beauty, so I'm going to start with you, Gary B. So, Gary, look,  these tech stocks, they have been up 28 percent, we're talking about  Facebook, Amazon, Google, they are absolutely on fire. Does this data  breach, does anything derail this tech landslide going on right now? </p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP:  It does not, John, and here is the  reason why. First of all, I just -- as a matter of fact just before we went  on air I tried to sign on to Twitter, and I got that, you know, the whole  gobbledygook, this and that. And you know what I did? I did like a millions  of other Twitter users. I said skip and move on.</p><p>My password is in 27 different locations, I'm sure it's the same password  throughout except for some exceptions. And people are just going to say,  this happened again. I mean, if this happens you know, almost every day it  seems. Maybe it was target at one time, there's been these other sites. </p><p>I think this is a big nothing. I think tech is where it's at. I mean, you  got robotics, you got self-driving cars, you got artificial intelligence,  we've moved away from an industrial society, we're now a tech society, that  is still where I put my money. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And about what I said there with beauty before age because I  want to be Gary B when I grow up because he is a scratch golfer, it's just  everything you want to be in life.</p><p>Jonas, the tech onslaught that's going on right now, you have bifurcated  markets, the tech stocks are on fire, the rest of the market not so much.  Does this continue? </p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, MAXFUNDS.COM EDITOR:  I don't think it does continue. And  this is just the very -- the Twitter is not the hottest stock in the world.  And I will say, first of all, everyone is not reading 27-page terms of  service that always comes it keeps throwing you but they are suspicious of  them now more than they ever have been. </p><p>And I think people are getting less happy about the amount of information  these companies have. It's not only their -- I mean, it's their fault that  they log the passwords to appear as text somewhere on their own servers. It  wasn't hacked they don't think.</p><p>I do think there is too much information given to these companies, people  are questioning the business model of collecting more and more and more  information on you, just to put ads between you and content, often content  that you created and your friends created. So, I think the boom is open,  the growth era for these stocks were a little ahead of ourselves. So, I  would say focus more on boring value stocks for little while and so they  can--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Nothing boring about making money. Gary B and Jonas, nothing  boring about you too, guys. Thank you very much both of you. It's the  highlight of my week. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Big day tomorrow, jobs day. Our own Maria Bartiromo will break  down the numbers with expert analysis. It all starts at 8.30 a.m. Eastern  Time on Mornings with Maria right here on Fox Business. </p><p>Thank you for watching. Charles Payne, my pal is here now with Making  Money. Charles, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

You seen what's happening.  I have to tell you far beyond our  expectations we've made a tremendous amount of progress in a very short  period of time, when you look at what has gone on with employment, look at  what's gone on with the stock market.

Take a look.   Dow industrials expected to be up better then 100 points.  S&amp;P 500 and the  Nasdaq also in positive territory.  </p><p>Check the European indices this Wednesday morning, and we see a weakness on  yields of that selloff yesterday from the highs.

What you need to know  this morning coming up.  One thing is for sure.  Not as bad as it is in  Russia.  The shocking temperatures that are causing eyelashes to freeze.   Plus, is it the end of General Electric as we know it?  The major  challenges that could lead to the breakup of this American staple?  Big  story there, although stories coming up this morning.</p><p>Joining me to talk all about it, Bold founder, Carrie Sheffield is here.</p><p>Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly and beyond sport, global ambassador  Fox News contributor, John Layfield.  Great to see you.  On Earl there</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you, very interesting  stuff with GE, this 100-year-old company is actually getting a chance for a  reset, or is this company going to break up?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If you're a long-term GE shareholder, this is a sad day.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I did just buy it recently for $18 thinking there is value there  at the bottom.  I hope it's not a falling night.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your thinking maybe unlocks shareholder value.  Good  morning to you, Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  The problem there is GE was actually was to  have thrown in the kitchen sink, when they actually did the restructuring  and they found these more problems.  $6 billion worth of problems, when  they are doing 20 billion of asset sales, that is pretty significant.   There is more to come with GE, if they could not find this there is a lot  more under the surface.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are on the other side of the trade.</p><p>KELLY:  So was the market.  Look at the reaction yesterday.  </p><p>CARRIE SHEFFIELD:  I hope you're wrong.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There is a lot to talk about in business as well as politics.   Did everybody catch the press conference yesterday about the president's  health?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  30 out of 30.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN HOST:  Stable genius.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  while I am watching it, I was just astounded at the stupidity  of the questions.  I mean come dentures?  </p><p>KELLY:  The last president was a smoker and a drinker.  This one isn't bad  at all.  </p><p>CARRIE SHEFFIELD, FOUNDER, BOLD:  He's got to lose 15 pounds and do more  exercise.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was embarrassed by the questions from the media.  I really  was.  Coming up this morning White House director of legislative affairs  Mark Short it is with us this morning.</p><p>Former CKE Restaurant CEO and America First Policy Advisor, Andy Puzder is  here.</p><p>Former Trump campaign manager and Avenue Strategies partner, Corey  Lewandowski joins with us.  Plus, Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  </p><p>And Dr.  Mike, Dr.  Mikhail Varshavski, is here, aka in dr.  Mike.  You  don't want to miss a moment of it.  Do stay with us.  </p><p>We kick it off with this top story.  Markets in record territory again.   The DOW topping 26,000.  President Trump weighed in on the record highs  from Washington.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) in</p><p>TRUMP:  The stock market is way up again today setting the record literally  all the time.  I'm telling you we have a long way to go.  And had the other  side gotten in, the market would have gone down 50 percent from where it  was.  50 percent from where it was.  Remember that.  It was stagnant, and  it was going down.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a big number.  50 percent, Kevin Kelly.  I do think we are  seeing this kind of success because of the president's policy.  </p><p>KELLY:  It totally is because of the policy.  The only reason the economy  can do well is if monetary policy and fiscal policies are working to the  benefit of the people and that is what is happening.  Every Federal Reserve  governor begging for fiscal policies.  The economy was hampered by  oppressive rules and regulations from are doing m an alphabet soup of  agencies including Obamacare, you name it and all of a sudden, a new  administration comes in enacts fiscal policies and Federal Reserve  governors are over the moon.  </p><p>Great, we can raise three times next year, maybe even more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this potential government shut down one of the threats to  the market rally the clock is ticking on Capitol Hill just days to avert a  government shutdown set for Friday?  House leaders propose a short-term  funding bill that would fund this government and for four more weeks while  allowing more time for stalled negotiations over what to do on the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals, the DACA program?  Is this the kind of event  should we see a government shutdown the takes this market down, John?</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think it will definitely take it down, it will take down the  Republican Party.  There is no doubt about that.  Seven government shut  downs since the budget and appropriation acts of 1976, all have been  ideological differences between the Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>In no case has there been one party controlled on both sides of congress  and the White House in a government shutdown.  This is suicide for the  Republican party.  For the market yes, I think it goes down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have to push back on that.  Yesterday I was watching the  show.  I had a cold.  I still have a little bit and I heard Dagen say look  back at all of the government shutdowns that we have seen, you know what,  the world goes on.  And not only that, but I feel like people are  increasingly upset with the obstructionism out there.  I think they will  blame the Democrats.  </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  I think they will because of with got Democrats like Heidi  Heitkamp, Joe Manchin.  The nine Democratic senators that were elected in  states that Trump won.  Including five where he won by double digits.</p><p>The obstructionism by the part of Democrats because the Republicans are  wanting to make a deal, they don't want to shut down the government this is  the insistence by the Democrats to say we need a clean DACA bill, though  which makes no sense because that's what we've been trying to do.  This is  why the Republican establishment lost because they were not willing to be  comprehensive and focus on the border first and that's what people are fed  up.  That's why you see a disconnect, I think you see almost a  sequestration between let Congress be the juvenile children, and we will be  the adults in the market.  </p><p>KELLY:  Real quick on this, I don't think the market does go down and I  don't think it will have any impact on it, in one of the reasons why only  in government does the government shutdown, not shutdown.  The government  won't shutdown, the markets are not worried about it, I think you're also  going to see Democrats seeing through to the 30th which is the state of the  union.  They will not want to shut down the government until they see what  the president actually lays out because they have elections in 2018.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to shut down the government but Kevin at the end of the  day the other side we want a government shutdown.  The Democrats.  They  would like that.  </p><p>KELLY:  Certain Democrats don't want to do their because they are running  for reelection in 2018, and they want to show they are actually working  with this administration to benefit constituents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who is that?  You are so positive.  I mean who, which Democrat?   Do you have a name?  And who is that that is working with Republicans?</p><p>KELLY:  So here is how it plays out in here is how the market is viewing  it.  They are viewing that Democrats will come along when they need to and  work with Republicans, state tax reform, whatever they need to do.   Especially there is no incentive for Democrats to work with Republicans  because they were shooting themselves in the foot repeatedly time after  time last year.  Look at health care.  It blew up in their faces.  No one  is pushing back on Democrats, especially constituents.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is why think that if they don't want to come to the table,  into the proper funding for the border wall and make sure that the military  is funded properly, I would say the Republicans will say fine, the  government shuts down.  Which is why I think people blamed the Dems.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I just completely disagree, I see it otherwise.  We are looking  at the tallest Lilliputian here, so it is sort of like neither party is  very good.  OK.  But the Republicans are in charge of everything right now.   This is never happened in the history of our country that someone has shut  down, when one party controls everything.  I think the Republicans will get  the blame.  But now when you understand your dealing with the least worse  in this case, so who is going to come out the worst on this?  Because both  parties are trying to have a 13 percent approval rating which is less than  people who believe in alien abductions.  So, it is within the crazy factor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, the Homeland Security Secretary says President Trump  used tough language on immigration during a White House meeting last week  though she denied hearing a particular vulgarity during testimony that  turned testy before the senate judiciary committee yesterday.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The president Trump used this word, or a substantially  similar word to describe certain countries.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY, UNITED STATES:  I did not  hear that word used, no, sir.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is not a question, anything similar to that  described in certain countries?</p><p>NIELSEN:  The conversation was very impassioned.  I don't dispute that the  president was using tough language, others in the room were also using  tough language.</p><p>REP:  CORY BOOKER, (D) NEW JERSEY:  When Dick Durbin called me, I had tears  of rage when I heard about his experience in that meeting.  For you not to  feel that hurt and that pain and to dismiss some of the questions of my  colleagues, saying I have already answered that line of questions, with  tens of millions of Americans are hurting right now because of what they're  worried about what happened in the White House.  That's unacceptable to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does Corey Booker not think that everyone knows that was just a  performance because he wants to run for president?  The way he spoke with  the secretary of homeland security to me was unacceptable.  As a  professional women, were you as outraged as I was?  </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  With all that man-splaning?  As the feminists would say.  It  was incredibly condescending.  And you are absolutely right.  This is his  platform where he wants to lead the mantle of the resistance against Trump.</p><p>I got news for the Democrats.  If you want to actually do something  different, i.e., win in 2018 and 2020, you have to do something different.   Because they tried this in 2016, they tried to be racially divisive, try to  divide us on whatever gender, however you want to slice and dice it, the  identity politics.  The left is not learning any different here.</p><p>And in terms of immigration, they want to focus on language and instead of  policy.  What you're doing matters a lot more and what the president said  in terms of immigration based on substance and merit.  It is what we should  be focusing on.  The fact of the matter is the National Academy of Sciences  has reported a 58 percent of immigrants are on some form of public welfare.  </p><p>Basically, what's happening is middle-class Americans are taking their  paychecks and subsidizing immigrants taking more than they are putting into  the system.  That's reality and however you want to slice it, politics is  about the allocation of resources.  It is about hard choices.  And Cory  Booker is just being emotional.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, he's putting on a show because he wants to run for  president.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think you probably is.  I certainly can't assign motives to  Mr. Booker.  But when you talk about nomenclature you're exactly right.  It  doesn't compare to deeds.</p><p>In the slums of Cape Town, that huge shantytown just outside of Cape Town,  last month I was in some soccer magic bus down the slums of Mumbai, I am  going to Haiti in a couple of months to visit the same sports programs  there.  </p><p>People are not doing anything to help these places.  I don't agree with  this term being used of that indeed was used, it is just alleged right now.   Not taking away from the fact that we have places like this, the ninth ward  down in New Orleans.  We found out it was just as bad as Haiti after  Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>We have places in our own country in our Third World countries inside our  country.  We are not doing anything about these inner cities.  We argue  over what we call them.  I think this is a total distraction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why does anybody sitting on that panel there think that is a  license to rip into somebody?  I'm talking about the way Cory Booker spoke  to the homeland security secretary.  I thought it was disgusting.  </p><p>KELLY:  Because it was a public hearing.  You see the difference between  how they act in their private hearings were nothing gets out, nothing  actually gets done.  In public hearings really use it as a platform for  themselves.</p><p>That's all it was whether it was Dick Durbin doubling down or Corey Booker  putting on this sideshow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  We will keep talking about.  Will take a break and  when we come back, police in Baltimore on the hunt for two suspects after  brazen shoot at a 7 Eleven overnight.  Details on the robbery that led to  the gunfire.</p><p>Then bitcoin selloff this morning, the crypto currency plunging as  governments move to regulate.  Is the meteoric rise over?  Back in a  moment.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two suspects on the run after an exchange of gunfire with  Baltimore police.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Good morning.  This shootout happening at a  7 Eleven in downtown Baltimore.  The pair were trying to rob a store when  police showed up and a gun battle ensued.  The two suspects shooting at  police were able to get away when officers took cover to protect  themselves.  Shots ringing out with the robber and officers just feet apart  from each other.  Baltimore police say it's an absolute blessing that an  officer was not shot in this exchange.  </p><p>Another winter storm warning hitting parts of the northeast all the way  south to the gulf coast.  Snow, sleet, freezing rain.  Parts of Texas are  dealing with frozen rain.  Forecaster warning about dangerous travel  conditions throughout the entire swath of the storm.  Hundreds of flights  already canceled across the United States.  </p><p>And the thermometer has been plunging in Russia down to minus 62 degrees.   So cold there it is freezing people's eyelashes and luckily for us they are  taking pictures of their frozen eyelashes.  Beautiful but yes more than 60  degrees to the negative.</p><p>General Electric considering breaking itself apart, for problems with the  GE Capital Unit prompted a reevaluation of the strategy.  The company would  book a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its insurance  operations.  They need to set aside 15 billion over seven years to bolster  insurance results.  GE shares down about 40 percent from a year ago.  Big  story, Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exciting story.  The said one was the most valuable company of  any company.  You bought the stock recently because you see value, you're  saying absolutely you are not touching it right now.</p><p>KELLY:  just to get back on that point.  One of the reasons why I want to  touch it is because they expect to command multiple evaluation of their  peers, like Honeywell and other companies that are operating efficiently  but with better management.  Why would they deserve that?</p><p>Their breakup value, sum of the parts is less than their share price right  now.  So, this is very optimistic where they are trading.  They have  ongoing concerns when it comes to management.  They just announced somebody  new in Europe.  </p><p>This whole thing where there is smoke there is fire, and they were supposed  to get rid of it a couple weeks ago and didn't work out.  And here we are  today.</p><p>M:  Let me just point out to Bob Nardelli was a regular on this program  called it.  He said you know what at some point this company may there will  consider breaking up.  He said on WALL STREET WEEK, a couple weeks ago we  will bring the soundbite later on.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  We have healthcare to windmills, you have a company that is  incredibly diverse, they used to say how the economy goes GE goes, I think  now you are not seeing that anymore.  This is just the biggest shakeup  since you had JP Morgan take the company from Thomas Edison.  I think they  have a chance for a reset.  I think Flannery has a chance to throw  everything out.  And I think that is what he is doing right now.  You can  get all the bad news front loaded in the next couple weeks.  </p><p>KELLY:  Charlie Gasparino said in November there might be a breakup, too.  </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  I just wonder what role policy and taxes, because they moved to  Boston, but before that they were in Connecticut were they were battling  this enormous tax burden, regulatory burden.  If they had been in a  different state, what might be different?   </p><p>M:  They moved to Massachusetts because of that, you are right.  You also  have to look at leadership.  Jeff Immelt took over the week of September 11  by the way, 2001, and that was a hardship for sure.  But the decisions that  he made obviously were bad decisions.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  You have $31 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.  You have  $83 billion in cash and cash overseas that completely changes the balance  sheet with this repatriation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will take a break when we come back.  All eyes on  earnings.  Bank of America, Goldman Sachs reported before the bell this  morning.  How markets react after see sawing yesterday.  As you see both  stocks are trading up.</p><p>Meanwhile, giant fireball lighting up the night sky it can be seen from six  states.  Scientists explain that a meteor was the reason for the  extraordinary experience.  Got to see this.  Back in a minute.     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures indicating another rally.  This market  will not quit.  Dow industrials up 133 points right now.  Nasdaq expected  to be up about 26.  Futures indicating a big rally.  Markets of course  extending the record run after the Dow briefly crossed 26,000 yesterday for  the first time ever.  The shortest 1000-point move ever.  From 25-26000.   Big banks reporting earnings continuing the last couple days.  We await  numbers this morning from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.  </p><p>Want to bring in capitalistpig.com founder, Fox News contributor Jonathan  Hoenig.  Good to see you.  Op-ed in the journal today.  Stocks are headed  for a fall.  That is from Marty Feldstein what is your take on this?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  We are still in a bull market.  New  highs yesterday so many big stocks are of new highs.  This is the basic  reality of the markets that trends tend to persist.  I first fell in love  with you many years ago during the 90s bull market in you remember up to  five, six years, it went up 100 percent in 1999.  </p><p>I do think there are indicators that the pendulum has swung from greed,  from fear all the way to greed, mostly the average investor is at the  highest-level stock exposure since 2000.  We herd you send stocks right  now.</p><p>It's a good time to argue for lower than normal exposure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a real moment in time of the 90s.  Thank you for that  by the way.  Then, pushing stocks because they have a.com at the end of it,  today we are seeing buying the stocks because the fundamentals.  The real  story.  Earnings growth 23 percent in 2018 because of this tax plan.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, the difference was that back then it was about eyeballs.  How  many eyeballs are you getting now.  Now it's about revenue earnings and you  are saying that come through.  It's fascinating if you think about  previously the past few years, we were in an earnings recession that's the  biggest issue we had and now companies are actually doing exceptionally  well, operating margins are at their highest levels.  They are hiring.  We  see the tailwind of the monetary policy finally pulled through.  Now we  have fiscal policy taken hold and the global growth story that is actually  lending credence to all large multinational corporations.  </p><p>HOENIG:  Can I just kind of that really quickly.  I think this time it  isn't different.  Back then it was .com.  Now it's block chain.  Add block  chain to your name, this companies me 200 times in public trading.  He  talked about stocks, they are not publicly traded.  All the block chain  companies, all the press releases.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, so we are not in the S&amp;P 500, so you look at your exposure,  the long block chains are not indicative of the nature of today's markets.  </p><p>HOENIG:  But it's not pushing the stock market higher, the stock market if  you look at the Dow Jones industrial average.  </p><p>KELLY:  The 30 largest companies, none of them are block chain companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  IBM talking about.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, they have exposure to the block chain hyper ledger, but it is  not driving the revenues.  Just using it and deploying it.  Using  technology to foster.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Block chain or bitcoin, could it be bitcoin that is the thing  that is the thing that takes this market down.  Look what happened  yesterday.  Plunge more than 25 percent at one point yesterday.</p><p>This is no surprise to a lot of people out there.  It is now sitting as you  can see out 10,000.  Legendary investor T.  Boone Pickens slammed the  crypto craze, the Twitter user asked for his thoughts on the crypto  currency, and he said at 89 years old, anything with the word crypt in it,  it is a real turnoff for me.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  I love it, the thing is, as far as whether it will be a drag on  the market, the fact that we have a spike in stocks meanwhile  simultaneously the drop in the crypto currency.  Thank God right now, it  seems like it's isolated and it will not have a larger impact like you said  on fundamentals.  I don't think bitcoin is baked into the fundamentals  about this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But sometimes when you lose money in one area you sell whatever  you can sell.  And so sometimes that triggers the selloff because you try  to make up your gains in another area and, so you sell what you can sell.</p><p>HOENIG:  The great recession started with a problem in subprime and now was  the nature of the beast.  You can make the argument that bitcoin is the  canary in the coal mine.  The liquidity indicator.  They would've never  existed in 2008 and 2009.  It has taken a big ball market.  Ultimately have  another leg up.  People are very bearish on on bitcoin right now.  But that is the canary in the coal mine, it will  leave the rest of risk assets down.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  But it is not integrated the way subprime mortgages were.  On  these other layers on top of it.  You have systemic risk but --</p><p>LAYFIELD:  One thing integrated in the market his inflation.  You look at a  copper it is up 31 percent.  I know you follow commodities.  Oil is at $65.   China imported deflation a long time.  Now looks like they are exporting  inflation.  Is that your biggest worry right now?</p><p>HOENIG:  I will spare you my opinions and give you my position.  The  platinum metals you mentioned copper, but now is a good time to have  platinum, Palladium, rhodium. I think those are good place right now, because you want to take things  that are counter to the S&amp;P 500.  You want to find alternative assets that  are doing well.  So, I think those are once look at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for stopping by.  Really good to see you.  </p><p>More hacking by North Korea.  The United States accusing the regime of  crypto currency tax and South Korea, similar to the massive cyber attack on  Sony pictures.  A surge of excitement as power returns to one Puerto Rico  school, the heartwarming video, the reality and struggles that the island  still faces this morning.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, January  17th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  The rising  North Korea threat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning a military  option could be on the table if Kim Jong-un does not choose negotiations.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  With respect to whether Americans  should be concerned about a war with North Korea, I think it's  -- we all  need to be very sober and clear eyed that that threat is growing and if  North Korea is not -- does not choose the pathway of engagement,  discussion, negotiation, then they themselves will trigger an option.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on that and new concerns this morning over the regime's  ties to cyber attacks on crypto currency.  Earnings season in focus on Wall  Street.  Several big banks reporting ahead of the open this morning,  including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, we will bring you the numbers  as soon as they hit the tape, and check those stocks.  </p><p>Markets this morning, looking good, futures pointing to another rally at  the start of trading this morning, we are now at the highs of the morning  with the Dow industrials up 145 points, the NASDAQ up 28 points.  We're  looking a strength this morning, for the S&amp;P 500, after a wild session on  Wall Street yesterday.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied all the  way up to 26,000 cracking yet another new milestone.  But then, toward the  end of the day, erase the games as the session wore on.  </p><p>We saw some real volatility.  Checking the overseas action this morning, as  you see, the markets are looking lower.  And the FT 100 is down 14 points,  the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index also weaker, on the heels of that, we  close for Wall Street yesterday.  In Asia overnight, stocks were mixed,  Shanghai composite up a quarter of a percent, as well as the Hang Seng in  Hong Kong.</p><p>Celgene, eyeing a second deal in as many weeks.  The Wall Street Journal  this morning reporting the biotech company is in talks to acquire Juno  Therapeutics.  The stock is soaring on the news.  Check it out.  Juno  Therapeutics up, 50 percent in the pre-market this morning.  A major  milestone for one school on Puerto Rico, kids erupting in cheers as the  power comes back on after three months of no power, the heart-warming  video, coming up.</p><p>Plus, lighting up the night, a meteor shooting across the sky, so powerful  it triggered a small earthquake.  We will bring it to you, coming up.  But  first, this top story this half an hour, crypto hacked, a U.S. cyber  security firm has identified a North Korean hacking outfit as the hackers  behind the latest crypto currency attacks in South Korea.  This is the same  group responsible for the Sony hacks at the end of last year.  Joining us  right now is Endgame CEO, Nate Fick, Nate, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for weighing in this morning.  </p><p>NATE FICK, CEO OF ENDGAME:  Hi, Maria, good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how vulnerable is this crypto currency to hack?</p><p>FICK:  Look, we live in a world that's increasingly digitally connected.   We're connecting a billion things to the internet every quarter, including  increasingly now, currencies and cars and other things that we hadn't  previously thought of as digital.  So, there's exposure there, obviously.   And when you talk about war with a place like North Korea and the United  States, you're talking about a potential war between a strong country and a  weak country.  And the cyber capabilities can we weapons for the weak.   They're cheap and easy to develop.</p><p>KELLY:  Here's my biggest issue, it's Kevin Kelly, I see all these things  coming out in North Korea and I'm like, how is the regime like this able to  get due anything possible, such as come up with the WannaCry, such as  develop nuclear weapons.  And the only thing coming in to my head is that  they're enabled by China.  </p><p>I see, you know, North Korea as a proxy for China to develop things, figure  out how they can actually come up with the tax, they can place blame.  You  know, what is your take on that that North Korea's being enabled by China,  especially in the cyber security realm because we've seen these attacks  happen, but the only way North Korea gets internet is through China.</p><p>FICK:  Well, look, one of the realities of cyber security is that defense  is really hard, but attacking is pretty easy.  And think about the attacks,  even here on the United States that have been launched by, you know, a kid  and his parents' basement.  </p><p>So, the reality is that the barriers to entry to this, kind of, high-end  cyber capability are falling.  And it's likely that North Korea's getting  outside help.  But, it's also not beyond the realm of possibility that a  handful of people relatively well-equipped can do these themselves.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Nate, this is John Layfield, this appears to be their only  option, right?  I mean, they don't have the gas, little gasoline to invade  South Korea.  They don't have any money.  So their only option out there is  to either be a cyber-terrorist or develop nuclear weapons.  Isn't that  right?  This is a matter just of self-survival.</p><p>FICK:  There's a great book about the Vietnam War, called The War of the  Flea, that makes this point.  That in asymmetrical conflicts, conflicts  between the strong and the weak.  These are the sorts of things the weak  adversary does.  Cyber security, cyber capabilities are cheap and easy to  develop, so yes, I agree with you.  You go to the low end of the spectrum  and develop these kinds of capabilities, or you go to the high-end of the  spectrum, the nuclear end, to try to deter the United States.</p><p>CARRIE SHEFFIELD, FOUNDER, BOLD GLOBAL MEDIA:  Well, and this is Carrie  Sheffield, so, there was elections in South Korea last year and word on the  street is that the new leader they have there, he is not as pro-western as  some of his predecessors.  </p><p>What's your assessment of that?  There's even talk that he wants to reopen  the case on industrial conflicts, which by my mind, would allow millions of  dollars to flow into North Korea, to the point we said earlier, that would  allow the North Koreans to have access to more capital which means that  they could do more damage.</p><p>FICK:  I think there's a reality that the South Koreans have to live next  door to North Korea and are probably going to be a little bit more, you  know, potentially pragmatic or even accommodationist, then the United  States can be across the Pacific Ocean.  Look at the talks recently.  Look  at the inclusion of North Korean athletes in the Olympics.  You know, this  is a -- it's a matter of geography and proximity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nate, let me ask you about the hacks hitting corporate America.   I mean, Intel revealed a slaw -- a flaw, rather, in its security, allows  hackers to compromise a laptop in literally seconds.  Then you had last  year's incident, Yahoo, revealing the cyber-attacks affected all 3 billion  users, all 3 billion users and Equifax that had compromised 145 and a half  million Americans.  </p><p>You have a recent op-ed in the New York Times and you're asking who should  be held accountable for the complex cyber-attacks.  Is this a federal or a  corporate issue?  At the end of the day, who's responsible or who should be  accountable for the fix?</p><p>FICK:  I think it's a little bit of.  On the one hand, with the companies  themselves, were not seen the kind of accountability in the market that you  would expect to see if investors and consumers were taken this seriously,  and recognized that all of their personal data and so much of their  potential livelihood is at stake.  On the government side though, we really  see a vacuum of government policy here, specifically with respect to  deterrence.  </p><p>Imagine if American ships were sailing out of Rotterdam to New York and  being attacked by foreign navies, where if American airlines were at risk  of being shot down by foreign migs, we'd be dealing with this in a  different way.  But that's exactly what's happening in the cyber domain and  we don't have the government policies, informational, economic, diplomatic,  or if necessary, military, to deter it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, that's bigger government.  That's a bigger government to  handle this.  Is that what you want?</p><p>FICK:  I don't -- no, I don't think it's bigger.  Look, I've fought in  Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11.  We didn't send citizens with pitchforks  to Afghanistan.  We had a military response to defeat and dissuade our  adversaries and we need the same thing in the cyber domain.</p><p>KELLY:  Nate.</p><p>FICK:  That's why government exists.</p><p>KELLY:  Nate, we talked about this, the spectre situation that's happening  with Intel, you know, how do we prevent these going into the future?  I  mean, you know, we're talking on a business show, it affects stocks like  AMD, Intel, you name it.  As an investor myself, I'm trying -- how do I --  how do I protect myself against this and how do -- how do these companies  protect themselves?</p><p>FICK:  Yes.  Well, the -- look, spectrum meltdown vulnerabilities are a  whole new breed here, right?  For the first time, really, we're talking  about the firmware; we're talking about the CPU, and it appears that there  is some intermediate things we can do to limit the exposure, but  ultimately, you're talking about a supply chain refresh and ultimately  replacing all of those chips over time.</p><p>That is a unique thing.  Most of the vulnerabilities and most of the  breaches that we've encountered over the last several years. Yahoo and  Equifax and others, are software problems.  They can be more rapidly  remediated.  So, it's simple table stakes like applying your patches,  training your people, deploying technology.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Nate, are we losing this war?  I mean, certainly, it looks like  from the outside, and that we are.  I mean, Google has 50 of the top A.I.,  a hundred scientists in the world, private company.  China says they're  going to be the leader in A.I. in 2020.  It seems like we are losing this  war.  Is that -- you think that's right?</p><p>FICK:  So, I think, we're currently losing the war and I'll give you the  numbers to back it up, three umbers, $75 billion spent a year on cyber  security and yet, 90 percent plus of large enterprises breached., and once  the bad guys are in, it takes an average of three months to find it.  So,  yes, we are losing the war.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Well, then, how do you even do that internally when you have  the enemy within, people like Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, et cetera,  who are, you know, supposed to be the people protecting us.  And then you  have them doing traitorous behavior, how can you even protect against that?</p><p>FICK:  Yes.  I mean, vetting employees in internal security is all separate  issue and a good one to raise and our security clearance process, you know,  inside the government and inside government contractors, this is another  whole issue.  I think -- I think, you know, when you boil it down in cyber  security, though, we need to build better software, we have to role cyber  security into the overall enterprise risk management framework and  enterprises.  And we need the government to make sure the term works in the  cyber domain.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Nate, great insights from  you, thanks so much.  </p><p>FICK:  Glad to be here, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nate Fick there.  Coming up, major biotech deal reportedly in  the works, Celgene in talks to acquire Juno Therapeutics, take a look at  Juno this morning, it's up 50 percent.  How the partnership could impact  the future of lifesaving cancer drugs, that's coming up.  Then, stunning  sky show, a meteor lighting up the skies over five states, we have the  incredible pictures, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A school in Puerto Rico is celebrating the  return of electricity.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Some good news, Maria.  Take a look at this video that was posted  on Facebook.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(STUDENTS SCREAMING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  The school's electricity was restored more than 110 days after  Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico.  So far, only about 60 percent  of people have power in the country.  </p><p>Well, Celgene is looking to grow.  The Wall Street Journal says the company  is in talks to buy Juno Therapeutics.  Sources say, one of the deals to  come in the first week.  Celgene CEO discusses company's growth with Maria  last week at San Francisco.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ALLES, CEO, CELGENE:  Strategically, we're well positioned for growth  in the next decade, but our core today in cancer, immune-inflammatory  diseases increasingly in other areas of immunology inflammation is really,  really, growing very nicely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, shares of Celgene down nearly 10 percent from just a year  ago.  And finally, the scientists are saying this was a meteor soaring over  Michigan yesterday.  It also caused an earthquake, though, which is  interesting.  Residents reported a loud booming sound and a flash that you  can see it lit up the night sky.  Cameras throughout Michigan capturing the  experience.  The National Weather Service in Detroit says that a 2.0  magnitude quake resulted from the meteor's grand entrance into our  atmosphere, Maria.  And those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl, thanks so much.  While you are talking, we  got the bank numbers that we've been waiting for, just hitting the tape.   The Bank of America, mixed: $0.47 a share is better than the $0.44 a share  in terms of earning.  However, the revenue coming in at $21.4 billion for  the quarter.  That's slightly lower than the $21.5 billion that analysts  were expecting to see here.  Bank of America number is out.  Kevin Kelly,  your thoughts?  The stock is up right now on the first push.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think one of the issues that you're having here is that  trading has been weak for a lot of these companies, but we're trying to  figure out how they're going to go in the path forward, especially on  loans, right?  In their loan growth, we saw actually J.P. Morgan show a  positive side last week.  Bank of America is actually up more than it  appears 21 percent since it's reported last time so it's been the best  performer.  So, it seems like investors are still taking this to heart with  it up in the premarket.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of the issues here, John, is the fact that the company  is taking a charge in the fourth-quarter as a result of the tax plan,  which, of course, we're seeing throughout the banking sector.  Citi Group  was the first to announce a big charge.  They're riding off assets in '17  versus '18 because of the tax plan.  $2.9 billion charges, what do you say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, and we haven't seen how these tax plans won't take  effect -- earnings.  Look, the banks have decent run -- (INAUDIBLE 48:52)  when President Trump got elected, mainly because Elizabeth Warren wasn't  going to be in the position of power.  And now you're starting to see  earnings revisions are starting to come out.  Analyst believes that  earnings will be up about 20 percent because of this tax package.  The  stocks have been up seven to 10 percent since this tax package has been  finalized.  So, if that is true, if the evaluation holds true, see about  another 10 percent up for these banks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's pretty incredible.  They were expecting 11 percent  earnings growth for 2018.  And on top of the tax plan that's another 12  percent, 23 percent earnings growth for 2018 for S&amp;P500 is an incredible  number.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This tax package is going to hit these banks very  favorably going forward, because of them have earnings in the United  States.  It's going to impact them very favorably.  I think these banks  stocks have a leg up from here and there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I think -- yes, you've already seen a huge in the bank,  obviously, since the election, but we are entering a period that has to be  great for the banks.  You've got rising interest rates.  That's going to  help margins.  You've got economic growth.  Four percent is what people are  expecting for 2014.  And you've got lower regulation.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, de-regulation is the --</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Regulation, I think, is the untold story here in terms of -- I  think the administration should really focus on just letting people know  what it means.  It can be very abstract, I think -- especially for a lot of  these younger people; they don't understand exactly how much regulation.   It just curtails everything, especially start-ups.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Because they are the ones who don't have these at massive  economies of scale to deal with the regulatory compliance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We talked a lot about that on this program actually.   We'll take a break.  When we come back, earnings watch in the busy morning,  Goldman Sachs reporting earnings later this morning.  We'll break down the  tax reforms impact on Wall Street and beyond.  Plus, markets are rallying  this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to be up better than 130 points.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have breaking the news this morning.  Bank of  America earnings hitting the tape moments ago.  Adjusted earnings coming in  above expectations of $0.47 a share.  Revenue is $21.4 billion just shy of  the estimate.  The company is also taking a $2.9 billion charge in the  quarter as result of the tax act.  We're watching these stocks, and we've  been having a conversation about this in the commercial break that we're  about to enter a period, Kevin Kelly, that is beautiful for the banks.   Because not only do you have better economic growth, but you also have  higher interest rates that are going to continue moving.  And you've got  the rollback and regulations that have not hit the banks yet.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think one of the best things that's going to happen is that  you're going to see their net interest margin.  That's where they make  their most money, right?  Because of the rising interest rate environment,  and then they actually can deploy revenues that they're generating from  that into other areas that generate more revenue as opposed to compliance  procedures and programs that happened under Dodd-Frank, right? We had over  22,000 pages of rules and regulations from a basket of agencies -- you  know, hold them down.  We had Citizens' Financial CEO here, you know, a  couple of weeks ago talking about that, right?  I mean, he was just saying,  we don't even have to worry about the SIFI designations.  So, as you start  gaining more assets, right, that you're overseeing, you know, $1oo billion,  more rules and regulations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know why they were even considered as the SIFI, by the  way.</p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Systemically important institution, which punctures the whole  host of new rules.  No, really, I mean, this is financial?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly -- and that's what I'm saying, the regional bank, they  should be deploying their capital in their -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the kind of rule-making that was really crippling  companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Crippling companies.  The Dodd-Frank did not anything  to address what happened with derivatives and -- derivatives of derivates  for the 2008 crisis.  But it did put a lot of restrictions on banks.  Banks  and earnings have not been that great.  The earnings are not that great.   Banks have not been great stocks this past year.  What the good part is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because nobody cared about the fourth-quarter, John, right?  I  mean, they just want to know what the tax plan is going to be for '18.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  100 percent correct.  One is going forward.  You get  right reaction coming off Dodd-Frank, coming off to some degree, and the  tax policy and people still don't know how this tax policy will affect  earnings.  It looks like it's going to create to about 20 percent of  earnings, but they're not sure until these earnings come out, and these  analysts are able to decipher it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I think you make a really good point, Carrie, in  terms of the smaller banks.  They're going to see the big upside.  </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Right.  You mentioned, Citizens Bank is investing into the  community, so this is where we've seen a lot of the damage happening where  the smaller banks are being gobbled up, they're drying up because they  couldn't comply with the regulation.  And so, this is a big breathing  relief for them.  And I will note, in particular, a lot of these community  banks were African-American owned banks.  And they shut down because of  Dodd-Frank.  Again, this is the big difference between intention versus  outcome that drives me crazy about liberals versus conservatives.   Conservatives actually care about outcomes.  They actually care about  outcomes.  They actually want to help Black-owned banks, community banks by  substance and through policies that make sense.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the problem is they're crippling a lot of these  banks with things that they don't have to -- they should have to comply  with anyway.  They're not selling mortgages anyway.  They're not selling  derivatives.  You are either having to comply to Dodd-Frank, which doesn't  affect all. </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Yes, and they want people who win are lawyers and accountants.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We haven't seen what J.P. Morgan will do with the extra savings  from the tax plan.  They sort of hinted that they're looking at a lot of  different things.  It sounded like he's going to do more on the cost,  taking costs down -- cutting prices for consumers as opposed to a thousand- dollar check, we'll see.  But he's definitely looking at a lot of this.   Goldman Sachs is reporting later on this show; we'll bring you the numbers.   But first, flu season crisis, emergency rooms overwhelmed.  Dozens of  deaths.  How did things get so bad?  Next hour, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Welcome back.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January 17.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Shutdown looming -- lawmakers have just three days to reach an agreement to  keep the government funded.  One major hurdle: the battle over immigration  reform.  Republicans did little to close the gap last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The general consensus tonight was that there is not  support for the current leadership plan as proposed.  I think no one wants  to shutdown.  I think none of us, myself included, wants to shut down the  government.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The looming threat coming as stocks hit near record territory.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday cracked 26000 but it ended the  day lower, below the milestone.  After that the markets closed as you see  fractionally lower.   It was the second highest close in history however,  even with the decline.</p><p>Futures this morning back in the green -- take a look.  We are expecting a  big open for the broader averages with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up  145 points right now, one-half of 1 percent higher.  Nasdaq is up 25 --  that's a third of a percent higher as earnings drive the day.</p><p>It is the season of fourth quarter numbers.  Bank of America just hit the  tape.  Earnings of B of A are 47 cents a share, topped expectations.   Revenue however was a slight miss.  But the company said it took a nearly  $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter to write off assets due to the tax  reform bill.</p><p>We are waiting for the numbers from Goldman Sachs.  As you can see B of A  and Goldman Sachs shares this morning are higher.  As soon as the Goldman  Sachs numbers hit the tape, we'll bring them to you.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a bit of a pull back.  FT 100 down a quarter of a  percent as is the DAX index.  The CAC 40 it's just fractionally lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks closed mixed with the Shanghai composite up a  quarter of a percent and the Hang Seng also higher by a quarter of a  percent in Hong Kong.</p><p>Flu season epidemic -- the vast number of cases overwhelming emergency  rooms across the country.  One hospital in California even forced to set up  a makeshift treatment center in the parking lot to deal with the massive  overcrowding caused by the flu.</p><p>One healthy place in the U.S., 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that's for sure.   The White House doctor says that President Trump is in good health.  But  that wasn't enough for the mainstream media.  The unbelievable questions  and the outrage coming up from the press looking for any weaknesses and the  doctor said the President is in excellent shape.</p><p>Plus could technology titans soon face anti-trust concerns?  The surprising  headwinds the likes of Facebook and Apple could be facing.</p><p>Plus this deal is anything but Butterfingers.  We've got a look at Nestle's  deal to sell its chocolate business for nearly $3 billion.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down, the founder of Bold Carrie Sheffield is here, Benchmark managing  partner Kevin Kelly, and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News  contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  It's awesome to be here.  I'm so glad we got  to report on Bank of America because we're going to see what happens out of  Goldman Sachs.  It's actually expected that -- their revenues and net  earnings are going to be down 5 percent.  And they had problems in an area  they dominated which is fixed income currencies and commodities.</p><p>So their fixed income department has had a hard time last year.  Let's see  what happens to this.  I mean it's the diverging results coming from the  banks especially, you know, titans like Goldman Sachs -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Goldman has had a hard time -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- in being dominant period. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it's pretty interesting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll follow that.  It was the case at one point as the  banks go, so goes the rest of the market.  But this whole market has been  so broad-based in terms of the rallies.  So we'll see what happens with the  banks this morning.  Longer term they certainly looking optimistic.  </p><p>Coming up this morning former CKE Restaurant CEO Andy Puzder is with us;  former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski will join us; Fox News  senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here; family medicine  physician Dr. Mike is here; and the CEO of Cadre Ryan Williams will join us  as well.</p><p>Big unicorn there.  You don't want to miss a moment of it.  </p><p>But first this, Republicans are on a deadlock on the government spending  fix as Congress barrels toward the Friday budget deadline.</p><p>The impasse comes after House leaders proposed a new short-term strategy  that would fund the government through February 16 while allowing more time  for negotiations on DACA.</p><p>But conservative Republicans are pushing for a deal that includes more  funding for the Pentagon and revealed last night that the GOP leadership  does not have the votes to pass a government funding bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MO BROOKS (R), ALABAMA:  Democrats are making an untenable demand  where they're putting illegal aliens above the interest of national  security.</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  There is not support for the  current leadership plan as proposed at this point.  There are two or three  options that are out there.  We're going to have to have discussions with  our leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile a bipartisan group of lawmakers are set to unveil a  new DACA bill today.  I want to bring in White House director of  legislative affairs, Marc Short.</p><p>Marc -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  Maria -- thanks  for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we on this?  Can you give us a status check?  </p><p>SHORT:  On the spending bill and DACA -- that's how they are tied together.   It's what we have had this week, it's an expectation of Thursday, Friday  vote on another continuing resolution -- Maria, that would get us into  February to allow more time for DACA and its conversations.</p><p>We met at a staff level with the staff from Leader McCarthy, Leader Hoyer,  Leader Cornyn as well as Senator Durbin yesterday.  I think there will be a  principles' meeting today in which those members will be joined by General  Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen from DHS to continue conversations to move  forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the Freedom Caucus go along with that?  Even though we  just heard Mark Meadows say look, we're not in favor of the leadership plan  here.</p><p>SHORT:  Maria -- we understand the frustration.  Keep in mind that we  submit a budget to Congress in February for 2018.  Mick Mulvaney, OMB  director is about to submit a budget in just a couple of weeks for 2019.   And yet we still haven't funded 2018 to date.</p><p>So we submit our budget in February.  Congress should have a bill completed  by September 30 at the end of the fiscal year.</p><p>Here we are now in mid-January still not having a funding bill for 2018  which is why we are continued to force to do these continuing resolutions  because nobody wants a shutdown.  That hurts federal workers and it hurts  our Defense Department, it hurts our military.  And we need to make sure  that we're continuing to fund our troops.</p><p>The Democrat position has been and continues to be we are going to shut  down the government, stop paying our troops unless there's a deal for  illegal aliens in place.  We are trying to get a deal to solve the DACA  problem but we don't want to shut down the government.</p><p>We think that we'll end up getting that passed this weak to buy us another  month but we're all frustrated -- Maria.  This is not the way Congress is  supposed to work.  They're supposed to have a funding bill completed by  September 30.  We're now in mid-January.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And you're absolutely right.  I mean you're basically  being held hostage and running the government every two weeks. </p><p>SHORT:  That's right.  It's not the way to run the government.  And the  biggest concern is frankly on the national security level.  Secretary  Mattis has continued to go and talk, not just to Republican leaders but  also the Democrat leaders and Schumer and Pelosi and say what you're doing  is tying my hands.  We cannot make the necessary planning that I need to  help make sure our country is secure and safe.  And you're putting our  troops' funding in jeopardy.  And it's a real national security risk for  us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how do you get that communicated to the American people?  I  mean we recognize the threats that are out there in terms of national  security for this country.</p><p>And we also recognize that the Democrats would like the government to shut  down because they believe that Republicans will be blamed.</p><p>SHORT:  There is a sense that if Republicans control the House, the Senate  and the White House they'll get blamed.  But the reality is that Democrats,  we need 60 votes in the United States senate.  The Democrats are the ones  that have a lot of power here and they are, as you say, holding American  people and the government hostage in order to get demands that they want on  DACA.</p><p>And when you talk about national security, Maria, something that was lost I  think in all the conversation, all the soap opera drama the last couple of  days, a report that came out that said three out of four terrorists  convicted here in the United States are foreign born.</p><p>But something else is as in that report that was missing.  Over 2,500  people every year on the terror watch list try to get into our country.   That is seven per day.</p><p>So here we are having all this drama and discussion about what he said, she  said.  And we're not focused on the reality that there are terrorists  trying to get into our country every day and we are trying to fix chain  migration and the lottery visa program to make sure our country is safe and  secure.</p><p>Seven everyday are apprehended or turned away from trying to come in.   Seven people on the FBI's terror watch list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a pretty incredible number actually.  But you're also  facing a group where they would prefer the government to shut down because  they don't want the legislative agenda to get executed, isn't that right?</p><p>SHORT:  Well, I think we're going to find that out this week.  Those are  questions on whether or not they really want a government shutdown or they  just think that they can bluff to try to get people to cave to their  demands on DACA.</p><p>And so we're going to find out this week because I think in reality  Republicans will end up holding together in making sure that we're given  more time to continue negotiate and we avoid a shutdown.</p><p>But again, this is no way to run a government.  We continue to do this  every couple of weeks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SHORT:  The administration submitted a budget in February of 2017 and here  we are again in mid-January without funding for 2018, much less beginning  in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's talk about the broader agenda -- Marc.  This is the  -- an anniversary week for the President, the first year in office under  his belt.  What are the priorities for '18?</p><p>SHORT:  Well, Maria -- I think that we are going to take time to review  2017 because of it was historic in so many ways.  But 2018 also will  feature an infrastructure plan that the President will probably unveil  closer to the State of the Union.  As well as continue to move forward in  areas to rollback the regulatory state and look to require work  requirements in some of the Medicaid payments as you've seen that HHS has  already unveiled.</p><p>So those will continue to be priorities for the administration.  But we  want to secure the border.  We want to make sure our troops are funded.   And we want to get this government funded.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the while, Democrats have been saying that they want  infrastructure.  Reports say that the President will actually present an  infrastructure plan during the State of the Union.  Do you have plans to  tout an infrastructure plan for the State of the Union?</p><p>SHORT:  There are plans for that.  The President has a plan in place; it's  a matter of timing.  We will continue to have conversations with Congress.   Our team at NEC has been doing that for the last few weeks and they'll  continue to over the next couple of weeks leading up to the State of the  Union to make sure they're fully briefed on what the plan will be.</p><p>But you should look for the President to unveil that closer to the State of  the Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems like, you know, on the left, the whole point in all of  the decisions is to win the 2018 -- win as many seats as they can in the  2018 elections.  I mean that's what they're going for and that's why the  obstruction is probably only going to pick up.</p><p>SHORT:  Well, I think you're right.  This is an election year and so there  will be a lot more obstruction and probably the expectations for what we  can do legislatively will diminish as the year goes along.</p><p>We have a lot of plans to begin the year.  But to your point, Democrats  will have to make a case as to why not -- not one of them voted for tax  relief that now 2.1 million Americans now -- 2.1 million workers have  either received a bonus or a pay increase since the tax release -- since  the tax package was passed just a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>There will continue to be more.  And they will have to explain why  unemployment in America is at its lowest point ever for African-Americans,  lowest point ever for Hispanic Americans -- a 17-year-low, and yet they are  stopping the economic plans of this administration.</p><p>So we look forward to that debate coming forth throughout the rest of year. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what is the biggest pushback from the left?  Is it funding  the border wall?  Giving the President the money that he is asking for?  Or  is it funding the military?</p><p>SHORT:  That's a great question -- Maria.  I think the reality is that on  the border security, keep in mind in 2006 most Democrats voted for the  Secure Fence Act that would have funded the wall including Chuck Schumer.</p><p>In 2013, over $40 billion was in the Democrat plan on part of their Dream  Act to provide border security.  So they have been willing to vote for it  before.  The only difference now is that Donald Trump is president.</p><p>So in my mind, it's less of a policy issue and purely a political issue  where there is a recognition of the security needs but for political  reasons looking to hold back support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of the conversation around the President's personality  and his remarks -- is that getting in the way in terms of doing a deal?  Or  is that just noise coming from the left.</p><p>SHORT:  Yes.  I think it's a lot of noise, frankly Maria.  I think that the  conversations yesterday were cordial.  I think that we'll have, hopefully  continued progress but keep in mind the administration put forward our  principles and what we want on this plan back in October.</p><p>Again we're in mid-January.  We refined that plan a couple of weeks ago and  took some things off the table to try to get closer to negotiations.  So  we've been leaning forward into this.</p><p>We're anxious for Congress to come back and say, ok these are reasonable  things you're asking for -- end of the visa lottery program which as you  know, was a program in which the pipe bomber came in.  End the chain  migration which as you know, is the program through which the terrorist who  ran over people in New York came through.</p><p>And begin to secure the border.  Those are practical requests for the  American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean are you getting at least an acknowledgement that the  visa program is ridiculous?</p><p>SHORT:  I think that -- I think there's a growing consensus that the visa  program is ridiculous, as you say.  I think the question is the Democrat  position has been, let's take those visas and reallocate them to other  programs like the temporary protected status program.  Or they think the  administration just believes that program should be terminated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc -- thanks so much for walking us through it all.  Great  insights from you.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>SHORT:  Thanks -- Maria.  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching the developments.  Marc Short at the White  House. </p><p>Coming up, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health -- reporters  poke and prod at President Trump's glowing physical exam report yesterday.   The bizarre questions that embarrassed the entire media for the White House  doctor -- coming up.</p><p>And then a bittersweet parting -- Nestle offloading its candy business to  an Italian chocolate giant for nearly $3 billion; why the deal could signal  a new future for Nestle.</p><p>Stay with us</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   I'm Cheryl Casone with your headlines. </p><p>Two Navy commanders facing negligent homicide charges related to the deadly  crash of two different ships last year.  They are former Commander Bryce  Benson of the USS Fitzgerald and former Commander Alfredo Sanchez of the  USS John McCain.</p><p>The Fitzgerald collided with a commercial ship near Japan in June.  That  killed seven sailors.  Ten were killed in August when the John s. McCain  crashed into an oil tanker.  This happened in Southeast Asia.</p><p>The story we're following for you this morning.  McDonald's is pledging to  have fully recyclable packaging by 2025.  The fast food chain also said  that recycling bins are going to be put in all of its restaurants.  Today  about half of McDonald's packaging comes from renewable, recyclable,  certified material.</p><p>Taking a look at the stocks -- shares of McDonald's restaurant up nearly 40  percent over the last year.</p><p>And then listen to this.  Nestle is selling its U.S. candy business to  Italy's Ferrero for about $2.8 billion in cash.  The brands being sold  include Butterfinger, Crunch and Runts -- all the good stuff, right.</p><p>The deal is going to make the Ferrero the third largest candy maker in the  United States.  Some analysts say that the move by Nestle is going to help  it focus more on healthier products.  They've actually been trying to do  that -- Maria.  </p><p>Shares of Nestle, up about 15 percent from a year ago.</p><p>All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the good stuff.</p><p>CASONE:  It's all the good stuff, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Like nothing better happen to my Butterfingers.  (INAUDIBLE) the  Butterfinger ice creams that are made of.  There is a healthy ecosystem off  of all those delicious candy.</p><p>M1:  You want the healthy Butterfinger.

RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN:  There's no indication whatsoever  that he has any cognitive issues.  You know, he's very sharp and you know,  he's very articulate when he speaks to me.  I found no reason whatsoever to  think that the President has any issues whatsoever with his thought  process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The media embarrassed itself yesterday.

We'll take you  under the hood of the new plan.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Wow, what a flu season.  The deadly flu season could get even worse.  The  severity of the virus is overwhelming emergency rooms across the country.   At least 20 children have died as a result.</p><p>Hospitals in California have begun turning their parking lots into  makeshift treatment centers to deal with the massive overcrowding caused by  flu patients.</p><p>Joining us right now is family medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, better  known as Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike -- good to see you.</p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And I told you during the  break I'm just back because I had a really bad cold.  It's not the flu but  I was afraid because the flu is seriously dangerous this season.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Very, very dangerous.  The flu is dangerous all seasons  actually.  We always forget when a year goes by that the last flu season  wasn't so bad. </p><p>But the flu does kill.  It's a deadly virus.  Even those who get it and  don't die from it they are out of work for a week, two weeks because of  high fevers, body aches, severe fatigue.</p><p>It's not a virus that's just like the common cold that goes away after a  few days.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can you do about it?  Do you just do Tamiflu?  What do you  do about it?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well, Tamiflu is a great anti-viral and it's best taken within  the first 48 hours of having the symptoms.  That's why I always recommend a  senior doctor right away when the symptoms do start.</p><p>Although there has been some promise with taking Tamiflu after the 48  hours.  That can reduce the complication rate with does kill people in very  severe populations that are susceptible -- thinking over the age of 65,  under the age of five.</p><p>KELLY:  So I guess the main question is should people be getting flu shots?   Did the flu shot actually work this season?  Because we are guessing at  what strains and cultures it actually is going to be here -- I like that.   So is the flu shot even worth it this year?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So the flu shot is definitely worth it.  There has been a lot  of excitement because initially, the way we decide if the flu shots can be  effective in prediction, we look at Australia.  Because they're in the  southern hemisphere, they experience their flu season before ours.</p><p>Their flu shot was only about 10 percent effective for the current strain  that we have.  The current strain is an H3N2 strain.  It means absolutely  nothing to the regular person but to scientists we get excited about it.</p><p>And what we found is the current flu shot is about 30 percent effective; 30  percent effective -- still very much worth getting.  And even if it doesn't  prevent you from getting the flu, it will tone down your symptoms, it will  shorten the course.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  And what we've seen is over time, if you consistently yearly  get flu shots it works even more effectively.</p><p>CARRIE SHEFFIELD, FOUNDER, BOLD:  Does the weather have any impact because  for me, you know, the snowstorm has been crazy.  I got cold.  I felt like  that affected my immune system.</p><p>Are you saying that like the weather pattern is affecting it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so cold this season.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  There is a couple of things that come from that.  When  it's cold, generated humidity -- the humidity is lower so germs hang around  longer in the air.  So someone can sneeze in a conference room, an hour  later you walk in those germs are still hanging around.</p><p>Also because it's cold everyone is staying inside.  We are closer together.   So if one person gets sick it spreads that much quicker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Constantly washing your hands is really important.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Washing your hands and not touching your face.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the President's health.  The White House  doctor said that commander in chief is in good health but that was not  enough for the mainstream media.</p><p>Watch this charade.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Does the President wear dentures.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you looking at things like early onset  Alzheimer's?  Are you looking at dementia like some -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is there anything you're keeping from us for privacy  reasons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  His weight I think is at 239, right.  That -- it  seems it's just shy of obesity.</p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're confident of that number and -- </p><p>JACKSON:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  -- and did you do any measurements.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Recently where the President appeared to slur his  words while giving an address.  Did you look into what the cause of that  might have been at all?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could not believe this yesterday.  I tweeted out in the  middle of it, \"No words.\"  No words.  I was embarrassed for my industry.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  All of the things going on -- all the things going on in the  country, that's what they're dealing with.  And he weighs 239; I hadn't  weighed that since I was 17.  I should be dead by now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were upset that the President -- there wasn't anything bad  to report.  I mean they were -- </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  He's never -- he doesn't drink.  He doesn't smoke.  He doesn't  do drugs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the doctor said a lifetime of no alcohol and no tobacco  really has served him incredibly well.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Well, they're talking about the 25th amendment because they're  obsessed.  They think that the President is not going to make it through  his first term and he's not going to run for reelection.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, not only do they think but they're definitely creating  that narrative.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Oh yes.  I call it the 50 states of impeachment fantasy where  they just have all these scenarios that they think that he just won't make  it.  And he's going to be impeached because of his health.</p><p>So that's why they're doing this.  It's just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as a medical doctor.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Here's what upsets me. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Here's what upsets me.  I see a lot of people critiquing  someone's health before they know exactly what's going on, especially from  the mental health side.  In order to know anything about someone's mental  health, you need to sit down with them.  You need to have a conversation  with them.  You need to talk about their family history.</p><p>So to see some journalists and even doctors come on and say I know that  this person has x illness.  That is medically unethical.  You are doing a  disservice to yourself.  You're doing a disservice to your patients because  you're proving that you don't follow the medical process.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Is it hard to measure mental health if you don't have a  baseline?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  It's hard to measure mental health when you haven't  interviewed and sat down with the person.  It's impossible.  You can't do  it.  You have to spend time.  They have to be your patient otherwise you're  just making stuff up.</p><p>KELLY:  There's nothing wrong with dentures, by the way, people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  George Washington, right.</p><p>But I mean have you ever seen anything like that? I mean President Obama  was a huge smoker.  There was no comments about it.  No one said anything.</p><p>I mean President Bush also had issues.  Have you ever seen anything like  that yesterday?  It was extraordinary.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it was pretty bad.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Look at how many heavy drinkers we had.  Look at all the -- I  know the President said the (INAUDIBLE) was on.  We've had -- President  Trump might be one of the more saner presidents we've had.  Look at -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- trying to propagate because he's drunk.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  It's just very -- it's this very narrative.  Ever since, you  know, he won they have this agenda where they want to obstruct in every way  possible.  So that's -- this is just par for the course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for you -- Mr. President.  Congratulations on excellent  health.  </p><p>Dr. Mike -- good to see you, sir.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, the DACA dispute -- the Department of Justice go straight to the  Supreme Court over a ruling to block President Trump from ending the Obama- era program that protects illegal immigrants who entered the country as  children.</p><p>The very latest in the legal battle on DACA coming up.</p><p>And then is it time for tech titans trust buster.  We'll take a look at  whether the industry's biggest names have gotten too big.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning everybody.

The Department of Justice asking for the Supreme Court to immediately  review a federal judge's ruling that blocked President Trump from ending  the program.  Last week a district judge ordered the administration to  continue protecting immigrants who entered the country illegally as  children.</p><p>In a statement yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Session said this, \"It  defies both law and common sense for DACA --  to somehow be mandated  nationwide by a single District Court in San Francisco.\"</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.</p><p>And Judge we keep asking the same question -- </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- why is the Ninth Court is so influential in the whole  country?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The Ninth Circuit, because the president's opponents filed  their complaints in California since they know that an overwhelming  majority of federal judges there are likely to resist the president.</p><p>So, there's a couple of questions here, one, was a federal judge in  California authorized to restrain the president nationwide?</p><p>The answer, \"Yes.\"</p><p>Now that is a rarely exercised a power, usually you restrain the president  or you restrain the defendant just in the area where you sit but when the  defendant or his agents are present nationwide and you believe the  defendant is engaging in unconstitutional behavior, which is what this  judge found -- I don't agree with him but did he have the authority to  enjoin the president?</p><p>He did.</p><p>Then the president said, \"We have to make these laws based on love and I'm  going to let DACA stay in place.\"</p><p>Then the president's lawyers advised him, 'if you don't appeal this, you  are sending the wrong signal to the court that maybe you really are  ambivalent about exercising these powers.'</p><p>So, they filed the appeal yesterday.  They bypassed your - at least  favorite circuit court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and went  directly to the Supreme Court; that is very rare and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- 99 percent of the time you do that the Supreme Court says,  \"Go to the Circuit Court first,\" but on every, single, without fail,  Immigration case that has started at California Federal District Court and  gone to the Ninth Circuit, and gone to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court  has reversed the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>So, the Justice Department is saying, we want to go to you directly because  we need an answer right away -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- I can't predict what the Supreme Court is going to do.</p><p>KELLY:  Well when is the Supreme Court going to hear this and decide on  this (ph)?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Entirely up to them -- </p><p>KELLY:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Kevin.</p><p>If it had gone to the Ninth Circuit they have a short window in which to  rule but because it goes to the Supremes, they can sit in it for as long as  they want.</p><p>In the meantime, the federal district judge's order stays in place and if  you are in this category of 800,000 -- of pretty much Americanized people  but born in another country and came here as babies, you can apply for the  DACA protection.</p><p>Now that DACA protection is for a year.  If you apply and get it then it's  another year before the president can invalidate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to get to a couple of different issues because we also want  to talk about 'sanctuary cities' with the Judge but first this, an  Oversight Hearing on Border Security took a real turn yesterday and we want  to get your take.</p><p>Senators began grilling DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over her role in  last week's White House Immigration meeting.</p><p>New Jersey Democrat, Cory Booker hit her especially hard, yelling at her  after she said she did not recall President Trump's vulgar language  reportedly used during the meeting.</p><p>Watch this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN.

They are losing their dominance in their  divisions that made them famous, that made them a corporate entity that was  so feared on Wall Street -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that why the stock is down?</p><p>KELLY:  -- Yes.</p><p>I think that is why the stock's down because they still haven't addressed  it and their CFO has repeatedly said, \"We're going to fix the problems in  the FICC division as well as Equities, and it hasn't happened but they have  done so well on the Investment Banking side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But everybody's FICC division is under pressure, isn't that  right?</p><p>I mean -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Trading earnings (ph) -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Trading has been like that (ph).</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- being a slug, it's like you said -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- earlier, fourth-quarter earnings really don't matter.  It's - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No volatility.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- it's what happens going forward.</p><p>This new tax package is going to accredit (ph) earnings about 20 percent.   It certainly looks like lack of regulation or regulation, breaking down  Dodd-Frank, is going to help banks a way, it's matters what's going  forward.</p><p>This fourth-quarter has not been a good quarter for banks, for last year it  has not necessarily been a good quarter for banks.  Next year looks to be.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  I'm with you there although I'm an interested party as a,  former Goldman alumni myself so matter what I say it's going to be through  that lens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, stock is down but the numbers look good but you're  right -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Trading is the - is a weak spot.</p><p>Will take a break.</p><p>When we come back the tax man cometh for your passport, how your tax debt  could potentially put your passport at risk of being revoked.</p><p>Then they are all the rage, Senator Orrin Hatch sporting the latest trend  in eyewear, invisible glasses, the Utah Republican's hilarious Twitter  response after he was caught on camera taking off the glasses he wasn't  actually wearing.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The IRS cracking down and seriously delinquent taxpayers.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, that's right Maria.</p><p>Taxpayers who owe the government a lot of money, they want to contact the  IRS about setting up some kind of plan under a new law that takes effect  later this month, the State Department could deny or revoke a passport for  anybody that's got unpaid taxes of more than $51,000.</p><p>Officials will probably only take that step if a taxpayer is subject to a  lien (ph) but still the threat is out there.</p><p>Well BMW and Mercedes-Benz planning to test subscription programs, one  monthly payment, will cover a car payment, maintenance, and insurance.

We're  unpacking the antitrust argument against Facebook, Google, and Amazon,  among others.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Dominating giant technology companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon,  raising the question, 'should they be broken up?'</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and of course the questions -- </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- are 'broken-up' or are they needing more governance or what?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  You break them up, you regulate them, what do you do?</p><p>It's a fascinating question and the Wall Street Journal did an excellent  and a very deep-dive on this.</p><p>Basically, they compared the Tech giants of today to those of the last  century so first they looked at the share size, the influence of these  companies.</p><p>Just check it out 95 percent of young adults today use Facebook; 89 percent  use Google to search the Web; 75 percent use Amazon to buy e-books.</p><p>Let's compare that to back when, nine and 10 of us made phone calls using  AT&amp;T and got our fuel from Standard Oil.</p><p>So, many people want to know how these companies through the ages have  gotten so big and as far as that antitrust regulator argument, does the  size help or hurt you and me as the consumer.</p><p>So, let's take a look, back in the day, John D. Rockefeller and Standard  Oil.  He either bought other smaller refineries or drove them out of  business to become so large and in the process managed to keep oil prices,  kerosene mostly, low.</p><p>Standard Oil ruled in a legal monopoly back in 1911.</p><p>So, today as we've also seen, Facebook is buying competition: Instagram;  WhatsApp; Oculus VR.  Its services are mostly free for you and me and they  are constantly evolving themselves to make the product better.</p><p>So, it's hard to prove at least from that monopoly point of view that their  services are harmful to the - to the consumer.</p><p>You can look at the addictive nature of the products, that's another  argument altogether.</p><p>Let's look at Amazon, it bought Staples; it bought Whole Foods, not even a  competitor, still managing to keep prices low.</p><p>Alphabet probably coming under the heaviest scrutiny here, paying billions  and billions of dollars in fines to European and US regulators for the way  they populate their search results which can often hurt their rival, the  competition.</p><p>These companies nonetheless and we're going to pull up a chart, they have  made investors wealthy but 2018 is going to offer a new test especially as  we look at these creative tie-ups: vertical mergers, when you don't buy  direct; competitor and we'll see that in March as AT&amp;T continues to try to  you know, merge with Time Warner.</p><p>Is it possible?</p><p>What is the government going to say?</p><p>And how do you regulate companies that have invaded our lives?</p><p>KELLY:  Well the biggest issue that you're seeing is on Facebook  (INAUDIBLE), right (ph), they were basically a media company, there were -  you could pay them in rubles -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- to push a story to - about whatever candidate you wanted.</p><p>And guess what?</p><p>Fox isn't held to the - to the same - Fox has standards, right, you have to  decide where you're getting your -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- information from, how and you know -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- the publishers need to be vetted.</p><p>Facebook certainly didn't do that and they certainly undermined democracy  by doing this.</p><p>They didn't vet.  They took it everywhere, even the Germans took action  against Facebook because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- there's one more thing - and there's one more thing and that  is the data that these companies have about us, they know everything.</p><p>Well I mean Google -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they obviously know everything that we're searching for -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  You looked -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- so that's sweater so let me show you this one, oh -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- this happens to be one of our sites that sells it (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, much data, that's why they're so powerful.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  I think there's also the issue of bias so I work with an  organization called \"Lincoln Network\" in Silicon Valley which is  Libertarian conservatives in Silicon Valley and they have just looked at  surveys talking to conservatives and libertarians in Silicon Valley and the  level of bias that these employees feel in the Valley, they can't speak up.</p><p>And you also see conservative publications and conservative media outlets  getting censored or even you know, a Congresswoman tried to put up a pro- life ad on Twitter, it was - and it was shot down.</p><p>The same thing that you're seeing in Google and Facebook.</p><p>This is a big question as it relates to the First Amendment and Freedom of  Speech and also just the ability to express yourself ideologically.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  But it doesn't seem like it's a fair comparison to compare this  to Rockefeller, I mean Google laying those three underground cables across  the ocean at -- 10 times as -- 10 million times as fast as a modem, worries  you about them taking over the Internet but Rockefeller you had no option  with Standard Oil.</p><p>You had to buy oil from him, Carnegie, you had -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because he bought -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- to buy it still from him -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- everybody else.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- Because he bought everybody else and to this day and age,  (they've got) a kid in a garage somewhere in Silicon Valley could take down  Google theoretically -- </p><p>KELLY:  Not really -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  -- because they'll clamp-down -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- did not have -- </p><p>KELLY:  -- either you sell -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  -- or we'll - we'll wipe you out, you can't buy this.  That's what  happened -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- Yes.  That's -- </p><p>KELLY:  -- to Snapshot and Instagram.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- maybe that's - well that's what happened in MySpace.</p><p>MySpace offers the same thing and all of a sudden, they come along, \"Hey,  we all thought the same thing.\"</p><p>Look at that merger, I mean people would have thought the same thing,  Technology is increasing so rapidly -- </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  It is true -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- it is not like the -- </p><p>SHEFFIELD:  -- and there's also the barriers to entry are much lower than  Standard Oil will you have to have massive physical assets.</p><p>You can do so much in your basement with almost nothing.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  And we don't have -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- Teddy Roosevelt -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- to go after these guys like they had back then.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Lauren it's worth watching and I know the stocks will  also get impacted -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if we do see a bigger government in Tech.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>Thank you Lauren Simonetti.</p><p>Apocalypse now, one graphic artist imagines what it would look like if the  technology giants, Facebook and Google face the same fate as some  retailers.</p><p>Next hour, right here on Mornings with Maria; stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning everybody.

Good Wednesday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is  Wednesday, January 17th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Shut down showdown, lawmakers have just three days to reach an  agreement to keep the government funded.  One major hurdle the battle over  immigration reform.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We certainly don't  want the government to shut down but we still like to see a budget deal,  that is a two-year budget deal that is a clean budget deal.  Democrats will  not hold our government hostage and we'll not stop allowing our country and  our nation to be protected.  </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  If we do our work there's no need for a  government shutdown.  But the Republicans are in control.  The House and  the Senate, and the White House.  It is their decision as to whether work  with this to move forward.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The looming threat coming as stocks sit near record territory.   The Dow Jones Industrial average yesterday cracked another all-time high of  26,000.  It ended the day below the milestone, as you see markets pulled  back by the close but it's still was a second highest close in history at  25,792 on the Dow.  Take a look at futures this morning, we're expecting a  rally at the start of trading.  Dow Industrials up in the triple digits, up  120 points.  One-half of one percent.  The NASDAQ is up a third of a  percent right now, 22 points higher.  </p><p>Earnings season driving the story on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs earn $5.68  a share, that was above expectations.  Revenue was also better than  expected at Goldman Sachs the earnings per share, 5.68 a share, better than  the 4.91 estimated.  This comes after Bank of America reported mixed  earnings earlier this morning.  More on those numbers coming up.  The banks  are mixed this morning.  In Europe today the major indices are lower.  Take  a look, FT-100, CAC quarante and the DAX Index fractionally weaker this  morning.  And in Asia overnight, stocks closed mixed.  As you'll see here  with the winners in Hong Kong and China.  Nikkei Average in Japan down a  third of a percent.</p><p>Breaking news out of South Korea right now, the icy relationship between  the country and the north may be thawing.  Reuters is reporting that the  countries have reached an agreement to march together under a unified Korea  flag at the Winter Olympics in south next month.  More in this breaking  story this morning coming up.</p><p>Is it the end of General Electric as we know it?  The major problems that  could lead to breakup of the American staple.  125-year-old company could  be broken up.  Plus, YouTube changes the way it reviews preferred content.   What it means for the life of embattled star Logan Paul.  Plus, what if  tech went the way of Brick and Mortar?  How one artist envisions the likes  of Facebook and Tinder if they fell victim the retail apocalypse.  All  those stories coming up this morning and joining me to help break it down,  Bold founder, Carrie Sheffield is here, Benchmark managing partner Kevin  Kelly and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News Contributor, John  Layfield.  Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY: It's awesome being here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning. </p><p>KELLY:  And I just -- on the Goldman Sachs we saw this down premarket, one  of the issues why is because Goldman used to command a premium to its  peers, right?  To the Bank of America which is actually up in the premarket  because they were the best place to go trade.  Fixed income equities and  that's not it anymore.  So if you -- if you're not going to go to them for  that and you're going to go Bank of America and you get great service on  your mortgage or what have you and you're doing your trading over there.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Banks overall though -- I've got a perfect scenario.  Elizabeth  Warren is not in position and power because Mr. Clinton was not elected, so  -- and you also now have tax policy coming forward that's' going to help  these banks, rising rates, regulation coming down off Dodd-Frank.  Banks  were in a good spot for the next 12 months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They definitely are.  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  But you got to pick and choose your banks as we can see with  Goldman Sachs compared to Bank of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your favorite bank right at the stock?</p><p>KELLY:  So, it's actually J.P. Morgan because we're firing across all  cylinders and their performance so low especially on the loan growth.  It's  either picking up where Wells Fargo actually is a detriment, you know,  especially with their recent scandal.  So J.P. Morgan is actually picking  up that Wells Fargo slack.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's talk more about that.  Joining the  conversation this morning is former CKE Restaurant CEO and former Labor  secretary nominee, Andy Puzder is here.  Former Trump campaign manager  Corey Lewandowski joins us, as well as Cadre CEO, Ryan Williams with us and  the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as well.  Big hour  ahead.  So don't miss a moment of it.  We'll kick it off this hour right  here with the shutdown showdown on Capitol Hill.  Republicans are  considering a spending fix as Congress barrels for the Friday budget  deadline.  Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the  latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.   House Republican leadership last night presented its members with a plan  that would fund the government a stop-gap measure through February 16th.   This by no means though is a slam dunk this morning as already.   Conservative members are expressing reservations about kicking the can down  the road once again.  However, the White House feels that Mark Meadows and  the House Conservative Freedom Caucus and Republicans, in general, will  eventually come around and will avert a government shutdown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  We have this week  as an expectation as an expectation both Thursday, Friday vote on another  continuing resolution, Maria, that would get us into February to allow more  time for a DACA conversation.  </p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), CHAIR, HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS:  At some point, you  have to figure out that why is the four C.R. going to be any different from  the second and the third.  And I don't know that there's a compelling case  that's been made for that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Now, the C.R., continuing resolution would be a clean C.R.,  meaning no strings attached, meaning that there was no DACA deal attached  to it.  That is exactly what the White House wanted with this and they feel  as well though that if for some reason, if there would be a shutdown of  some sorts, it would just give Democrats more leverage on that issue down  the line.  The Democratic Senator Dick Durbin who has been a centerpiece of  these negotiations as it relates to DACA feels that the White House is not  living up to its word.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DURBIN:  We've met the President criteria.  Remember one point when he  said, whatever you send me I'll sign.  I'll take the political heat on  this.  Well, we showed up Thursday with our bipartisan bill and presented  it to him, it was a much different story.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Maria, I've spoken to senior White House official a little while  ago, this person put the odds of a government shutdown at one in four.  25  percent while that might seem low.  This person also acknowledged that of  all the past fire drills, the last feud that we've been through and the  last handful of months, this 25 percent number is the highest that this  person has ascribed but does feel that in the end, this will be averted.   Again, the deadline is Friday night and there is a lot of room to go until  then.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Blake, did Dick Durbin just leaked that about something the  President said just because he was upset that the President didn't go for  his immigration plan? </p><p>BURMAN:  Well, you know, they thought they that had a deal on Thursday.   Dick Durbin, Lindsey Graham, this handful dozen or so people who were in  the room thought that they had a deal and that's why they're upset with all  of this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then they just decided -- you know, let me just go start  another fire and leak something that the President said in response.</p><p>BURMAN:  The -- you mean, from the conversations in that room on Thursday?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.  I mean, that's some of the allegations, you know, but again,  Dick Durbin also feels that what was said in that room wasn't respectful,  wasn't respectful of the office of the Presidency, there is the argument,  you know, you've got the Congressman from South Florida, Diaz-Balart saying  he never talks about what happens in a private meeting but clearly Dick  Durbin was upset enough that what he heard that he felt he needed to bring  this before the camera.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And upset that his plan wasn't accepted.  Blake, thank  you.  Blake Burman with the latest at the White House.  I want to turn to  the Russia probe right now.  Former White House Chief Strategist Steve  Bannon refusing to answer questions yesterday while testifying in the  closed-door meeting before the House Intelligence Committee despite being  subpoenaed according to Fox News sources.  Bannon reportedly told lawmakers  he was asked by the White House not to discuss details from his time in the  administration or during the Presidential transition.  Yesterday  Congressman Trey Gowdy and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee- Sanders weighed in on this use of executive privilege.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  We learned about a new privilege that  before day did not exist, this an executive privilege that covers  transitions communications, communications while you're working at the  White House and then communications after you separate from service at the  White House.  So that's why the subpoena was issued is because it is the  most tortured analysis of executive privilege I have ever heard of.  </p><p>SANDERS:  We've been completely cooperative throughout this entire process.   We're going to continue to be cooperative but we're also going to maintain  some of the executive privileges here at the White House that have been  practiced for decades.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox News has learned Bannon will return to speak to the House  Intelligence Committee tomorrow while former Trump campaign manager Corey  Lewandowski is set to testify today.  Communications Director Hope Hicks  could reportedly meet with the committee as early as Friday.  Joining us  right now is former Trump campaign manager, Avenue Strategies partner and  co-author or Let Trump Be Trump, Corey Lewandowski.  Also joining us is  Democratic Strategist, former Obama campaign regional director, and former  U.S. Army Ranger, Robin Biro.  Good to see you both.  Thanks so much for  joining us, gentlemen.</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Good morning.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN REGIONAL DIRECTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Corey, let me -- let me kick it off with you.  You're  testifying today.  There are reports that you hired a lawyer to represent  you over this probe.  Is that accurate?  What can we expect later today? </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Oh, what you expect from me today is exactly what you always  get from me which is the truth and I'll be happy and I said I'll cooperate  with any investigation that they have whether it's a Congressional  investigation or anybody else who wants to sit down and talk.  And I'll  tell them that there was no collusion, there was no coordination, no  cooperation between our campaign when I was there and any foreign entity.   And if there was any, then those people should be held accountable.  But  look, Maria, this has been going on now for over a year.  There's been no  evidence whatsoever that anything has taken place and even Dianne  Feinstein, the ranking member in the Senate Judiciary Committee has said  she has seen no evidence whatsoever to show any collusion between the Trump  campaign and Russia.  So, look I'll come in and talk to anybody but in some  point, we have to bring this investigation to a close.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robin, do you agree with that?  I mean, at this point given  where you haven't seen any evidence of any collusion and we know that there  was in fact collusion at the top of the FBI and Hillary Clinton with all of  the bias going on there and the protecting of Hillary Clinton and what she  was doing in terms of her e-mail and yet there is no -- there is no focus  there in the media. </p><p>BIRO:  You know, Maria, I just the opinion that this investigation, we're  not going to know exactly what there is to it at this point.  The public  certainly isn't privy to it so just let this investigation run its course  and the President has been insisting that he's innocent.  Let this go  unimpeded, so this is not a permanent stain on presidency.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you -- do you think -- do you think that there should be  questions asked over this so-called insurance policy that FBI Agent Peter  Strzok was discussing with his girlfriend Lisa Page at the FBI, they did  not Donald Trump to win the presidency and said that, well, you know, we  need this as an insurance policy.  Do you think that should be looked at? </p><p>BIRO:  Absolutely.  I think that everything should be looked at.  Look at  the investigation into Bill Clinton, that started off into a real estate  transaction and it burst the Monica Lewinsky.  So these investigations can  go anywhere, anything is fair game.  Absolutely, Maria.  I think that's  their game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Corey, one of the things we've been talking about this morning  is this idea that the apparently Bannon said he was told by the White House  not to discuss anything as you just heard Congressman Gowdy talking about  this new -- this new privilege.  Were you told not to discuss anything from  the White House?  </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: No, I wasn't.  And what I've said to the members of the  committee that asked me to come and I volunteered to come, by the way, they  asked me to come, I will be happy to go and talk to them.  But look, I'll  be happy to tell you anything.  But what I think Steve was saying is he'll  be happy to answer any questions during his tenure on the campaign because  if this investigation is truly about did Russia collude with the Trump  campaign to impact to the outcome of the election then let's talk about his  tenure on the campaign.  If this investigation is about something  completely different which is what Donald Trump has done after his a  president-elect or as the president, that's a very different investigation.   And Steve from what I understand, the public reports are saying is he is  willing and was willing to talk about anything that took place while he was  at the campaign but not while he was a chief strategist to the White House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- let me switch gears here because President Trump is  expected to hand out these fake news awards today.  He tweeted on January  7th this.  The fake news awards, those going to the most corrupt and biased  of the mainstream media will be presented to the losers on Wednesday,  January 17th rather than this coming Monday.  The interest and the  importance of these awards is far greater than anybody could have  anticipated, the President wrote.  Robin, what do you expect to happen  today?</p><p>BIRO:  You know, honestly, the lead purveyor of the fake news is Donald  Trump.  The fact-checkers have already said that he's given us more than  2,000 lies.  So honestly he should be one of the recipient.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the 2,000 lies, Robin?  Don't spew out nonsense.  What  are the 2000 lies?  </p><p>BIRO:  Come on, let's start with day one.  The biggest Presidential  Inauguration in the history of all inaugurations.  We can start there and  they just continued every single day.  We get more and more from him.  So - - but I agree there, you know, the media needs to be held accountable, so,  you know, I think we're going to all have a little bit off with this but  the term fake news, Maria, came because Russian bots were literally putting  out fake news.  Then it became --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  I think the term -- I think the term came because the  media is not focusing on what the American people care about, you never see  in the New York Times, any articles about Dow 25,000 and Dow 26,000, you  rarely see articles or news reports away from Fox and Fox Business of the  four percent economic growth that is expected in 2018 instead you've got  the mainstream media focusing on whether or not Donald Trump wears dentures  and whether or not he's obese and how many diet cokes he drinks.  </p><p>BIRO:  No, I'll give you that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fake news. </p><p>BIRO:  Yes but fair is fair.  And to me, it's the pot calling kettle black  because he is pushing out fake news every single day.  Maria, Maria, look,  we have reporters every day who are making up stories.  We saw this with  Brian Ross from ABC and the stock market drops 350 points, you know, in an  afternoon because he made up a fake news story and you know what the  accountability was?  Nothing.  Nothing.  He still has his job at ABC News,  that's what fake news is and that is what the American people are tired of.   And we've seen this time and again, we saw a story that said Deutsche Bank  was under a subpoena from the Mueller team to turn over Donald Trump's  finances.  </p><p>That never occurred, the Mueller team had to come out and say, we never  issued a subpoena to Deutsche Bank for those records.  So, where is the  accountability?  When do the people get fired in the media for making the  news that's supposed to the reporting news and that's what the fake news  awards are all about?  The worst of worst, the people who make up the news  and affect our lives every day and people's stocks and people's 401(k)s  with no accountability. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Corey Lewandowski, Robin  Biro, thanks very much, gentlemen.  We'll be right back.</p><p>BIRO:  Thank you.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news now, North and South Korea  agreeing to march together at the Winter Olympics in South Korea next  month.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Just hearing about this, Maria, you know,  tensions do still remain high on the Korean peninsula but North and South  Korea have agreed to create a joint Olympics team and they will march  together under one Korea flag at the Pyeongchang Games that starts on  February 9th.  The two countries have also agreed to form a unified women's  hockey team we should add.</p><p>So back here at home.  Nine men are now facing hazing charges in connection  with the death of Florida State University fraternity pledge.  20-year old,  excuse me, 20-year-old Andrew Coffey, he was a junior and a pledge of Pi  Kappa Phi.  He died November 3rd after he was found unresponsive.   Following his death, Florida State suspended its fraternities and  sororities with no timetable on when they would be reinstated.  </p><p>Well, YouTube taking another step make sure that ads on its site won't  appear with controversial videos.  The company actually ordered hundreds of  its workers to watch thousands of hours premium content, that's known as  Google Preferred.  YouTube says the full review should be completed by end  of March.  New videos are going to be reviewed before they're posted on the  site.  Shares of Alphabet, YouTube's parent up more than 36 percent from  just a year ago.  </p><p>And then this is interesting.  What would life look like if Google and  Facebook suffered the same fate of troubled retailers like Macy's and  Sears?  Well, check out this artist take on exactly that.  A Romanian  graphic artist imagined what some internet companies would physically look  like, like their headquarters that they were struggling.  It's a series  called Social Decay, he is, by the way, Maria, Adobe Photoshop and 3D  programming to create it and it's getting a lot of attention, Maria,  because of frankly the realistic look of these digital renderings, it  looked like actual buildings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thanks, Cheryl.  Coming up. Trouble for General  Electric.  G.E. stock has fallen big time.  Why one of the oldest U.S.  conglomerate, it's a 125-year-old company could now break itself up,   straight ahead.  Then, are you ready for some football?  Super Bowl tickets  this year will reportedly start 950 bucks.  What could happen to those  prices if the Vikings win on Sunday?  Later this hour.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big banks embracing high-tech.  Goldman Sachs  announcing a $250-million partnership with online commercial real estate  investment startup, Cadre.  The deal allows Goldman's private wealth  management clients to invest group Cadre online platforms.  joining me  right now is the CEO of Cadre, he's Ryan Williams.  Ryan, it's good to see  you again.  </p><p>RYAN WILLIAMS, CEO, CADRE:  Great to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And wow, what a huge deal, your company getting $250 million  injection from Goldman.  Explain how this works because this is actually  allowing Goldman clients to get a piece of the action.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  A hundred percent.  So the way that the actual investing  platform and relationship works is Goldman clients have committed and  closed 250 million in capital.  Now that's from a diverse group of their  clients.  It's across the country, across the world and they now have  access to invest in our platform.  And quality real estate investment deals  and otherwise would rather been inaccessible or frankly relating with this.   And so we're really excited about the partnership, it's really the anchor  and the foundation to which we'll raise more capital with Goldman clients.   And then ultimately overtime potentially even expand because there was a  lot of demand.  Goldman is the company, an organization that prides  themselves on being progressive on being technology-oriented and we thought  it's a perfect alignment for what we're looking to build.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain how Cadre works, the platform offers an alternative to  investors other than traditional real estate funds.  Explain Cadre.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sure.  So, really there's three kind of key dynamics that make  Cadre a better opportunity than investing in funds, investing in REITs or  investing direct.  Those are kind of the three primary ways.  First it's  about our team, second, it's about our tactics, third, it's about our tech.   in terms of our team, we're the first company to bring the diverse group of  talent from the likes of Blackstone, Goldman Sachs (INAUDIBLE) Facebook,  Google, Apple Square under one umbrella.  And basically what we've been  able to do is bring more than 40 billion of collective investing experience  with the best of tech world.  </p><p>Coming under one umbrella, we're providing quality access as easy as it  would it be to go on to Amazon and investor buying something.  But they  were also tactically making sure the product we offer has lower fees and  the funds to be up to 40 percent lower in total fees.  And then finally,  technology, right?  We want to make the experience easy.  So we want you,  Maria to be able to go on to our platform, explore quality investment  opportunities and with the click of a button know that you can invest in  quality opportunities with a degree of trust that otherwise would never  been accessible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me how the new tax law changes things and why you feel  that that's going to be a beneficiary in terms of working with Cadre.  </p><p>WYDEN:  Sure.  So, the beauty of real estate and why we're so passionate  about unlocking more access because again it's been constrained to a few  folks.  It's that it's a tax-efficient asset class to invest in?  Right?   You benefit from depreciation, you can roll forward, a lot of your losses.   You know, generally, there has been efficient opportunities to create  better tax-adjusted returns for people.  The new tax bill had some pass- through regulations and reforms that actually make it even more efficient  for LLCs and partnerships to reduce that overall tax loads.  So if you  combine the tax efficiencies from this new pass-through, our reform you  look at the natural kind of ability to invest in real estate being  something that's quality and, you know, it's kind of a one-plus-one-equals- three dynamic, and we want more people to access that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We should point out.  You partnered with Jared Kushner and his  brother Josh Kushner on this venture.  How much day-to-day influences do  the Kushner brothers have on this business?  Obviously, Jared is the top  level White House advisor.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sure.  So, you know, we have a diverse group of investors.  If I  were to go through the list of investors, you say we have almost a  political rainbow here, right across every spectrum and I think the best  companies and organizations have transcended value right in that, you know,  again, goes beyond any political affiliations.  Jared Kushner was an  initial early partner and investor, Josh Kushner, Thrive Capital invests  with us.  But again, we have folks like Ford Foundation, Goldman Sachs,  S.L. Green. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Peter Thiel.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Founders Fund.  Founders Fund, right? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is another investor.  Funders Fund, right.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Mark Cuban is one of our investors.  So again, there's a diverse  group of investors across the political spectrum.  What we focused on is  building what we believe will be one of the best business of our  generation, again, so more people can invest.  That's a testament to  Goldman.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Tell me where the growth comes from at Cadre in the coming  five years.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Sure.  So, first and foremost we want to make sure that we're  expanding nationally, right?  With real estate opportunities.  When I  started the company, it's primarily based out of New York.  We've been able  to expand and grow into multiple markets.  You know, we have a billion in  assets on our platform right now.  We're going to probably double that over  the next 12 months here in the U.S.  Over time we want to do is expand  internationally and then explore opportunities across asset classes, right?   Real estate is a quality asset class to invest in but it's not the only  asset class we think more people should be able to invest in or that our  investors invest in.  So maybe there's an opportunity for infrastructure or  natural resources or timber and oil, private equity, a lot of these  verticals are historically have been opaque and challenging for people to  access, we want to change.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  Where are the best opportunities right now for  real estate in the country?  Geographically speaking or even sector  speaking, where do you find value?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So we find a lot of value in a few sectors.  First, multifamily,  right?  We believe that people always need somewhere to live and we're  focused on cash tax -- adjusted in the second yield, right?  So we want to  make sure that people can invest in quality opportunities that are existing  asset in and around gateway markets.  So we focus on a lot of multifamily  across our portfolio.  We actually think there is a lot of quality  opportunities in the office sector as well.  We like office because again  you can buy their pretty good basis today given there's so many quality  operating partners bring us skills. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you avoid high-tax states?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, we focus first -- look, this is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  Because tax law changes.  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  It's a hundred percent something we focus on in terms of just  overall returns to our investors.  I think the beauty of real estate,  right?  Is the largest asset class in the world also the most imperfect, so  there's always bound to the inefficiencies.  So like stocks, you get a good  management team that can find opportunities.  So for us, it's really about  micro-level investing.  We overlay the macros well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to take the company public soon?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  I think we'll focus on this year, the following year.  Like I  told our team all the time, we do the right thing, we focus on value to our  users, to our customers.  I think we'll trancede NASDAQ -- exceed rather,  anyone's expectations and IPO, who knows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  At some point?  </p><p>WILLIAMS:  Potentially, yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ryan, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Thank you for having me.  Appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on that huge injection from  Goldman.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Thank you, Maria, appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a break.  The impact of President Trump's tax plan  on wineries in California coming up.  How the industry is cashing in big  time with the new reforms.  And then Goldman Sachs reporting earnings four  quarter earnings this morning beating earnings and revenue expectations.   We break down those numbers, the stock still lower this morning by a  fraction.  Stay with us.</p><p>LEIF SHIRAS, TENNIS CHANNEL COMMENTATOR:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court report.

Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, January  17th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Wall Street  in record territory again, the Dow Industrials yesterday cracked another  all-time high and milestone of 26,000 stocks came off of the highs however  and closed lower erasing all of the games and then some closing down about  10 points on the Dow.  President Trump touting this market's record run.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We've enacted massive tax cuts, you've seen it, you've seen what's  happening.  I have to tell you that far beyond our expectations we have  made a tremendous amount of progress in a very, very short period of time.   When you look at what's gone on with the employment, when you look at what  has gone on with the stock market, we have created now almost $8 trillion  worth of value just in the stock market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Checking the action this morning, we are an hour away from the  open and the markets are back in record territory once again.  Dow  Industrials up 96 points this morning, a third of a percent high.  This is  off of the highs of the morning but nonetheless look at that a very strong  opening for stocks about an hour.  In Europe this morning, stocks are lower  FTSE 100 and the DAX Index down about a quarter of a percent of piece.  The  CAC Quarante in Paris is also down fractionally.  In Asia overnight, stocks  closed mixed as you see, Hang Seng index and the Shanghai were higher.   Financial earnings in focus, Bank of America reporting mixed results for  the fourth quarter Goldman Sachs hurt by weak trading at a $4 billion hit  from tax reform.  Call it crypto crash, Bitcoin sold off trading near  $10,000 now after new concerns over government regulation.  The end of era  for General Electric could be at hand, the company eyes are breakup as it  struggles to shore up business, the stock continues to trade down another  2-1/2 percent right now.  </p><p>McKayla Maroney no longer has to worry about a nondisclosure agreement she  signed about the abuse she faced at the hands of Dr. Larry Nassar.  USA  Gymnastics will not pursue a fine if she speaks out but two celebrities  also stepped up with an offer to pay.  Plus the Super Bowl just over two  weeks away and we have the first look at ticket prices, the lowest ticket  price get this $950.  Good luck getting it with that price meanwhile.  </p><p>All that coming up but first this nearly 100 days of record closes on the  Dow since President Trump's election.  Listen to what FedEx CEO Frederick  Smith told Stuart Varney about his tax reform.  And how it's boosting  optimism for the bottom line.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FREDERICK SMITH, CEO, FEDEX:  The market is reflecting growth around the  world which of course we see, we serve 220 countries nobody sees the global  economy the way we do.  And it's pretty well synced up and you have a  better situation for business with the reduction and regulations and most  importantly this tax bill.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is America First Policies policy advisory  and former CKE restaurants CEO, Andy Puzder.  Andy, good to see you.</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, CEO, CKE RESTAURANTS:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So how would you  characterize where things are right now?  We know that the market has been  trading on real fundamentals, people are also expecting four percent  economic growth this year.  What can you tell us in terms of what you're  seeing?  </p><p>PUZDER:  Look.  I think it's spectacular.  This is the most booming economy  that I can ever remember experiencing and I, you know, I was 30 years old  in my 30s during the Reagan years.  This -- the energy here is incredible,  the business optimism that and you hear a lot about the big companies in  optimistic there.  I've got friends who are franchisees, you know, small  business owners that were with our company and other companies and they're  talking about building.  They used to talk about how can I build?  How can  I afford to pay for healthcare?  How can I afford to pay this minimum rate  wage increases?  Now they're worried about competing for sites, they're  worried about competing for real estate because there is so much demand.   So I think -- I think we will see four percent next year and I think we are  going to see wage growth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what if the conversation Kevin has changed from how am  I going to pay for all the lawyers and the compliance officers that I need  to keep up with regulation to how am I going to grow?  Where am I going to  invest for growth?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think Andy is bringing up a great point because -- and one  of the reasons why we're seeing this is because of the current tax  environment right.  It was harder for U.S. corporations to invest in the  United States than it was for foreign corporations, right?  And we saw that  happen precipitously with deals ever coming in from overseas and the tax  environment wasn't beneficial, are you seeing -- and I am curious Andy, are  the guys talking about -- pass-through entities, the deductions, what is  the main emphasis for them to invest and deploy their capital into the U.S.  here?  </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, you invest when you believe your business is going to go up  and that you can make a profit.  Another if your costs are down enough that  you can make a significant enough profit that you're willing to risk your  wealth, you're willing to risk your time and what they are seeing is  regulatory costs down, tax costs down, optimism very high, so they're  anticipating growth.  So this isn't rocket science, if people think they  can make money, they will invest in growth.  And what we had during the  Obama years was people -- they didn't believe they could make money so  growth held GDP down now we're seeing more investment, even before the tax  bill we've seen an increase in investment which is what the GDP to three  percent.  Now we're going to see really I think very, very substantial  investment.  The big problem for small businesses is the Dodd-Frank.   Because it killed a lot of the community banks but there are lenders out  there and they will continue to look for money and build as long as they  believe they can make money at it.  </p><p>CARRIE SHEFFIELD, FOUNDER, BOLD:  Andy, in addition (INAUDIBLE) what are  you seeing on regulatory side because I know for example on the labor side  there was this big Obama era regulation around to an employer mandate and  all this sort of regulation.  Are you seeing released in this while in  addition to tax reform?  </p><p>PUZDER:  Absolutely it's both joining employer and minimum wage.  Now wages  are going up because of competition but they're not being forced up to  where you're reducing the profitability.  These companies are actually  competing for employees with growth.  And joining employer was a very, very  fearful thing for small business particularly franchise businesses because  it looked like the franchisors, the larger companies are going to end up  controlling their labor costs.  Well, that is not franchising at that point  you are a subsidiary of the big company and entrepreneurs don't want that.   Now that trade is gone, so people are very excited as I said we're seeing - - we're seeing a lot of building.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  We talked about the investment that you had.  Morgan Stanley  plan index just said that 2007 -- since 2007 the biggest CapEx spending has  happened mainly since President Trump and the perception of business  current administration, low-interest rates, people already building a lot  of CapEx.  Do you see a lot of extra CapEx being spent -- being built with  this repatriation?  I call it repatriation money, I just don't think we're  going to see a lot of CapEx because we already -- you've already seen a lot  of it.</p><p>PUZDER:  Well, I -- you know we ever really have seen the money come back  yet so you are not seeing it I think you will see it going forward.  But  the big -- you know, where I see, you know, look, I would get same numbers  everybody else looks at.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics you look and see  how much money, if the census period when you look at whether GDP has gone  up and you look at -- they see -- whether it is because people invested or  not and they have been saying during the Obama administration, people  weren't investing kept GDP down.  The last two quarters, the investment has  gone up.  So this -- again, it's not rocket science if you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do they have to -- </p><p>PUZDER:  You get investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they have to bring the money back?  And I was surprised that  a 15-1/2 repatriation rate, we were talking 10 percent, we were talking  eight percent 15-1/2 percent is -- do they have to bring the money back at  this point?</p><p>PUZDER:  I don't think they have to bring the money back but I think they  will want to bring it back, people want to build and invest in the United  States.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they will at 15-1/2 percent you think?</p><p>PUZDER:  Yes.  Well, I mean if you're in Germany and you can invest in the  United States without a tax penalty, you could your bring money here to  invest if you make money in Germany and you pay higher than 15 percent,  you're not going to bring back competitive with Germany.  So I think we  will see investment, I -- we just haven't seen it yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, I was speaking to one investment pro this week.   And he said to me that he spoke with a lot of the companies that they own,  this private equity guy.  And he said that in Europe, they are saying you  know what we were planning on investing in Europe but we are going to  switch those plans and we're going to invest in America because of this tax  plan.  This is actually changing behavior across the world.  </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, in Japan, Germany, China and they've all expressed distress  at the fact that we passed this tax bill.  That's a good thing for us,  that's something we want in the United States.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  We're competitive before, right?  If you looked at the worldwide  averages was that 22-1/2 percent, we reached 35, we already complete  disadvantage I mean that's the thing.  So now they're freaking out, they're  trying to figure out if you look at -- if you look at the U.K. they are at  20 percent, they are looking to go to 17-1/2 percent.  </p><p>PUZDER:  We were the fastest runner on the track.  We were running with leg  weights, we just took them off.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy, are you going to go back to the White House? </p><p>PUZDER:  Look political -- I am glad you asked that.  They ran an article  claiming that I was getting an offer from the White House.  I told them  that I hadn't heard anything about it, they called friends of mine and all  of them said they heard nothing about it.  I talked to friends in the White  House who heard nothing about it, they just made this up basically to  reraise the salacious allegations from my divorce 30 years ago.  They try  and raise from whatever they can I, you know, it's -- I don't know.  But  there was nothing, I have no discussions about going back but if the  president ask me to mow the lawn, I would mow the lawn.  Whatever is going  to make this administration work, I'm happy to help but right now I'm  focused on doing it as a private citizen and enjoying myself.  I think I am  having -- my wife said, you know, I would like to see you be a secretary of  labor would have been great, it would be good for the country but aren't we  really having a lot more fun?  That, you know, she's kind of right.  BARTIROMO:  You must have an opinion about the 18 states that just raised  the minimum wage.  </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, as long as they don't -- the key with the minimum wage is  not to raise it above where competition has driven it.  And I think what  we've seen with Wal-Mart going to $11 an hour in a lot -- in a lot of -- in  a major sections of the country that will set the minimum wage, competition  will set it.  If you want the best employees, if you are running a muffler  shop or a restaurant, you're competing with Wal-Mart for those employees.   And if you want the best you're going to have to meet their price.  So if  the minimum wage goes from 7.50 to 8.50 to 9.50 at this point it really  doesn't matter much.  </p><p>The economy is growing at such a pace, the competition is outstripping  government and really government -- when government sets those rates the  only thing the federal government can do is set the lowest possible rate  because if you don't then places that are economically distressed like  let's say Birmingham or Memphis, Tennessee if you drive them to $15 an hour  you hurt them you don't help anybody.  So you can't set it to what you got,  what you got in Seattle or San Francisco you have to set it low.   Competition drives it, it's kind of like a tide that drives to where the  tide goes and Wal-Mart has just taken a big step in moving to 11.  And I  think people should be excited about that, President Obama wanted 10-10,  Wal-Mart went to 11.  Let's praise them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  If you were labor secretary, what would have been the very  first thing you would have done in office?  What would be your top  priority?  </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, the first thing I would have done was try and get people in  there to help run the department.  They're still the person that I wanted  to have my number two it's the same person that Alex Acosta wants his  number two.  And, you know, I thought the person would be approved by mayor  -- and they're still not approved.</p><p>SHEFFIELD:  Wow.</p><p>PUZDER:  So you really -- you got -- you go into -- you go into this agency  and you've got people that are right then and there, you've got resistance  within your agency.  And it's not like a private business where you can  start firing people and bring everybody in line.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PUZDER:  But I would have worked on joint employer, the overtime regulation  you know really focused on things that drive jobs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy, great to have you on the show.  </p><p>PUZDER:  Great to be here, Maria.  Thank you.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Andy Puzder joining us there.  We will be  right back.  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FOUNDER, XLR-8:  I hope that -- you know, I hope the swan  song here isn't, you know, pushed down 28,000 corporate people, put them  into businesses, move them out, sell the final three, and then all of a  sudden G.E. goes away of Westinghouse.  It would be a terrible -- a  terrible saga for a legacy company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, unfortunately, that is the conversation.  That was G.E.'s  former transportation CEO Bob Nardelli on the company possibly breaking up.   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more  details there.  Nic, the stock is lower this morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Maria.  Again, to the downside.   I mean, this is a stock of legacy company as he said.  This is one of our  oldest conglomerates, 125-year-old company and it's down again.  Down two  percent.  First of all, they're suffering yet from yesterday's headlines of  the $6.2-billion charge in G.E. Capital.  The company has had a new CEO in  place.  They've been slashing the dividends, selling off assets, but the  breakup has been back on the table, the talk that Flannery may have been  really orchestrating this for some time.  And then, it may be difficult  because of pensions and debt structure but that it can be done, that it  won't be completely broken up as we noted 300,000 employees under the  umbrella there.  So, a name that's been under pressure for the last year,  at least.</p><p>Taking a look at some of the banks, Goldman Sachs out with its numbers,  have beat the estimates of $4.4-billion charge related to Trump's tax  reform did push the company to first-quarter loss.  You can see Goldman  Sachs down one percent this morning.  Did well on its revenue, the banking  revenue, IPOs underwriting.  And then there's a look at Bank of America  which is slightly higher.  They did beat on the net profit slump on the  adjusted income beat.  So, there's the banks for you, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nic, thank you so much.  Nicole is on the floor.   Meanwhile, an unhealthy response to a clean bill of health.  Mainstream  media reporters on the attack yesterday, poking and prodding at President  Trump's physical exam report, asking the White House doctor outrageous  questions.  It was incredible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Does the President wear dentures?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you ruling out things like early onset  Alzheimer's, are you looking at dementia-like symptoms.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is there anything you're keeping from us for privacy  reason?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's weight, I think he's a 239, right?  That's -- it  seems just shy of obesity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're confident of that number and did you do any  measurement?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE) where the president appears to slur his  words while giving an address.  Did you look into what the cause of that  might have been at all?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a charade.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney now  with his thoughts.  Stu, I tweeted out in the middle of it yesterday.  No  words.  I -- it was just incredible.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  It was a disgrace.  That's what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a disgrace.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean, when you got a White House press corps asking the  president's doctor about dementia, obesity, how much sleep does he get?   How about his eating of ice cream, how much golf does he play?  I think  they delivered a black eye to themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me too.</p><p>VARNEY:  I thought they looked just ridiculous quite frankly.  Childish,  petulant, and ever eager to have a go at President Trump.  Do you really  think that they would ask anything like those questions to President  Obama's doctor who was the same doctor as President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who smoked, right?  He was a -- he was a big smoker, by the  way.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  That's right.  They never asked that question, certainly  not.  Oh, when did you quit, Mr. President?  That's what they would have  said.  I think it was a distraction from what's going on in the economy and  the markets.  And I've got Eric Trump on this program about 50 minutes  away.  He's going to sit right next to me.  I'm going to ask him what do  you feel like when your dad's mental health is questioned?  I'll ask him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I'm going to be watching that interview, Stu, for  sure.  All in the face of the doctor repeatedly saying the president is in  excellent health.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they wanted more.  They kept prodding.  It was incredible.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Ridiculous!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in 10 minutes, Stu.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Devastating news from the college football  world.  Jared Max with the story.  Jared?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Maria, Tyler Hilinksi, 21-year-old  quarterback for the Washington State Cougars college football team is dead  from an apparent suicide.

She received this as part of  a $1.25-million settlement from USA Gymnastics.  Now, the NDA said Maroney  could not share details about her about abuse at the hands of Nassar.   Well, yesterday, USA Gymnastics said it would not find her if she speaks  out.  Meanwhile, model Chrissy Teigen tweeted support for Maroney, saying  the entire principal of this should be fought.  An NDA to stay quiet about  the serial monster with over 140 accusers.  But I would be absolutely  honored to pay this fine for you.  Actress Kristen Bell also said that she  would help pay any fine.</p><p>You're going to have to pay a big-time cost if you want to attend Super  Bowl LII, February 4th in Minneapolis.  According to Yahoo! Sports, the  face value of Super Bowl tickets begins at $950, goes all the way to 5,000.   Of course, these are face value prices.  The cheapest tickets on StubHub  right now $4500 and that's for the $950 ticket, so about three to four  times as somebody a broker told Yahoo! Sports, if the Vikings win Sunday, a  lot of folks in Minnesota are going to be selling their fishing boats next  week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.  It's such a horrible story about the  suicide.  Jared's sports reports on Fox News headlines 24/7 or Sirius XM  115.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER: From CNN's New York headquarters, the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR WITH LOU DOBBS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, HOST: Good evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global financial markets today continued their stunning decline. The Dow Jones Industrials fell another 210 points, bringing the two- day loss to a staggering 437 points.  Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin today blamed a herd mentality for the battering of global markets and broadly outlined a new plan to head off a global recession.  And in Washington, warnings of possible military action to end the slaughter of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.</p><p>We begin tonight on Wall Street where stocks fell precipitously for the second day.  The Dow tumbled 210 points, down 2-1/2 percent. The Nasdaq fell nearly 5 percent in its fourth biggest point less ever.  A staggering $600 billion of market value has been erased in the past two days as the world's economic crisis continues to pound Wall Street.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler covered today's events from the New York Stock Exchange, joins me now live from the CNNfn Newsroom with a report.</p><p>Rhonda.</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, for the first time ever, the Dow has dropped 200 points two days in a row, and like yesterday, this sell-off was global.  Stock markets from Asia to Europe to Latin America fell sharply, deepening investors' fears of a world slipping dangerously close to recession.  The Dow Industrials today lost 210 points, closing at 7,632.  The selling was even steeper on the Nasdaq where the market took out some big-name tech stocks. The Nasdaq plummeted nearly 5 percent, closing at 1,612.</p><p>And once again, the winner in all of this was the U.S. bond market.  When investors flocked to the stability of this government- backed security, it gained 1-1/4 points, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, falling to another all-time low, today closing at 4.87 percent.</p><p>Lou, back to you.</p><p>DOBBS: Rhonda, thank you.  Rhonda Schaffler. Well, as global stocks were tumbling today, the chairman of the Federal Reserve acknowledged just how fragile world markets have become.  In congressional testimony, Alan Greenspan said the failure of a single hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, could have resulted in severe widespread and prolonged disruptions to financial market activity.  In New York today, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said global financial reforms are urgently needed to end the crisis.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT RUBIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: In the short term, the international community has worked aggressively to limit the damage from what is in some ways probably the most serious financial crisis of the past 50 years.</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): But the Treasury secretary said the work so far is not nearly enough to stem what he called vast and systemic disruptions in global markets.  He said the United States will push governments, international institutions, and private lenders to be more open and more careful in their financial dealings.</p><p>R. RUBIN: Both the concrete steps and the proposals for further work will basically deal with three areas: improving transparency, strengthening national financial systems, especially in emerging markets and developing countries, and improving response to international crisis, including appropriate private-sector involvement.</p><p>FRANK: The Treasury secretary urged the International Monetary Fund to pressure countries that fail to take tough reform measures. To make those reforms stick without setting off social unrest, he said, the international community also must have a social safety net.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was addressing one piece of the puzzle: the need for government involvement in the rescue of a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.</p><p>ALAN GREENSPAN, FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD CHAIRMAN: The plight of LTCM might scarcely have caused a ripple in financial markets or among financial regulators 18 months ago, but in current circumstances, it was judged to warrant attention.</p><p>FRANK (on camera): The first test of the new U.S. resolve to bolster countries that adopt economic reform may come within the week in Brazil, and the Treasury secretary said the United States and other countries are ready to help Brazil fend off economic contagion from other emerging markets.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) DOBBS: We'll have much more later on the global economic crisis. Ahead, complete coverage of the market losses, both on Wall Street and around the world, analysis of Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony on hedge funds, and my guests tonight are the secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, and we'll be joined by one of the nation's most prominent hedge fund managers Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisers.</p><p>In Washington this afternoon, House Democrats met in private hoping to settle on a strategy in the battle over ground rules for impeachment hearings.  Democrats are pushing for rules that would limit the hearings in both scope and duration, but Republicans appear content to follow the precedent of Watergate for a more open-ended format.</p><p>Bob Franken has the story from Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB FRANKEN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They're meeting now.  Both Republicans and Democrats huddling in a series of closed sessions.  The House Democrats are trying to hammer out their alternative to the Watergate model rules for an impeachment inquiry favored by the Republican leader of the Judiciary Committee Henry Hyde.</p><p>SEN. JOHN CONYERS (D-MI), JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: This is a little bit more than a chess game.</p><p>FRANKEN: Actually, it is a chess game right now.  Democrats say their package won't be completed today but that the highlights have already been publicly discussed.  They want a strict time limit imposed on the investigation instead of the open-ended schedule contemplated by the Republicans.</p><p>CONYERS: We're talking four to six weeks or -- you know, we're talking about a reasonable period of time that we would negotiate.</p><p>FRANKEN: They also want to restrict the investigation to the Lewinsky matter.  Republicans want to leave the proceedings open.  In an attempt to limit the scope, Democrats have written a letter to Republicans asking that independent counsel Ken Starr let them know if he has any further information that might apply to impeachment.  If there are no such referrals, they wrote, then the committee can easily confine the scope and duration of the review.  But Republicans are resisting any talk of limiting the investigation.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We must follow the truth wherever it leads and get an expeditious review of the process -- of the matter and an expeditious resolution of the matter but not under some arbitrary time line that does not make any sense for us to follow.</p><p>FRANKEN: Still to be decided: whether to put forth a Democratic- backed motion of censure against President Clinton as an alternative to an impeachment investigation.  That is a sensitive subject for Democrats. CONYERS: Members come up to me -- none of -- I haven't seen any today that have said it, but I've been getting it all last week, that this would be a highly regarded method and an alternative.  So it is still under contemplation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANKEN: Democrats are going to hold a news conference tomorrow morning to announce the specifics of their counterproposal.  Remember: The Republicans are in the majority.  It's up to them to decide exactly what the rules will be.  The only thing Democrats can do is complain, if they want to, that the Republicans are being too partisan and see how that plays with the public.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Bob, as it now appears then, the Watergate hearings will be the structure for these hearings, should they come about?</p><p>FRANKEN: Probably so.  Now the Republicans probably will negotiate some.  Democrats, for instance, will propose a specific time line, and Republicans might decide that they can come up with some sort of acceptable compromise.  But, yes, Watergate is the model.</p><p>DOBBS: Bob Franken reporting from Capitol Hill.  Thank you.</p><p>Well, while Congress debates the ground rules, the White House is quietly lobbying Democrats to stand by the president and to vote against impeachment hearings, and CNN has learned that the lobbying is surprisingly aggressive.  Both the president and his wife, despite their diminished political capital within their own party, are trying to play hardball.</p><p>John King has our report from the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A show of Democratic unity on the issues as the White House lobbies aggressively for a similar show of support in the impeachment debate.</p><p>MIKE MCCURRY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What we're trying to do is put forward the most powerful and persuasive argument we can put forward that will convince members of the House that an inquiry is not warranted.</p><p>KING: The first lady is among those making the case to House Democrats in recent days, and CNN has learned she's playing a little political hardball.  Several sources say the first lady is casting the investigation as a political vendetta against her husband and arguing that Democrats have an obligation to vote against an impeachment inquiry.  Two of these sources describe the first lady's pitch as adamant and say it includes a blunt message that the White House will be reluctant to offer campaign help to Democrats who support an inquiry, but early estimates suggest 50 or more Democrats might vote yes. SEN. JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (D), CONNECTICUT: But the hard fact is that there is no quick end in sight.  The president by his own words is not going to resign, and the House by its leaders' own words is going to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry.</p><p>KING: The president is steering clear of the impeachment debate in public but using his events to make the case the Republican Congress isn't paying attention to the things that matter most.</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And yet no issue has suffered more from misplaced priorities and partisan pursuits than American's public schools.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KING: There is, of course, considerable irony in the first lady's role defending her husband.  In the last impeachment debate a quarter century ago, young Hillary Rodham worked for House Judiciary Committee Democrats building the impeachment case against Richard Nixon.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: John, thank you.  John King reporting from the White House.</p><p>Also in Washington today, opening statements in the corruption trial of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.  Espy is accused of taking illegal gifts, of lying about it, and then trying to get a friend to cover up for him.  Espy allegedly accepted $35,000 worth of travel, sports tickets, luggage, and other goods from businesses regulated by his department.  Prosecutors call Espy a \"super sports fan\" who was chronically short of money.  Espy pleaded not guilty to those changes last year.  The trial is expected to last at least six weeks.</p><p>Coming up next on the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR, the Clinton administration's national security team today goes to Capitol Hill trying to lay the groundwork for military action in Kosovo.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Western powers could be on the brink of military intervention in Kosovo.  The United Nations Security Council is meeting at this hour in emergency session.  International efforts to stop the unrest took on new urgency this week after reports of two separate Serb massacres of ethnic Albanians.  In one attack, 12 men were killed.  In another, 18 people, including women and children, were mutilated.  Serbs deny they had anything to do with those massacres and, today, they invited international experts to look into the alleged attacks.</p><p>Richard Roth is at the United Nations and has an update on today's emergency meeting.</p><p>Richard. RICHARD ROTH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, the U.N. Security Council has been meeting for about two hours.  It's expected to break momentarily.  The Council is expected to issue a press statement -- thus, it's not an official document regarding the Kosovo situation -- and there is likely to be no talk of any military force to be used now or in the near future.</p><p>The Council is expected to condemn the atrocities that you referred to in Kosovo and also to call on the Belgrade government to identify and punish those responsible.  However, the Security Council is on record as saying further measures may be taken against Serbia or perhaps the Kosovo Liberation Army, but, once again, with China and Russia not willing to sign on at this point to any document calling for force, we're at least several days away from further legal diplomatic authorization of any NATO air strikes.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Richard, thank you.  Richard Roth reporting from the United Nations.</p><p>The Clinton administration today sent its national security team to brief Capitol Hill on the Kosovo situation.  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger telling senators about alleged Serb atrocities against ethnic Albanians.  They laid out what Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should do to avoid military action against his forces.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM COHEN, DEFENSE SECRETARY: There are several things he must do.  He must pull back his armed forces.  He must pull back the police.  He must allow the NGOs -- the nongovernmental organizations and agencies to provide humanitarian relief.  He must allow for the displaced persons to return to their homes and then sit down and seek a diplomatic solution to the conflict.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Also today, the State Department warned Americans not to travel to Serbia or Montenegro.  A possible indication that military action is imminent.</p><p>NATO's top decision makers have completed their plans for possible air strikes against Serb forces.  NATO has been working for months on plans to intervene in Kosovo.</p><p>Military affairs correspondent Jamie McIntyre reports on what NATO Has in mind if, in fact, it should act.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sources say NATO's attacks begin with cruise missile strikes from U.S. ships and possibly B-52 bombers to disable Yugoslav air defenses. That would pave the way for an escalating bombing campaign by NATO warplanes, if President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't capitulate.</p><p>KEVIN BACON, PENTAGON SPOKESMAN: Unless he immediately begins to meet the demands that the international community have made that -- he faces the possibility of a very punishing military strike.</p><p>MCINTYRE: NATO officials say Milosevic has only a matter of days to order an end to the killing of civilians in Kosovo and allow the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees to their homes.</p><p>JAMES RUBIN, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: It is not going to be enough for him to simply play cat and mouse with the international community.</p><p>MCINTYRE: Sources say, while NATO will make a show of participation by all 16 of its member nations, plans call for up to 80 percent of the bombing to be done by U.S. planes.  The United States has some 40 F-16s at Aviano Air Base in Northern Italy, another 15 F- 18s and F-14s on the aircraft carrier Eisenhower currently on a port call in Greece, and the U.S. has additional strike aircraft in Germany, England, and Turkey which could be moved to forward bases in Italy to beef up the NATO strike force.</p><p>Sources say the bombing would not be limited to the Kosovo province, that all of Serbia proper is fair game.  Targets have been selected to minimize risks to pilots and civilians while crimping Milosevic's military forces.  Sources say the targets could include command headquarters, communications centers, and military installations.</p><p>BACON: If military action is called for, the purpose would be to degrade Milosevic's ability to continue his attacks and reduce his will to continue those attacks as well.</p><p>MCINTYRE: So far, there has been no order by the Pentagon to move any planes or cut short the carrier's port call, a sign that military action, while closer, is not yet imminent.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCINTYRE: And if NATO succeeds in imposing a cease-fire either by force or the threat of force, it leads to another NATO option that no one here much wants to talk about: a possible midwinter deployment of 10s of thousands of NATO troops to keep the peace in an open-ended Bosnia-style deployment.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Jamie, thank you.  Jamie McIntyre reporting from the Pentagon.</p><p>Former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter received a warning from his former boss for speaking out on the subject of Iraq.  Richard Butler wrote Ritter a letter admonishing him for violating the secrecy clause of his United Nations employment contract.  Ritter resigned in protest in August, accusing the United Nations of failing to deal firmly with Iraq's refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors. A belated acknowledgement from the Israeli government tonight that an LL (ph) cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam in 1992 was, in fact, carrying a chemical used to make nerve gas, but the Israeli government insists the chemical was nontoxic and it was not to be used to make sarin nerve gas.  The 1992 LL crash killed 47 people.</p><p>Coming up next on the NEWS HOUR, a scathing indictment of the West in action in the Balkans.  My guest tonight, a journalist, an author whose latest book chronicles the fall of Bosnia and the world's efforts to deal with.  David Reiff is next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Serbs began action against ethnic Albanian separatists in February.  Since then, more than 700 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands driven from their homes.  Word of last week's massacre once again prompted Western nations to take notice of the crisis in the Balkans.</p><p>My guest tonight says air strikes against Serb forces will only aggravate the situation.  He is the author of \"Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West.\"</p><p>David Reiff, good to have you with us on the NEWS HOUR.</p><p>DAVID REIFF, AUTHOR: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: At this point, with NATO, the United Nations discussing and focusing upon Kosovo and what could be, it seems, military action very soon, do you think that they are taking a proper course?</p><p>REIFF: I think that if they imagined a policy for Kosovo, one that would include not just the military action they're contemplating now but some kind of outcome afterwards, a political outcome, military strikes might form part of it, but they have no idea what they're going to do.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, the Clinton administration has obviously focused on the human suffering.  Is it your judgment that that could be, in fact, alleviated by taking action, particularly military air strikes?</p><p>REIFF: I'd have to tell you I don't understand the humanitarian justification.  It's true there's a lot of suffering in Kosovo.  It's also true there's much more suffering in a place like Sudan or Sierra Leone or a lot of other places we all could name.</p><p>DOBBS: Where there are plenty of refugees.</p><p>REIFF: Where there are plenty of refugees.  In South Sudan, people are starving to death as we're having this conversation.  The reason to intervene in Kosovo surely is political.  It's surely one -- a question of European stability.  It's about saying Milosevic is a troublemaker.  He has been since the breakup of Yugoslavia the problem in the Balkans.  There are other villains as well, but he's been the problem.  We have to do something, but to strike, launch military strikes, make war on Serbia just for a humanitarian basis seems to me grandstanding.</p><p>DOBBS: Milosevic has been singularly successful in holding the United Nations and the United States and NATO at bay.  Is he, in your judgment, that remarkable a leader, or is he confronting a group of powers who simply have not, as you have said, come forward with an objective that allows them to be effective?</p><p>REIFF: I think it's more the latter than the former.  Milosevic is a clever guy and a shrewd politician, but he's also a fairly typical, central casting thug.  We don't know what we want.  This is sound byte diplomacy, to use the famous putdown of Mrs. Albright. This is a wish list.  This isn't a serious policy.  Again, Kosovo is legally a part of Yugoslavia.  Do we want independence for Kosovo?  Is that what we want these bombs to do when the -- Mr. Bacon from the Defense Department says we're going to degrade Milosevic's military capability?  What's the goal?  Nobody's enunciated that.  And what's the legal basis?</p><p>DOBBS: What should, in your judgment, the Clinton administration do?</p><p>REIFF: I think the first thing the Clinton administration needs to do is work out some kind of coherent policy with the NATO allies for what they want the long-term future of Kosovo to be.  The possibilities are obviously the status quo, a return to the autonomy Milosevic took away from the Kosovo Albanians, or independence.</p><p>DOBBS: Milosevic says that he's willing to talk about that.</p><p>REIFF: Well, Milosevic is a famous liar, and without backing some of this up by at least the threat of force, we're not going to get anywhere, but the point is we're putting the car before the horse here.  We don't have a policy.  We're threatening military force in advance of a clearly enunciated policy.  That's why people keep coming back to this humanitarian business, because they can't think of anything else.  They talk about the suffering.  The suffering exists, but it's not the basis for making war on Serbia.</p><p>DOBBS: And those who would suggest that NATO is not entirely the correct framework, that it is a matter, in point of fact, for Italy, for France, and for Germany, even with its new government, to take leadership roles in this instance?</p><p>REIFF: Well, I think it would certainly be better if the Europeans would take the lead, but since they failed to take the lead in Bosnia, it seems hard for me to imagine they'll do it in Kosovo. Frankly, Europe is an economic unit, but it's not a political unit yet, whatever people talk about it at this moment.</p><p>DOBBS: David Reiff, thanks for being here.</p><p>REIFF: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, next on the NEWS HOUR, a very frightening secret report requested by Winston Churchill discovered after more than 50 years. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In London, a document has surfaced offering new evidence that the Cold War could have begun as a very hot war.  A 29-page plan. It was code-named Operation Unthinkable.  It was drawn up at the request of Winston Churchill, and it called for a coordinated surprise attack on the Soviet Union.  The plan came in the days after Germany's surrender in 1945 when an uneasy peace existed between the Anglo- American forces and the Soviet allies.  The hypothetical attack, which would have been led by 47 British and American divisions, was discovered in a public records office and, of course, never used.</p><p>Coming up next, the second half of the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Another brutal, punishing day on Wall Street.  The Dow Jones industrials today dropped 210 points, putting the two-day loss at more than 400 points on the Dow.  The Nasdaq Composite today tumbled almost five percent.  The damage similar to yesterday's, and so was the trigger.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler has report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCHAFFLER (voice-over): Worries about a global economic slowdown and it's impact on corporate profits prompted investors to unload stocks and, once again, snap up Treasury bonds.</p><p>TODD EBERHARD, EBERHARD INVESTMENT ASSOCIATES: Concerns about a recession, possibly, for the U.S. economy, corporate profits certainly are a concern, interest rates are a concern.  A 4.89-percent long bond is very low, but the answer I love to give people is at least you'll make 4.89 percent if you buy that, as opposed to possibly losing a lot of money if you're in the market in certain places.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: The Dow's almost 2.7-percent loss wasn't as steep as the losses among big-tech stocks, which dragged the Nasdaq composite down 4.8 percent.  Among the Nasdaq stocks taking the biggest beating: Microsoft down $6, Dell and Cisco Systems down more than $4, Yahoo! down more than $16.50, Amazon.com plunging $9 a share.  Financial stocks were also hit hard on fears about hedge fund exposure and weakening earnings.  Profits for major banks are expected to be off more than 40 percent in the third quarter.  Wells Fargo plunged 11- 3/4, Merril Lynch losing about 2-1/2, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shedding more than three, Chase Manhattan down 2-13/32, Citicorp off 4-3/4.</p><p>With the same reasons weighing on the market, few expect a turnaround any time soon.</p><p>LARRY WACHTEL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: I think the 7400 level will probably be tested in the next week or so.  And I think, if it is violated, probably that could create a washout that would finally put a period to this thing -- finally bring on the capitulation that we haven't had up till now.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCHAFFLER: The last two days marked the steepest back-to-back selloffs on Wall Street in over a month.  The latest damage leaves the Dow Jones industrial average off 3-1/2 percent for the year, and investors are wary of October and its history, from the crash of '29 and '87, to last year's dizzying selloff -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Rhonda, thank you.</p><p>Well, taking a closer look at the markets: the Dow Jones tumbling 210 points, tonight at 7632.53.  Volume today, almost 900 million shares, declining issues beating advancers by a better than three-to- one margin.</p><p>And even worse day on the Nasdaq.  That index fell 81 points, losing almost five percent: tonight at 1612.33.  Volume there 856 million shares.  The Nasdaq is still, however, up 2-1/2 percent so far this year; down 20 percent from its record, however.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index also down sharply today.  Down almost 31 points, losing three percent.</p><p>A global sell-off today slammed markets all around the world, beginning in Tokyo, where the Nikkei fell to a 12-year low.  The skid in the German market wiped out all of the gains of the year; Frankfurt's market plummeted 5.5 percent.  The Dax has now dropped a stunning 30 percent in six weeks.  Paris off five percent.  Battered bank shares in London; that index down more than three percent.</p><p>Declining bank stocks and fears of a credit crunch also pounded markets in Latin America.  Brazil off almost 10 percent.  Argentina down almost 8 percent.  Mexico fell five percent.  Chile down just over one percent.</p><p>Another rally, another record in the bond market, however. Continued volatility in global markets again making U.S. treasuries the investment of choice.  The 30-year issue followed yesterday's better-than-two-point surge with a gain today of 1-8/32.  The yield tonight at 4.87 percent; that the lowest level ever for the bond. It's dropped more than a full percentage point this year.</p><p>Despite record-low interest rates, a business credit crunch does threaten the economy.  The Federal Reserve Board reported today the nations' banks, concerned and faced with financial turmoil, are squeezing credit for industry and commerce.</p><p>Bill Dorman has the report from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's becoming harder for big companies to borrow money.  The Federal Reserve conducted a special survey of 54 banks about two weeks ago to judge the impact of recent financial turbulence on the bank loan market. The finding: shrinking demand for corporate loans to buy new factory equipment; a troubling indicator for future business conditions.</p><p>LAWRENCE CHIMERINE, ECONOMIC STRATEGY INSTITUTE: It not only suggests a slowdown in the economy, but clearly the risk of a recession some time in the next 12 months is higher now, by far, than it's been at any time since this expansion began.</p><p>DORMAN: Manufacturing is also slowing, falling for the fourth month in a row.  The survey of purchasing managers show further declines in exports to Asia.  And it's not just factories getting hit by trouble from overseas; farmers are suffering from tumbling crop prices.  Concerns about the U.S. economy are even surfacing at the World Bank, where officials worry that information about bank loans to problem economies may amount to less than full disclosure.</p><p>JAMES WOLFENSOHN, PRESIDENT, WORLD BANK GROUP: I woke up one day to find that over $60 billion had been loaned by Western banks to private companies in Indonesia.  That was an awakening, because it didn't show up in any of the statistics that I was aware of.</p><p>DORMAN: Other troubling statistics are plentiful, from warnings about corporate earnings, to a decline in corporate capital spending plans.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>One bright statistic remains domestic consumer spending, along with continued low unemployment, but as the stock market continues to slide, any corresponding fall in consumer confidence would come at a steep cost to this economy -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Bill, thank you.  Bill Dorman reporting from Washington.</p><p>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan today played defense on Capitol Hill. To a very skeptical House Banking Committee, he was forced to explain the Fed's involvement in last week's $3.5 billion takeover of Long- Term Capital Management, the hedge fund.  Greenspan also argued against direct regulation of the hedge fund industry.</p><p>From Washington, Kelli Arena who with a report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Fed- orchestrated rescue of Long-Term Capital has lawmakers at odds with the Federal Reserve.</p><p>REP. BERNARD SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Not when family farmers get in trouble, not when small business people get in trouble, not when poor people get in trouble, but I guess to get government assistance or the help of the Feds, you've got to be a multi-billionaire gambler.</p><p>ARENA: But the Fed didn't use taxpayer dollars, and Alan Greenspan defended the privately-financed takeover.</p><p>ALAN GREENSPAN, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD: Had the failure of LTCM triggered the seizing up of markets, substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market participants, including some not directly involved with the firm, and could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations, including our own.</p><p>ARENA: Some lawmakers were clearly frustrated.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D), NEW YORK: What kind of banking system do we have where major financial institutions have no idea as to the financial condition or balance sheet of the borrower they're extending credit to?</p><p>ARENA: There are about 4,000 hedge funds controlling hundreds of billions of dollars in investments for wealthy individuals.  But Greenspan argues government regulation would result in big funds moving abroad, making them even harder to monitor.  In addition, no regulation is foolproof.</p><p>GREENSPAN: But they make mistakes.  They're human beings.  And I think they will continue to do so.  And I know of no set of supervisory actions we can take that will prevent people from making dumb mistakes.  I know of no piece of legislation that can be passed by the Congress which would require us to prevent them from making dumb mistakes.</p><p>ARENA: But other market regulators suggested a more aggressive approach, in cooperation with international partners.</p><p>BROOKSLEY BORN, COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMM.: I do think transparency, disclosure, availability of information, is very important.</p><p>ARENA (on camera): Arguments over regulating hedge funds will continue on several fronts: not only on Capitol Hill, but within the G-7, and as part of the president's working group on financial markets.</p><p>Kelli Arena, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Coming up next on MONEYLINE: one of the legends of the hedge fund industry, Leon Cooperman of Omega.  But first, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will map out a solution to the world's financial crisis.  He's my guest next on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus\": the global economic crisis. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin today warned that this is in some ways, the worst economic crisis in 50 years.  A crisis, that the secretary has a plan to deal with.  Secretary Rubin joins me now. Good to have you with us.</p><p>R. RUBIN: Good to be with you Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: An international framework, a new approach -- give us if you will, some sense of what needs to be done immediately. R. RUBIN: Well, let me break this into two pieces.  We have been over the course of now, a little bit more than a year, very intensely focused on dealing with the crisis that's in front of us, through a whole range of measures.  We have also been, at the same time focused, on building an architecture on the kinds of changes we are going to need if we are going to have a global financial system that really works for the 21st century.  One grounded in a market based economy, but at the same time dealing with the kinds of problems that can develop in markets.</p><p>DOBBS: The IMF, World Bank, G-7 -- institutions with a great tradition and history, -- what more needs to be done institutionally?</p><p>R. RUBIN: I think there's a great deal that is going to have to happen if we're going to have what we need five, 10, 15 years from now.  The IMF, clearly is going to have to become far more transparent, more accountable.  I believe there will have to be a review of the kinds of programs and policies that they follow. Although, I think that they have on balance done a good job in the face of extraordinarily complex situations over the course of the past year.</p><p>I think, Lou, there is going to have to be a very intense focus on how to provide incentives for developing countries to put in place sound financial systems and banking systems.  And for the industrial country, financial institutions to much more rigorously focus on risks in their credit extension and provision of portfolio capitol.</p><p>DOBBS: Is there anything to the idea that this global financial crisis is providing something of a ring out for those countries, particularly emerging countries, that have resisted transparency, that have resisted regulation -- that there is or should be at least a clear cut understanding now on the part of the leaderships of those countries that they are going to have to move to meet market demands for transparency, for stability, and for security?</p><p>R. RUBIN: I think one of the clear -- I think you are onto something very important.  I think one of the clear lessons of this past year is that countries that have economic policy regimes that are unsound will pay a very heavy price in the global financial markets. But unfortunately, what is also happening now is that just as investors and creditors probably were careless because of sustained good times when capital flowed in, they're now, in effect, withdrawing -- in a sense with a herd mentality.</p><p>So the countries that have had very good reform programs and reform regimes are being affected by a kind of contagion.  That's one of the things that we're all focusing on trying to limit to the extent possible. DOBBS: Specifically in Latin America, Brazil -- I would think would be foremost in your outlook.  Brazil, President Cardoso in an election this Sunday -- Brazil has accomplished tremendous gains over the past three, four years, yet they are under an incredible threat right now.  What can this government and those institutions that we just talked about -- the IMF, the World Bank -- do to provide some sort of help support to Brazil? R. RUBIN: Well, the first step, has now been taken by President Cardoso himself, who about two weeks ago gave a speech in which he said he was going to make fiscal discipline and Social Security reform the centerpiece of his next term -- very important in terms of dealing with Brazil's challenges.</p><p>I think probably what I -- the most I ought to say at that point, Lou -- and I have said before -- is that Brazil is very important to the economic well being of the region -- the United States.  And all of us are very much focused -- the international community is very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful if need be.</p><p>DOBBS: But is this management -- this leadership of the International Monetary Fund, at this point -- they have been criticized, they've understated the crisis in Asia.  They have understated the crises in Russia.  Today Yevgeny Primikov threatened the Soviet style controls -- the Russian economy should (UNINTELLIGIBLE) more than four billion dollars not be delivered by the IMF.  Give us your judgment of this leadership and its track record.</p><p>R. RUBIN: I don't agree with the, what is in effect the premise of your question, Lou.  The IMF is faced dealing with, what really in many ways are -- as you correctly said -- unprecedented problems and exceedingly complex problems.  I think on balance they have made the right judgment, although there are no sure, no easy answers.  Once they put a program in place -- and these programs are very carefully tailored to the circumstance in each country -- they then have adjusted the program as circumstances have warranted.</p><p>But they are dealing with an extremely complex set of problems that have developed over many, many years.  I think as one thinks about it, one has to think of limiting the damage as the world works its way through a very difficult period.  Clearly, I might add, I do believe there will be very substantial reform in the IMF and needs to be.</p><p>DOBBS: And the U.S. markets are severely challenged, particularly over the past two months -- give us your best judgment on the state of the U.S. economy -- the state of the markets.  I want to ask you to lay out a course for interest rates -- but give us your best characterization?</p><p>R. RUBIN: I think, Lou, we still, as the most likely scenario going forward, have solid growth and low inflation.  But I think it is also equally clear that this international crisis is affecting some sectors significantly and is creating a greater risk for the overall economy.  The two most significant things that could happen in the world in terms of our economic well being, are, number one, for Japan to get back on track because of the enormous importance that would have for the rest of the world.</p><p>And secondly, something we can do, which is to provide funding for the International Monetary Fund.  The United States has not yet committed to provide the funding the president requested over a year ago.  And the rest of the world is waiting for that action.  Once that happens, the whole world will make their contributions and the IMF will then again have the resources they need to deal with the kind of crises that so affect our economic interests.</p><p>DOBBS: The bailed out orchestrated by the Federal Reserve -- before Capitol Hill in testimony there, you offered some cautionary words.  Give us your judgment about the bail out?</p><p>RUBIN: You're talking about LTCM?</p><p>DOBBS: The Long-Term Capital -- yes.</p><p>RUBIN: I don't think it was a bail out, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's a bail out in the sense that capital was provided from a number of firms to Long-Term Capital, which would not have had sufficient capital to stay in business.  And that was arranged and encouraged by the Federal Reserve.  It was not a bail out by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>RUBIN: There was no public money.  It seems to me the Federal Reserve Board of New York provided a useful function.  They made a judgment that there were possible systemic risks.  I'm not close enough to know whether those judgments are right or wrong, but I have enormous respect for the people who made those judgments.  And once they made those judgments they then convened the creditors, but the creditors made their own decisions as to what was in their economic self-interests.</p><p>DOBBS: Is it your judgment that there is sufficient surveillance of -- and oversight of bank lending to hedge funds at this point?</p><p>RUBIN: I think there are two areas there that need focus.  One are hedge funds themselves.  We actually will have -- actually have under way now a study in the financial markets working group which is a group that has Alan Greenspan, myself, and Arthur Levin (ph), and others on it.  We have a focus on the implications of LTCM and more generally issues with respect to hedge funds to determine whether or not there is regulation that would be appropriate.  In terms of the banks themselves, I think there what we need is far greater supervisory focus on proper and effective risk evaluation and credit extension.</p><p>DOBBS: As always, it is great to talk with you, Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin.</p><p>RUBIN: Good to be with you, Lou, thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: We will continue in just one moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: The all but total failure of Long-Term Capital Management and its dramatic takeover, highlight the fragility of the global financial system.  It's also raised news, somewhat troubling questions about largely unregulated pools of capital inhabited by Nobel Prize winners, the world's super rich and Wall Street legends such as John Merriweather, George Soris (ph), Julian Robertson and my guest tonight, Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisers.</p><p>Lee, good to have you with us.</p><p>LEON COOPERMAN, CHAIRMAN, OMEGA ADVISER: Nice to be with you.</p><p>DOBBS: I might say as well, not just hedge funds, but the legend of Wall Street itself.  The hedge funds -- are they unfairly focused upon by the regulators, lawmakers right now, because of Long-Term Capital, in your judgment?</p><p>COOPERMAN: I believe so.  I guess back in 1965 when Jack Nicklaus won the master's tournament, the great golfer Bobbie Jones observed that Jack Nicklaus plays a game of golf with which I'm not familiar with.  Similarly, most of the people I know in the hedge fund business don't manage money in a way that would familiar to what goes on, what happened at Long-Term Capital.</p><p>DOBBS: Will leverage obviously, the principle story at Long-Term Capital.  Give us an example of what is a more typical leverage.</p><p>COOPERMAN: It varies, you know whether you are running an equity fund, or you're running a fixed income fund\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: A (UNINTELLIGIBLE) fund.</p><p>COOPERMAN: \u2026 whether you're specializing in convergence trades.  In our own case, I think that the highest in the last three or four years, we have been roughly $3 of assets per dollar of equity.</p><p>DOBBS: And that is modest by even the classic understanding of what is a hedge fund.  The suggestion, as we just heard from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, that there would be an appropriate road for them in looking over hedge funds.</p><p>What is your reaction to that?</p><p>COOPERMAN: Fine.  I mean all the regulation they want to heap on us is fine.  We're already, in my opinion, in my business very highly regulated.  We have to adhere to Federal Reserve Board margin requirements.  The brokers that we deal with -- they have in house rules regarding margin.  We are registered investment advisers, so the SCC has jurisdiction over us.</p><p>DOBBS: Then how did Long-Term Capital happen?</p><p>COOPERMAN: That's my question.  In my opinion, the question should not be directed towards to hedge funds, per se, but questions should be asked as to how the banks and the brokerage industry lent $116 billion to one borrower with $4 billion of equity.</p><p>DOBBS: And that's obviously the question now that Congressman Leach, chairing the House Banking Committee will be asking with his usual rigor and thoroughness.  If it's your judgment that LTC was a loan in its position -- give us judgment about how treacherous this market is.  I know that for (UNINTELLIGIBLE) fund for every fund, there has been -- these last two months have not been a lot of fun. Give us your past judgment about this market right now.</p><p>COOPERMAN: Well, I think we basically had a goldilocks market environment where the market was discounting perfection.  And all of a sudden, the three bears got out of control.  I think it was kind of a balloon looking for a pin and the pin turned out to be what happened in Russia.  I think it's a very mixed picture at the current time. And I think frankly, where we had head from here is going to be very much a function what happens in the economy.</p><p>DOBBS: The economy itself, we are seeing earnings decline.  We are seeing also at the same time, tremendous historic lows in terms of inflation and unemployment.  What is your outlook then for the economy?  I'm not letting you off that easy.</p><p>COOPERMAN: Basically three scenarios out there that are very plausible.  For want of any better terminology, we talk in terms of soft landing, recession and something worse than recession. Essentially, I think if it's a soft landing, financial markets have more than adjusted to that, and I think the lows of august, early September will hold up as being the lows in the cycle.  A recession, I think is not yet quite discounted.  And something worse is not discounted in any of the financial markets.  I think it's a period where one has to be very careful.  I mean we have a lot of instability around the world.  You look at Japan, every one of their long-term bonds yields less than 70 basis points.  Short rates are 25 basis points.  Asia is in a depression\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: You are not cheering me up, Lee.</p><p>COOPERMAN: Look, there are positives out there.  I mean we have good fiscal policy; we have a budget surplus.  We have very low long- term low interest rates.  But I think the low long-term interest rates are functions of the problems in the economy.</p><p>DOBBS: Do you believe the Fed has moved fast enough?</p><p>COOPERMAN: I think they will move fast enough.  They are there to preserve order, and will do what they have to do.  And I am quite confident with that view.  I think the thing to watch here is the economy, Brazil and mutual fund cash flow.</p><p>DOBBS: Will do, as always.  Lee, great to have you here on the \"MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR\" with us.</p><p>COOPERMAN: Nice to be here with you.</p><p>DOBBS: Leon Cooperman.</p><p>We'll continue in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: For tonight, that's the bottom line.  Thanks for being with us.

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.</p><p>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.</p><p>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up $1.87, or 2 percent, at $97.45.</p><p>The Dow Jones transportation index, a proxy for future economic activity, edged higher, notching its tenth straight increase and its twelfth gain in the past 13 trading days.</p><p>A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. They were roughly flat by midday, and spent the afternoon swapping small bumps and dips.</p><p>The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.78, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59, or 0.2 percent, to 3,154.</p><p>The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are rapidly approaching their all-time closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.</p><p>Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.</p><p>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc.said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose $3.79, or 2.6 percent, to $149.99.</p><p>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to $118.50.</p><p>Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose $3.58 to $62.48.</p><p>Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:</p><p>* Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to $21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.</p><p>* Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.10 after hours.</p><p>* Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost $10.83, or 11 percent, to $87.49 after hours.</p><p>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.</p><p>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.</p><p>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"</p><p>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-000376372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57MB-X1V1-JBRC-V1C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 29, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002PPD</classCode><className>CATERPILLAR INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC00025QI</classCode><className>BIOGEN IDEC INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002LDS</classCode><className>ROPER TECHNOLOGIES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS333131 MINING MACHINERY &amp;

KEY FACTS     The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1%, nearly 50 points, at Wednesday\u2019s open, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%.      The Federal Reserve, which concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at near zero to continue to support the economy through the coronavirus pandemic.       The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet are set to testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee later on Wednesday, which may give investors insight into how Big Tech companies are handling challenges from regulators.       While Big Tech companies are among the best-performing stocks so far this year, there are rising concerns on Wall Street that heavy market concentration in these handful of big names could pose downside risks.      The busiest week of the second quarter earnings season continued, with shares of General Electric, Advanced Micro Devices, General Motors and Shopify all rising after the companies reported better-than-expected results.      Boeing and Starbucks, meanwhile, posted wider-than-expected losses last quarter, but both stocks traded higher heading into the market open.     Key background   Investors also continued to assess the latest coronavirus relief bill unveiled by Senate Republicans late on Monday, titled the Heath, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools (HEALS) Act. The GOP proposal for the next round of federal coronavirus aid includes a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks and more funds for small business loans in the Paycheck Protection Program. The bill would also eliminate the $600-per-week federal unemployment supplement, which states stopped paying out this week, to be replaced with a 70% wage-replacement program.    What to watch for   The Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday: The last time Fed officials met in June, they decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0% to 0.25%. On Tuesday, the central bank announced that it would extend loan programs through the end of 2020 as it continues to support the U.S. economy amid the pandemic.

Big technology companies, long investor favourites, suffered heavy losses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deepening worries over newly protectionist U.S. trade policies combined with blowback toward technology companies, including Facebook's ever-widening privacy scandal, have prompted investors to pull money out of the market. That has meant steep drops in former big winners including Netflix, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google's parent company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among other recent winners, Intel dove 6.1 per cent following a report in Bloomberg News that Apple plans to start using its own chips in Mac computers, and Amazon sank following more broadsides from U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>on Twitter.</p><p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 758 points, although major indexes regained some of their losses later in the afternoon. The Dow lost 458.92 points, or 1.9 per cent, to 23,644.19.</p><p>The S&amp;;P 500 index gave up 58.99 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 2,581.88.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite slumped 193.33 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 6,870.12. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 36.90 points, or 2.4 per cent, to 1,492.53.</p><p>Toronto's main stock index joined U.S. markets in a downward swing Monday as Chinese tariff action rattled investors after the holiday weekend.</p><p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&amp;;P/TSX composite closed down 153.84 points at 15,213.45, led by declines in energy and health care.</p><p>Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the step by China is small but significant.</p><p>\"The fact that a country has actually raised tariffs in retaliation is an important step in the wrong direction,\" she said. \"The tariffs imposed by China today lead to greater worries that we will see escalating tariffs and the possibility of a much bigger impact than investors were anticipating last week. And that could be true for Mexico as well as for China.\"</p><p>Food maker Tyson dropped 6.2 per cent after China raised import duties on a US$3 billion list of U.S. goods in response to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>ordered last month.</p><p>Amazon fell another 5.2 per cent.</p><p>The online retailer has slumped with the market recently, although it's still up about 17 per cent in 2018. Trump has repeatedly criticized Amazon over issues including taxes and Amazon's shipping deals with the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors, said Amazon is just the latest company to falter after it drew scrutiny from the government, as Facebook and Alphabet have slumped recently on data privacy concerns.</p><p>\"It seems like the long arm of the government is interfering with investors'expectations,\" he said. \"Investors are pricing in an escalating trade war and regulation of tech companies.\"</p><p>Microsoft dropped three per cent and Alphabet, Google's parent company, shed 2.4 per cent.</p><p>After a month of public negotiations between the U.S. and several other countries, Monday marked the first time another country has placed tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the Trump administration's recent trade sanctions.</p><p>The price of gold climbed 1.2 per cent to US$1,343.60 an ounce and silver jumped two per cent to US$16.60 an ounce as some investors took money out of stocks and looked for safer investments.</p><p>Health insurer Humana was one of the market's few winners following more reports Walmart could buy the company or create a new partnership with it. Humana is a major provider of Medicare Advantage coverage for people 65 and older. Humana gained 4.4 per cent while Walmart slid 3.8 per cent.</p><p>Bond prices finished little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury stayed at 2.74 per cent after a sharp decline last week.</p><p>Energy companies skidded as benchmark U.S. crude lost US$1.93, or three per cent, to US$63.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid US$1.70, or 2.5 per cent, to US$67.64 a barrel in London.</p><p>Wholesale gasoline dropped five cents to US$1.97 a gallon. Heating oil fell four cents to US$1.98 a gallon. Natural gas slid five cents to US$2.68 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p><p>Copper rose two cents to US$3.05 a pound.</p><p>The dollar declined to 105.85 yen from 106.50 yen. The euro edged up to US$1.23 from US$1.2306.</p><p>Trading in France, Germany and Britain was closed for Easter. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.3 per cent and South Korea's Kospi fell almost 0.1 per cent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was closed as well. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Welcome to a  special Black Friday edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, November 23th, your top  stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, time to go shopping.  It's Black Friday more  than 164 million people are expected to shop this weekend.  Online sales  are set to hit records.  We'll keep an eye on retailers this morning like  Amazon, Overstock, Macy's, these stocks have all been very hard hit, most  of the retailers so far this month, can they turn around? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon hit by a worker's strike in Germany and Spain today.  Futures are  showing this and the market action this morning.  The losses across the  board.  The Dow futures are down 84 points.  And, again, this is so far  we're trying to turn around what has been a really, really awful week.  We  have losses of more than three percent at almost four percent loss on the  NASDAQ Composite so far this week.  In Europe, we have England, France, and  Germany trading wide-open. </p><p>A slight loss on the Footsie 100 in England.  Gains in France and Germany.   The Asian markets closing lower overnight.  The Nikkei was closed  altogether.  It never opened, but we have losses on the other three major  markets there.  The price of crude oil slipping this morning.  We have oil  prices now at the lowest level since late 2017 on abundance of supply.  We  break out what is going on.  Telecom trouble, the U.S. warning that  countries dealing with Chinese company Huawei Technologies ahead of this  big meeting between President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping at the  G20 Summit next week. </p><p>The concern is the use of Huawei Technology and potential infiltration on  the U.S. military bases abroad.  And then on to the border battle,  President Trump threatening to shut down the entire Mexican border if  immigration becomes uncontrollable.  This is a group breaks off from the  migrant caravan just 500 feet away from the U.S. border.  The Trump  administration reportedly wants to meet the heads of Volkswagen, BMW, and  Daimler to discuss trade policy. </p><p>Reuters says that the invitation is to meet with Economic Advisor Larry  Kudlow Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  Then the thriller on the green,  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson teeing off today in a special pay-per-view  match in Las Vegas.  Nine million dollars at stake.  We have details.  And  Lion King goes live action.  We can just listen to that all morning long.   The trailer for the Lion King movie making its debut online and more of the  amazing video coming up. </p><p>Here to break it all down this morning, Fox Business Network's Susan Li,  Chief Market Strategist at Third Seven Advisors, Michael Block, and  Republican strategist, former Trump surrogate, former Republican Convention  Deputy Press Secretary Erin Elmore.  Erin, I'm going to get to the  president's tweet.  I don't feel like I've talked to you enough this  morning.  So the president just tweeted and I'm going to get your reaction  really quickly.  Here's what the president says, really good criminal  justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. </p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer have a real chance  to do something so badly needed in our country.  Already passed with the  big boat and House would be a major victory for all.  He's seriously  focused regardless of the Democrats' win in the House.  He's seriously  focused on getting things done. </p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Right, because it's been so divisive.   Right now, it's Republicans vote one way and Democrats vote another way,  and there's really no sort of civility anymore.  And I think he's really  wants to get things accomplished in a bipartisan fashion because we haven't  seen that in the last two years and I also think he's looking forward to  2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I don't -- I will argue that the president based on just  the language that he enjoys using sometimes.  It's not about civility.   It's about results.  But it's not -- it's not about getting along in terms  of not calling each other names.  It's actually passing things that benefit  all America. </p><p>ELMORE:  Absolutely, because he has the best interests of the American  people at heart whereas some these people in the Senate -- in the House  that are so worried about their reelects and their elections and just sort  of banging their fists on principle aren't so focused on those goals. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So instead of investigations in the House maybe we get actual  things getting done and he's talking about the Senate, but -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ELMORE:  Well, I think, you know, focusing on the Hillary Clinton stuff and  dredging all that up again.  Let's be more like the markets.  Let's be  forward looking, right?  So I think that's what should be the big focus  here Hillary Clinton stuff, it's old news and I think we have to move on  from all of it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, maybe she's going to run again. </p><p>ELMORE:  I mean that would be -- that would be Christmas come early for the  Republicans. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What a day.  So we'll move on this Black Friday full swing -- in  full swing.  Shoppers scored deals ahead of the holidays.  Hillary Vaughn  is live from Garden City, New York with the very latest.  Good morning,  Hillary.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dagen.  Well, the  Apple store just opened up.  That's the big news here.  There was a line  all the way down this hallway.  They opened up.  Now, a lot of people  looking to get good deals on new Apple products.  But Apple is one of the  stores where they're kind of offering a bonus gift card with any purchase - - some of the purchases for some of their new gear.  Not necessarily  discounting their prices. </p><p>But we have other long lines here.  You have lines out the door for jewelry  stores.  I talked to a lot of these shoppers in line.  They're looking to  get some gifts for their mom, their sisters.  Some guys in line looking to  get gifts for their daughter or girlfriend.  This is a store that's been  pretty steady.  A lot of people stacked up in line.  We've seen a lot of  young shoppers today.  A lot of high schoolers out with their friends  looking to cash in on the good deals and get those gifts, a lot of  millennial shoppers. </p><p>So, you know, all this talk of people hopping on their phones staying at  home doing everything online, well, we've seen young shoppers actually get  into the holiday spirit.  They like the idea of going out with their  friends grabbing coffee early in the morning and coming here, and making a  day of it.  So a lot of hustle and bustle here people cashing in getting  into holiday spirit, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hillary, thank you for that.  Hillary Vaughn for us at -- on  Long Island.  President Trump touting his administration's economic  successes yesterday as the United States kicks off its annual holiday  shopping season.  The commander-in-chief commenting on what he's thankful  for. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you most thankful for Mr. President? </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For having a great family  and for having made a tremendous difference in this country.  I've made a  tremendous difference in the country.  This country is so much stronger now  than it was when I took office that you wouldn't believe it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here now fashion and retailer trend analyst Charcy Evers.   Charcy, your take on the holiday shopping season kicking off so far?  What  should we be watching? </p><p>CHARCY EVERS, FASHION AND RETAIL TREND ANALYST:  We are all about  experience at retail right now and that's what's drawing people into the  stores.  I keep saying that Black Friday is back and that's what customers  are coming in for the experience and we're seeing that across, you know,  all the big box stores as well as smaller retailers -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What kind of experience other than just the elbows and showing  from the crowds because you're talking about things that the retailers have  really planned to really push and to get people -- get -- to produce foot  traffic? </p><p>EVERS:  Right, exactly.  And it's part of much larger shift in retail in  general this idea of creating experience centers in touch points because we  all know that we can all buy everything online.  So what's going to give me  a reason to come into a store?  Target for example has over 25,000 hours of  retail experience planned throughout the holiday season.  They have hours  of play for kids really kind of taking advantage of the hole in the market  that Toys\"R\"Us left inviting children in and having play dates with them  and actually letting them use toys before you're even buying them. </p><p>So it's really creating a way to get them into the stores.  Wal-Mart the  same thing.  They're having actual play dates with children really inviting  them in.  They've also created a digital playground online where you can  use your tablet or your computer to try the toys out before, so that's just  one the ways that these retailers are having people, you know, getting them  into the store and making it like enjoyable. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it's hard to get consumers in the store especially if  you can shop online and that's why it's hard to compete also with Amazon's  discount.  You really have to slice a lot of your pricing, right? </p><p>EVERS:  Right.  And I think we all know that, you know, to -- the holidays  is a perfect time to kind of come up with a new experiential strategy as a  retailer because it's, you know, we -- the idea of Black Friday or the  holidays in general is like let's go and sit on Santa's lap and take a  picture.  That's always kind of, you know, it's bringing back that  nostalgia of going in and creating tradition and Black Friday for many  families is a tradition of going shopping -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about pricing though? </p><p>ELMORE:  I mean (INAUDIBLE) get competitive when you have to give door  busters and you basically cut your prices to extraordinary levels. </p><p>EVERS:  I think that retailers are really trying to take -- get away from  that stigma that Black Friday has of like people fighting over T.V.'s at  the door and making it more of a kind of feel good family experience.   There's always -- we know we're going to get the best prices online.  We  know that the deals are out there.  But it's kind of, again, as I said,  it's part of this larger shift in retail in general of creating an  experience in the holidays really lend itself well to that -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ELMORE:  -- this holiday season?  </p><p>EVERS:  Target for sure.  I know their earnings will let you know was not a  good Tuesday for them.  But, you know, they've really put -- they've  reinvested in their company.  They put money back into the stores and  really, you know, built-up their e-commerce business.  So I think we will  be surprised to see them.  I think they'll have a good holiday season. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It might -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  So, Charcy,  you talked about Kohl's, and Target, and Kohl's, you talked about investing  more in their business perhaps some more in these experiences, what about  the mall operators?  They've been under a lot of fire as, you know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BLOCK:  -- retail investment in kinds of places, is there any talk amongst  the mall operators about how to provide more experiences? </p><p>EVERS:  Oh, absolutely.  I think that that's why, you know, we were talking  a lot -- we talked a lot about retailer apocalypse and I always say it's  actually retail renaissance.  It's a much needed renaissance and rebirth of  retail and it has caused the mall developers to really look at how they're  using their space, right?  So Roosevelt Mall for example has an area where  shops are just pop-ups.  So rather than going into these long-term leases  which are really difficult for retailers to sustain, you know, and it's a  risk in having overhead inventory. </p><p>Having pop-ups gives me a reason like I know when in one a month, it's  going to be a different store there, so I'm going to go back into the mall  and I'm going to go check out what's new with the pop-ups.  So it's a  little bit of novelty.  There's also, you know, Westfield does a great job  of incorporating experience in terms with theater, with entertainment, with  restaurants, you know, they will become more experiential hubs. </p><p>And going back to Wal-Mart, they've really create -- they're doing new  things with their stores and creating what they call town centers.  And,  actually, using the space around them, you know, the parking lots, the  empty stores around them and creating these experiential centers that are  really drawing consumers in, so -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And don't -- because, again, I feel like some retail success  stories get lumped in with the mall problems which had been going clearly  30 years in this country because I keep bringing this up, but Aerie which  is a division of American Eagle was -- if you watched Aerie, that store  literally -- it pulled you in you as a -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- shopper that they have such great inexpensive like lounge  wear.  If you were watching Aerie versus Victoria's Secret, you would know  even two years ago that Victoria's Secret was in trouble and that Aerie was  on the rise. </p><p>EVERS:  Oh, yes.  I talked a lot about that.  Don't get me started  Victoria's Secret.  I think that -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>EVERS:  -- they missed out on the roller trend, you know, and they're also  -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>EVERS:  -- very early and they did it and they did it well, and Victoria's  Secret just needs, you know, come with the top -- like lived up in the  times, you know, they didn't shift when the consumer shifted.  We're with  at leisure out there and more athletic apparel and stuff.  The bras don't  need to be under wired.  We're not into push-up bras.  We're not into that  image of a woman any more, you know, it's about physical -- it's about  being comfortable and -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- was the management at Victoria's Secret living in that they  wouldn't know that it was about this -- there's not one standard of beauty  anymore and it doesn't weigh 100 pounds and is six feet tall and -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  -- the primetime lingerie  show.  I mean -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>EVERS:  -- but when you -- when you think about the comments of the CMO  made about the Victoria's Secret Show, you really see that it's better than  the culture.  This ideology that's outdated. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That CMO has been running that fashion show as long as they've  been doing it and kind of begs the question of like why is that dude still  there? </p><p>EVERS:  Right -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BLOCK:  -- as my wife would say some man must have thought of that -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>EVERS:  Think about it.  It's not the zeitgeist the more -- it's all about  a male fantasy and an image that they're banking off as opposed to like me  too women's power like get with day -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BLOCK:  -- make money. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm glad I got you started on that really quickly, who do you  think will be the big winner this weekend retail wise?</p><p>EVERS:  I think Macy's is doing a great job.  Nordstrom is doing a great  job.  Macy's is doing pop-ups with Facebook.  You know, this idea of  integrating online and off-line, I also talked a lot about retail -- it's  just retail, right?  It does not have to online, off-line.  The customer is  shopping now on their mobile.  It has to be seamless.  There's no  distinction between the two. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Charcy, great to see you.  Come back. </p><p>EVERS:  I will.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we'll talk about everything, Charcy Evers.  Stay tuned we'll  be right back everybody. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Border battle, President Trump threatening to shut down the  U.S.-Mexico border if troops cannot get a handle on the migrants looking to  cross into this country.  Edward Lawrence is live from the White House with  the very latest.  Good morning, Edward. </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   And not only is the president willing to shut down the entire border, but  it's allowing the military to forcibly stop any illegal immigrant who gets  out of control.  This is an escalation of his position on the caravan.   Now, this president says that criminals have infiltrated this caravan and  they're already started to cause problems in Tijuana.  He made these  comments while the nation has celebrated Thanksgiving. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  It's not like normal innocent people.  These are people you talk  to.  I mean they start a fistfight.  I don't that in this country, OK? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, what about the idea that the military  may use lethal force against these migrants? </p><p>TRUMP:  They have to.  They're going to use lethal force. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE:  And he wants Mexico to do more to secure their side of the  border.  The president is saying that if things get out of control as a  last resort, he will close the entire border.  No crossings at all.  The  State Department says that $1.7 billion worth of goods and services crosses  that Mexican border daily.  Now, all of this is tied to the funding of the  border wall.  The president tweeting about 20 minutes ago saying that  Republicans and Democrats need to come together with a package that will  include funding for the wall. </p><p>The president is saying he will partially shut down the government if he  does not get funding for that border wall.  Now, on this subject, Hillary  Clinton interviewed with the Guardian newspaper backtracking a little bit  what she campaigned on in 2016.  She said that Europe cannot offer -- open  borders because it's giving rise to these right-wing populist groups.   Hillary Clinton goes on to say that Europe must put a position out there. </p><p>Now, that they will not have -- they will not continue to refuge or support  unlimited refugees.  Back to you, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That it went too far in terms of the asylum-seekers and the  migrants coming in particularly from Syria.  It went too far in Germany.   You've seen that in -- with Angela Merkel in Germany and I pointed this out  earlier, Edward, it was -- I said two years ago.  It was actually three  years ago.  There were mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany related to  this very problem, so Hillary Clinton is essentially saying that this went  too far in Europe -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LAWRENCE: Yes, exactly. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and it's -- she's saying that after a lot of other people  know that. </p><p>LAWRENCE:  Exactly.  And not just Germany but also Greece and Italy had a  massive problem with this influx.  Now, the numbers have cut down since  2015.  But, again, they're still having those issues and seeing more and  more people coming in. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Edward, thank you so much.  Happy Thanksgiving belatedly.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  You too. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Edward Lawrence.  Coming up, crude awakening, we're watching oil  prices and oversupply concerns.  And The Lion King is back, a sneak peek of  the live action reboot later this hour. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Futures are pointing to a lower ahead of the open where a little  more than an hour away from the opening bell.  A 115-point loss on the Dow  futures right now.  And let's not forget what happened on Wednesday.  It's  been a really terrible week for stocks.  But gains were wiped out in the  final hours of trading on Wednesday.  So even when you -- maybe we can see  a bounce back.  If we see a flip around in the futures maybe we get gains  as we head into the close at 1:00 p.m. Eastern today. </p><p>Joining us now is the Head of Global Research at Bulltick Capital Markets,  Kathryn Rooney Vera.  Kathryn, always great to see you.  What you are you  watching today in terms of the market action?  Are investors going to be  paying attention to any incline we get about retail sales? </p><p>KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD, GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS:  Yes.   I think retail sale definitely comes into play, Dagen.  There's been a lot  of talk about recession that seems kind of comical at this point when you  see Black Friday sales already pointing to a double-digit year-over-year  increase.  So I mean I think that retail sales are going to come out  strong.  I think we're in a strong economic swing and I don't see recession  on the near-term horizon at all. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What people -- when people talked about recession what they're  worried about is this broad downdraft in a whole host of asset classes.   It's not just technology stocks.  It was retail stocks earlier in the week  like sever double-digit losses on some of these retail names.  It's even  Bitcoin.  You have a yield curve that is flattening that, you know, people  are very worried about shorter term interest rates being higher than longer  term interest rates. </p><p>You -- even the downdraft in oil, so -- but you don't see a recession here,  so does that mean that we get a rebound in the market? </p><p>VERA:  Dagen, none of these trends are new, not one.  I would say that what  I'm expecting is a near term near impetus to change this negative trend.   It's momentum driven.  It's sentiment driven.  Guys talk about recession,  Dagen, when the -- when we get a correction in the markets.  It's a direct  correlation between drops in markets and talk of recession.  So one does  not necessarily mean imply the other.  What I will say is that I think that  the Xi and Trump meeting is the most near term potential of near tern  potential for that bounce in sentiment. </p><p>So if we get anything on this front, anything verbal a handshake, any  concession from the Chinese, I'll bet you got stocks fly.  </p><p>BLOCK:  What do you see other than, Kathryn, you know, in terms of emerging  markets?  We haven't heard a lot about Brazil and Mexico (INAUDIBLE) what  do you -- what's your outlook there? </p><p>VERA:  Look, I think, you know, if we get a risk on sentiment then emerging  markets definitely disproportionately benefit because it's a high beta  place.  So if you have risk on which means that investors rush in looking  for those higher yields higher than what you get in treasuries then the  emerging markets will certainly benefit.  But what we do need to see what  we have to see is some, you know, some melting of the icy tensions with  China and the U.S. </p><p>So I think that's going to be near term stimulus if we get the emerging  markets do even better. </p><p>ELMORE:  Headwinds, a strong dollar higher interest rates.  I assume you're  pricing in the fed to move into December and possibly more next year. </p><p>VERA:  Yes.  The fed I think has largely -- the hikes have been largely  discounted if you look at fed funds futures which is something that we in  the market look at in terms of where the fed is going to be putting rates  or the terminal rate by end of next year.  I would say it's largely priced  in, Erin.  And the market would be surprised if the fed were to hike  disproportionately more.  There's a real risk however that the feds applies  on the opposite side that they don't hike in December. </p><p>That could be another near term impetus for the market to change this  negative trajectory. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kathryn, great to see you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Thanks for  taking some of your Black Friday morning out and joining us.  Kathryn  Rooney Vera down in -- where it's a lot warmer than it is here in Florida. </p><p>VERA:  Thank you so much. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, questions for James Comey, the latest development as  the former FBI Director is vowing to fight a subpoena he received from  House Republicans.  Plus, a legendry face-off, the nine million dollar  showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA: BLACK  FRIDAY.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  Black  Friday is here!  All eyes on retailers, more than 164 million people are  expected to shop this weekend.  A record-setting number of online shoppers  set to grab some deals.  Futures are showing this in the markets.  Can we  get a turn around?  We had one in the making on Wednesday, and as we got  near the close, markets flipped around.  Dow down 119 points on the Futures  right now, it's been a bruising week for stocks.  Markets close early today  at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Fox Business has you covered until 2:00 in the  afternoon.  So, all day past the close at 1:00.  And we're looking at  losses of more than three percent on all three major market gauges so far  this week.  And we've had like double-digit losses on some of these retail  stocks.</p><p>In Europe, we have losses on the FTSE 100, and the CAC Quarante in France  to report although slight.  And in Asia overnight, it was losses across the  board, as well.  Except for the Nikkei which was closed for trading this  Friday.  The price of crude oil in the red again this morning.  Oil prices  at their lowest level since late 2017.  We have cost of crude trading at  $51.00 a barrel at the moment.</p><p>Car conference, the Trump administration reportedly wants to meet the heads  of German automakers next week to discuss trade policy.  Does that mean  getting rid of tariffs?  Europe's import tariffs on our cars.  How about  our import tariffs on light trucks coming in from other nations?  We will  dig into that.</p><p>And former -- and subpoenaed former FBI Director, Jim Comey, is meeting --  is meeting with House Judiciary Committee next month.  He's been  subpoenaed, Comey says, I'm going to -- you know, I don't want to do it  behind closed doors, I want do it in public.  Let's see what happens.  This  is, of course, before the Democrats take over the House in January.</p><p>It's Tiger versus Phil, golf greats Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson team off  today in a special pay-per-view match in Las Vegas.  A lot riding on the  game including a $9-million prize and a side bet from Mickelson himself.</p><p>And the circle of life goes live action, the trailer for the new \"Lion  King\" movie making its debut online, more of this incredible coming  attraction, coming up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You can't get enough, can you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I cannot get enough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Cannot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I watched it I don't know how many times yesterday.</p><p>Outrage for Amazon workers, employees striking in Germany and Spain during  Black Friday.  Kristina Partsinevelos is live from the New York Stock  Exchange with the details.  Hey, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Good  morning, Dagen.  As you can see, it's kind of quiet here today.  A lot of  people haven't come into the office, but what we're hearing from Amazon,  you're actually seeing some pre-market volume going on with that stock  right now, but like you mentioned, there is a strike going on in Germany,  about 650 employees walked off the job.  They're expected to also walk off  in Spain tomorrow, so they're going to have a walk-off and then strike on  Saturday.  The company claims that this won't affect Black Friday orders,  nonetheless, the employees chose to do -- this moment in time to negotiate  hire pay.</p><p>But since we're talking about Amazon such a giant, I wanted to switch over  the Best Buy and start talking about that company because Wedbush analyst  put out a note raising their target on Best Buy.  Right now, it's at  $62.00, they believe it can climb higher at $65.00 because they believe  Best Buy has done a great job when it comes to electronics and competing  the prices against Target.  And if we're going to -- against Amazon, sorry.   If we're going to end on Wal-Mart and target, I just heard both companies  right now, if you go into their stores for Black Friday, you have a  wireless thing, you don't have to wait in line, they'll come and find you  to buy your products.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're finally doing what Apple has been doing for how many  years?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Exactly.  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I saw that story and I thought --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they should have been doing that at Whole Foods yesterday  because that was a horror show here in New York City on Thanksgiving Day.   At least they were open, but nevertheless, it was kind of in disarray.  I  leave it at that.  Kristina Partsinevelos, thank you.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's good to see you.  Joining us now, former McDonald's USA  CEO, former Famous Dave's BBQ CEO, Fat Brands International Chairman, Ed  Rensi.  Ed, what's your outlook for the holiday shopping season?</p><p>ED RENSI, CHAIRMAN, FAT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL:  I think it's fantastic.   Trump has driven this economy largely with these tax reductions, so people  have got a lot more money to spend, there's a joyous attitude, too, because  a lot of people are back to work, the wages are good, I think, it's a good  holiday season, I think it's a good economic story for the average Joe  walking the street.  I think it's great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, maybe the people in politics on the left need to stop  talking down the economy, and trying to convince everybody that things are  lousy simply because they hate President Trump.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, President Trump is clearly cheerleader in chief.  You ask him  how he's doing, he's doing AAA.  You ask him how the country is doing, it's  AAA, he can't find anything wrong anywhere except for the Democrats bad  behavior on the border.  So, I think we ought to be optimistic.  I think as  all citizens, my whole family belonged to the Democratic Party, they were  in unions, those are the people that built this great country of ours.   It's time to get off their back and celebrate the hard work of men and  women all across the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, just to be clear, the quote from President Trump -- I --  because I wrote it down from the Chris Wallace interview earlier in the  week.  Look, when he asked how he would grade things, look, I late to do  it, but I will do it, I would give myself an A+.  Is that enough?  Can I go  higher than that?  So, that's the quote which I will be using as the  weekend wears on.  Susan Li has a question for you, Ed.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, just about wages, Ed, because we know that this holiday shopping  season, a lot of retailers have had to raise their wages.  It's a tight  labor market, you're going to compete for workers, but what does that mean  for profit margins in the bottom line?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, the fact of the matter is when you have a labor shortage  which we're suffering in the hospitality industry, people are doing amazing  things to recruit for restaurants, and hotels, and what have you.  I think  it's good, frankly, it's going to lift wages a bit, it's going to put some  impact on the bottom line of a lot of companies.  But they'll adjust by  raising prices, getting more efficient, sharpening their pencils.  So, I  think all in all, it's good when people have more money in their pocket and  wages are going up.</p><p>BLOCK:  Hey, Ed.  You know, how much -- you mentioned, you know, getting  more efficient, how much of this is not so much labor-oriented, but  technology, i.e., use of points of sale technology in some of the fast food  restaurants, where you have a lot of expertise, you know, is that really  the wave of the future, is that something that's going to be a bigger and  bigger part of what these companies invest in?</p><p>RENSI:  Yes, I think you're going to see more labor devoted to hospitality  and less to process of the purchase.  I had an experience yesterday, I  drove from Jupiter, Florida over to Sarasota for the holiday, and we went  on -- my wife went on the app on her phone, ordered a meal at a fast-food  restaurant.  We pulled in, told them we were there, we didn't even know  what restaurant we were going to, they had the order.  It was amazing to  me.  You know, being 74 years old, it's astound to go get that level of  customer service out of a little piece of electronic stuff.  It's amazing,  I love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, which fast-food restaurant was it?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I went to Hurricanes Bar &amp; Grill in Jupiter, and I stopped at  McDonald's halfway over, and then went in to FAT Brands, have a big  possible burger.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You were -- you are fast-food patron, my friend.  Erin Elmore  has a question.</p><p>ELMORE:  Hi, good morning.  How are you?  So, we see this Black Friday now  the uptick in sales in retail, what about in your sector, in the  hospitality and food business?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, any time people are on the street, they're going to be buying  lunch, dinner, breakfast out.  The companies that provide great customer  service and get people in and out and make it affordable are going to  succeed.  You know, historically, dry goods, people said, this was the day  that you begin going from red ink to black ink, and I agree with that.   This is a time when restaurants and all people in hospitality see a real  uptick in their -- in their traffic, so I think it bodes well.  Let's just  hope the weather doesn't get in the way through December.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, what do you make of some of the Democrats talking about  rolling back at least some of the tax cuts, as they move into the New Year  and take over the house?  I mean, it won't get -- it won't get done,  obviously, the Republicans still control the Senate.  President Trump would  gladly veto that, but they still talk about it.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I don't understand for the life of me how anybody can talk  about socialism, increase in taxes.  Look at Venezuela, one of the  wealthiest, beautifulest countries in South America totally destroyed today  because of leftist activity.  I think the Democrats are out of their minds.   There are some sensible people there but the leadership just doesn't have  any policies, practices, or future vision, of what this country can do, and  all they can think about is destroying Republicans.  That's not going to  work.  The American people are not going to put up with it for the long  haul.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Ed, this is something that I've talked about earlier in  the week, that it is a left-wing fallacy that, oh, we can just tax the top  one percent more and pay for all these spending programs, all of these  goodies that the people on the left talk about.  If you confiscated every  single dollar of adjusted-growth income earned and reported by the top one  percent, it would only be about $2 trillion.  What does Medicare for All  cost in a year based on the estimates?  More than 3.2 trillion, so it would  -- you could take every dollar that somebody had in income in the top one  percent and it still wouldn't pay for Medicare for All, it won't even come  close.</p><p>RENSI:  Dagen, you're too intelligent, you're too smart, you're too  realistic.  These people that are talking about the kinds of things that --  of cutting these tax cuts to crumbs, they don't understand that the average  guy on the street is what makes this country run.  The middle class pays  the vast majority of the taxes.  You hurt them, you're hurting revenue.   John Kennedy knew that, that's why he cut taxes.  How all of a sudden are  today's Democrats that stupid that they think he was that wrong?  I just  don't get it, it's illogical, it's all about entrenched power.  They say  things that denigrate the rich so the poor will vote for them.  The  unclean, the deplorables, it's just disgusting in their behavior.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And well -- and ultimately, if you want this kind of (INAUDIBLE)  board of socialist policies, everybody gets taxed to their noses, tax to  their teeth.  It's gas taxes, it's value-added taxes, you have people  rioting in France because of these higher diesel taxes.  I want to move  onto this really quickly, fast-food restaurants are hosting hiring parties  because they're having such trouble, like, bringing people in because  unemployment is the lowest in almost 50 years.  What do you think of these  companies beefing up their efforts, Ed?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, I think it's intelligent.  You got to create teams.  It's  interesting to me that Bezos, one of the richest guys in the world from  Amazon, talking about Amazon could fail in the future, if you don't respect  and work for the consumer.  Well, the number one customers employers have  are their employees.  Let's celebrate them, let's have parties for them.   Let's let people know they are good places to work.  I think it's exciting,  we're going to have to get smarter about how we recruit, why not?  It makes  the whole country better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, great to see you.  I expect a full report on where you ate  over the weekend.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RENSI:  All right.  I'm in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  Ed Rensi, take care.  Coming up, a face-off on the green,  the $9-million showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.  And Simba  is back, a sneak peek of the \"Lion King\" reboot.  The trailer ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The White House set to meet with German car executives.  Cheryl  Casone has the details on this story (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good, I think is the right  reaction.  This is going to be interesting.  We're just learning about  this.  This is from Reuters, they're reporting that the Trump  administration has invited the heads of Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler to the  White House to discuss trade policy.  The meeting likely taking place next  week will also feature Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow and Secretary of  Commerce Wilbur Ross.</p><p>Well, a subpoena sent to former FBI Director James Comey, making headlines.   In the subpoena, Comey says Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee  want him to testify at a closed-door meeting next month to talk about  allegations of anti-Trump bias that led to the opening of the Russia  investigation plus the handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal.   Well, Comey, he fired back on Twitter saying he's happy to testify but only  if everyone can see so there's no fear of leaking or distortion.  They're  just tweet.</p><p>All right.  The head-to-head matchup between two of the biggest names in  golf is set for later today.

We asked our  Fox Business team including our very own Maria Bartiromo.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, I am a sucker for a  sale, so I've already started.  I was driving past a store the other day,  they said everything is 30 percent off, I got right out and I started  buying stuff, even though I didn't need any of it.  Unfortunately, that's  how I do it.  I will be on line and I will go to a few stores on Friday,  but not too many because I don't like the crowds, but I'll get everything I  need, especially if there are sales.</p><p>TRISH REGAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  To me, Black Friday is all about  staying in, watching some T.V. with the kids, hanging out with my husband.   I really don't like -- I don't like to go shopping, period.  A little  secret.  But I do kind of like the online thing, and that's what I'll be  doing.  In fact, I've already been scouting out a few sales.  I mean,  online, to me, it's a -- it's indeed been revolutionary, and it's great for  someone who does not like to shop.  For me, online all the way, for sure.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  A lot of people like to  work off their turkey dinners with some shopping.  Do you do Black Friday  shopping?</p><p>TODD PIRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  No.  You know what I do on Black Friday,  I hang out with you --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Target.</p><p>PIRO:  -- at a random Target in the middle of Northern New Jersey and do  live shots for the Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I am not a big shopper in  stores.  I never have been.  So, I love the internet for that.  I'm all  about Cyber Monday.  I'm even happy to shop on Friday, but from my phone or  computer.</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I did my shopping last  summer, I get things done.  Yes, that's what I'm talking about.  No, I'm  just kidding.  I don't do any shopping.  I have learned a lesson from  Stuart Varney.  I only regift.  In fact, Stuart Varney and I have been  swapping the same electric pepper mill and spatula for the last five years.   That's what I do.  Kidding!  No, I do my shopping in the summer.  I start  early.  I've got a big family.  Can't help it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASONE:  It's true, she does have a big family, she does have to start in  the summer.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Somebody in Steve Forbes' family regifts every year.</p><p>CASONE:  Really?</p><p>ELMORE:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I know that.  We talked about it on earlier in the week.</p><p>LI:  So, it's Steve, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not Steve.</p><p>CASONE:  I bet -- look, I mean, I think we should be called Cyber Friday,  maybe Cyber Thursday night.  I started yesterday online, yes.</p><p>LI:  No difference anymore.  The discounts start at midnight on -- like on  Thursday.</p><p>CASONE:  It's great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I bet online shopping -- I bought something online and it  was -- it looks God awful.  Maybe it's just me.  It looks -- it looks God  awful on me.</p><p>CASONE:  You can buy some cute stuff online.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is not cute.  It looked like I made it.</p><p>LI:  Well, what made you buy in the first place?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it looked good in the photo.</p><p>ELMORE:  And then, you tried it on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ELMORE:  And still looked darn good.</p><p>BLOCK:  Oh, I just want to point out, you know, I know -- I know it's  Giving Tuesday, coming up, after Cyber Monday, but it's also Give Back  Friday, so if you want to get out and do something for the community,  there's probably something going on in your town, that's what the Block  family will be doing (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that comes from your wife who does that every single day.</p><p>BLOCK:  It's my wife who is -- that's what she's all about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She runs a --</p><p>BLOCK:  She runs a program called Grace, which provides groceries and food  and also other necessities for our neighbors, and I'm very proud of the  great work she does.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike Block.

It's Friday, November 23rd.</p><p>Your top stories this Black Friday right at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>More than 164 million people are expected to shop this weekend.  We're  watching the retailers this morning like Amazon, TJX, we have losses on  both of these stocks as we move toward the trading day.</p><p>We're two-and-a-half hours away from the opening bell.  Markets close at  1:00 p.m. Eastern today.  And futures are pointing to a lower open, a 149- point loss on the Dow futures right now.  This wrapping up a week that has  seen all three major market gauges fall more than 3 percent.  The Nasdaq  composite down nearly 4 percent in just three trading sessions.</p><p>In Europe, we have some gains to report in England, France and Germany,  although slight.</p><p>And in Asia, markets closing lower overnight.

So you  know -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Santa Claus is real.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRDSEVEN ADVISORS:  That's true.</p><p>ELMORE:  It was so cold out there.  Did you really expect her to sing?   Right.  It was a big 19 degrees.</p><p>BLOCK:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the fact that the track was so off though, that it was --  it was like she was singing a different song than the one that was playing.  </p><p>BLOCK:  She shouldn't have sung like when Ashlee Simpson started dancing  the ho down, you know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- that happened so long ago.  We actually show  our age when we reference Ashlee Simpson -- </p><p>BLOCK:  I always show my age.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- on \"Saturday Night Live\".  At least I didn't reference like  H.R. Puff and Stuff last hour which -- that song was playing it sounded  like the theme music to H.R. Puff and Stuff.</p><p>BLOCK:  Millennials running amuck.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  If only I was some millennial.</p><p>It is the busiest shopping day of the year everybody.  Black Friday  shoppers are flooding retailers of all shapes and sizes to snag the best  deal.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn is at Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, Long Island, New  York with the very latest.  Hey, Hillary.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Dagen -- well,  this mall is just opening its doors really for the second time for Black  Friday.  They were open on Thanksgiving Day into the night, until 2:00 a.m.   And now they're opening up for a second round of Black Friday shopping for  those Black Friday shoppers that didn't want to wait overnight and are just  getting up for the daytime deals.</p><p>We've seen a lot of people shopping around carrying bags.  And it's really  people are getting busy.  They're cashing in on deals.  They're having a  great time.</p><p>One thing that the Roosevelt Field Mall is doing that's interesting is  they're opening up temporary space to e-retailers.  And they said they've  had e-retailers actually experience a lot of foot traffic in the stores and  then decided to lease space here.</p><p>So for the argument about brick and mortar, that no one is going into the  stores anymore, we've seen a lot of millennial shoppers.  I talked to them.   I said why do you come here today instead of just hopping on your phone to  shop.  They say they want to he see the products.  They're worried about  the Web site crash and skipping out on those good deals.  And they're also  here because of the tech.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've seen a lot of good deals.  They've got some Beat  headphones, new keyboards, speakers.  And that stuff doesn't go on sale,  you know.  So it's like today is the day where you've got to get it, you  know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  So a lot shoppers not wanting to miss out on those deals today.   And they're trying to cash in on them -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Hillary.  We'll check in with you next  hour.  Hillary Vaughn at the Roosevelt Field Mall out in Garden City, Long  Island.</p><p>Millions across the country are hitting the stores.  The National Retail  Federation estimates that 160 million potential shoppers today, another 75  million expected online on Monday.</p><p>Joining me now, shopping and retail expert at blackfriday.com, Sarah  Hollenbeck.  Sarah -- what to watch today and this weekend?  </p><p>SARAH HOLLENBECK, SHPPING AND RETAIL EXPERT, BLACKFRIDAY.COM:  Yes.  You  should definitely be keeping an eye on top retailers like Amazon, Walmart  and Target.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is offering really great discounts on their own in- house lines.  So both their smart home products and their fashion lines.   They're also offering 40 percent off some of the hottest toys of the year.</p><p>If you're looking for TVs, Target and Walmart are definitely going to be  your top picks.  They're offering great discounts on both the new HDR and  4K devices.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a story -- an interesting story in the \"Wall Street  Journal\", Sarah this morning that the downfall of Sears and Toys R Us  actually could help other big name retailers as people -- they have to find  some place to shop for toys.  They have to find some place to shop for baby  gear.  They have to find some place -- again Best Buy is actually adding  appliances with Sears in such trouble.  </p><p>HOLLENBECK:  Yes.  With the demise of some of these other retailers, the  other retailers are definitely picking up the slack and kind of taking up  that customer base.  We saw that early on this November.</p><p>Some retailers released toy books and different items that maybe Toys R Us  and other retailers were providing throughout the holiday season in the  past couple of years.  So they're definitely filling in that gap and taking  in that customer base.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  So 78 percent of Americans  are expected to buy something either today or Cyber Monday.  60 percent of  those sales will be done online and close to 80 percent will spend either  the same or maybe a little bit more this year.  What does that say to you  about the health of the American consumer?  </p><p>HOLLENBECK:  I think the American consumers have a great opportunity both  on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to take advantage of these great sales.   There's definitely a huge uptick in shoppers this year because the economy  is doing so well and retailers are really responding to that by offering  some of the best deals we've seen in recent years.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Sarah -- what categories might we see on this holiday season that  might surprise to the upside?  Like what categories, you know, could there  be more interest in than usual?  </p><p>HOLLENBECK:  I think gaming is definitely a pretty big category this year.   We've seen a lot of really great bundles at places like Game Stop, Walmart  and Target.  For instance, the Nintendo Switch bundle with the Mario Car  has sold out at various stores across the nation.  It's definitely one of  the top deals of the year.  </p><p>ELMORE:  Hi, Sarah -- it's Erin Elmore.  Good morning.  </p><p>Our reporter here at Fox Business, Hillary Vaughn, said she has seen a lot  of millennials hitting the stores, which is a little bit surprising.  We  think they're always into technology doing that online shopping.  Why do  you think that is, millennials are out there hitting the stores?  </p><p>HOLLENBECK:  Well, I think there's something to be said about seeing the  product that you want in person and that excitement of being in store.  And  consumers can shop online throughout the year.  But that in-store shopping  experience with everyone getting really excited about the holiday season  only happens once a year.</p><p>So I think that's why you're seeing a lot more people come out in store  during the holiday season.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can you read into some of the deals that these companies are  offering, some of the promotions as a sign of desperation that they're  worried and what does that say about their -- Mike Block can answer this --  but their profit margins?  But again, how do the promotions this year  compare to years past?  </p><p>HOLLENBECK:  We're seeing a lot bigger promotions this year to kind of draw  in those consumers that maybe weren't shopping in years past.  And because  a lot of consumers are wanting to shop online, you're seeing a lot of THOSE  Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals being replicated online as well as in- store.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike.</p><p>BLOCK:  Again any particular categories where you're seeing more  promotional activity than others?  </p><p>HOLLENBECK:  I think tech is definitely one of the biggest categories of  the season.  You're seeing a lot of really great deals on smart home  products, TVs, laptops, tablets, things like that.  Consumers definitely  need to do their research before they pick up these items during the  holiday season so they don't fall for doorbuster prices that aren't  necessarily worth it.</p><p>They need to check reputable tech sites like PC Mag to do their research  and see what brands are really worth the money this season.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Could the sales like in a lot of the apparel retailers, a lot of  the clothing companies broke in-store and online.  The major department  stores, online retailers beginning this week, Sarah.  And I've noticed that  there's not a lot of merchandise that's on sale and the discounts aren't  that deep.</p><p>So it looks like at least that these retailers might have managed their  inventory better.  I don't know if that's just anecdotal or not.  </p><p>HOLLENBECK:  Well, the clothing deals usually don't start until Cyber  Monday.  We see site-wide discounts at various retailers like Target, Old  Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, places like that.  They're going to offer  anywhere from 15 to 50 percent off.  So if you are wanting to shop for  clothing, you're definitely better off waiting until Cyber Monday.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Block -- what about -- before we go, what about margin  pressure?  Because it was the Target earnings and it was Kohl's earlier in  the week where Target warned about higher input costs and warned about  higher wage pressures.  And seemed to be one of the reasons that that  stock, I just want to point out, Target is down 13 percent this week, 17  percent in the month -- </p><p>LI:  10 percent in one day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  For the month of November, 17 percent.</p><p>BLOCK:  Here's what I'll say about Target and Kohl's.  Both stocks had nice  runs because earlier this year we were warned about the wage pressures and  the shipping pressures and things like that.</p><p>However, both of these companies and the macro data always showed and the  beige book showed that these companies were going to be able to raise  prices and that was the evidence we got.  Sure enough they were able to do  that, preserve the margins.</p><p>What happened this week was both of these companies came out and they both  warned of these again and the market took it as panic and they sold the  stocks.  What remains to be seen is whether they can keep getting priced.   We're obviously in the holiday season now.  Sarah's been talking about more  promotions. </p><p>There's two things we're not considering here.  Number one, in Kohl's  earnings report they are investing money into the stores.  They are  investing in higher wages.  And that's how they look at it.  Is that going  to help them in the long run?  The Bulls would say yes.</p><p>The second thing is we have companies like Sears going into bankruptcy.  We  have others like Bon-Ton going in.  Historically we've seen stages years  ago -- the demise of Mervyn's really helping Kohl's.  </p><p>LI:  How about JC Penney going out?  </p><p>BLOCK:  And JC Penny -- that's a third one -- thank you.  Those are the big  ones that have fallen.  That's going to help companies like this.  So  investors need to keep that in mind.</p><p>Will the demise of these other stores, you mentioned the story about Toys R  Us and Sears, will that help these other companies.  The bulls are going to  tell you yes, it will.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Best Buy has said that and Macy's has said that in their  recent earnings reports.  The closing of competitors is one reason for the  lift in their recent quarterly sales.  So there you go.  </p><p>BLOCK:  And we can say they're talking about it.  But then again these  selloffs are maybe giving us an opportunity to own these stocks longer  term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  Sarah Hollenbeck -- thank you so much.  Thank you  for being here this Black Friday.  Stay tuned to our Black Friday market  coverage.  Fox Business -- we're open until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Coming up, even more questions for Boeing.  The company being pressed for  the safety of the new 737 model following October's Lion Air crash.</p><p>Plus, call the cavalry, watch these jewelry store clerks fend off armed  robbers with swords.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lion Air pressing Boeing for more details about the 737 Max  after last month's fatal crash. </p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Dagen.  Good  morning again.</p><p>The Indonesia airliner says its pilots struggled with the 737's flight  controls before their plane crashed into the sea.  Lion Air's safety  director plans to visit the Boeing facility in Seattle as the company looks  for more details about the jet itself.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo, Boeing's CEO Dennis  Muilenburg saying his company is fully cooperating with the investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  So what happened?  Apparently  there were 10 computers -- the computers, about the angle of the nose were  not accurate and then the plane went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you  have a sense of what went wrong?  </p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING:  Yes, the Indonesian authorities have  pointed out initially there were indications of an inaccurate angle attack  signal that was being sent to the airplane.  And of course, the airplane  has the ability to handle that.  We have procedures in place.  </p><p>And we've already issued a couple of additional bulletins to our operators  and pilots around the world that point them back to existing flight  procedures to handle that kind of position.  So again, we're going to  continue to support the investigation as it proceeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Well, the crash killed all 189 people on-board.</p><p>Taking a look at shares of Boeing, lower in the premarket, down nearly 1  percent.</p><p>Well, the Camp Fire in northern California is now about 95 percent  contained, thanks to the rain.  But the weather is also hurting search  efforts in that region.  More rain today could bring the risk of dangerous  flooding and more importantly in California a big problem is mud slides.</p><p>The death toll has risen to 84.  More than 560 people we should say are  still unaccounted for but that number has dropped substantially over the  last 48 hours.</p><p>Ok, grand theft airplane, two teen boys are now under arrest in Utah.  They  allegedly went on a mile high joy ride.  Police say the duo left a group  home, stole a tractor, drove it to a private air field, swiped a small  plane and then they flew it over a highway before landing actually safely.   But they still face a number of charges.  Ok.</p><p>And then there is this, a gang of thieves may think twice before trying to  rob another jewelry store.  Police in a town near Toronto say the thieves  smashed their way into the store on Wednesday but the tables quickly turned  when employees pulled out swords, not guns, swords -- and rushed them.</p><p>This surveillance footage is from a similar break-in just four months  earlier in a nearby town.  Kind of tells you the story.  One of the crooks  tried to fire the gun but that jammed.  The four men then fled.  They're  still being hunted by police, maybe with guns this time and not swords.</p><p>And those are your headlines -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I bet you Michael is packing a sword right now.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  Oh, Dagen.</p><p>BLOCK:  I'm going to be under the desk.  Excuse me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was nothing meant but -- I was being very literal.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Well, I am from Shell Winds (ph).  It's like a very Wu Tang thing,  you know.  </p><p>ELMORE:  Wu Tang.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was being literal.</p><p>Coming up, the price of oil seeing its lowest levels in over a year.  The  President says what about supplies?  Does he deserve credit for driving  down the price of oil?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have losses across the board on the futures this morning as  we are almost two hours away from the opening bell.  Markets trading until  1:00 p.m. Eastern time this afternoon.  Dow futures are down 117 points.</p><p>The price of crude oil slipping this morning.  Oil now at its lowest level  since late 2017 on an abundance of supply.  President Trump talking about  how important America's relationship with Saudi Arabia is regarding the  price of oil.  This on Tuesday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Right now we have oil prices  in great shape.  I'm not going to destroy the world economy and I'm not  going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi  Arabia.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  joining me now chief oil analyst, one of my favorite people on  the planet, OPIS Tom Kloza.  Tom, your thoughts.  Because you predicted  this wild volatility this time of year.  Where do we go from here?  </p><p>TOM KLOZA, CHIEF OIL ANALYST, OIL PRICE INFORMATION SERVICE:  Well, I think  we go immediately lower.  And I think we might even be dangerously lower.   You mentioned the price of crude.  I think it's about $52 for WTI today.   But if you're in Canada, it's about $12 a barrel.  If you're in the Permian  Basin, which is where all the new crude is coming in the United States,  it's about $45.  So you've got to be careful.</p><p>I mean if you really put the hammer to producers and squeeze a lot more oil  out of the planet, you can push it down below the price where let's say it  has a net positive effect with the country.  I think the December 6th OPEC  meeting is going to result in a cut and prices are going to be fortified by  then.   But I could be wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does President Trump deserve some of the credit for pushing oil  prices down and pushing gasoline prices down as we head into the holiday  season by essentially getting Saudi Arabia and even Russia to make sure  supplies were plentiful?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, you know, you could make it credit.  You could say it's  blame.  I certainly do believe that he's tried to sort of maneuver a  joystick to manipulate oil prices lower before the election and immediately  thereafter.</p><p>And perhaps at some point he's going to get a lot of pressure to fortify  the numbers or else this whole notion of U.S. energy dominance could fall  apart like it did in 2016.</p><p>So I think it's over-stated.  I think mostly what's happened is every  country that usually has problems like Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela and Iraq,  they're all operating about as well as they could hope for.  So I think  that world demand is probably going to pick up and -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  Tom -- quickly -- you mentioned a lot of countries.</p><p>KLOZA:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  What about Saudi Arabia since President Trump has tweeted about Saudi  Arabia and how they kept the spigots on and that's helping depress oil  prices?  </p><p>KLOZA:  I think the Saudis are going to cut.  I think they're going to have  to cut because they are the swing producer and, you know, we'll probably  need a cut of a million, 1.2 million.  </p><p>LI:  What about the Khashoggi case then?  How does that impact oil pricing?  </p><p>KLOZA:  You know, I think it's high drama.  It's kind of a sideline opera  there.  But I don't think it's going to have much impact on whether or not  the Saudis cut.</p><p>I think they need to cut.  They have a budget number of $90, not that  anybody holds to budgets.  But I think they're going to cut production.  I  think probably the notion that the U.S. and the Saudis are just bosom  buddies right now is probably a bit off.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Hey Tom -- one thing, you know, the Iranian sanctions were on the  way up, people were worried about that.  That was going to cut supply.  Now  we're seeing Iranian oil leak through, so-to-speak.  Could part of  fortifying the prices you put be tightening some of these sanctions.  Do  you think that's something we're going to hear about along with the OPEC  cuts?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean we were looking for sanctions on these  countries to where it would be very difficult for them to pull oil.  What  happened instead where you got these waivers to where the sanctions on the  eight countries amounted to a very stern talking to.</p><p>So I suspect that they'll put the squeeze on and they'll make it more  difficult for Iran to export oil and we're starting to see that too.  We  are starting to see them export a little bit less.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tom -- great to see you as always, my friend.  Tom Kloza.</p><p>KLOZA:  Thanks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  before you go, gasoline Christmas day, the retail average, U.S.,  what do you think?  </p><p>KLOZA:  I think about $2.50.  I think we go below that nationally and then  we get to that.  And I think there will be about a dozen states including  some of those fine southern states that you come from that will have less  than $2 if you're prone to looking for it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you feel bad that my Redskins lost yesterday?  </p><p>KLOZA:  I feel bad that the Dallas Cowboys won.  That makes every Friday a  Black Friday in my opinion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My hat is off to you, dear sir.  That's why I asked you that  question.  By the way, Tom's a Giants fan so my feelings are with you.</p><p>Tom Kloza -- good to see you.  We'll see you soon.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>KLOZA:  Good to see you, too.  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, trade hype -- President Trump announcing he and  China's President Xi Jinping will meet at next week's G-20 summit.  We have  more details, next.</p><p>Plus, songbird slip-up.  The Internet goes nuts after Rita Ora's lip  syncing debacle at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back, I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday November 23rd.  Your top  stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>Black Friday is here.  More than 164 million people are expected to go  shopping this weekend, according to the National Retail Federation.   Outrage for Amazon workers, the latest as employees strike in Germany and  Spain today.  </p><p>Plus, small business Saturday kicks off tomorrow.  We check on a veteran- owned and operated apparel company, based in Georgia.  That's ahead.  </p><p>Checking market action this morning, it's been a rough shortened week for  stocks so far.  We have a triple digit loss on the Dow Futures.  The  markets close at 01:00 p.m. Eastern time today, 102 point loss on the blue  chips.  This comes as the NASDAQ is on pace for its worst week in eight  months.  All three major market gauges down more than three percent.  The  NASDAQ close to a four percent loss so far this week.  </p><p>In Europe we have a slight loss on the FTSE 100 in England but gains in  France and Germany.  </p><p>And in Asia overnight, the markets moving lower across the board except for  the Nikkei which was closed for trading this Friday.  </p><p>Crude awakening, we're watching oil prices and oversupply concerns.  We  have crude oil close to dipping below $52.00 a barrel.  </p><p>And honoring America's heroes, President Trump expresses his profound  gratitude to all five branches of the military on Thanksgiving, the details  ahead.  </p><p>And a lip sync fail, how Macy's is responding to Rita Ora's singing gaffe  at the Thanksgiving Day parade.  </p><p>And serious spending, details on the $150,000 Thanksgiving dinner that  included a gold turkey.  Let's start with shopping mania.  The National  Retail Federation estimating about 164 million people plan on shopping over  the holiday weekend.  Today, being the busiest day with 116 million people  planning to go out and spend some money.  Here now National Taxpayers Union  Senior Fellow, Mattie Duppler.  Mattie, good to see you. </p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Talking about those tax cuts, is that one of the reasons the  spending will be so good this weekend and even over the holidays?  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  Well, listen, consumer spending makes up 70 percent of  the economy.  So, it's always a huge chunk of economic growth.  But when  you look at what's happened over the past year for consumers, certainly  Americans have more money in their pockets to spend now.  </p><p>One of the most pervasive characteristics of the recession was the fact  that wages did not rise.  And as a result, there was no discretionary  spending.  I shouldn't say no discretionary spending, but of course  Americans had less money in their pockets and all of the money that they  had, had to go to those fixed costs like mortgage payments, loans, those  sorts of things.  So, lot less to be spending in the consumer economy.  </p><p>Now that the economy has rebounded and Americans on average, the typical  American family had more than a $2,000 tax cut because the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act.  That's a little bit of spending money when you're looking in to  the holiday season.  </p><p>You know what's interesting this year as well, now that we kind of have  moved away from just Black Friday being the biggest retail day of the  nation -- of the year, we now see Black Friday deals starting as early as  November on Veterans Day.  So we've seen a lot more spending moving into  this holiday season and I expect that to continue.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mattie, just I want to point out, $2,000, not crumbs.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  Not crumbs.  Not Armageddon as Nancy Pelosi the  presumed new speaker of the House had said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would  auger for the economy and for Americans.  So certainly a rosier outlook  than Democrats were expecting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think that the Democrats are really going to try and roll  back at least some of the tax cuts for the wealthy, for example, do you  think that that is really a serious agenda item starting in January?  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, I think -- I think that this is really the most interesting  revelation from Democrats that we've seen.  Of course, the debate has  already started.  Nancy Pelosi campaigned for a month saying that adamantly  they were going to repeal the tax cuts as soon as they got power.  And  she's reach -- she's finding a little bit of a resistance from her own  conference after campaigning on that promise.  And then, instituting a rule  change in which they would only repeal the tax cuts for high income earners  as of course, as we know, are not really high income earners at all,  they're middle class Americans.  </p><p>She has met resistance in her caucus with progressive now saying we want  all those tax cuts to be repealed, not just for the high income earners.   So it just goes to show that when Democrats say they want to tax the rich,  what that means is they want to tax the rich first, they want to tax  everyone else following that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this report that workers at Amazon  logistics centers in Germany and Spain have staged strikes today, walking  off on Black Friday.  Is this a sign of trouble for Amazon?  Because again,  with Amazon picking the two new headquarters locations, the HQ2 here and  Queens and down in Washington, there was a lot -- there was -- there was  pushback on these tax breaks from the right and the left.  When you have  the National Review agreeing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, then the  world's been turned upside down.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.  You know, my opinion on the Amazon situation is that  communities should be creating a business environment in which all business  can thrive.  Narrow tax cuts and narrow benefits for one company is  extremely short-sighted in my view for policy makers.  They should be  looking at what the next Amazon is, because Amazon certainly deserves  credit.  It has changed the way we shop in pretty much every sector.  </p><p>However, that means that other companies are trying to keep up.  And we see  that now with Black Friday now extending through the entire month of  November and December.  The future of retail is really online.  So online  commerce is here to stay and that doesn't begin or end with Amazon.  It  means there are many companies waiting in the wings in order to take over  that market share.  </p><p>So, if communities and policy makers are really looking to increase jobs  and economic growth in their neighborhoods, they should be looking to  create a business environment and ecosystem that supports the next Amazon  and the next Amazon after that.  Focusing on one specific company at a time  is a short-sighted view.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, critics of Amazon forget that of all the very small  retailers that Amazon does support.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean we've had them on this program.  They're like very small  retail operations that Amazon gives lift to and I think other large  retailers are doing that and certainly even Instagram.  I'm a big critic of  Facebook.  But Instagram has really given life to a lot of these small  businesses.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Yes, Dagen.  At the end of the day, there's nothing more  democratizing than the Internet.  So small businesses are able to access  audiences.  They otherwise never would be exposed to because the likes of  Amazon and everything else.  So there's certainly a lot of economic growth  as a result of these companies integrating in the communities.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mattie, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A belated happy Thanksgiving, Mattie Duppler.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  And happy Black Friday.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right on.  Stay tuned for our Black Friday coverage on Fox  Business.  We are on the air until 2:00 p.m. Eastern.  And in case you  missed it, here is some of this week's top moments from the show.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your reaction, China, the United States, where do we go from  here in terms of these trade relationships?  </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  So I'm  going to say something outrageous, I actually think that they're going to  get a deal done pretty quickly and if it's not next week, it will be before  the end of the year because that's the president's personality.  </p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  You know, I think this fits in  broadly with the idea that the best is behind us, you know, the peak in  economic activity, capital expenditures, employment and profits, I think is  all behind us now.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And you were a little  optimistic there, bullish about this markets.  </p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, ETFS DISTRIBUTOR:  But my friends stands tall says  I'm a B, a bull with a small B, not a capital B.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, we'll take that.  </p><p>Twitter battle royal.  New York Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez going back and forth with 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah  Palin on Twitter.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become  like, a (INAUDIBLE) for the right.  I mean, they love beating up on her.   She makes mistakes.  She's I think 29 years old.  So she is a novice in  terms of American politics and could use some civic lessons.  And she  really got in trouble with the Middle East, if you recall.  But this case,  it's almost like fun.  It's almost like candy as we approach Thanksgiving.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New rules after the whole Acosta mess a couple of weeks ago.   What's your reaction to all of this?  </p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, I think it's sad  and unfortunate that it's come to this.  You have to mandate professional  and behavior and decorum because a few bad apples are trying to make it  about themselves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Holiday shopping headache, a new Bankrate survey claims the  only half of Americans feel pressure to overspend during the holiday  season.  </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION:  You have to start off with  a plan.  Make a list of the people that you're going to shop for, assign a  dollar amount on what you can afford to spend for that individual and only  spend that amount.  I don't want people to wake up in January and have a  holiday hangover for the next 18 months trying to pay off credit card debt  when they bought things they couldn't afford.  If you can't afford to buy a  gift, then be creative.  Think of ways you can make a gift.  If they have  kids, gift them with babysitting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because when you give people something like I'll babysit your  kids, the recipient of that gift knows that that babysitter is never going  to show up.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Dagen, you sound like you've stood to people up with babysitting  before.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  </p><p>CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  When we were younger,  we used bath bombs all the time but we wanted to make our own, because a  lot of times it would stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little  extra something inside our bath bombs which was a surprise.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb? </p><p>ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in terms of toys and expecting overall  consumer spending this holiday?  </p><p>MARISSA DEBARTOLO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, TOY INSIDER:  We're hoping that it's  going to be a good year this year.  You know, we had the loss of Toys 'R'  Us, but the other retailers are really stepping it up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Basketball takeover, the Harlem Globetrotters are performing  trick shots across the globe and are stopping here in New York City this  weekend. </p><p>Can we try it once? </p><p>CHEESE CHISHOLM, ROOKIE, HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS:  Yes, of course.  This right  here. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  I'm Cheryl Casone with some of your headlines.  President Trump  sending Thanksgiving greetings to U.S. Troops overseas.  He held a  Thanksgiving Day conference call with members of all five military branches  to thank them for their service.  Later the president visited a Coast Guard  station in South Florida expressing his gratitude as he did last year.  </p><p>Pop star Rita Ora is getting brutalized on social media after she was  caught on camera lip syncing her performance at the Thanksgiving Day parade  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RITA ORA, SINGER-SONGWRITER:  I should've stayed with you last night,  instead of going out to find trouble, that's just trouble.  I think I run  away sometimes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  OK, so, Macy's came to her defense, saying they had technical  difficulties during the show.  But the best response of this one from  singer John Legend, here's what he said.  Fun fact, we all have lip sync on  this parade, because the floats don't have the capacity to handle the sound  requirements for a live performance.  Hope you all enjoyed it anyway.  Know  that if you come to my shows, the vocals are 100 percent live.  Good one,  John Legend.</p><p>All right, the results of some football yesterday and fans had a triple  serving of games.  First, the New Orleans, Drew Brees threw four touchdown  passes to lead the Saints to 31-10 win over the Falcons.  It was the 10th  straight win for the Saints, tightening their grip on the NFC South.   Falcons fall the 4-7 as a record the season so far.  </p><p>Now, to the Dallas Cowboys, roasting the Washington Redskins.  Ezekiel  Elliott ran for 143 yards, including this 16 yard.  And look at him throw a  $21.00 in at the Salvation Army army donation bucket.  The Cowboys now  sitting on top of the NFC East.  </p><p>And in Detroit, the Chicago Bears overcame a slow start on short rest and  came roaring back to meet the Lions for the second time in three weeks.  It  was the Bears' 5th straight win.  And they improved their record to 8-3.  </p><p>And there is this, how about a six figure Thanksgiving meal?  A steak house  in New York City offered a $150,000 Thanksgiving dinner.  This is the most  expensive in history, topping their own $76,000 dinner which they offered  last year.  So this year's meal includes the keys to a 2018 Maserati  Levante inside a free range organic turkey sprinkled with gold flakes.  So  you got to eat the turkey to get to the keys, OK.  The manufacturer  suggested retail price for that car, by the way, $74,000, depending what  options you get which don't generally include keys that smell like turkey.   So there you have that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, Cheryl Casone, you know this, the Redskins  quarterback has two broken bones in his legs.  Two, that's why you all won.  </p><p>CASONE:  Can we not just celebrate for a moment with the boys?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you cannot, Cheryl Casone.  I do appreciate you not texting  me last night.  </p><p>CASONE:  No, I wasn't.  I held back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  As the Washington Redskins lost.  Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump just tweeting on border funding writing this,  Republicans and Democrats must come together, finally, with a major border  security package which will include funding for the wall after 40 years of  talk, it is finally time for action.  Fix the border.  For once and for  all.  Now.  All caps, exclamation point.  </p><p>Coming up, from the battlefield to a lifestyle brand, we talk to the CEO of  Nine Line Apparel, a veteran bringing pride, patriotism and trust to the  clothing aisle.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Small Business Saturday is tomorrow.  Today we're highlighting a  veteran-owned and operated apparel company.  Joining me now, retired army  captain and the Nine Line Apparel CEO, Tyler Merritt .  Tyler, I know the  term the -- what does Nine Line mean in the military?  It has great  significance to you.  </p><p>TYLER MERRITT, CEO, NINE LINE APPAREL:  Absolutely, in the military, Nine  Line is the call for help.  When someone's injured on the battlefield, they  call on for Nine Line.  Someone like myself will come and pull them off the  battlefield.  But in the U.S., Nine Line is a call to action.  The idea of  trying to bring those who serve and those who supporters together and  create a conversation, a dialogue about some of the issues that we're going  through.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, talk about the company.  And because I know viewers of Fox  Business and the Fox News Channel will be familiar with the company because  when you expanded to this very large -- I think it's a 60,000 square foot  facility in Savannah, you were on the air.  Tell us about growth and how  your brand is resonating with customers?  </p><p>MERRITT:  Yes, growth is exponential, about 5,000 percent year over year.   We're doing very well.  And the things that we're most proud of is that  we've been able to successfully transition a lot of our non-USA made  products to USA made.  We've been able to increase our job count to almost  over 180 employees from my garage less than five years ago.  So that's one  of the things that we take to heart when the president says growing the  U.S. economy and specifically U.S. made manufacturing, that's patriotism.   That's something we need to do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So where are the products made?  What parts of the United  States?  </p><p>MERRITT:  So, if you look around the table, you've got our shirts over  here, proudly displaying the made in the U.S.  I have my hat that I really  wanted to wear but obviously we're on Fox Business, I'm trying to be a  little more professional but this is --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is such a southern thing, wear your hat inside.  </p><p>MERRITT:  Yes, you got to wear your hat, you can't wear the hat inside.   But you know, the idea of taking it and the sacrifice of going from a  highly profitable, non-U.S. made product to something that's made in the  U.S., you've got quality, plus you know that you're employing more people  here.  </p><p>You know, Nike took a stand on profit above everything else.  We take a  stand on values above everything else.  But we're still hyper profitable.   People are willing to spend just a little bit more for that USA made.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where are you sold?  Like, and are you expanding the number of  channels through which you sell the product?  </p><p>MERRITT:  Absolutely.  We started off almost everything was online.  But  we've transitioned to almost half wholesale.  We picked up in the last year  everyone from field and stream to Dick's, to Cabela's Bass Pro.  And these  are incredible partnerships.  So much so that they grow our sales so fast  that we can't keep up.  This product right here, it's our patented product.   It holds your beer hand free which is very novel and needed.  But as soon  as it landed, we had -- well, we though after January --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can you get a close-up of this.  I'm going to move behind the  mannequin, see, look.  It's perfect.  </p><p>MERRITT:  It is, but this product is out of stock and it's going to be out  of stock until January.  Thanked the wholesalers, they bought up  everything. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you can find it, you could find it in a store potentially.  </p><p>MERRITT:  It's right now in a lot of Big Box Stores, Dick's Sporting Goods,  it's been selling through really, really, really quick.  It will probably  be gone by the time the segment is done.  And I can't resupply it until  about January.  So I do apologize.  I do appreciate all the support.  I  just have to get our growth rate up.  We're a boot strap company.  I'm  still in the process of bringing on some outside funding.  So -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are -- so do you need -- you can't fund growth in with  internal cash flow?  You're trying to raise a little bit of money?  So  you're going to sell part of the business?  </p><p>MERRITT:  Not at the rate that the demand is coming in.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I got it.</p><p>MERRITT:  You know, I can't float the cash to bring in millions and  millions and millions of dollars of a product and wait for it to be sold.   So, we have smaller amounts that get sold out very quickly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tyler, really quickly, how are you giving back to the men and  women who serve and have served?  </p><p>MERRITT:  So, the idea is putting your actions and your money where your  mouth is.  For us, we want to help take care of our veterans.  We build  houses for severely wounded veterans, and right now, we're working on an  initiative to build tiny homes for homeless veterans.  And if you're  interested, check out ninelinefoundation.org.  There's a lot of information  for people that give back.  But we have no paid employees.  And it's a  hundred percent give-back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tyler, thank you, thanks for being here.  Thank you for your  service.  And that goes out to every man and women who is serving today and  has sacrificed for this country.  The freedoms that we hold dear and  congratulations on the business, Tyler Merritt.</p><p>MERRITT:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Everybody, it's the busiest shopping day of the year.

Hope you had a lovely -- </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Black Friday.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know.  I hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving, but we're back to  business.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, we are.  </p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER REPUBLICAN CONVENTION DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And some of these retailers were open yesterday.  </p><p>LI:  Well, you can get your deals online already yesterday.  I know.  I was  sifting through all -- full transparency here, but it's going to be a  blowout shopping season.  </p><p>A trillion dollars for the first time should be spent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the question is, can that turn the market around?  </p><p>Two words.  You get two words, yes or no?  May be.  May be's two words.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Sneaking up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Michael.  We're going to get -- dig into all of this  as the morning wears on.  </p><p>Retail, the Super Bowl was officially here.  Black Friday shoppers braving  the cold, gearing up for major deals.  </p><p>Hillary Vaughn is live in Garden City, New York, where shoppers are scoring  some bargains.  Hey, Hillary.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, one to  know, this mall was open all of Thanksgiving until about 2:00 a.m., and  then they closed for a few hours, and now they're opening their doors again  to daytime Black Friday shoppers.  </p><p>We're seeing this happen all over the country where retailers are not only  rolling out early deals online, but also in stores and malls opening up on  Thanksgiving Day.  </p><p>So, people really don't have to wait late at night outside in the cold for  the mall to open before they're able to cash in on really good deals.  </p><p>So, we've a lot of people starting to trickle in and walk around.  Some of  them already have bags of things that they bought.</p><p>So, we're looking at some early sales data.  The mall here says that they  saw -- basically are expecting to at least have the same turnout in sales  that they had last year at this time, the same number of people, and  possibly purchase or even beat those estimates. </p><p>But some people are also, that have shopped online, are having trouble  getting online.  Walmart and Lululemon had some website access issues,  which is concerning some shoppers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like being able to see what it is that I'm buying  versus having wait and see when it comes, like, in the mail.  But -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And sometimes, I've had it crash, or have the  websites just, like, there's so many people on at the same time. </p><p>So, to be able to still get the deals and not have to worry about if  something sells out or crashes or whatever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  And for the first time ever, half of those shoppers online were  shopping on their phone, Dagen.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  We will check back in next hour.  </p><p>Hillary Vaughn out on Long Island for us. </p><p>Staying on the Trump economy, President Trump touting his administration's  economic success yesterday as this country kicks off its annual holiday  shopping season.</p><p>The Commander-in0Chief commenting on what he is thankful for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you most thankful for, Mr. President?  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For having a great family  and for having made a tremendous difference in this country.  I've made a  tremendous difference in the country.  </p><p>This country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office that  you wouldn't believe it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, Wall Street Global Economic Senator, Jon  HILSENRATH.  I'm thankful for myself.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  So I'm  thankful for myself, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come on, we -- that's funny.  That did make them laugh.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Did that make it around the table last night when you all said  what you were thankful for?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got a great -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Thankful for what I've done for everybody around.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to grade myself.  I give myself an A plus.  Can I give  myself a higher grade than that?  Is that possible?</p><p>Jon, what do you make of the U.S. economy right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we're seeing some signs that it -- it's  slowing down a little bit.  We had numbers earlier this week on investment  durable goods orders.  </p><p>And they were soft and it was a little troubling after a third quarter in  which business investment numbers were kind of soft.</p><p>You all were talking earlier about retail sales.  I mean we're in a moment  right now where the consumer has so much power, with unemployment so low.  </p><p>And the benefits of these tax cuts that this might be a quarter, the fourth  quarter, where it's really the consumer driving thing more than anything  else.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that enough to turn the markets around, though?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you asked Michael yes or no question, I'm going to say  no.</p><p>You know, it does look like the economy is slowing, it does look like  earnings growth going into 2019 is slowing down.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So I think, you know, there's a lot this market has to be  worried about right now.</p><p>BLOCK:  So Jon, with all that, what is the fed thinking here?  You know,  you -- if you go back even a month, everyone was -- it was near certainty  that they were going to raise rates again on -- in December.</p><p>You know, now we're looking at a scenario where suddenly we're starting to  see blanks.  We've talked about it on this program.  </p><p>And the futures markets are starting to price in that this isn't a given  anymore.  </p><p>What is the fed thinking about right now?  What's most important to them?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the fed is thinking that it's going to go in  December, so, you know, we had John Williams, New York Fed President, out  speaking last week.  Jay Powell has been out there talking in the last few  weeks, and they haven't sent any signals that suggest they're wavering.  </p><p>You know, when they see the market volatility like this, they say, \"All  right, that's part of the going back to normal in an economy.  It's having  a market that has ups and downs.\"</p><p>And so I think they're going to look through what -- the volatility we're  seeing right now and go ahead and raise rates in December.</p><p>LI:  I think they have to go in December at this point, because if you  don't, it looks like you're kowtowing to the White House.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  To the President.  </p><p>LI:  You're supposed to be an independent institution, right?  </p><p>Four times that year, that's questionable to me.  That's what Goldman Sachs  is pricing in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean it's interesting because the President has really  been on Jay Powell, the Fed Chairman, about raising rates.</p><p>And he's kind of put the fed into position where if it doesn't raise rates,  which is what the President wants to happen, then it looks like the fed is  getting political -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- and bending to the White House will.  So it's counter --  you could argue that it's counterproductive, but I think from the fed's  point of view, you have unemployment at a 50-year low.</p><p>Their model show that inflation should pick up when inflation gets this  low.  Powell isn't completely convinced of that, but we have seen inflation  pick up.  It's around two percent now.</p><p>So, I think they're going to go ahead in December and then see how things  play out next year.  The big question's what happens in 2019, and when they  meet next month, the big question is going to be how the forecast change  their forecast for 2019 come down.  </p><p>But I wouldn't expect them to back away from a December move at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's stay on the fed really quickly.  </p><p>The President, though, is -- many people think he's right to talk about  interest rates in the sense of that that is a concern that people are  worried about, the Fed Reserve overdoing it.  </p><p>We heard that from the economist, from the National Association of Retail - - excuse me, Realtors, existing home sales were up for the first time in  six months thankfully, but they're worried about the -- about rising  interest rates.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, we -- I mean it's interesting because the fed's been --  I'm sorry, the President has been talking about this for months.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And just now the markets are starting to come around to his  view that maybe the fed is being too aggressive.  </p><p>And the other thing that's interesting about the President's comments is,  you know, he's very vocal about his unhappiness with what Jerome Powell is  doing.</p><p>But he really isn't interfering personally with what the fed has been up  to.  He hasn't talked to Powell since before he was nominated.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this is -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So he's not -- you know, like we saw with LBJ back in the  1960s and President Nixon, they personally intervened with fed leaders and  say -- and said, \"Don't do this.  Don't do this to me.\"</p><p>And with Powell -- I'm sorry, with the President, he's speaking publicly  about it, but he isn't personally intervening with Jay Powell and telling  him to stop.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think anything changes with their balance sheet reduction  that something that Greg Ip was writing about, about the removal of  quantitative easing in Europe.  </p><p>LI:  That's quantitative tightening as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And -- well -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in Europe and Bank -- and the Bank of Japan and here in the  United States.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Well -- so the fed built up this four and half  trillion dollar balance sheet.  They bought all these treasury bonds, all  these mortgage-backed securities, to try to hold down -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- long-term interest rates and boost markets in the economy.</p><p>You know, they've been -- they've been at this for many months now, and  they said they were going to do it more than a year ago.</p><p>It shouldn't be a surprise to markets.  Markets are supposed to be forward- looking, and price in all of this activity.</p><p>LI:  But why do they need to do -- couldn't they hold these bonds to  maturity?  </p><p>I mean, you don't necessarily have to un-want the balance sheet and sell  off a bit -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what they -- that's what the -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, they -- they're not -- they're not selling -- they're  not selling any of the bonds.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, that's what they are doing now.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right?  They're not actively selling.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  They're allowing them -- they're allowing them -- when they  mature, they're just allowing them to retire.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- and they're not recycling them into new bonds.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But the point I was trying to make is, like, the market should  know this.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  So, the -- it shouldn't give be  an on -- </p><p>In theory, it shouldn't be an ongoing headwind to the market because it  should have been priced in a long time ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But a lot people would argue that it is because there's just  all the supply coming out of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're -- but we're assuming that investors are really smart.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And always make really good decisions looking ahead.  </p><p>I want to talk about china.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a lot of cover in this.  But President Trump is expected  to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at the G20 Summit in  Argentina.  </p><p>The President sounding confident on his trade strategy ahead of the much  anticipated meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I can say this China wants to make a deal very badly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think it's going to happen?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Because of the tariffs.  Because right now on $250 billion, they'll  be paying, as of January 1st, 25 percent.  </p><p>And in many cases, they're already paying 205 percent.  On the rest that  they're not, they're paying 10, but the 10 percent goes to 25 percent on  January 1st.</p><p>China is right now paying us.  Right now paying us billions of dollars a  month.  That's never happened before.  And soon, they're going to be paying  us many, many billions of dollars a month.  </p><p>But China wants to make a deal.  If we can make a deal, we will.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then on china, Jon, you guys have one major breaking story  every day, multiple stories a day, in fact.  </p><p>And today, it's the U.S. government has initiated an extraordinary outreach  campaign to foreign allies trying to persuade wireless and internet  providers from avoiding the Chinese telecom equipment maker, Huawei  Technologies.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're putting the hammer down on China in many ways, not  just the tariff and the trade fight.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But it's -- we're doing it in ways that are kind of  inconsistent and hard to read.  On one hand -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- you know, we're trying to convince Germany and Japan not to  buy equipment from Huawei because we're afraid that they're going use that  to spy, not only on Germany and Japan, but at our military installations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But on the other hand, you know, we had this band on U.S.  equipment sales, chip sales, to ZTE and then we reversed it.</p><p>So, it's kind of hard to tell where we're going in this battle.  But, it,  you know, when you look at it, you kind of think, you know, are we going to  do a deal with the Chinese next week and then all of a sudden everything is  fine?  </p><p>And you know economic relations are kind of back to normal with the Chinese  I don't think so.  I think this is a very long run -- confrontation that  we've got with China on its economic might and its technological might.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, to President Trump's credit, this is deliberately hard to  read.  </p><p>You know, the whole point here is exert pressure at various random points  in order to say -- in order to get dialogue going within China -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BLOCK:  -- and back channel saying, \"Hey, this guy is going after us.  Now  we need to step down and make a deal, and I can tell you from my personal  checks that that's feeling in China right now.  </p><p>But there is also this optimism that deals are going to get done with the  midterms out of the way going into the New Year.  </p><p>When Wilbur Ross said, \"Wait until next year,\" he wasn't kidding.  There's  things happening.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, final word, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think next week, with Xi Jinping and President Trump, this  is going to get a lot of attention.  I don't expect a big breakthrough.</p><p>I mean maybe they keep talking going into 2019.  But the President just --  and that hit didn't sound like he was ready for a deal.  </p><p>He said the Chinese want to do a deal.  He didn't say he's ready to do the  one himself.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's yesterday and then there's today.  So, maybe we'll  get a tweet in the next 45 minutes that's incredibly optimistic.  You just  never know.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Keep watching.  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Happy Thanksgiving, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Come back soon.  Jon Hilsenrath, Wall Street  Journal.  Stay tuned, our special Black Friday market coverage on Fox  Business.  </p><p>Markets close at 1:00, we're here until 2:00.  </p><p>And then coming up, border battle.  President Trump threatening to shut  down the entire U.S.-Mexico border if troops cannot get a handle on the  migrants looking to cross into this country.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dozens killed in a mosque blast in Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone  has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  We're  just getting some new details on this story.  </p><p>Here's what we know.  This was an explosion at a mosque in the Eastern  Afghan Province of Coast.  </p><p>The mosque was inside of an army base, this was evening prayers.  At least  26 people are dead, 50 wounded.  The victims, of course, had gathered there  to pray.  </p><p>No word on what caused that explosion, though.  We're going to, of course,  be updating this story throughout the morning for you.</p><p>Another headlines this morning, Black Friday shopping turning violent in an  Alabama mall last night.  </p><p>Police fatally shooting a suspected gunman who they say opened fire inside  a mall crowded with shoppers.  Two people, including a 12-year-old girl,  were injured.</p><p>The gunshots sent shoppers scurrying for cover and several were seen with  their guns drawn.</p><p>The gunfire started just before 10 p.m. at the Riverchase Galleria in  Hoover.  That's about 10 miles from Birmingham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was crazy in every direction.  And I just started  praying and praying that God would give the police wisdom and accuracy of  shot, protect the victims.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The suspect has not yet been identified.</p><p>Well, dozens were hurt after a charter bus overturned on an icy road in  Washington State.</p><p>That bus was carrying the University of Washington Marching Band and it  flipped on its side.</p><p>They were on their way to tonight's Apple Cup came against Washington  State.  </p><p>Nearly 40 of the 56 people onboard were injured, but none of those  injuries, luckily, are serious.</p><p>Well, Nissan's Board voting unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn from  his post.  </p><p>The Japanese automaker claims Ghosn used company money to buy personal  homes, including a condominium in Rio de Janeiro.  </p><p>Nissan also says that Ghosn uses subsidiary in the Netherlands to make  multiple payments totaling thousands of dollars to his older sister for  consulting.</p><p>Shares of the company are down about 14 percent so far this year, Dagen.  </p><p>And there is the year-to-date with chart.  A lot of pressure and a lot of  news coming out on Nissan as well.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  I'm reading \"The Wall Street  Journal's\" story that the auto -- Nissan found that Carlos Ghosn used a  subsidiary in the Netherlands, which Cher was talking about, to spend $18  million, buying, renovating personal homes.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It wasn't just a condo in Rio, but it was a home in Beirut that  his sister received 60,000 commission for advising on the housing in Rio.</p><p>LI:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But found no evidence that the sister actually performed such  work.</p><p>LI:  And he underreported his $44 million in earnings as well according to  these allegations in Japanese court.  </p><p>And so, yes, Japan doesn't take this lightly, as I mentioned to you.  It's  a very insular domestic oriented economy.  And when you're a foreign CEO  heading up one of the largest companies in the country, you know, that  doesn't look good for you, especially for a legacy.  </p><p>Someone like Carlos Ghosn who's been -- his tenure has been over 10 years  at the helm of Nissan.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they save Nissan -- he essentially saved Nissan from  bankruptcy.</p><p>LI:  Avoided, 2008.  Yes.</p><p>BLOCK:  That's -- then becomes a corporate rock star, and now this happens.   Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well they wanted to -- independence, I guess.  And now -- </p><p>LI:  But it took a while for them to actually kick him out because they  needed Renault's support in order to oust him as chairman and they finally  got it, so.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What happens to the alliance, guys?</p><p>LI:  I think it stays in place because it's been intact for so long.  It's  been successful.  I think they -- they're -- bringing in new people  obviously, new blood to front the new entity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you don't have to be a rock star to actually know how to run  a company or series of companies.  I'll just point that out.</p><p>BLOCK:  It's more -- </p><p>LI:  Maybe -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Boring is better sometimes.</p><p>LI:  Maybe stars only shine so long, I think that's the lesson.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>BLOCK:  You're a rock star, and don't steal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, caravan crisis, more asylum seekers gaining ground  near the U.S.-Mexico border, as President Trump threatens to shut it down  entirely.  </p><p>Plus subpoena sent, FBI Director James Comey urging for transparency, set  to answer house judiciary questions over the Clinton email investigation.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take a look at futures today.

We'll be looking  into this, digging into this as the morning moves on.</p><p>Markets close today shortened trading session.

I mean the whole border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This coming after reports that a small group separated from the  major migrant caravan within 500 feet of the U.S. border yesterday.</p><p>Joining us now, \"Weekly Standard\" Deputy Editor Kelly Jane Torrance.  What  do you make of what the President was talking about there?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes.  You know, it's  really coming to a showdown, isn't it, Dagen?  And I have mixed feelings.  </p><p>I mean you don't want to close the border to people who do have real  problems and who are seeking asylum, but at the same time, a lot of these  people are coming specifically for a showdown.</p><p>And, you know, the President says talking about closing down border, but  what he's not mentioning is actually the government knows about the caravan  and has been preparing for it for months now.</p><p>And what's interesting is the administration is actually implementing what  they call a Remain in Mexico plan, which is if you can show that you have  worries for your life, you need to get out of Mexico, you will be let into  the United States while your asylum claim is being processed.  </p><p>But if you can't, you're going to actually wait in Mexico while that claim  is being processed.</p><p>And, you know, President Trump has been complaining for a while about the,  you know, what he calls the, you know, detainee program now, and  complaining about people being released.  </p><p>Well, if they're going to have to wait in Mexico, it might actually stop  some people from coming to United States who think, \"Well, I can get here,  I can get to the United States.  And once they let me go, I can do what I  want.\"</p><p>So there's a lot going on here that the President isn't talking about  that's going on behind the scenes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Erin.  </p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.  Hi, Kelly.  Erin Elmore here.  Good morning.  We know that  immigration is a huge issue for the Trump voter and the Trump base.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p>ELMORE:  What do you think the right play is here?  We know 9th Circuit is  trying to control the situation, but what do you think the right play is?   What do you tell the President to do?</p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes, and, you know what, everyone's complaining about Donald  Trump talking about the politicized core, but let's face it, you had -- </p><p>Okay, so this is not the 9th Circuit, but it's the district court that  things go to the 9th Circuit.  The District Court of Northern California  complained that the President cannot make immigration law and it stopped,  you know, his recent laws.  </p><p>But let's face it, that same court actually thought that it was okay for  Obama, President Obama to make immigration law with DACA, with the, you  know, the DREAM Act.</p><p>And so then it was like, \"Oh, it's okay for the president to say -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  -- that we're going to have this DREAM Act in young people who  are here.  They had no problem with the President making immigration law  then they have a problem with Donald Trump doing it.</p><p>So I mean, you know, you don't want to criticize courts too much, you want  to let them do their job, but I think in this case, Donald Trump actually  has a point.  </p><p>And you say, you know, look at and it's like, \"Well, hey, we're -- Donald  Trump can't make immigration law but Barack Obama can.\"  He has a good  point there.</p><p>ELMORE:  So he's not relying on his own precedent, is what you're saying  basically.  And that's -- the beauty of courts is that their precedent  shows you what they're going to likely do in the future.  </p><p>And in this case, they're not relying on their own precedent and it is  politics.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Exactly.  I mean I agree with the court, actually, that it's  Congress who should be making immigration law.</p><p>But we -- of course we know that Congress has been trying since the George  W. Bush years to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill and it's not  going to happen.  </p><p>Let's face it, it's just never going to happen and that's why presidents  have been using executive orders to do things that they want and, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What -- well, I want to point out that one very well-known  Democrat, Hillary Clinton, weighed in on immigration.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Former Presidential candidate urging Europe to get a handle  on the migrant crisis there.  </p><p>This is in an interview with \"The Guardian.\"  </p><p>Hillary Clinton said this, \"I admire the very generous and compassionate  approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like German Chancellor,  Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part and  must send a very clear message.\"</p><p>\"We're not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support  because we don't deal with the immigration issue.  We'll continue to roil  the body politic.\"</p><p>Your reaction to that.  Again, it's -- she's talking about Europe, but why  not the United States?</p><p>TORRANCE:  Well -- and, of course, one of the reasons that Europe has this  crisis is because Angela Merkel actually welcomed migrants to come to  Germany.</p><p>People forget that the reason that you have this migrant crisis, one of the  reasons, is that Angela Merkel said, \"Hey, you guys need asylum?  Come  here.\"</p><p>And, of course, people listen.  But let's face it, why do we -- why does  Europe have that migrant crisis?  It's because of the war in Syria.  </p><p>And, you know, honestly, if we got rid of the terrible regime in Iran,  that's propping up Bashar al-Assad and making it impossible to live in  Syria, for regular Syrians who are facing, you know, terrible situations,  they wouldn't be doing that.</p><p>So, yes, let's look at the root causes of why people are leaving and I  think -- no, that's one of the things that Donald Trump is tried -- sort of  said is like, hey, we need to look at what's happening in Central America  and maybe help people at the source, so they don't feel they need to leave.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She -- Hillary Clinton did say that you need to handle the  immigration crisis if you want to stop the rise of right wing populist, in  the region.  But I'll point out.</p><p>Remember the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany that were virtually  not covered by the news media, here in the United States?  In large part,  because of this immigration crisis that Hillary Clinton is talking about  and I think that was two years ago, maybe, just to point that out.</p><p>TORRANCE:  It's not even just it wasn't covered here, it was actually not  covered in Germany so much, because police in Cologne actually wouldn't --  didn't want people to know about what was happening because they didn't  want people angry at the government that -- you know, welcome those people  to come.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Kelly Jane, Kelly Jane Torrance, this morning, Happy  Thanksgiving.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Black Friday madness.  It's the biggest shopping day  of the year.  We'll see if retail stocks get a boost or even the overall  market.  And live action Lion King, a sneak peek at the latest trailer from  Disney and all of the talent that comes along with it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, Black  Friday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, November 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Black Friday  is here.  More than 164 million people are expected to go shopping this  weekend, that, according to the National Retail Federation.</p><p>Checking out market actions this morning, Futures are pointing way, way  lower, 126-point loss on the Dow Futures.  Markets close at 1:00 p.m.  Eastern time, today.  But so far, in this shortened holiday week, the Dow,  S&amp;P and NASDAQ are all down more than three percent.  NASDAQ Composite down  nearly four percent.  That's the worst week in eight months, for the  NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe, markets have shown some mixed moves.  So far, we have green  across the screen, at the moment, slight gains in England, France and  Germany, and in Asia overnight, markets moving lower.  The Nikkei was  closed for trading, but the Hang Seng, Shanghai and KOSPI in South Korea,  all to the downside.</p><p>Crude awakening, we're watching oil prices amid oversupply concerns, we  have a four percent loss on the cost of crude this morning, the cost of  oil, at $52.32 a barrel.</p><p>Question for James Comey, the latest developments as the former FBI  director is vowing to fight a subpoena he received from House Republicans  before they pass the baton to the Democrats.</p><p>It's sky-high bid, the details as Virgin Atlantic reportedly discusses  purchasing struggling budget airline, Flybe.  Plus, a legendary face-off,  $9 million showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, that's ahead.   And the Lion King is back.  A sneak peek at the live-action reboot, later  this hour.  We will play this trailer over and over and over again.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, Futures are heading lower on the  busiest shopping day of the year, joining us now, Payne Capital Management  President, Ryan Payne.  Can -- do investors need to see even better-than- expected sales, this weekend?  Is that enough to turn this market around?</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Well, it wasn't earlier  in the weeks, so we had, you know, a couple big new retailers report  earnings on Tuesday.  You know, you got Kohl's report, you got Target  report, and they had great sales, and they sold off pretty unmercifully, I  would say.</p><p>LI:  But it's profit margins because people are thinking ahead, thinking  when (INAUDIBLE) a bite, when do supply chains get too expensive and when  do shoppers stop shopping when interest rates go up.</p><p>PAYNE:  And I think that is a big one.  I think everyone is worried, like,  has the consumer peaked here?  Is this as good as it going to get?  And I  think that's kind of been the overhang on the market.  Like, do we really  believe the economy is getting stronger?  At some point here, it's all  going to collapse.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, if you look at this, I want to stay on retail before we  move on, but if you look at these retail stocks, the only of this major  list of retail stocks that we follow, including Kohl'sNordstrom, Penney's,  Macy's, you name it, the only one up, so far this month, is -- </p><p>Well, you know, because I asked my (INAUDIBLE) about it.  It's Fred's.   Fred's is up on, but it's up 9-1/2 percent, but you've got an 18 percentage  point loss, almost 19 percent, like Abercrombie and Fitch, these are deep,  deep, deep losses for these retail stocks.</p><p>BLOCK:  We were watching T.V. earlier about Black Friday, and there was a  woman who was sitting at the mall and she was interviewed, and she said,  yes, I was getting 60 to 70 percent off at Aeropostale.  What does that  mean for an Abercrombie?  It's definitely difficult.</p><p>You know, one thing I'm looking at here is, earlier this year, we talk  about wage costs, freight costs.  Those are allegedly going to hit the  retail.  But what happened was, retailers were able to keep raising their  prices and they actually turned out decent margins.</p><p>With the Kohl's and Target reports earlier this week, we saw, A, there is  some concern about freight costs, both companies mentioned that, but also,  B -- you know -- B, there's also -- there are some issues with the price.   You know, what could save these stocks here?  What could help them?</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, I think at this point (INAUDIBLE) as an overall lifted  market, right?  They also sold off just because a whole market there is  capitulating in the short term, which I would argue it's probably a good  buying opportunity because now, valuations are even more reasonable.</p><p>And, you know, our belief in Payne Capital Management is, you know, the  retailer -- the retail investors are strong right now.  Consumer is strong  and it's going to continue to get stronger.  So, as long as the consumers  in good shape, I think it's going to be very good for those stocks, long  term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that argument about, I can find some bargains now.  People  have been saying that about technology and big technology stocks, and  you've continued to see a downdraft in all of these big names, and Apple,  really, putting pressure on the market, specifically, earlier in the week.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, you live by a (INAUDIBLE) right?  I mean, tech, has had a huge  move up, and now we've seen this, you know, huge move down.  So, at some  point, I think you have to find some kind of ground here where the market  says OK.</p><p>You know, valuations are reasonable.  I mean, techs never going to get  reasonable here.  I mean, you're still trading at like, 20 times forward  earnings, which is a premium to the market.</p><p>LI:  It's a growth stock though.  That's a growth sector.  That's kind of  how they're valued, aren't they?  You know, we -- </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>LI:  We actually had Facebook, admitting, going into the holiday, later on  Wednesday, that they did hire definers.  That was -- they did that on  purpose, so that we would miss the headlines on Thursday.  But, they  admitted to hiring definers, Sheryl Sandberg admitted to actually knowing  that they hired this opposition research team.</p><p>So, what about Facebook, in particular?  What about the reputational risk,  regulatory risk priced in?</p><p>PAYNE:  I (INAUDIBLE) priced in.  We had a lot of panic already.  And  anecdotally, I work the retail investor.  And invariably, the retail  investor is always wrong.  So, when they start to panic -- you know, I  think, when they start to panic, you're starting to see some panic in here,  that's actually very bullish for the markets.</p><p>You didn't see that before and we had a big selloff in the end of October,  and we kind of hit those lows again, this past week.  No, no one's really  panicking, that always concerned me, but now you're starting to see a  little bit of panic in there, which makes me think we're probably even  closer to some kind of bottom in here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what, I think our viewers, based on  their comments on Twitter, are quite smart about the markets, when what's  part --  a part of what's causing this downdraft, it's the smart money.   It's the smart money getting put out of business because they have been so  wrong.  Talk about that.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  Well, what's been going on, is Q3 was hard for one, the hedge  funds, they've got whipsawed by a lot these, moves higher in the big tech  stocks, and then, right when they -- right when they bought into that, it  traded down.  It was a rough October, rough November.</p><p>There's a lot of blood out there.  There's a lot of liquidation.  I'm  reading about somebody's energy focus funds.  There's an energy fund that's  down 15.7 percent, month to date, right now, and around, so there's a lot  going on.</p><p>Your clients, you do have -- you know, you claim retail investors aren't  smart, but you know, of course, yours are the smartest, and what are they  saying?  Like, are they excited about the market?  Are they apprehensive?   What's your biggest concern right now?</p><p>PAYNE:  When was the retail investor not smart?  But they tend to be very  emotional, right?  And that emotional Litmus test.  Then, you know, we can  argue, is the smart money really that smart?  Hedge funds have not done  that well in the last couple of years.</p><p>Just the fact they're selling, they might not -- they might be indicative  of making a bad decision as opposed to good decision.</p><p>BLOCK:  They're Mike Tyson-smart.  They're geniuses until they get punched  in the face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonas Ferris used that very quote on Wednesday, by the way.</p><p>BLOCK:  Great minds think alike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you were -- no, you were watching, is what -- </p><p>BLOCK:  Hi, Jonas.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just kidding.  Ryan Payne, good to see you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks so much.  Stay tuned.  Our special Black Friday on Fox  Business, we're here until 2:00 p.m. Eastern.  And coming up, he's urging  for transparency, former FBI Director James Comey, issuing -- issued a  subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee, over the Hillary Clinton E-mail  scandal.</p><p>Plus, showdown on the links, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods set to duke it  out today, in Vegas, with a $9 million purse.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Weird song.  Virgin Atlantic reportedly in talks to by Flybe.   Cheryl Casone has more.  Hey, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  That's weird.  All right, here's the news: Sky News says the  Britain's Virgin Atlantic is going to acquire regional airline, Flybe.   This comes a week after Flybe announced in talks to sell itself.  Virgin  Atlantic owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Delta Airlines.  Flybe  has got a market cap of about 27 million.  Last month, Flybe has shared a  proper warning, though; they said a weak demand and a weaker British  Pounds.  So, we'll see if Virgin Atlantic gets the deal. </p><p>Former FBI Director, James Comey says that Republicans have subpoenaed him  to testify at a closed-door meeting of the House Judiciary Committee early  next month.  In a Thanksgiving Day tweet, Comey says, that he would be  happy to answer the committee's questions but would resist doing it behind  closed doors for that his testimony will be leaked and distorted.  The  subpoena part of a congressional inquiry into allegations of anti-Trump  bias that led to the opening of the Russia investigation.  </p><p>Well, the head-to-head matchup between two of the biggest names in golf  takes place today.  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson is going to hit the  links in Las Vegas, the much-hyped $9 million winner take all match.   Organizers are hoping to recoup the money from fans willing to pay $19.99  for pay-per-view.  Woods and Mickelson are also putting up their own cash  and side bets that eventually, of course, is all going to charity.  Teatime  is set for 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Dagen, place your bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a Disney classic reborn.  The first trailer for the  live-action \"Lion King\" wowing people; it basically broke the Internet  yesterday.  Coming up, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is wrong you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Start churning butter and put on your church shoes  little sister because we're about to blast off.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is it you're trying to say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to the Internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the new animated film \"Ralph Breaks the  Internet\"; the sequel to Disney's \"Wreck It Ralph,\" it premiers on  Wednesday.  Joining me now: \"IN THE FOX LIGHT\" Host, Michael Tammero. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The microphone is off?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is your take on \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" is he going to  break the box office?  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR MARKETING:   It's going to break all sorts of records this weekend, looking probably  about $100 million.  You know, this is a big weekend for the box office  every year; and so far, box office is up over 10 percent this year over  last year, with an -- attendance is up which is even a bigger story right  now.  It's not just, you know, the fact that tickets are more expensive,  but attendance is up about seven percent so far this year.  And this  weekend, looks to push those numbers even higher.  The Ralph, critics are  loving him and audiences are loving him as well and it about A- cinema  score. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What else is opening this weekend or is in competition -- </p><p>TAMMERO:  We have \"Creed 2,\" follow up to the big 2016 hit, Michael B.  Jordan -- what a year this guy has had.  He started the year with \"Black  Panther\" which grossed over $700 million.  \"Creed 2\" is getting also sorts  of critical acclaim; and who knows it could push him to an Oscar coming  down, an award season, you just never know with these things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right, so what broke yesterday, can we just watch it?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Oh, my God, yes!  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"The Lion King\" live-action trailer, the very first one.  Roll  it.  Do we have it?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Or not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There we go. </p><p>TAMMERO:  Oh my god.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not all of it.  I'm just going to sit here (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>TAMMERO:  Over and over again.  Look, this formula has been really  successful for Disney: Bringing these animated movies to live-action  movies.  A lot of -- how is this going to look?  This broke yesterday.   People are going nuts.  I was driving home watching it from mother-in-law  and I said, oh my god, this look so good.  And my husband was like, enough  with \"The Lion King.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.</p><p>TAMMERO:  We've seen the Broadway show ten times, the movie, but guess  what?  Guess who was watching it last night and all of a sudden oh my god,  this looks incredible.  I'm like, see?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You caught your husband when you were in the other room watching  the trailer on his phone.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Sold.  He is sold, Jon Favreau is directing, Beyonce plays Nala,  Donald Glover is in this -- Darth Vader, I can't think of his name -- James  Earl Jones is in this as well plays Mufasa.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I actually -- because I'm such a nerd as Adam Driver but it  wasn't Adam Driver.  But it's -- the James Earl Jones does the voiceover  for the film.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is it about?  Is it this movie?  I know that they've really  brought back some iconic Disney films through this new live-action  technology but there's something about \"The Lion King:\" It's the music and  it's the story and the fact that it had life as an animated film and then  as a Broadway show -- which so many people have seen.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  It's a great story and the music is fantastic.  This is going to  have a whole remade score from Hans Zimmer, that we'd get to look forward  to.  And it's also -- it's the way they do these movies now; it's so  incredible.  When you think about the motion capture and the CGI tech --  watching this last night, I kept thinking: Wow, animation is no longer the  only execution to create a world; now it's just going to be a style of  execution.  When you can do things like this, you really don't need to know  the animation, this looks real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE), from \"Swingers.\"  What an incredible -- but what an  amazing career as a director when a lot of people just thought he would  just be an actor.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  He's responsible for Disney's \"The Jungle Book\" which made  hundreds of dollars last year at the box office.  I cannot wait.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It looks --</p><p>TAMMERO:  2019 cannot come soon enough.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But now, Jon Favreau, you have to deliver.  It has to be as good  as the trailer.  It better be better than the trailer.  Happy Thanksgiving.   Loved your whole family; loved your husband, Michael Tammero.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Happy Thanksgiving.  Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, everybody, still ahead, it's the busiest shopping day  of the year and we're just getting started, the best Black Friday deals  more on the markets next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.

Welcome to a  special Black Friday edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday, November 23th, your top  stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, time to go shopping.  It's Black Friday more  than 164 million people are expected to shop this weekend.  Online sales  are set to hit records.  We'll keep an eye on retailers this morning like  Amazon, Overstock, Macy's, these stocks have all been very hard hit, most  of the retailers so far this month, can they turn around? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon hit by a worker's strike in Germany and Spain today.  Futures are  showing this and the market action this morning.  The losses across the  board.  The Dow futures are down 84 points.  And, again, this is so far  we're trying to turn around what has been a really, really awful week.  We  have losses of more than three percent at almost four percent loss on the  NASDAQ Composite so far this week.  In Europe, we have England, France, and  Germany trading wide-open. </p><p> A slight loss on the Footsie 100 in England.  Gains in France and Germany.   The Asian markets closing lower overnight.  The Nikkei was closed  altogether.  It never opened, but we have losses on the other three major  markets there.  The price of crude oil slipping this morning.  We have oil  prices now at the lowest level since late 2017 on abundance of supply.  We  break out what is going on.  Telecom trouble, the U.S. warning that  countries dealing with Chinese company Huawei Technologies ahead of this  big meeting between President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping at the  G20 Summit next week. </p><p> The concern is the use of Huawei Technology and potential infiltration on  the U.S. military bases abroad.  And then on to the border battle,  President Trump threatening to shut down the entire Mexican border if  immigration becomes uncontrollable.  This is a group breaks off from the  migrant caravan just 500 feet away from the U.S. border.  The Trump  administration reportedly wants to meet the heads of Volkswagen, BMW, and  Daimler to discuss trade policy. </p><p>Reuters says that the invitation is to meet with Economic Advisor Larry  Kudlow Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  Then the thriller on the green,  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson teeing off today in a special pay-per-view  match in Las Vegas.  Nine million dollars at stake.  We have details.  And  Lion King goes live action.  We can just listen to that all morning long.   The trailer for the Lion King movie making its debut online and more of the  amazing video coming up. </p><p> Here to break it all down this morning, Fox Business Network's Susan Li,  Chief Market Strategist at Third Seven Advisors, Michael Block, and  Republican strategist, former Trump surrogate, former Republican Convention  Deputy Press Secretary Erin Elmore.  Erin, I'm going to get to the  president's tweet.  I don't feel like I've talked to you enough this  morning.  So the president just tweeted and I'm going to get your reaction  really quickly.  Here's what the president says, really good criminal  justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. </p><p> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer have a real chance  to do something so badly needed in our country.  Already passed with the  big boat and House would be a major victory for all.  He's seriously  focused regardless of the Democrats' win in the House.  He's seriously  focused on getting things done. </p><p> ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Right, because it's been so divisive.   Right now, it's Republicans vote one way and Democrats vote another way,  and there's really no sort of civility anymore.  And I think he's really  wants to get things accomplished in a bipartisan fashion because we haven't  seen that in the last two years and I also think he's looking forward to  2020.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I don't -- I will argue that the president based on just  the language that he enjoys using sometimes.  It's not about civility.   It's about results.  But it's not -- it's not about getting along in terms  of not calling each other names.  It's actually passing things that benefit  all America. </p><p> ELMORE:  Absolutely, because he has the best interests of the American  people at heart whereas some these people in the Senate -- in the House  that are so worried about their reelects and their elections and just sort  of banging their fists on principle aren't so focused on those goals. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So instead of investigations in the House maybe we get actual  things getting done and he's talking about the Senate, but -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ELMORE:  Well, I think, you know, focusing on the Hillary Clinton stuff and  dredging all that up again.  Let's be more like the markets.  Let's be  forward looking, right?  So I think that's what should be the big focus  here Hillary Clinton stuff, it's old news and I think we have to move on  from all of it. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, maybe she's going to run again. </p><p> ELMORE:  I mean that would be -- that would be Christmas come early for the  Republicans. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What a day.  So we'll move on this Black Friday full swing -- in  full swing.  Shoppers scored deals ahead of the holidays.  Hillary Vaughn  is live from Garden City, New York with the very latest.  Good morning,  Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dagen.  Well, the  Apple store just opened up.  That's the big news here.  There was a line  all the way down this hallway.  They opened up.  Now, a lot of people  looking to get good deals on new Apple products.  But Apple is one of the  stores where they're kind of offering a bonus gift card with any purchase - - some of the purchases for some of their new gear.  Not necessarily  discounting their prices. </p><p> But we have other long lines here.  You have lines out the door for jewelry  stores.  I talked to a lot of these shoppers in line.  They're looking to  get some gifts for their mom, their sisters.  Some guys in line looking to  get gifts for their daughter or girlfriend.  This is a store that's been  pretty steady.  A lot of people stacked up in line.  We've seen a lot of  young shoppers today.  A lot of high schoolers out with their friends  looking to cash in on the good deals and get those gifts, a lot of  millennial shoppers. </p><p> So, you know, all this talk of people hopping on their phones staying at  home doing everything online, well, we've seen young shoppers actually get  into the holiday spirit.  They like the idea of going out with their  friends grabbing coffee early in the morning and coming here, and making a  day of it.  So a lot of hustle and bustle here people cashing in getting  into holiday spirit, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hillary, thank you for that.  Hillary Vaughn for us at -- on  Long Island.  President Trump touting his administration's economic  successes yesterday as the United States kicks off its annual holiday  shopping season.  The commander-in-chief commenting on what he's thankful  for. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you most thankful for Mr. President? </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For having a great family  and for having made a tremendous difference in this country.  I've made a  tremendous difference in the country.  This country is so much stronger now  than it was when I took office that you wouldn't believe it. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here now fashion and retailer trend analyst Charcy Evers.   Charcy, your take on the holiday shopping season kicking off so far?  What  should we be watching? </p><p> CHARCY EVERS, FASHION AND RETAIL TREND ANALYST:  We are all about  experience at retail right now and that's what's drawing people into the  stores.  I keep saying that Black Friday is back and that's what customers  are coming in for the experience and we're seeing that across, you know,  all the big box stores as well as smaller retailers -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What kind of experience other than just the elbows and showing  from the crowds because you're talking about things that the retailers have  really planned to really push and to get people -- get -- to produce foot  traffic? </p><p> EVERS:  Right, exactly.  And it's part of much larger shift in retail in  general this idea of creating experience centers in touch points because we  all know that we can all buy everything online.  So what's going to give me  a reason to come into a store?  Target for example has over 25,000 hours of  retail experience planned throughout the holiday season.  They have hours  of play for kids really kind of taking advantage of the hole in the market  that Toys\"R\"Us left inviting children in and having play dates with them  and actually letting them use toys before you're even buying them. </p><p> So it's really creating a way to get them into the stores.  Wal-Mart the  same thing.  They're having actual play dates with children really inviting  them in.  They've also created a digital playground online where you can  use your tablet or your computer to try the toys out before, so that's just  one the ways that these retailers are having people, you know, getting them  into the store and making it like enjoyable. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because it's hard to get consumers in the store especially if  you can shop online and that's why it's hard to compete also with Amazon's  discount.  You really have to slice a lot of your pricing, right? </p><p> EVERS:  Right.  And I think we all know that, you know, to -- the holidays  is a perfect time to kind of come up with a new experiential strategy as a  retailer because it's, you know, we -- the idea of Black Friday or the  holidays in general is like let's go and sit on Santa's lap and take a  picture.  That's always kind of, you know, it's bringing back that  nostalgia of going in and creating tradition and Black Friday for many  families is a tradition of going shopping -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about pricing though? </p><p> ELMORE:  I mean (INAUDIBLE) get competitive when you have to give door  busters and you basically cut your prices to extraordinary levels. </p><p> EVERS:  I think that retailers are really trying to take -- get away from  that stigma that Black Friday has of like people fighting over T.V.'s at  the door and making it more of a kind of feel good family experience.   There's always -- we know we're going to get the best prices online.  We  know that the deals are out there.  But it's kind of, again, as I said,  it's part of this larger shift in retail in general of creating an  experience in the holidays really lend itself well to that -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ELMORE:  -- this holiday season?  </p><p> EVERS:  Target for sure.  I know their earnings will let you know was not a  good Tuesday for them.  But, you know, they've really put -- they've  reinvested in their company.  They put money back into the stores and  really, you know, built-up their e-commerce business.  So I think we will  be surprised to see them.  I think they'll have a good holiday season. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It might -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  So, Charcy,  you talked about Kohl's, and Target, and Kohl's, you talked about investing  more in their business perhaps some more in these experiences, what about  the mall operators?  They've been under a lot of fire as, you know -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BLOCK:  -- retail investment in kinds of places, is there any talk amongst  the mall operators about how to provide more experiences? </p><p> EVERS:  Oh, absolutely.  I think that that's why, you know, we were talking  a lot -- we talked a lot about retailer apocalypse and I always say it's  actually retail renaissance.  It's a much needed renaissance and rebirth of  retail and it has caused the mall developers to really look at how they're  using their space, right?  So Roosevelt Mall for example has an area where  shops are just pop-ups.  So rather than going into these long-term leases  which are really difficult for retailers to sustain, you know, and it's a  risk in having overhead inventory. </p><p> Having pop-ups gives me a reason like I know when in one a month, it's  going to be a different store there, so I'm going to go back into the mall  and I'm going to go check out what's new with the pop-ups.  So it's a  little bit of novelty.  There's also, you know, Westfield does a great job  of incorporating experience in terms with theater, with entertainment, with  restaurants, you know, they will become more experiential hubs. </p><p> And going back to Wal-Mart, they've really create -- they're doing new  things with their stores and creating what they call town centers.  And,  actually, using the space around them, you know, the parking lots, the  empty stores around them and creating these experiential centers that are  really drawing consumers in, so -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And don't -- because, again, I feel like some retail success  stories get lumped in with the mall problems which had been going clearly  30 years in this country because I keep bringing this up, but Aerie which  is a division of American Eagle was -- if you watched Aerie, that store  literally -- it pulled you in you as a -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- shopper that they have such great inexpensive like lounge  wear.  If you were watching Aerie versus Victoria's Secret, you would know  even two years ago that Victoria's Secret was in trouble and that Aerie was  on the rise. </p><p> EVERS:  Oh, yes.  I talked a lot about that.  Don't get me started  Victoria's Secret.  I think that -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> EVERS:  -- they missed out on the roller trend, you know, and they're also  -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> EVERS:  -- very early and they did it and they did it well, and Victoria's  Secret just needs, you know, come with the top -- like lived up in the  times, you know, they didn't shift when the consumer shifted.  We're with  at leisure out there and more athletic apparel and stuff.  The bras don't  need to be under wired.  We're not into push-up bras.  We're not into that  image of a woman any more, you know, it's about physical -- it's about  being comfortable and -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- was the management at Victoria's Secret living in that they  wouldn't know that it was about this -- there's not one standard of beauty  anymore and it doesn't weigh 100 pounds and is six feet tall and -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  -- the primetime lingerie  show.  I mean -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> EVERS:  -- but when you -- when you think about the comments of the CMO  made about the Victoria's Secret Show, you really see that it's better than  the culture.  This ideology that's outdated. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That CMO has been running that fashion show as long as they've  been doing it and kind of begs the question of like why is that dude still  there? </p><p> EVERS:  Right -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BLOCK:  -- as my wife would say some man must have thought of that -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> EVERS:  Think about it.  It's not the zeitgeist the more -- it's all about  a male fantasy and an image that they're banking off as opposed to like me  too women's power like get with day -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BLOCK:  -- make money. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm glad I got you started on that really quickly, who do you  think will be the big winner this weekend retail wise?</p><p> EVERS:  I think Macy's is doing a great job.  Nordstrom is doing a great  job.  Macy's is doing pop-ups with Facebook.  You know, this idea of  integrating online and off-line, I also talked a lot about retail -- it's  just retail, right?  It does not have to online, off-line.  The customer is  shopping now on their mobile.  It has to be seamless.  There's no  distinction between the two. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Charcy, great to see you.  Come back. </p><p> EVERS:  I will.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we'll talk about everything, Charcy Evers.  Stay tuned we'll  be right back everybody. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Border battle, President Trump threatening to shut down the  U.S.-Mexico border if troops cannot get a handle on the migrants looking to  cross into this country.  Edward Lawrence is live from the White House with  the very latest.  Good morning, Edward. </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   And not only is the president willing to shut down the entire border, but  it's allowing the military to forcibly stop any illegal immigrant who gets  out of control.  This is an escalation of his position on the caravan.   Now, this president says that criminals have infiltrated this caravan and  they're already started to cause problems in Tijuana.  He made these  comments while the nation has celebrated Thanksgiving. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  It's not like normal innocent people.  These are people you talk  to.  I mean they start a fistfight.  I don't that in this country, OK? </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, what about the idea that the military  may use lethal force against these migrants? </p><p> TRUMP:  They have to.  They're going to use lethal force. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE:  And he wants Mexico to do more to secure their side of the  border.  The president is saying that if things get out of control as a  last resort, he will close the entire border.  No crossings at all.  The  State Department says that $1.7 billion worth of goods and services crosses  that Mexican border daily.  Now, all of this is tied to the funding of the  border wall.  The president tweeting about 20 minutes ago saying that  Republicans and Democrats need to come together with a package that will  include funding for the wall. </p><p> The president is saying he will partially shut down the government if he  does not get funding for that border wall.  Now, on this subject, Hillary  Clinton interviewed with the Guardian newspaper backtracking a little bit  what she campaigned on in 2016.  She said that Europe cannot offer -- open  borders because it's giving rise to these right-wing populist groups.   Hillary Clinton goes on to say that Europe must put a position out there. </p><p> Now, that they will not have -- they will not continue to refuge or support  unlimited refugees.  Back to you, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That it went too far in terms of the asylum-seekers and the  migrants coming in particularly from Syria.  It went too far in Germany.   You've seen that in -- with Angela Merkel in Germany and I pointed this out  earlier, Edward, it was -- I said two years ago.  It was actually three  years ago.  There were mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany related to  this very problem, so Hillary Clinton is essentially saying that this went  too far in Europe -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> LAWRENCE: Yes, exactly. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and it's -- she's saying that after a lot of other people  know that. </p><p> LAWRENCE:  Exactly.  And not just Germany but also Greece and Italy had a  massive problem with this influx.  Now, the numbers have cut down since  2015.  But, again, they're still having those issues and seeing more and  more people coming in. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Edward, thank you so much.  Happy Thanksgiving belatedly.</p><p> LAWRENCE:  You too. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Edward Lawrence.  Coming up, crude awakening, we're watching oil  prices and oversupply concerns.  And The Lion King is back, a sneak peek of  the live action reboot later this hour. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Futures are pointing to a lower ahead of the open where a little  more than an hour away from the opening bell.  A 115-point loss on the Dow  futures right now.  And let's not forget what happened on Wednesday.  It's  been a really terrible week for stocks.  But gains were wiped out in the  final hours of trading on Wednesday.  So even when you -- maybe we can see  a bounce back.  If we see a flip around in the futures maybe we get gains  as we head into the close at 1:00 p.m. Eastern today. </p><p> Joining us now is the Head of Global Research at Bulltick Capital Markets,  Kathryn Rooney Vera.  Kathryn, always great to see you.  What you are you  watching today in terms of the market action?  Are investors going to be  paying attention to any incline we get about retail sales? </p><p> KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD, GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS:  Yes.   I think retail sale definitely comes into play, Dagen.  There's been a lot  of talk about recession that seems kind of comical at this point when you  see Black Friday sales already pointing to a double-digit year-over-year  increase.  So I mean I think that retail sales are going to come out  strong.  I think we're in a strong economic swing and I don't see recession  on the near-term horizon at all. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What people -- when people talked about recession what they're  worried about is this broad downdraft in a whole host of asset classes.   It's not just technology stocks.  It was retail stocks earlier in the week  like sever double-digit losses on some of these retail names.  It's even  Bitcoin.  You have a yield curve that is flattening that, you know, people  are very worried about shorter term interest rates being higher than longer  term interest rates. </p><p> You -- even the downdraft in oil, so -- but you don't see a recession here,  so does that mean that we get a rebound in the market? </p><p> VERA:  Dagen, none of these trends are new, not one.  I would say that what  I'm expecting is a near term near impetus to change this negative trend.   It's momentum driven.  It's sentiment driven.  Guys talk about recession,  Dagen, when the -- when we get a correction in the markets.  It's a direct  correlation between drops in markets and talk of recession.  So one does  not necessarily mean imply the other.  What I will say is that I think that  the Xi and Trump meeting is the most near term potential of near tern  potential for that bounce in sentiment. </p><p> So if we get anything on this front, anything verbal a handshake, any  concession from the Chinese, I'll bet you got stocks fly.  </p><p> BLOCK:  What do you see other than, Kathryn, you know, in terms of emerging  markets?  We haven't heard a lot about Brazil and Mexico (INAUDIBLE) what  do you -- what's your outlook there? </p><p> VERA:  Look, I think, you know, if we get a risk on sentiment then emerging  markets definitely disproportionately benefit because it's a high beta  place.  So if you have risk on which means that investors rush in looking  for those higher yields higher than what you get in treasuries then the  emerging markets will certainly benefit.  But what we do need to see what  we have to see is some, you know, some melting of the icy tensions with  China and the U.S. </p><p> So I think that's going to be near term stimulus if we get the emerging  markets do even better. </p><p> ELMORE:  Headwinds, a strong dollar higher interest rates.  I assume you're  pricing in the fed to move into December and possibly more next year. </p><p> VERA:  Yes.  The fed I think has largely -- the hikes have been largely  discounted if you look at fed funds futures which is something that we in  the market look at in terms of where the fed is going to be putting rates  or the terminal rate by end of next year.  I would say it's largely priced  in, Erin.  And the market would be surprised if the fed were to hike  disproportionately more.  There's a real risk however that the feds applies  on the opposite side that they don't hike in December. </p><p> That could be another near term impetus for the market to change this  negative trajectory. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kathryn, great to see you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Thanks for  taking some of your Black Friday morning out and joining us.  Kathryn  Rooney Vera down in -- where it's a lot warmer than it is here in Florida. </p><p> VERA:  Thank you so much. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, questions for James Comey, the latest development as  the former FBI Director is vowing to fight a subpoena he received from  House Republicans.  Plus, a legendry face-off, the nine million dollar  showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson ahead. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA: BLACK  FRIDAY.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  Black  Friday is here!  All eyes on retailers, more than 164 million people are  expected to shop this weekend.  A record-setting number of online shoppers  set to grab some deals.  Futures are showing this in the markets.  Can we  get a turn around?  We had one in the making on Wednesday, and as we got  near the close, markets flipped around.  Dow down 119 points on the Futures  right now, it's been a bruising week for stocks.  Markets close early today  at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Fox Business has you covered until 2:00 in the  afternoon.  So, all day past the close at 1:00.  And we're looking at  losses of more than three percent on all three major market gauges so far  this week.  And we've had like double-digit losses on some of these retail  stocks.</p><p> In Europe, we have losses on the FTSE 100, and the CAC Quarante in France  to report although slight.  And in Asia overnight, it was losses across the  board, as well.  Except for the Nikkei which was closed for trading this  Friday.  The price of crude oil in the red again this morning.  Oil prices  at their lowest level since late 2017.  We have cost of crude trading at  $51.00 a barrel at the moment.</p><p> Car conference, the Trump administration reportedly wants to meet the heads  of German automakers next week to discuss trade policy.  Does that mean  getting rid of tariffs?  Europe's import tariffs on our cars.  How about  our import tariffs on light trucks coming in from other nations?  We will  dig into that.</p><p> And former -- and subpoenaed former FBI Director, Jim Comey, is meeting --  is meeting with House Judiciary Committee next month.  He's been  subpoenaed, Comey says, I'm going to -- you know, I don't want to do it  behind closed doors, I want do it in public.  Let's see what happens.  This  is, of course, before the Democrats take over the House in January.</p><p> It's Tiger versus Phil, golf greats Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson team off  today in a special pay-per-view match in Las Vegas.  A lot riding on the  game including a $9-million prize and a side bet from Mickelson himself.</p><p> And the circle of life goes live action, the trailer for the new \"Lion  King\" movie making its debut online, more of this incredible coming  attraction, coming up.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You can't get enough, can you?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I cannot get enough.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Cannot.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I watched it I don't know how many times yesterday.</p><p> Outrage for Amazon workers, employees striking in Germany and Spain during  Black Friday.  Kristina Partsinevelos is live from the New York Stock  Exchange with the details.  Hey, Kristina.</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Good  morning, Dagen.  As you can see, it's kind of quiet here today.  A lot of  people haven't come into the office, but what we're hearing from Amazon,  you're actually seeing some pre-market volume going on with that stock  right now, but like you mentioned, there is a strike going on in Germany,  about 650 employees walked off the job.  They're expected to also walk off  in Spain tomorrow, so they're going to have a walk-off and then strike on  Saturday.  The company claims that this won't affect Black Friday orders,  nonetheless, the employees chose to do -- this moment in time to negotiate  hire pay.</p><p> But since we're talking about Amazon such a giant, I wanted to switch over  the Best Buy and start talking about that company because Wedbush analyst  put out a note raising their target on Best Buy.  Right now, it's at  $62.00, they believe it can climb higher at $65.00 because they believe  Best Buy has done a great job when it comes to electronics and competing  the prices against Target.  And if we're going to -- against Amazon, sorry.   If we're going to end on Wal-Mart and target, I just heard both companies  right now, if you go into their stores for Black Friday, you have a  wireless thing, you don't have to wait in line, they'll come and find you  to buy your products.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're finally doing what Apple has been doing for how many  years?</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Exactly.  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, I saw that story and I thought --</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they should have been doing that at Whole Foods yesterday  because that was a horror show here in New York City on Thanksgiving Day.   At least they were open, but nevertheless, it was kind of in disarray.  I  leave it at that.  Kristina Partsinevelos, thank you.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's good to see you.  Joining us now, former McDonald's USA  CEO, former Famous Dave's BBQ CEO, Fat Brands International Chairman, Ed  Rensi.  Ed, what's your outlook for the holiday shopping season?</p><p> ED RENSI, CHAIRMAN, FAT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL:  I think it's fantastic.   Trump has driven this economy largely with these tax reductions, so people  have got a lot more money to spend, there's a joyous attitude, too, because  a lot of people are back to work, the wages are good, I think, it's a good  holiday season, I think it's a good economic story for the average Joe  walking the street.  I think it's great.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, maybe the people in politics on the left need to stop  talking down the economy, and trying to convince everybody that things are  lousy simply because they hate President Trump.</p><p> RENSI:  Well, President Trump is clearly cheerleader in chief.  You ask him  how he's doing, he's doing AAA.  You ask him how the country is doing, it's  AAA, he can't find anything wrong anywhere except for the Democrats bad  behavior on the border.  So, I think we ought to be optimistic.  I think as  all citizens, my whole family belonged to the Democratic Party, they were  in unions, those are the people that built this great country of ours.   It's time to get off their back and celebrate the hard work of men and  women all across the country.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ed, just to be clear, the quote from President Trump -- I --  because I wrote it down from the Chris Wallace interview earlier in the  week.  Look, when he asked how he would grade things, look, I late to do  it, but I will do it, I would give myself an A+.  Is that enough?  Can I go  higher than that?  So, that's the quote which I will be using as the  weekend wears on.  Susan Li has a question for you, Ed.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, just about wages, Ed, because we know that this holiday shopping  season, a lot of retailers have had to raise their wages.  It's a tight  labor market, you're going to compete for workers, but what does that mean  for profit margins in the bottom line?</p><p> RENSI:  Well, the fact of the matter is when you have a labor shortage  which we're suffering in the hospitality industry, people are doing amazing  things to recruit for restaurants, and hotels, and what have you.  I think  it's good, frankly, it's going to lift wages a bit, it's going to put some  impact on the bottom line of a lot of companies.  But they'll adjust by  raising prices, getting more efficient, sharpening their pencils.  So, I  think all in all, it's good when people have more money in their pocket and  wages are going up.</p><p> BLOCK:  Hey, Ed.  You know, how much -- you mentioned, you know, getting  more efficient, how much of this is not so much labor-oriented, but  technology, i.e., use of points of sale technology in some of the fast food  restaurants, where you have a lot of expertise, you know, is that really  the wave of the future, is that something that's going to be a bigger and  bigger part of what these companies invest in?</p><p> RENSI:  Yes, I think you're going to see more labor devoted to hospitality  and less to process of the purchase.  I had an experience yesterday, I  drove from Jupiter, Florida over to Sarasota for the holiday, and we went  on -- my wife went on the app on her phone, ordered a meal at a fast-food  restaurant.  We pulled in, told them we were there, we didn't even know  what restaurant we were going to, they had the order.  It was amazing to  me.  You know, being 74 years old, it's astound to go get that level of  customer service out of a little piece of electronic stuff.  It's amazing,  I love it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ed, which fast-food restaurant was it?</p><p> RENSI:  Well, I went to Hurricanes Bar &amp; Grill in Jupiter, and I stopped at  McDonald's halfway over, and then went in to FAT Brands, have a big  possible burger.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You were -- you are fast-food patron, my friend.  Erin Elmore  has a question.</p><p> ELMORE:  Hi, good morning.  How are you?  So, we see this Black Friday now  the uptick in sales in retail, what about in your sector, in the  hospitality and food business?</p><p> RENSI:  Well, any time people are on the street, they're going to be buying  lunch, dinner, breakfast out.  The companies that provide great customer  service and get people in and out and make it affordable are going to  succeed.  You know, historically, dry goods, people said, this was the day  that you begin going from red ink to black ink, and I agree with that.   This is a time when restaurants and all people in hospitality see a real  uptick in their -- in their traffic, so I think it bodes well.  Let's just  hope the weather doesn't get in the way through December.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ed, what do you make of some of the Democrats talking about  rolling back at least some of the tax cuts, as they move into the New Year  and take over the house?  I mean, it won't get -- it won't get done,  obviously, the Republicans still control the Senate.  President Trump would  gladly veto that, but they still talk about it.</p><p> RENSI:  Well, I don't understand for the life of me how anybody can talk  about socialism, increase in taxes.  Look at Venezuela, one of the  wealthiest, beautifulest countries in South America totally destroyed today  because of leftist activity.  I think the Democrats are out of their minds.   There are some sensible people there but the leadership just doesn't have  any policies, practices, or future vision, of what this country can do, and  all they can think about is destroying Republicans.  That's not going to  work.  The American people are not going to put up with it for the long  haul.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Ed, this is something that I've talked about earlier in  the week, that it is a left-wing fallacy that, oh, we can just tax the top  one percent more and pay for all these spending programs, all of these  goodies that the people on the left talk about.  If you confiscated every  single dollar of adjusted-growth income earned and reported by the top one  percent, it would only be about $2 trillion.  What does Medicare for All  cost in a year based on the estimates?  More than 3.2 trillion, so it would  -- you could take every dollar that somebody had in income in the top one  percent and it still wouldn't pay for Medicare for All, it won't even come  close.</p><p> RENSI:  Dagen, you're too intelligent, you're too smart, you're too  realistic.  These people that are talking about the kinds of things that --  of cutting these tax cuts to crumbs, they don't understand that the average  guy on the street is what makes this country run.  The middle class pays  the vast majority of the taxes.  You hurt them, you're hurting revenue.   John Kennedy knew that, that's why he cut taxes.  How all of a sudden are  today's Democrats that stupid that they think he was that wrong?  I just  don't get it, it's illogical, it's all about entrenched power.  They say  things that denigrate the rich so the poor will vote for them.  The  unclean, the deplorables, it's just disgusting in their behavior.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And well -- and ultimately, if you want this kind of (INAUDIBLE)  board of socialist policies, everybody gets taxed to their noses, tax to  their teeth.  It's gas taxes, it's value-added taxes, you have people  rioting in France because of these higher diesel taxes.  I want to move  onto this really quickly, fast-food restaurants are hosting hiring parties  because they're having such trouble, like, bringing people in because  unemployment is the lowest in almost 50 years.  What do you think of these  companies beefing up their efforts, Ed?</p><p> RENSI:  Well, I think it's intelligent.  You got to create teams.  It's  interesting to me that Bezos, one of the richest guys in the world from  Amazon, talking about Amazon could fail in the future, if you don't respect  and work for the consumer.  Well, the number one customers employers have  are their employees.  Let's celebrate them, let's have parties for them.   Let's let people know they are good places to work.  I think it's exciting,  we're going to have to get smarter about how we recruit, why not?  It makes  the whole country better.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ed, great to see you.  I expect a full report on where you ate  over the weekend.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RENSI:  All right.  I'm in.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  Ed Rensi, take care.  Coming up, a face-off on the green,  the $9-million showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.  And Simba  is back, a sneak peek of the \"Lion King\" reboot.  The trailer ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The White House set to meet with German car executives.  Cheryl  Casone has the details on this story (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good, I think is the right  reaction.  This is going to be interesting.  We're just learning about  this.  This is from Reuters, they're reporting that the Trump  administration has invited the heads of Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler to the  White House to discuss trade policy.  The meeting likely taking place next  week will also feature Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow and Secretary of  Commerce Wilbur Ross.</p><p> Well, a subpoena sent to former FBI Director James Comey, making headlines.   In the subpoena, Comey says Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee  want him to testify at a closed-door meeting next month to talk about  allegations of anti-Trump bias that led to the opening of the Russia  investigation plus the handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal.   Well, Comey, he fired back on Twitter saying he's happy to testify but only  if everyone can see so there's no fear of leaking or distortion.  They're  just tweet.</p><p> All right.  The head-to-head matchup between two of the biggest names in  golf is set for later today.  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson hitting the  links in Las Vegas in a much hyped $9-million winner-take-all match.   Organizers hoping to recoup the money from fans willing to pay 19.99 for  pay-per-view.  Woods and Mickelson also, as we reported a couple of times,  they're putting up their own money in side bets that eventually are going  to all go to charity.  The tee time is set for 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p> And then, finally this, the King is back on the big screen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everything the light touches is our kingdom.  But a  king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  You tell them James Earl Jones.  All right.  Disney releasing the  first trailer for the new live-action remake of the classic 1994 film \"Lion  King.\"  It features many pretty big voices, James Earl Jones, of course, as  Mufasa, Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonce is going to be Nala.  It's going to  hit theaters July 19, 2019, so next year.  I've never actually seen the  original, Dagen.  I'm embarrassed to say that, but I've never seen it.</p><p> ELMORE:  Not even the broadway play?</p><p> CASONE:  Now even that which has been on broadway for how many years.  So,  anyway, it looks amazing, though.</p><p> ELMORE:  Truly amazing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can't wait for it.  (INAUDIBLE) Jon Favreau.  I root for him.</p><p> LI:  I don't blame you.  \"Ironman\" as an actor as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll leave you with this, \"Four Christmases.\"  He has a small  role in \"Four Christmases.\"</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, watch it.  I will tweet the -- I will tweet the clip.   Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  OK.  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Black Friday in full swing, your Hollywood shopping  outlook, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are you a Black Friday or a Cyber Monday shopper?  We asked our  Fox Business team including our very own Maria Bartiromo.  Take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, I am a sucker for a  sale, so I've already started.  I was driving past a store the other day,  they said everything is 30 percent off, I got right out and I started  buying stuff, even though I didn't need any of it.  Unfortunately, that's  how I do it.  I will be on line and I will go to a few stores on Friday,  but not too many because I don't like the crowds, but I'll get everything I  need, especially if there are sales.</p><p> TRISH REGAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  To me, Black Friday is all about  staying in, watching some T.V. with the kids, hanging out with my husband.   I really don't like -- I don't like to go shopping, period.  A little  secret.  But I do kind of like the online thing, and that's what I'll be  doing.  In fact, I've already been scouting out a few sales.  I mean,  online, to me, it's a -- it's indeed been revolutionary, and it's great for  someone who does not like to shop.  For me, online all the way, for sure.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  A lot of people like to  work off their turkey dinners with some shopping.  Do you do Black Friday  shopping?</p><p> TODD PIRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  No.  You know what I do on Black Friday,  I hang out with you --</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Target.</p><p> PIRO:  -- at a random Target in the middle of Northern New Jersey and do  live shots for the Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I am not a big shopper in  stores.  I never have been.  So, I love the internet for that.  I'm all  about Cyber Monday.  I'm even happy to shop on Friday, but from my phone or  computer.</p><p> ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I did my shopping last  summer, I get things done.  Yes, that's what I'm talking about.  No, I'm  just kidding.  I don't do any shopping.  I have learned a lesson from  Stuart Varney.  I only regift.  In fact, Stuart Varney and I have been  swapping the same electric pepper mill and spatula for the last five years.   That's what I do.  Kidding!  No, I do my shopping in the summer.  I start  early.  I've got a big family.  Can't help it.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CASONE:  It's true, she does have a big family, she does have to start in  the summer.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Somebody in Steve Forbes' family regifts every year.</p><p> CASONE:  Really?</p><p> ELMORE:  Really?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I know that.  We talked about it on earlier in the week.</p><p> LI:  So, it's Steve, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's not Steve.</p><p> CASONE:  I bet -- look, I mean, I think we should be called Cyber Friday,  maybe Cyber Thursday night.  I started yesterday online, yes.</p><p> LI:  No difference anymore.  The discounts start at midnight on -- like on  Thursday.</p><p> CASONE:  It's great.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I bet online shopping -- I bought something online and it  was -- it looks God awful.  Maybe it's just me.  It looks -- it looks God  awful on me.</p><p> CASONE:  You can buy some cute stuff online.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is not cute.  It looked like I made it.</p><p> LI:  Well, what made you buy in the first place?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, it looked good in the photo.</p><p> ELMORE:  And then, you tried it on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> ELMORE:  And still looked darn good.</p><p> BLOCK:  Oh, I just want to point out, you know, I know -- I know it's  Giving Tuesday, coming up, after Cyber Monday, but it's also Give Back  Friday, so if you want to get out and do something for the community,  there's probably something going on in your town, that's what the Block  family will be doing (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, that comes from your wife who does that every single day.</p><p> BLOCK:  It's my wife who is -- that's what she's all about.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She runs a --</p><p> BLOCK:  She runs a program called Grace, which provides groceries and food  and also other necessities for our neighbors, and I'm very proud of the  great work she does.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike Block.

It's Friday, November 23rd.</p><p> Your top stories this Black Friday right at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> More than 164 million people are expected to shop this weekend.  We're  watching the retailers this morning like Amazon, TJX, we have losses on  both of these stocks as we move toward the trading day.</p><p> We're two-and-a-half hours away from the opening bell.  Markets close at  1:00 p.m. Eastern today.  And futures are pointing to a lower open, a 149- point loss on the Dow futures right now.  This wrapping up a week that has  seen all three major market gauges fall more than 3 percent.  The Nasdaq  composite down nearly 4 percent in just three trading sessions.</p><p> In Europe, we have some gains to report in England, France and Germany,  although slight.</p><p> And in Asia, markets closing lower overnight.  Nikkei was not open for  trading this Friday.</p><p> The price of crude is down this morning, oil prices continue their slide to  the lowest levels since late 2017 on an abundance of supply.  We break down  what's going on with the cost of crude.</p><p> Investigating the crash, Lion Air says it will ask Boeing for more  information about their new 737 jet in light of the recent plane crash in  Indonesia.  We will hear from Maria Bartiromo's exclusive interview with  the CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.</p><p> On guard, amazing video of a shopkeeper defending his business from gun- wielding thugs using a sword.  Yes, baby.</p><p> Parade outrage, the Internet up in arms as a technical glitch reveals that  star Rita Ora was lip syncing at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.   Macy's and John Legend coming to the singer's defense.  We have the very  latest.  Did you think the people on the floats were singing live?</p><p> Here with me this morning to break it all down: Fox Business Network's  Susan Li; chief market strategist at ThirdSeven Advisors Michael Block; and  Republican strategist, former Trump surrogate, former Republican convention  deputy press secretary, Erin Elmore.  </p><p> Come on.</p><p> ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIS:  I believe Santa Claus is real.  So you  know -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Santa Claus is real.</p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRDSEVEN ADVISORS:  That's true.</p><p> ELMORE:  It was so cold out there.  Did you really expect her to sing?   Right.  It was a big 19 degrees.</p><p> BLOCK:  That's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was the fact that the track was so off though, that it was --  it was like she was singing a different song than the one that was playing.  </p><p> BLOCK:  She shouldn't have sung like when Ashlee Simpson started dancing  the ho down, you know.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what -- that happened so long ago.  We actually show  our age when we reference Ashlee Simpson -- </p><p> BLOCK:  I always show my age.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- on \"Saturday Night Live\".  At least I didn't reference like  H.R. Puff and Stuff last hour which -- that song was playing it sounded  like the theme music to H.R. Puff and Stuff.</p><p> BLOCK:  Millennials running amuck.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  If only I was some millennial.</p><p> It is the busiest shopping day of the year everybody.  Black Friday  shoppers are flooding retailers of all shapes and sizes to snag the best  deal.</p><p> Hillary Vaughn is at Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, Long Island, New  York with the very latest.  Hey, Hillary.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Dagen -- well,  this mall is just opening its doors really for the second time for Black  Friday.  They were open on Thanksgiving Day into the night, until 2:00 a.m.   And now they're opening up for a second round of Black Friday shopping for  those Black Friday shoppers that didn't want to wait overnight and are just  getting up for the daytime deals.</p><p> We've seen a lot of people shopping around carrying bags.  And it's really  people are getting busy.  They're cashing in on deals.  They're having a  great time.</p><p> One thing that the Roosevelt Field Mall is doing that's interesting is  they're opening up temporary space to e-retailers.  And they said they've  had e-retailers actually experience a lot of foot traffic in the stores and  then decided to lease space here.</p><p> So for the argument about brick and mortar, that no one is going into the  stores anymore, we've seen a lot of millennial shoppers.  I talked to them.   I said why do you come here today instead of just hopping on your phone to  shop.  They say they want to he see the products.  They're worried about  the Web site crash and skipping out on those good deals.  And they're also  here because of the tech.  Take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've seen a lot of good deals.  They've got some Beat  headphones, new keyboards, speakers.  And that stuff doesn't go on sale,  you know.  So it's like today is the day where you've got to get it, you  know.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  So a lot shoppers not wanting to miss out on those deals today.   And they're trying to cash in on them -- Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Hillary.  We'll check in with you next  hour.  Hillary Vaughn at the Roosevelt Field Mall out in Garden City, Long  Island.</p><p> Millions across the country are hitting the stores.  The National Retail  Federation estimates that 160 million potential shoppers today, another 75  million expected online on Monday.</p><p> Joining me now, shopping and retail expert at blackfriday.com, Sarah  Hollenbeck.  Sarah -- what to watch today and this weekend?  </p><p> SARAH HOLLENBECK, SHPPING AND RETAIL EXPERT, BLACKFRIDAY.COM:  Yes.  You  should definitely be keeping an eye on top retailers like Amazon, Walmart  and Target.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is offering really great discounts on their own in- house lines.  So both their smart home products and their fashion lines.   They're also offering 40 percent off some of the hottest toys of the year.</p><p> If you're looking for TVs, Target and Walmart are definitely going to be  your top picks.  They're offering great discounts on both the new HDR and  4K devices.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a story -- an interesting story in the \"Wall Street  Journal\", Sarah this morning that the downfall of Sears and Toys R Us  actually could help other big name retailers as people -- they have to find  some place to shop for toys.  They have to find some place to shop for baby  gear.  They have to find some place -- again Best Buy is actually adding  appliances with Sears in such trouble.  </p><p> HOLLENBECK:  Yes.  With the demise of some of these other retailers, the  other retailers are definitely picking up the slack and kind of taking up  that customer base.  We saw that early on this November.</p><p> Some retailers released toy books and different items that maybe Toys R Us  and other retailers were providing throughout the holiday season in the  past couple of years.  So they're definitely filling in that gap and taking  in that customer base.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  So 78 percent of Americans  are expected to buy something either today or Cyber Monday.  60 percent of  those sales will be done online and close to 80 percent will spend either  the same or maybe a little bit more this year.  What does that say to you  about the health of the American consumer?  </p><p> HOLLENBECK:  I think the American consumers have a great opportunity both  on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to take advantage of these great sales.   There's definitely a huge uptick in shoppers this year because the economy  is doing so well and retailers are really responding to that by offering  some of the best deals we've seen in recent years.  </p><p> BLOCK:  Sarah -- what categories might we see on this holiday season that  might surprise to the upside?  Like what categories, you know, could there  be more interest in than usual?  </p><p> HOLLENBECK:  I think gaming is definitely a pretty big category this year.   We've seen a lot of really great bundles at places like Game Stop, Walmart  and Target.  For instance, the Nintendo Switch bundle with the Mario Car  has sold out at various stores across the nation.  It's definitely one of  the top deals of the year.  </p><p> ELMORE:  Hi, Sarah -- it's Erin Elmore.  Good morning.  </p><p> Our reporter here at Fox Business, Hillary Vaughn, said she has seen a lot  of millennials hitting the stores, which is a little bit surprising.  We  think they're always into technology doing that online shopping.  Why do  you think that is, millennials are out there hitting the stores?  </p><p> HOLLENBECK:  Well, I think there's something to be said about seeing the  product that you want in person and that excitement of being in store.  And  consumers can shop online throughout the year.  But that in-store shopping  experience with everyone getting really excited about the holiday season  only happens once a year.</p><p> So I think that's why you're seeing a lot more people come out in store  during the holiday season.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Can you read into some of the deals that these companies are  offering, some of the promotions as a sign of desperation that they're  worried and what does that say about their -- Mike Block can answer this --  but their profit margins?  But again, how do the promotions this year  compare to years past?  </p><p> HOLLENBECK:  We're seeing a lot bigger promotions this year to kind of draw  in those consumers that maybe weren't shopping in years past.  And because  a lot of consumers are wanting to shop online, you're seeing a lot of THOSE  Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals being replicated online as well as in- store.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike.</p><p> BLOCK:  Again any particular categories where you're seeing more  promotional activity than others?  </p><p> HOLLENBECK:  I think tech is definitely one of the biggest categories of  the season.  You're seeing a lot of really great deals on smart home  products, TVs, laptops, tablets, things like that.  Consumers definitely  need to do their research before they pick up these items during the  holiday season so they don't fall for doorbuster prices that aren't  necessarily worth it.</p><p> They need to check reputable tech sites like PC Mag to do their research  and see what brands are really worth the money this season.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Could the sales like in a lot of the apparel retailers, a lot of  the clothing companies broke in-store and online.  The major department  stores, online retailers beginning this week, Sarah.  And I've noticed that  there's not a lot of merchandise that's on sale and the discounts aren't  that deep.</p><p> So it looks like at least that these retailers might have managed their  inventory better.  I don't know if that's just anecdotal or not.  </p><p> HOLLENBECK:  Well, the clothing deals usually don't start until Cyber  Monday.  We see site-wide discounts at various retailers like Target, Old  Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, places like that.  They're going to offer  anywhere from 15 to 50 percent off.  So if you are wanting to shop for  clothing, you're definitely better off waiting until Cyber Monday.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike Block -- what about -- before we go, what about margin  pressure?  Because it was the Target earnings and it was Kohl's earlier in  the week where Target warned about higher input costs and warned about  higher wage pressures.  And seemed to be one of the reasons that that  stock, I just want to point out, Target is down 13 percent this week, 17  percent in the month -- </p><p> LI:  10 percent in one day.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  For the month of November, 17 percent.</p><p> BLOCK:  Here's what I'll say about Target and Kohl's.  Both stocks had nice  runs because earlier this year we were warned about the wage pressures and  the shipping pressures and things like that.</p><p> However, both of these companies and the macro data always showed and the  beige book showed that these companies were going to be able to raise  prices and that was the evidence we got.  Sure enough they were able to do  that, preserve the margins.</p><p> What happened this week was both of these companies came out and they both  warned of these again and the market took it as panic and they sold the  stocks.  What remains to be seen is whether they can keep getting priced.   We're obviously in the holiday season now.  Sarah's been talking about more  promotions. </p><p> There's two things we're not considering here.  Number one, in Kohl's  earnings report they are investing money into the stores.  They are  investing in higher wages.  And that's how they look at it.  Is that going  to help them in the long run?  The Bulls would say yes.</p><p> The second thing is we have companies like Sears going into bankruptcy.  We  have others like Bon-Ton going in.  Historically we've seen stages years  ago -- the demise of Mervyn's really helping Kohl's.  </p><p> LI:  How about JC Penney going out?  </p><p> BLOCK:  And JC Penny -- that's a third one -- thank you.  Those are the big  ones that have fallen.  That's going to help companies like this.  So  investors need to keep that in mind.</p><p> Will the demise of these other stores, you mentioned the story about Toys R  Us and Sears, will that help these other companies.  The bulls are going to  tell you yes, it will.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Best Buy has said that and Macy's has said that in their  recent earnings reports.  The closing of competitors is one reason for the  lift in their recent quarterly sales.  So there you go.  </p><p> BLOCK:  And we can say they're talking about it.  But then again these  selloffs are maybe giving us an opportunity to own these stocks longer  term.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  Sarah Hollenbeck -- thank you so much.  Thank you  for being here this Black Friday.  Stay tuned to our Black Friday market  coverage.  Fox Business -- we're open until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time.</p><p> Coming up, even more questions for Boeing.  The company being pressed for  the safety of the new 737 model following October's Lion Air crash.</p><p> Plus, call the cavalry, watch these jewelry store clerks fend off armed  robbers with swords.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lion Air pressing Boeing for more details about the 737 Max  after last month's fatal crash. </p><p> Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Dagen.  Good  morning again.</p><p> The Indonesia airliner says its pilots struggled with the 737's flight  controls before their plane crashed into the sea.  Lion Air's safety  director plans to visit the Boeing facility in Seattle as the company looks  for more details about the jet itself.</p><p> In an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo, Boeing's CEO Dennis  Muilenburg saying his company is fully cooperating with the investigation.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  So what happened?  Apparently  there were 10 computers -- the computers, about the angle of the nose were  not accurate and then the plane went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you  have a sense of what went wrong?  </p><p> DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING:  Yes, the Indonesian authorities have  pointed out initially there were indications of an inaccurate angle attack  signal that was being sent to the airplane.  And of course, the airplane  has the ability to handle that.  We have procedures in place.  </p><p> And we've already issued a couple of additional bulletins to our operators  and pilots around the world that point them back to existing flight  procedures to handle that kind of position.  So again, we're going to  continue to support the investigation as it proceeds.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  All right.  Well, the crash killed all 189 people on-board.</p><p> Taking a look at shares of Boeing, lower in the premarket, down nearly 1  percent.</p><p> Well, the Camp Fire in northern California is now about 95 percent  contained, thanks to the rain.  But the weather is also hurting search  efforts in that region.  More rain today could bring the risk of dangerous  flooding and more importantly in California a big problem is mud slides.</p><p> The death toll has risen to 84.  More than 560 people we should say are  still unaccounted for but that number has dropped substantially over the  last 48 hours.</p><p> Ok, grand theft airplane, two teen boys are now under arrest in Utah.  They  allegedly went on a mile high joy ride.  Police say the duo left a group  home, stole a tractor, drove it to a private air field, swiped a small  plane and then they flew it over a highway before landing actually safely.   But they still face a number of charges.  Ok.</p><p> And then there is this, a gang of thieves may think twice before trying to  rob another jewelry store.  Police in a town near Toronto say the thieves  smashed their way into the store on Wednesday but the tables quickly turned  when employees pulled out swords, not guns, swords -- and rushed them.</p><p> This surveillance footage is from a similar break-in just four months  earlier in a nearby town.  Kind of tells you the story.  One of the crooks  tried to fire the gun but that jammed.  The four men then fled.  They're  still being hunted by police, maybe with guns this time and not swords.</p><p> And those are your headlines -- Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I bet you Michael is packing a sword right now.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> LI:  Oh, Dagen.</p><p> BLOCK:  I'm going to be under the desk.  Excuse me.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was nothing meant but -- I was being very literal.  </p><p> BLOCK:  Well, I am from Shell Winds (ph).  It's like a very Wu Tang thing,  you know.  </p><p> ELMORE:  Wu Tang.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was being literal.</p><p> Coming up, the price of oil seeing its lowest levels in over a year.  The  President says what about supplies?  Does he deserve credit for driving  down the price of oil?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have losses across the board on the futures this morning as  we are almost two hours away from the opening bell.  Markets trading until  1:00 p.m. Eastern time this afternoon.  Dow futures are down 117 points.</p><p> The price of crude oil slipping this morning.  Oil now at its lowest level  since late 2017 on an abundance of supply.  President Trump talking about  how important America's relationship with Saudi Arabia is regarding the  price of oil.  This on Tuesday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Right now we have oil prices  in great shape.  I'm not going to destroy the world economy and I'm not  going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi  Arabia.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  joining me now chief oil analyst, one of my favorite people on  the planet, OPIS Tom Kloza.  Tom, your thoughts.  Because you predicted  this wild volatility this time of year.  Where do we go from here?  </p><p> TOM KLOZA, CHIEF OIL ANALYST, OIL PRICE INFORMATION SERVICE:  Well, I think  we go immediately lower.  And I think we might even be dangerously lower.   You mentioned the price of crude.  I think it's about $52 for WTI today.   But if you're in Canada, it's about $12 a barrel.  If you're in the Permian  Basin, which is where all the new crude is coming in the United States,  it's about $45.  So you've got to be careful.</p><p> I mean if you really put the hammer to producers and squeeze a lot more oil  out of the planet, you can push it down below the price where let's say it  has a net positive effect with the country.  I think the December 6th OPEC  meeting is going to result in a cut and prices are going to be fortified by  then.   But I could be wrong.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Does President Trump deserve some of the credit for pushing oil  prices down and pushing gasoline prices down as we head into the holiday  season by essentially getting Saudi Arabia and even Russia to make sure  supplies were plentiful?  </p><p> KLOZA:  Well, you know, you could make it credit.  You could say it's  blame.  I certainly do believe that he's tried to sort of maneuver a  joystick to manipulate oil prices lower before the election and immediately  thereafter.</p><p> And perhaps at some point he's going to get a lot of pressure to fortify  the numbers or else this whole notion of U.S. energy dominance could fall  apart like it did in 2016.</p><p> So I think it's over-stated.  I think mostly what's happened is every  country that usually has problems like Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela and Iraq,  they're all operating about as well as they could hope for.  So I think  that world demand is probably going to pick up and -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LI:  Tom -- quickly -- you mentioned a lot of countries.</p><p> KLOZA:  Yes.</p><p> LI:  What about Saudi Arabia since President Trump has tweeted about Saudi  Arabia and how they kept the spigots on and that's helping depress oil  prices?  </p><p> KLOZA:  I think the Saudis are going to cut.  I think they're going to have  to cut because they are the swing producer and, you know, we'll probably  need a cut of a million, 1.2 million.  </p><p> LI:  What about the Khashoggi case then?  How does that impact oil pricing?  </p><p> KLOZA:  You know, I think it's high drama.  It's kind of a sideline opera  there.  But I don't think it's going to have much impact on whether or not  the Saudis cut.</p><p> I think they need to cut.  They have a budget number of $90, not that  anybody holds to budgets.  But I think they're going to cut production.  I  think probably the notion that the U.S. and the Saudis are just bosom  buddies right now is probably a bit off.  </p><p> BLOCK:  Hey Tom -- one thing, you know, the Iranian sanctions were on the  way up, people were worried about that.  That was going to cut supply.  Now  we're seeing Iranian oil leak through, so-to-speak.  Could part of  fortifying the prices you put be tightening some of these sanctions.  Do  you think that's something we're going to hear about along with the OPEC  cuts?  </p><p> KLOZA:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean we were looking for sanctions on these  countries to where it would be very difficult for them to pull oil.  What  happened instead where you got these waivers to where the sanctions on the  eight countries amounted to a very stern talking to.</p><p> So I suspect that they'll put the squeeze on and they'll make it more  difficult for Iran to export oil and we're starting to see that too.  We  are starting to see them export a little bit less.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tom -- great to see you as always, my friend.  Tom Kloza.</p><p> KLOZA:  Thanks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  before you go, gasoline Christmas day, the retail average, U.S.,  what do you think?  </p><p> KLOZA:  I think about $2.50.  I think we go below that nationally and then  we get to that.  And I think there will be about a dozen states including  some of those fine southern states that you come from that will have less  than $2 if you're prone to looking for it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you feel bad that my Redskins lost yesterday?  </p><p> KLOZA:  I feel bad that the Dallas Cowboys won.  That makes every Friday a  Black Friday in my opinion.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  My hat is off to you, dear sir.  That's why I asked you that  question.  By the way, Tom's a Giants fan so my feelings are with you.</p><p> Tom Kloza -- good to see you.  We'll see you soon.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> KLOZA:  Good to see you, too.  Thanks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, trade hype -- President Trump announcing he and  China's President Xi Jinping will meet at next week's G-20 summit.  We have  more details, next.</p><p> Plus, songbird slip-up.  The Internet goes nuts after Rita Ora's lip  syncing debacle at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back, I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Friday November 23rd.  Your top  stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p> Black Friday is here.  More than 164 million people are expected to go  shopping this weekend, according to the National Retail Federation.   Outrage for Amazon workers, the latest as employees strike in Germany and  Spain today.  </p><p> Plus, small business Saturday kicks off tomorrow.  We check on a veteran- owned and operated apparel company, based in Georgia.  That's ahead.  </p><p> Checking market action this morning, it's been a rough shortened week for  stocks so far.  We have a triple digit loss on the Dow Futures.  The  markets close at 01:00 p.m. Eastern time today, 102 point loss on the blue  chips.  This comes as the NASDAQ is on pace for its worst week in eight  months.  All three major market gauges down more than three percent.  The  NASDAQ close to a four percent loss so far this week.  </p><p> In Europe we have a slight loss on the FTSE 100 in England but gains in  France and Germany.  </p><p> And in Asia overnight, the markets moving lower across the board except for  the Nikkei which was closed for trading this Friday.  </p><p> Crude awakening, we're watching oil prices and oversupply concerns.  We  have crude oil close to dipping below $52.00 a barrel.  </p><p> And honoring America's heroes, President Trump expresses his profound  gratitude to all five branches of the military on Thanksgiving, the details  ahead.  </p><p> And a lip sync fail, how Macy's is responding to Rita Ora's singing gaffe  at the Thanksgiving Day parade.  </p><p> And serious spending, details on the $150,000 Thanksgiving dinner that  included a gold turkey.  Let's start with shopping mania.  The National  Retail Federation estimating about 164 million people plan on shopping over  the holiday weekend.  Today, being the busiest day with 116 million people  planning to go out and spend some money.  Here now National Taxpayers Union  Senior Fellow, Mattie Duppler.  Mattie, good to see you. </p><p> MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Good morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Talking about those tax cuts, is that one of the reasons the  spending will be so good this weekend and even over the holidays?  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Right.  Well, listen, consumer spending makes up 70 percent of  the economy.  So, it's always a huge chunk of economic growth.  But when  you look at what's happened over the past year for consumers, certainly  Americans have more money in their pockets to spend now.  </p><p> One of the most pervasive characteristics of the recession was the fact  that wages did not rise.  And as a result, there was no discretionary  spending.  I shouldn't say no discretionary spending, but of course  Americans had less money in their pockets and all of the money that they  had, had to go to those fixed costs like mortgage payments, loans, those  sorts of things.  So, lot less to be spending in the consumer economy.  </p><p> Now that the economy has rebounded and Americans on average, the typical  American family had more than a $2,000 tax cut because the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act.  That's a little bit of spending money when you're looking in to  the holiday season.  </p><p> You know what's interesting this year as well, now that we kind of have  moved away from just Black Friday being the biggest retail day of the  nation -- of the year, we now see Black Friday deals starting as early as  November on Veterans Day.  So we've seen a lot more spending moving into  this holiday season and I expect that to continue.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mattie, just I want to point out, $2,000, not crumbs.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  Not crumbs.  Not Armageddon as Nancy Pelosi the  presumed new speaker of the House had said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would  auger for the economy and for Americans.  So certainly a rosier outlook  than Democrats were expecting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think that the Democrats are really going to try and roll  back at least some of the tax cuts for the wealthy, for example, do you  think that that is really a serious agenda item starting in January?  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Well, I think -- I think that this is really the most interesting  revelation from Democrats that we've seen.  Of course, the debate has  already started.  Nancy Pelosi campaigned for a month saying that adamantly  they were going to repeal the tax cuts as soon as they got power.  And  she's reach -- she's finding a little bit of a resistance from her own  conference after campaigning on that promise.  And then, instituting a rule  change in which they would only repeal the tax cuts for high income earners  as of course, as we know, are not really high income earners at all,  they're middle class Americans.  </p><p> She has met resistance in her caucus with progressive now saying we want  all those tax cuts to be repealed, not just for the high income earners.   So it just goes to show that when Democrats say they want to tax the rich,  what that means is they want to tax the rich first, they want to tax  everyone else following that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this report that workers at Amazon  logistics centers in Germany and Spain have staged strikes today, walking  off on Black Friday.  Is this a sign of trouble for Amazon?  Because again,  with Amazon picking the two new headquarters locations, the HQ2 here and  Queens and down in Washington, there was a lot -- there was -- there was  pushback on these tax breaks from the right and the left.  When you have  the National Review agreeing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, then the  world's been turned upside down.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Exactly.  You know, my opinion on the Amazon situation is that  communities should be creating a business environment in which all business  can thrive.  Narrow tax cuts and narrow benefits for one company is  extremely short-sighted in my view for policy makers.  They should be  looking at what the next Amazon is, because Amazon certainly deserves  credit.  It has changed the way we shop in pretty much every sector.  </p><p> However, that means that other companies are trying to keep up.  And we see  that now with Black Friday now extending through the entire month of  November and December.  The future of retail is really online.  So online  commerce is here to stay and that doesn't begin or end with Amazon.  It  means there are many companies waiting in the wings in order to take over  that market share.  </p><p> So, if communities and policy makers are really looking to increase jobs  and economic growth in their neighborhoods, they should be looking to  create a business environment and ecosystem that supports the next Amazon  and the next Amazon after that.  Focusing on one specific company at a time  is a short-sighted view.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, critics of Amazon forget that of all the very small  retailers that Amazon does support.</p><p> DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I mean we've had them on this program.  They're like very small  retail operations that Amazon gives lift to and I think other large  retailers are doing that and certainly even Instagram.  I'm a big critic of  Facebook.  But Instagram has really given life to a lot of these small  businesses.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Yes, Dagen.  At the end of the day, there's nothing more  democratizing than the Internet.  So small businesses are able to access  audiences.  They otherwise never would be exposed to because the likes of  Amazon and everything else.  So there's certainly a lot of economic growth  as a result of these companies integrating in the communities.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mattie, good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Good to see you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A belated happy Thanksgiving, Mattie Duppler.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  And happy Black Friday.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right on.  Stay tuned for our Black Friday coverage on Fox  Business.  We are on the air until 2:00 p.m. Eastern.  And in case you  missed it, here is some of this week's top moments from the show.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your reaction, China, the United States, where do we go from  here in terms of these trade relationships?  </p><p> ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  So I'm  going to say something outrageous, I actually think that they're going to  get a deal done pretty quickly and if it's not next week, it will be before  the end of the year because that's the president's personality.  </p><p> STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS:  You know, I think this fits in  broadly with the idea that the best is behind us, you know, the peak in  economic activity, capital expenditures, employment and profits, I think is  all behind us now.  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And you were a little  optimistic there, bullish about this markets.  </p><p> SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, ETFS DISTRIBUTOR:  But my friends stands tall says  I'm a B, a bull with a small B, not a capital B.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, we'll take that.  </p><p>Twitter battle royal.  New York Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez going back and forth with 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah  Palin on Twitter.  </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become  like, a (INAUDIBLE) for the right.  I mean, they love beating up on her.   She makes mistakes.  She's I think 29 years old.  So she is a novice in  terms of American politics and could use some civic lessons.  And she  really got in trouble with the Middle East, if you recall.  But this case,  it's almost like fun.  It's almost like candy as we approach Thanksgiving.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  New rules after the whole Acosta mess a couple of weeks ago.   What's your reaction to all of this?  </p><p> SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, I think it's sad  and unfortunate that it's come to this.  You have to mandate professional  and behavior and decorum because a few bad apples are trying to make it  about themselves.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Holiday shopping headache, a new Bankrate survey claims the  only half of Americans feel pressure to overspend during the holiday  season.  </p><p> CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION:  You have to start off with  a plan.  Make a list of the people that you're going to shop for, assign a  dollar amount on what you can afford to spend for that individual and only  spend that amount.  I don't want people to wake up in January and have a  holiday hangover for the next 18 months trying to pay off credit card debt  when they bought things they couldn't afford.  If you can't afford to buy a  gift, then be creative.  Think of ways you can make a gift.  If they have  kids, gift them with babysitting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because when you give people something like I'll babysit your  kids, the recipient of that gift knows that that babysitter is never going  to show up.  </p><p> HOGAN:  Dagen, you sound like you've stood to people up with babysitting  before.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Two sisters making bank with bath bombs and all before they even  enter college.  </p><p> CAROLINE BERCAW, CO-FOUNDERS, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  When we were younger,  we used bath bombs all the time but we wanted to make our own, because a  lot of times it would stain the tub.  And so, we decided to add a little  extra something inside our bath bombs which was a surprise.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So what is the surprise inside the bath bomb? </p><p> ISABEL BERCAW, CO-FOUNDER, DA BOMB BATH FIZZERS:  It could be like a toy or  message on waterproof paper or even some jewelry.  And it always  coordinates with the name and the fragrance of the bomb.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting in terms of toys and expecting overall  consumer spending this holiday?  </p><p> MARISSA DEBARTOLO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, TOY INSIDER:  We're hoping that it's  going to be a good year this year.  You know, we had the loss of Toys 'R'  Us, but the other retailers are really stepping it up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Basketball takeover, the Harlem Globetrotters are performing  trick shots across the globe and are stopping here in New York City this  weekend. </p><p> Can we try it once? </p><p> CHEESE CHISHOLM, ROOKIE, HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS:  Yes, of course.  This right  here. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  I'm Cheryl Casone with some of your headlines.  President Trump  sending Thanksgiving greetings to U.S. Troops overseas.  He held a  Thanksgiving Day conference call with members of all five military branches  to thank them for their service.  Later the president visited a Coast Guard  station in South Florida expressing his gratitude as he did last year.  </p><p> Pop star Rita Ora is getting brutalized on social media after she was  caught on camera lip syncing her performance at the Thanksgiving Day parade  yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RITA ORA, SINGER-SONGWRITER:  I should've stayed with you last night,  instead of going out to find trouble, that's just trouble.  I think I run  away sometimes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  OK, so, Macy's came to her defense, saying they had technical  difficulties during the show.  But the best response of this one from  singer John Legend, here's what he said.  Fun fact, we all have lip sync on  this parade, because the floats don't have the capacity to handle the sound  requirements for a live performance.  Hope you all enjoyed it anyway.  Know  that if you come to my shows, the vocals are 100 percent live.  Good one,  John Legend.</p><p> All right, the results of some football yesterday and fans had a triple  serving of games.  First, the New Orleans, Drew Brees threw four touchdown  passes to lead the Saints to 31-10 win over the Falcons.  It was the 10th  straight win for the Saints, tightening their grip on the NFC South.   Falcons fall the 4-7 as a record the season so far.  </p><p> Now, to the Dallas Cowboys, roasting the Washington Redskins.  Ezekiel  Elliott ran for 143 yards, including this 16 yard.  And look at him throw a  $21.00 in at the Salvation Army army donation bucket.  The Cowboys now  sitting on top of the NFC East.  </p><p> And in Detroit, the Chicago Bears overcame a slow start on short rest and  came roaring back to meet the Lions for the second time in three weeks.  It  was the Bears' 5th straight win.  And they improved their record to 8-3.  </p><p> And there is this, how about a six figure Thanksgiving meal?  A steak house  in New York City offered a $150,000 Thanksgiving dinner.  This is the most  expensive in history, topping their own $76,000 dinner which they offered  last year.  So this year's meal includes the keys to a 2018 Maserati  Levante inside a free range organic turkey sprinkled with gold flakes.  So  you got to eat the turkey to get to the keys, OK.  The manufacturer  suggested retail price for that car, by the way, $74,000, depending what  options you get which don't generally include keys that smell like turkey.   So there you have that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  By the way, Cheryl Casone, you know this, the Redskins  quarterback has two broken bones in his legs.  Two, that's why you all won.  </p><p> CASONE:  Can we not just celebrate for a moment with the boys?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, you cannot, Cheryl Casone.  I do appreciate you not texting  me last night.  </p><p> CASONE:  No, I wasn't.  I held back.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  As the Washington Redskins lost.  Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump just tweeting on border funding writing this,  Republicans and Democrats must come together, finally, with a major border  security package which will include funding for the wall after 40 years of  talk, it is finally time for action.  Fix the border.  For once and for  all.  Now.  All caps, exclamation point.  </p><p> Coming up, from the battlefield to a lifestyle brand, we talk to the CEO of  Nine Line Apparel, a veteran bringing pride, patriotism and trust to the  clothing aisle.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Small Business Saturday is tomorrow.  Today we're highlighting a  veteran-owned and operated apparel company.  Joining me now, retired army  captain and the Nine Line Apparel CEO, Tyler Merritt .  Tyler, I know the  term the -- what does Nine Line mean in the military?  It has great  significance to you.  </p><p> TYLER MERRITT, CEO, NINE LINE APPAREL:  Absolutely, in the military, Nine  Line is the call for help.  When someone's injured on the battlefield, they  call on for Nine Line.  Someone like myself will come and pull them off the  battlefield.  But in the U.S., Nine Line is a call to action.  The idea of  trying to bring those who serve and those who supporters together and  create a conversation, a dialogue about some of the issues that we're going  through.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, talk about the company.  And because I know viewers of Fox  Business and the Fox News Channel will be familiar with the company because  when you expanded to this very large -- I think it's a 60,000 square foot  facility in Savannah, you were on the air.  Tell us about growth and how  your brand is resonating with customers?  </p><p> MERRITT:  Yes, growth is exponential, about 5,000 percent year over year.   We're doing very well.  And the things that we're most proud of is that  we've been able to successfully transition a lot of our non-USA made  products to USA made.  We've been able to increase our job count to almost  over 180 employees from my garage less than five years ago.  So that's one  of the things that we take to heart when the president says growing the  U.S. economy and specifically U.S. made manufacturing, that's patriotism.   That's something we need to do.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So where are the products made?  What parts of the United  States?  </p><p> MERRITT:  So, if you look around the table, you've got our shirts over  here, proudly displaying the made in the U.S.  I have my hat that I really  wanted to wear but obviously we're on Fox Business, I'm trying to be a  little more professional but this is --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is such a southern thing, wear your hat inside.  </p><p> MERRITT:  Yes, you got to wear your hat, you can't wear the hat inside.   But you know, the idea of taking it and the sacrifice of going from a  highly profitable, non-U.S. made product to something that's made in the  U.S., you've got quality, plus you know that you're employing more people  here.  </p><p> You know, Nike took a stand on profit above everything else.  We take a  stand on values above everything else.  But we're still hyper profitable.   People are willing to spend just a little bit more for that USA made.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Where are you sold?  Like, and are you expanding the number of  channels through which you sell the product?  </p><p> MERRITT:  Absolutely.  We started off almost everything was online.  But  we've transitioned to almost half wholesale.  We picked up in the last year  everyone from field and stream to Dick's, to Cabela's Bass Pro.  And these  are incredible partnerships.  So much so that they grow our sales so fast  that we can't keep up.  This product right here, it's our patented product.   It holds your beer hand free which is very novel and needed.  But as soon  as it landed, we had -- well, we though after January --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Can you get a close-up of this.  I'm going to move behind the  mannequin, see, look.  It's perfect.  </p><p> MERRITT:  It is, but this product is out of stock and it's going to be out  of stock until January.  Thanked the wholesalers, they bought up  everything. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you can find it, you could find it in a store potentially.  </p><p> MERRITT:  It's right now in a lot of Big Box Stores, Dick's Sporting Goods,  it's been selling through really, really, really quick.  It will probably  be gone by the time the segment is done.  And I can't resupply it until  about January.  So I do apologize.  I do appreciate all the support.  I  just have to get our growth rate up.  We're a boot strap company.  I'm  still in the process of bringing on some outside funding.  So -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You are -- so do you need -- you can't fund growth in with  internal cash flow?  You're trying to raise a little bit of money?  So  you're going to sell part of the business?  </p><p> MERRITT:  Not at the rate that the demand is coming in.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I got it.</p><p> MERRITT:  You know, I can't float the cash to bring in millions and  millions and millions of dollars of a product and wait for it to be sold.   So, we have smaller amounts that get sold out very quickly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tyler, really quickly, how are you giving back to the men and  women who serve and have served?  </p><p> MERRITT:  So, the idea is putting your actions and your money where your  mouth is.  For us, we want to help take care of our veterans.  We build  houses for severely wounded veterans, and right now, we're working on an  initiative to build tiny homes for homeless veterans.  And if you're  interested, check out ninelinefoundation.org.  There's a lot of information  for people that give back.  But we have no paid employees.  And it's a  hundred percent give-back.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tyler, thank you, thanks for being here.  Thank you for your  service.  And that goes out to every man and women who is serving today and  has sacrificed for this country.  The freedoms that we hold dear and  congratulations on the business, Tyler Merritt.</p><p> MERRITT:  Thank you very much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Everybody, it's the busiest shopping day of the year.

It's down in premarket trading  so far.</p><p> The futures are showing this in market action.  Loses across the board, in  fact.  The Dow Futures are down 132 points in what has been a rough week so  far the -- for the markets.</p><p> This is end of the week that's seen all three major market gauges down.

Black Friday shoppers braving  the cold, gearing up for major deals.  </p><p> Hillary Vaughn is live in Garden City, New York, where shoppers are scoring  some bargains.  Hey, Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, one to  know, this mall was open all of Thanksgiving until about 2:00 a.m., and  then they closed for a few hours, and now they're opening their doors again  to daytime Black Friday shoppers.  </p><p> We're seeing this happen all over the country where retailers are not only  rolling out early deals online, but also in stores and malls opening up on  Thanksgiving Day.  </p><p> So, people really don't have to wait late at night outside in the cold for  the mall to open before they're able to cash in on really good deals.  </p><p> So, we've a lot of people starting to trickle in and walk around.  Some of  them already have bags of things that they bought.</p><p> So, we're looking at some early sales data.  The mall here says that they  saw -- basically are expecting to at least have the same turnout in sales  that they had last year at this time, the same number of people, and  possibly purchase or even beat those estimates. </p><p> But some people are also, that have shopped online, are having trouble  getting online.  Walmart and Lululemon had some website access issues,  which is concerning some shoppers.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like being able to see what it is that I'm buying  versus having wait and see when it comes, like, in the mail.  But -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And sometimes, I've had it crash, or have the  websites just, like, there's so many people on at the same time. </p><p> So, to be able to still get the deals and not have to worry about if  something sells out or crashes or whatever.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> VAUGHN:  And for the first time ever, half of those shoppers online were  shopping on their phone, Dagen.  Back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  We will check back in next hour.  </p><p> Hillary Vaughn out on Long Island for us. </p><p> Staying on the Trump economy, President Trump touting his administration's  economic success yesterday as this country kicks off its annual holiday  shopping season.</p><p> The Commander-in0Chief commenting on what he is thankful for.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you most thankful for, Mr. President?  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For having a great family  and for having made a tremendous difference in this country.  I've made a  tremendous difference in the country.  </p><p> This country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office that  you wouldn't believe it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, Wall Street Global Economic Senator, Jon  HILSENRATH.  I'm thankful for myself.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  So I'm  thankful for myself, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Come on, we -- that's funny.  That did make them laugh.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Did that make it around the table last night when you all said  what you were thankful for?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've got a great -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Thankful for what I've done for everybody around.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm going to grade myself.  I give myself an A plus.  Can I give  myself a higher grade than that?  Is that possible?</p><p> Jon, what do you make of the U.S. economy right now?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we're seeing some signs that it -- it's  slowing down a little bit.  We had numbers earlier this week on investment  durable goods orders.  </p><p> And they were soft and it was a little troubling after a third quarter in  which business investment numbers were kind of soft.</p><p> You all were talking earlier about retail sales.  I mean we're in a moment  right now where the consumer has so much power, with unemployment so low.  </p><p> And the benefits of these tax cuts that this might be a quarter, the fourth  quarter, where it's really the consumer driving thing more than anything  else.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is that enough to turn the markets around, though?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you asked Michael yes or no question, I'm going to say  no.</p><p> You know, it does look like the economy is slowing, it does look like  earnings growth going into 2019 is slowing down.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  So I think, you know, there's a lot this market has to be  worried about right now.</p><p> BLOCK:  So Jon, with all that, what is the fed thinking here?  You know,  you -- if you go back even a month, everyone was -- it was near certainty  that they were going to raise rates again on -- in December.</p><p> You know, now we're looking at a scenario where suddenly we're starting to  see blanks.  We've talked about it on this program.  </p><p> And the futures markets are starting to price in that this isn't a given  anymore.  </p><p> What is the fed thinking about right now?  What's most important to them?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the fed is thinking that it's going to go in  December, so, you know, we had John Williams, New York Fed President, out  speaking last week.  Jay Powell has been out there talking in the last few  weeks, and they haven't sent any signals that suggest they're wavering.  </p><p> You know, when they see the market volatility like this, they say, \"All  right, that's part of the going back to normal in an economy.  It's having  a market that has ups and downs.\"</p><p> And so I think they're going to look through what -- the volatility we're  seeing right now and go ahead and raise rates in December.</p><p> LI:  I think they have to go in December at this point, because if you  don't, it looks like you're kowtowing to the White House.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  To the President.  </p><p> LI:  You're supposed to be an independent institution, right?  </p><p> Four times that year, that's questionable to me.  That's what Goldman Sachs  is pricing in.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean it's interesting because the President has really  been on Jay Powell, the Fed Chairman, about raising rates.</p><p> And he's kind of put the fed into position where if it doesn't raise rates,  which is what the President wants to happen, then it looks like the fed is  getting political -- </p><p> LI:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- and bending to the White House will.  So it's counter --  you could argue that it's counterproductive, but I think from the fed's  point of view, you have unemployment at a 50-year low.</p><p> Their model show that inflation should pick up when inflation gets this  low.  Powell isn't completely convinced of that, but we have seen inflation  pick up.  It's around two percent now.</p><p> So, I think they're going to go ahead in December and then see how things  play out next year.  The big question's what happens in 2019, and when they  meet next month, the big question is going to be how the forecast change  their forecast for 2019 come down.  </p><p> But I wouldn't expect them to back away from a December move at this point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's stay on the fed really quickly.  </p><p> The President, though, is -- many people think he's right to talk about  interest rates in the sense of that that is a concern that people are  worried about, the Fed Reserve overdoing it.  </p><p> We heard that from the economist, from the National Association of Retail - - excuse me, Realtors, existing home sales were up for the first time in  six months thankfully, but they're worried about the -- about rising  interest rates.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, we -- I mean it's interesting because the fed's been --  I'm sorry, the President has been talking about this for months.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And just now the markets are starting to come around to his  view that maybe the fed is being too aggressive.  </p><p> And the other thing that's interesting about the President's comments is,  you know, he's very vocal about his unhappiness with what Jerome Powell is  doing.</p><p> But he really isn't interfering personally with what the fed has been up  to.  He hasn't talked to Powell since before he was nominated.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But this is -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  So he's not -- you know, like we saw with LBJ back in the  1960s and President Nixon, they personally intervened with fed leaders and  say -- and said, \"Don't do this.  Don't do this to me.\"</p><p> And with Powell -- I'm sorry, with the President, he's speaking publicly  about it, but he isn't personally intervening with Jay Powell and telling  him to stop.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think anything changes with their balance sheet reduction  that something that Greg Ip was writing about, about the removal of  quantitative easing in Europe.  </p><p> LI:  That's quantitative tightening as well.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And -- well -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in Europe and Bank -- and the Bank of Japan and here in the  United States.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Well -- so the fed built up this four and half  trillion dollar balance sheet.  They bought all these treasury bonds, all  these mortgage-backed securities, to try to hold down -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- long-term interest rates and boost markets in the economy.</p><p> You know, they've been -- they've been at this for many months now, and  they said they were going to do it more than a year ago.</p><p> It shouldn't be a surprise to markets.  Markets are supposed to be forward- looking, and price in all of this activity.</p><p> LI:  But why do they need to do -- couldn't they hold these bonds to  maturity?  </p><p> I mean, you don't necessarily have to un-want the balance sheet and sell  off a bit -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what they -- that's what the -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, they -- they're not -- they're not selling -- they're  not selling any of the bonds.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, that's what they are doing now.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  The -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right?  They're not actively selling.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  They're allowing them -- they're allowing them -- when they  mature, they're just allowing them to retire.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- and they're not recycling them into new bonds.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But the point I was trying to make is, like, the market should  know this.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  So, the -- it shouldn't give be  an on -- </p><p> In theory, it shouldn't be an ongoing headwind to the market because it  should have been priced in a long time ago.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But a lot people would argue that it is because there's just  all the supply coming out of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're -- but we're assuming that investors are really smart.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And always make really good decisions looking ahead.  </p><p> I want to talk about china.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a lot of cover in this.  But President Trump is expected  to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at the G20 Summit in  Argentina.  </p><p> The President sounding confident on his trade strategy ahead of the much  anticipated meeting.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I can say this China wants to make a deal very badly.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think it's going to happen?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Because of the tariffs.  Because right now on $250 billion, they'll  be paying, as of January 1st, 25 percent.  </p><p> And in many cases, they're already paying 205 percent.  On the rest that  they're not, they're paying 10, but the 10 percent goes to 25 percent on  January 1st.</p><p> China is right now paying us.  Right now paying us billions of dollars a  month.  That's never happened before.  And soon, they're going to be paying  us many, many billions of dollars a month.  </p><p> But China wants to make a deal.  If we can make a deal, we will.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then on china, Jon, you guys have one major breaking story  every day, multiple stories a day, in fact.  </p><p> And today, it's the U.S. government has initiated an extraordinary outreach  campaign to foreign allies trying to persuade wireless and internet  providers from avoiding the Chinese telecom equipment maker, Huawei  Technologies.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, we're putting the hammer down on China in many ways, not  just the tariff and the trade fight.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But it's -- we're doing it in ways that are kind of  inconsistent and hard to read.  On one hand -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- you know, we're trying to convince Germany and Japan not to  buy equipment from Huawei because we're afraid that they're going use that  to spy, not only on Germany and Japan, but at our military installations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But on the other hand, you know, we had this band on U.S.  equipment sales, chip sales, to ZTE and then we reversed it.</p><p> So, it's kind of hard to tell where we're going in this battle.  But, it,  you know, when you look at it, you kind of think, you know, are we going to  do a deal with the Chinese next week and then all of a sudden everything is  fine?  </p><p> And you know economic relations are kind of back to normal with the Chinese  I don't think so.  I think this is a very long run -- confrontation that  we've got with China on its economic might and its technological might.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, to President Trump's credit, this is deliberately hard to  read.  </p><p> You know, the whole point here is exert pressure at various random points  in order to say -- in order to get dialogue going within China -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BLOCK:  -- and back channel saying, \"Hey, this guy is going after us.  Now  we need to step down and make a deal, and I can tell you from my personal  checks that that's feeling in China right now.  </p><p> But there is also this optimism that deals are going to get done with the  midterms out of the way going into the New Year.  </p><p> When Wilbur Ross said, \"Wait until next year,\" he wasn't kidding.  There's  things happening.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, final word, Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think next week, with Xi Jinping and President Trump, this  is going to get a lot of attention.  I don't expect a big breakthrough.</p><p> I mean maybe they keep talking going into 2019.  But the President just --  and that hit didn't sound like he was ready for a deal.  </p><p> He said the Chinese want to do a deal.  He didn't say he's ready to do the  one himself.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that's yesterday and then there's today.  So, maybe we'll  get a tweet in the next 45 minutes that's incredibly optimistic.  You just  never know.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Keep watching.  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Happy Thanksgiving, Jon.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Come back soon.  Jon Hilsenrath, Wall Street  Journal.  Stay tuned, our special Black Friday market coverage on Fox  Business.  </p><p> Markets close at 1:00, we're here until 2:00.  </p><p> And then coming up, border battle.  President Trump threatening to shut  down the entire U.S.-Mexico border if troops cannot get a handle on the  migrants looking to cross into this country.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dozens killed in a mosque blast in Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone  has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  We're  just getting some new details on this story.  </p><p> Here's what we know.  This was an explosion at a mosque in the Eastern  Afghan Province of Coast.  </p><p> The mosque was inside of an army base, this was evening prayers.  At least  26 people are dead, 50 wounded.  The victims, of course, had gathered there  to pray.  </p><p> No word on what caused that explosion, though.  We're going to, of course,  be updating this story throughout the morning for you.</p><p> Another headlines this morning, Black Friday shopping turning violent in an  Alabama mall last night.  </p><p> Police fatally shooting a suspected gunman who they say opened fire inside  a mall crowded with shoppers.  Two people, including a 12-year-old girl,  were injured.</p><p> The gunshots sent shoppers scurrying for cover and several were seen with  their guns drawn.</p><p> The gunfire started just before 10 p.m. at the Riverchase Galleria in  Hoover.  That's about 10 miles from Birmingham.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was crazy in every direction.  And I just started  praying and praying that God would give the police wisdom and accuracy of  shot, protect the victims.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The suspect has not yet been identified.</p><p> Well, dozens were hurt after a charter bus overturned on an icy road in  Washington State.</p><p> That bus was carrying the University of Washington Marching Band and it  flipped on its side.</p><p> They were on their way to tonight's Apple Cup came against Washington  State.  </p><p> Nearly 40 of the 56 people onboard were injured, but none of those  injuries, luckily, are serious.</p><p> Well, Nissan's Board voting unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn from  his post.  </p><p> The Japanese automaker claims Ghosn used company money to buy personal  homes, including a condominium in Rio de Janeiro.  </p><p>Nissan also says that Ghosn uses subsidiary in the Netherlands to make  multiple payments totaling thousands of dollars to his older sister for  consulting.</p><p> Shares of the company are down about 14 percent so far this year, Dagen.  </p><p> And there is the year-to-date with chart.  A lot of pressure and a lot of  news coming out on Nissan as well.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  I'm reading \"The Wall Street  Journal's\" story that the auto -- Nissan found that Carlos Ghosn used a  subsidiary in the Netherlands, which Cher was talking about, to spend $18  million, buying, renovating personal homes.</p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It wasn't just a condo in Rio, but it was a home in Beirut that  his sister received 60,000 commission for advising on the housing in Rio.</p><p> LI:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But found no evidence that the sister actually performed such  work.</p><p> LI:  And he underreported his $44 million in earnings as well according to  these allegations in Japanese court.  </p><p> And so, yes, Japan doesn't take this lightly, as I mentioned to you.  It's  a very insular domestic oriented economy.  And when you're a foreign CEO  heading up one of the largest companies in the country, you know, that  doesn't look good for you, especially for a legacy.  </p><p> Someone like Carlos Ghosn who's been -- his tenure has been over 10 years  at the helm of Nissan.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, they save Nissan -- he essentially saved Nissan from  bankruptcy.</p><p> LI:  Avoided, 2008.  Yes.</p><p> BLOCK:  That's -- then becomes a corporate rock star, and now this happens.   Unbelievable.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well they wanted to -- independence, I guess.  And now -- </p><p> LI:  But it took a while for them to actually kick him out because they  needed Renault's support in order to oust him as chairman and they finally  got it, so.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What happens to the alliance, guys?</p><p> LI:  I think it stays in place because it's been intact for so long.  It's  been successful.  I think they -- they're -- bringing in new people  obviously, new blood to front the new entity.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you don't have to be a rock star to actually know how to run  a company or series of companies.  I'll just point that out.</p><p> BLOCK:  It's more -- </p><p> LI:  Maybe -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Boring is better sometimes.</p><p> LI:  Maybe stars only shine so long, I think that's the lesson.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p> BLOCK:  You're a rock star, and don't steal.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, caravan crisis, more asylum seekers gaining ground  near the U.S.-Mexico border, as President Trump threatens to shut it down  entirely.  </p><p> Plus subpoena sent, FBI Director James Comey urging for transparency, set  to answer house judiciary questions over the Clinton email investigation.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take a look at futures today.  We've got a market that's down  three percent or more so far this week.  There -- Monday and Tuesday being  horrible days in the stock market.</p><p> Now you have 124 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.  We'll be looking  into this, digging into this as the morning moves on.</p><p> Markets close today shortened trading session.  Close at 1 p.m. Eastern  Time.</p><p> Moving on to the border showdown, President Trump threatening to shut down  the United States border with Mexico if things cannot get under control.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  If we find that it's -- it gets to a level where we are going to  lose control, or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will  close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under  control.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You mean entire border of the country?  </p><p> TRUMP: The whole border.  I mean the whole border.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This coming after reports that a small group separated from the  major migrant caravan within 500 feet of the U.S. border yesterday.</p><p> Joining us now, \"Weekly Standard\" Deputy Editor Kelly Jane Torrance.  What  do you make of what the President was talking about there?</p><p> KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes.  You know, it's  really coming to a showdown, isn't it, Dagen?  And I have mixed feelings.  </p><p> I mean you don't want to close the border to people who do have real  problems and who are seeking asylum, but at the same time, a lot of these  people are coming specifically for a showdown.</p><p> And, you know, the President says talking about closing down border, but  what he's not mentioning is actually the government knows about the caravan  and has been preparing for it for months now.</p><p> And what's interesting is the administration is actually implementing what  they call a Remain in Mexico plan, which is if you can show that you have  worries for your life, you need to get out of Mexico, you will be let into  the United States while your asylum claim is being processed.  </p><p> But if you can't, you're going to actually wait in Mexico while that claim  is being processed.</p><p> And, you know, President Trump has been complaining for a while about the,  you know, what he calls the, you know, detainee program now, and  complaining about people being released.  </p><p> Well, if they're going to have to wait in Mexico, it might actually stop  some people from coming to United States who think, \"Well, I can get here,  I can get to the United States.  And once they let me go, I can do what I  want.\"</p><p> So there's a lot going on here that the President isn't talking about  that's going on behind the scenes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Erin.  </p><p> ELMORE:  Yes.  Hi, Kelly.  Erin Elmore here.  Good morning.  We know that  immigration is a huge issue for the Trump voter and the Trump base.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p> ELMORE:  What do you think the right play is here?  We know 9th Circuit is  trying to control the situation, but what do you think the right play is?   What do you tell the President to do?</p><p> TORRANCE:  Yes, and, you know what, everyone's complaining about Donald  Trump talking about the politicized core, but let's face it, you had -- </p><p> Okay, so this is not the 9th Circuit, but it's the district court that  things go to the 9th Circuit.  The District Court of Northern California  complained that the President cannot make immigration law and it stopped,  you know, his recent laws.  </p><p> But let's face it, that same court actually thought that it was okay for  Obama, President Obama to make immigration law with DACA, with the, you  know, the DREAM Act.</p><p> And so then it was like, \"Oh, it's okay for the president to say -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> TORRANCE:  -- that we're going to have this DREAM Act in young people who  are here.  They had no problem with the President making immigration law  then they have a problem with Donald Trump doing it.</p><p> So I mean, you know, you don't want to criticize courts too much, you want  to let them do their job, but I think in this case, Donald Trump actually  has a point.  </p><p> And you say, you know, look at and it's like, \"Well, hey, we're -- Donald  Trump can't make immigration law but Barack Obama can.\"  He has a good  point there.</p><p> ELMORE:  So he's not relying on his own precedent, is what you're saying  basically.  And that's -- the beauty of courts is that their precedent  shows you what they're going to likely do in the future.  </p><p> And in this case, they're not relying on their own precedent and it is  politics.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Exactly.  I mean I agree with the court, actually, that it's  Congress who should be making immigration law.</p><p> But we -- of course we know that Congress has been trying since the George  W. Bush years to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill and it's not  going to happen.  </p><p> Let's face it, it's just never going to happen and that's why presidents  have been using executive orders to do things that they want and, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What -- well, I want to point out that one very well-known  Democrat, Hillary Clinton, weighed in on immigration.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Former Presidential candidate urging Europe to get a handle  on the migrant crisis there.  </p><p> This is in an interview with \"The Guardian.\"  </p><p> Hillary Clinton said this, \"I admire the very generous and compassionate  approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like German Chancellor,  Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part and  must send a very clear message.\"</p><p> \"We're not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support  because we don't deal with the immigration issue.  We'll continue to roil  the body politic.\"</p><p> Your reaction to that.  Again, it's -- she's talking about Europe, but why  not the United States?</p><p> TORRANCE:  Well -- and, of course, one of the reasons that Europe has this  crisis is because Angela Merkel actually welcomed migrants to come to  Germany.</p><p> People forget that the reason that you have this migrant crisis, one of the  reasons, is that Angela Merkel said, \"Hey, you guys need asylum?  Come  here.\"</p><p> And, of course, people listen.  But let's face it, why do we -- why does  Europe have that migrant crisis?  It's because of the war in Syria.  </p><p> And, you know, honestly, if we got rid of the terrible regime in Iran,  that's propping up Bashar al-Assad and making it impossible to live in  Syria, for regular Syrians who are facing, you know, terrible situations,  they wouldn't be doing that.</p><p> So, yes, let's look at the root causes of why people are leaving and I  think -- no, that's one of the things that Donald Trump is tried -- sort of  said is like, hey, we need to look at what's happening in Central America  and maybe help people at the source, so they don't feel they need to leave.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She -- Hillary Clinton did say that you need to handle the  immigration crisis if you want to stop the rise of right wing populist, in  the region.  But I'll point out.</p><p> Remember the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany that were virtually  not covered by the news media, here in the United States?  In large part,  because of this immigration crisis that Hillary Clinton is talking about  and I think that was two years ago, maybe, just to point that out.</p><p> TORRANCE:  It's not even just it wasn't covered here, it was actually not  covered in Germany so much, because police in Cologne actually wouldn't --  didn't want people to know about what was happening because they didn't  want people angry at the government that -- you know, welcome those people  to come.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you Kelly Jane, Kelly Jane Torrance, this morning, Happy  Thanksgiving.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Black Friday madness.  It's the biggest shopping day  of the year.  We'll see if retail stocks get a boost or even the overall  market.  And live action Lion King, a sneak peek at the latest trailer from  Disney and all of the talent that comes along with it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, Black  Friday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, November 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Black Friday  is here.  More than 164 million people are expected to go shopping this  weekend, that, according to the National Retail Federation.</p><p> Checking out market actions this morning, Futures are pointing way, way  lower, 126-point loss on the Dow Futures.  Markets close at 1:00 p.m.  Eastern time, today.  But so far, in this shortened holiday week, the Dow,  S&amp;P and NASDAQ are all down more than three percent.  NASDAQ Composite down  nearly four percent.  That's the worst week in eight months, for the  NASDAQ.</p><p> In Europe, markets have shown some mixed moves.  So far, we have green  across the screen, at the moment, slight gains in England, France and  Germany, and in Asia overnight, markets moving lower.  The Nikkei was  closed for trading, but the Hang Seng, Shanghai and KOSPI in South Korea,  all to the downside.</p><p> Crude awakening, we're watching oil prices amid oversupply concerns, we  have a four percent loss on the cost of crude this morning, the cost of  oil, at $52.32 a barrel.</p><p> Question for James Comey, the latest developments as the former FBI  director is vowing to fight a subpoena he received from House Republicans  before they pass the baton to the Democrats.</p><p> It's sky-high bid, the details as Virgin Atlantic reportedly discusses  purchasing struggling budget airline, Flybe.  Plus, a legendary face-off,  $9 million showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, that's ahead.   And the Lion King is back.  A sneak peek at the live-action reboot, later  this hour.  We will play this trailer over and over and over again.</p><p> But to our top story this half hour, Futures are heading lower on the  busiest shopping day of the year, joining us now, Payne Capital Management  President, Ryan Payne.  Can -- do investors need to see even better-than- expected sales, this weekend?  Is that enough to turn this market around?</p><p> RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Well, it wasn't earlier  in the weeks, so we had, you know, a couple big new retailers report  earnings on Tuesday.  You know, you got Kohl's report, you got Target  report, and they had great sales, and they sold off pretty unmercifully, I  would say.</p><p> LI:  But it's profit margins because people are thinking ahead, thinking  when (INAUDIBLE) a bite, when do supply chains get too expensive and when  do shoppers stop shopping when interest rates go up.</p><p> PAYNE:  And I think that is a big one.  I think everyone is worried, like,  has the consumer peaked here?  Is this as good as it going to get?  And I  think that's kind of been the overhang on the market.  Like, do we really  believe the economy is getting stronger?  At some point here, it's all  going to collapse.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, if you look at this, I want to stay on retail before we  move on, but if you look at these retail stocks, the only of this major  list of retail stocks that we follow, including Kohl'sNordstrom, Penney's,  Macy's, you name it, the only one up, so far this month, is -- </p><p> Well, you know, because I asked my (INAUDIBLE) about it.  It's Fred's.   Fred's is up on, but it's up 9-1/2 percent, but you've got an 18 percentage  point loss, almost 19 percent, like Abercrombie and Fitch, these are deep,  deep, deep losses for these retail stocks.</p><p> BLOCK:  We were watching T.V. earlier about Black Friday, and there was a  woman who was sitting at the mall and she was interviewed, and she said,  yes, I was getting 60 to 70 percent off at Aeropostale.  What does that  mean for an Abercrombie?  It's definitely difficult.</p><p> You know, one thing I'm looking at here is, earlier this year, we talk  about wage costs, freight costs.  Those are allegedly going to hit the  retail.  But what happened was, retailers were able to keep raising their  prices and they actually turned out decent margins.</p><p> With the Kohl's and Target reports earlier this week, we saw, A, there is  some concern about freight costs, both companies mentioned that, but also,  B -- you know -- B, there's also -- there are some issues with the price.   You know, what could save these stocks here?  What could help them?</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, I think at this point (INAUDIBLE) as an overall lifted  market, right?  They also sold off just because a whole market there is  capitulating in the short term, which I would argue it's probably a good  buying opportunity because now, valuations are even more reasonable.</p><p> And, you know, our belief in Payne Capital Management is, you know, the  retailer -- the retail investors are strong right now.  Consumer is strong  and it's going to continue to get stronger.  So, as long as the consumers  in good shape, I think it's going to be very good for those stocks, long  term.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that argument about, I can find some bargains now.  People  have been saying that about technology and big technology stocks, and  you've continued to see a downdraft in all of these big names, and Apple,  really, putting pressure on the market, specifically, earlier in the week.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, you live by a (INAUDIBLE) right?  I mean, tech, has had a huge  move up, and now we've seen this, you know, huge move down.  So, at some  point, I think you have to find some kind of ground here where the market  says OK.</p><p> You know, valuations are reasonable.  I mean, techs never going to get  reasonable here.  I mean, you're still trading at like, 20 times forward  earnings, which is a premium to the market.</p><p> LI:  It's a growth stock though.  That's a growth sector.  That's kind of  how they're valued, aren't they?  You know, we -- </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.</p><p> LI:  We actually had Facebook, admitting, going into the holiday, later on  Wednesday, that they did hire definers.  That was -- they did that on  purpose, so that we would miss the headlines on Thursday.  But, they  admitted to hiring definers, Sheryl Sandberg admitted to actually knowing  that they hired this opposition research team.</p><p> So, what about Facebook, in particular?  What about the reputational risk,  regulatory risk priced in?</p><p> PAYNE:  I (INAUDIBLE) priced in.  We had a lot of panic already.  And  anecdotally, I work the retail investor.  And invariably, the retail  investor is always wrong.  So, when they start to panic -- you know, I  think, when they start to panic, you're starting to see some panic in here,  that's actually very bullish for the markets.</p><p> You didn't see that before and we had a big selloff in the end of October,  and we kind of hit those lows again, this past week.  No, no one's really  panicking, that always concerned me, but now you're starting to see a  little bit of panic in there, which makes me think we're probably even  closer to some kind of bottom in here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what, I think our viewers, based on  their comments on Twitter, are quite smart about the markets, when what's  part --  a part of what's causing this downdraft, it's the smart money.   It's the smart money getting put out of business because they have been so  wrong.  Talk about that.</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  Well, what's been going on, is Q3 was hard for one, the hedge  funds, they've got whipsawed by a lot these, moves higher in the big tech  stocks, and then, right when they -- right when they bought into that, it  traded down.  It was a rough October, rough November.</p><p> There's a lot of blood out there.  There's a lot of liquidation.  I'm  reading about somebody's energy focus funds.  There's an energy fund that's  down 15.7 percent, month to date, right now, and around, so there's a lot  going on.</p><p> Your clients, you do have -- you know, you claim retail investors aren't  smart, but you know, of course, yours are the smartest, and what are they  saying?  Like, are they excited about the market?  Are they apprehensive?   What's your biggest concern right now?</p><p> PAYNE:  When was the retail investor not smart?  But they tend to be very  emotional, right?  And that emotional Litmus test.  Then, you know, we can  argue, is the smart money really that smart?  Hedge funds have not done  that well in the last couple of years.</p><p> Just the fact they're selling, they might not -- they might be indicative  of making a bad decision as opposed to good decision.</p><p> BLOCK:  They're Mike Tyson-smart.  They're geniuses until they get punched  in the face.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jonas Ferris used that very quote on Wednesday, by the way.</p><p> BLOCK:  Great minds think alike.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you were -- no, you were watching, is what -- </p><p> BLOCK:  Hi, Jonas.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just kidding.  Ryan Payne, good to see you.</p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks so much.  Stay tuned.  Our special Black Friday on Fox  Business, we're here until 2:00 p.m. Eastern.  And coming up, he's urging  for transparency, former FBI Director James Comey, issuing -- issued a  subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee, over the Hillary Clinton E-mail  scandal.</p><p> Plus, showdown on the links, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods set to duke it  out today, in Vegas, with a $9 million purse.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Weird song.  Virgin Atlantic reportedly in talks to by Flybe.   Cheryl Casone has more.  Hey, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  That's weird.  All right, here's the news: Sky News says the  Britain's Virgin Atlantic is going to acquire regional airline, Flybe.   This comes a week after Flybe announced in talks to sell itself.  Virgin  Atlantic owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Delta Airlines.  Flybe  has got a market cap of about 27 million.  Last month, Flybe has shared a  proper warning, though; they said a weak demand and a weaker British  Pounds.  So, we'll see if Virgin Atlantic gets the deal. </p><p> Former FBI Director, James Comey says that Republicans have subpoenaed him  to testify at a closed-door meeting of the House Judiciary Committee early  next month.  In a Thanksgiving Day tweet, Comey says, that he would be  happy to answer the committee's questions but would resist doing it behind  closed doors for that his testimony will be leaked and distorted.  The  subpoena part of a congressional inquiry into allegations of anti-Trump  bias that led to the opening of the Russia investigation.  </p><p> Well, the head-to-head matchup between two of the biggest names in golf  takes place today.  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson is going to hit the  links in Las Vegas, the much-hyped $9 million winner take all match.   Organizers are hoping to recoup the money from fans willing to pay $19.99  for pay-per-view.  Woods and Mickelson are also putting up their own cash  and side bets that eventually, of course, is all going to charity.  Teatime  is set for 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Dagen, place your bet.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a Disney classic reborn.  The first trailer for the  live-action \"Lion King\" wowing people; it basically broke the Internet  yesterday.  Coming up, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is wrong you?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Start churning butter and put on your church shoes  little sister because we're about to blast off.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is it you're trying to say?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to the Internet.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the new animated film \"Ralph Breaks the  Internet\"; the sequel to Disney's \"Wreck It Ralph,\" it premiers on  Wednesday.  Joining me now: \"IN THE FOX LIGHT\" Host, Michael Tammero. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The microphone is off?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What is your take on \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" is he going to  break the box office?  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR MARKETING:   It's going to break all sorts of records this weekend, looking probably  about $100 million.  You know, this is a big weekend for the box office  every year; and so far, box office is up over 10 percent this year over  last year, with an -- attendance is up which is even a bigger story right  now.  It's not just, you know, the fact that tickets are more expensive,  but attendance is up about seven percent so far this year.  And this  weekend, looks to push those numbers even higher.  The Ralph, critics are  loving him and audiences are loving him as well and it about A- cinema  score. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What else is opening this weekend or is in competition -- </p><p> TAMMERO:  We have \"Creed 2,\" follow up to the big 2016 hit, Michael B.  Jordan -- what a year this guy has had.  He started the year with \"Black  Panther\" which grossed over $700 million.  \"Creed 2\" is getting also sorts  of critical acclaim; and who knows it could push him to an Oscar coming  down, an award season, you just never know with these things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right, so what broke yesterday, can we just watch it?  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Oh, my God, yes!  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \"The Lion King\" live-action trailer, the very first one.  Roll  it.  Do we have it?  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Or not?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There we go. </p><p> TAMMERO:  Oh my god.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's not all of it.  I'm just going to sit here (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p> TAMMERO:  Over and over again.  Look, this formula has been really  successful for Disney: Bringing these animated movies to live-action  movies.  A lot of -- how is this going to look?  This broke yesterday.   People are going nuts.  I was driving home watching it from mother-in-law  and I said, oh my god, this look so good.  And my husband was like, enough  with \"The Lion King.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.</p><p> TAMMERO:  We've seen the Broadway show ten times, the movie, but guess  what?  Guess who was watching it last night and all of a sudden oh my god,  this looks incredible.  I'm like, see?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You caught your husband when you were in the other room watching  the trailer on his phone.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Sold.  He is sold, Jon Favreau is directing, Beyonce plays Nala,  Donald Glover is in this -- Darth Vader, I can't think of his name -- James  Earl Jones is in this as well plays Mufasa.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I actually -- because I'm such a nerd as Adam Driver but it  wasn't Adam Driver.  But it's -- the James Earl Jones does the voiceover  for the film.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What is it about?  Is it this movie?  I know that they've really  brought back some iconic Disney films through this new live-action  technology but there's something about \"The Lion King:\" It's the music and  it's the story and the fact that it had life as an animated film and then  as a Broadway show -- which so many people have seen.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  It's a great story and the music is fantastic.  This is going to  have a whole remade score from Hans Zimmer, that we'd get to look forward  to.  And it's also -- it's the way they do these movies now; it's so  incredible.  When you think about the motion capture and the CGI tech --  watching this last night, I kept thinking: Wow, animation is no longer the  only execution to create a world; now it's just going to be a style of  execution.  When you can do things like this, you really don't need to know  the animation, this looks real.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE), from \"Swingers.\"  What an incredible -- but what an  amazing career as a director when a lot of people just thought he would  just be an actor.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  He's responsible for Disney's \"The Jungle Book\" which made  hundreds of dollars last year at the box office.  I cannot wait.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It looks --</p><p> TAMMERO:  2019 cannot come soon enough.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But now, Jon Favreau, you have to deliver.  It has to be as good  as the trailer.  It better be better than the trailer.  Happy Thanksgiving.   Loved your whole family; loved your husband, Michael Tammero.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Happy Thanksgiving.  Good to see you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, everybody, still ahead, it's the busiest shopping day  of the year and we're just getting started, the best Black Friday deals  more on the markets next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, November 23rd. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Five pros break down the company earnings and why they don't see the gains ending anytime soon.   Howard Ward, CIO of growth equities at GAMCO, applauds Amazon for its long-term focus.    \"When you look at Amazon in particular, Amazon is a stock that people that use valuation as a reason not to own Amazon ever since it went public, and that didn't work out very well. It worked out very well for Jeff Bezos , on the other hand, to become the richest person in the world using a management philosophy of forgoing short-term profits. I think that has turned out very well for him, and I think there's a lesson in there not only for other companies and their approach to managing their businesses, but it's a lesson for investors as well, because investors that took that long-term ride with Jeff Bezos have done very well.\"   Alan Patricof, founder of Greycroft, sees the threat of regulation lingering over these companies.    \"I think it's inevitable that there's going to be more deep observation of all these companies, and everybody's going to face up to the fact that they are basically utilities. You can't survive today really without Facebook, you can't survive without Google. Google represents 90% of the searches. Think about that. No matter what you do, if you're sitting there, you want to find some information, you have to go with Google ... Anything that people are so dependent on is something that becomes a utility, a public utility, which means something has to be done to make sure that our public utility doesn't take advantage of the public in one way or another. That, to me, it's inevitable there's going to be some regulation.\"   Ann Winblad, managing partner at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, says these reports highlighted how tech is evolving to meet the challenges of the pandemic.    \"I'm surprised how well Facebook actually did in their advertising revenue. I had high expectations of cloud revenue for the enterprise for Amazon and Google, and Google is making great progress on cloud revenue. Apple was stunning. All of these companies, first of all, demonstrated that ... they can operate in extraordinary circumstances. For all companies operating long term, this way is going to be really challenging \u2014 to maintain talent, to maintain innovation.\"   Mark Mahaney, lead internet analyst at RBC, sees promise in Facebook's report.    \"I think Facebook showed that its ad model currently is more resilient than Google's. There are two interesting numbers that came out of the Facebook print \u2014 one is that they disclosed that they now have 9 million advertisers; their last disclosure was 8 million. And the second one is that they've disclosed that their top 100 advertisers accounted for only 16% of their total revenue; last time they disclosed that it was 20%. So they are diversifying their advertiser base and they're dramatically increasing it.\"   Jim Cramer , host of CNBC's \" Mad Money ,\" is in awe of Amazon's results.    \"Every conference call last night, with the exception of Google, was incredible. The power of these companies is extraordinary ... Brian Olsavsky, he's the CFO of Amazon, when he talks about the idea that basically, 'We didn't know we were going to make billions of dollars more than we did \u2014 not tens of millions, not hundreds of millions \u2014 billions.' What a juggernaut, the most impressive of last night.\"   Disclaimer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42732408098</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GM-XKF1-F07F-82R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00072IM</classCode><className>HUMMER WINBLAD VENTURE PARTNERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Nasdaq composite added 35 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,091 and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 11 points, or 0.1 percent, at 18,070.</p><p> BIG GAINS IN BIG TECH: Microsoft, Amazon and Google all rose sharply after the releasing their quarterly results. Amazon jumped $56.32, or 14 percent, to $446.33. While the company reported a quarterly loss, investors were encouraged the growth in some of Amazon\u2019s other businesses, including Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division.</p><p> Microsoft rose $4.41, or 10 percent, to $47.75. The software giant had results that beat expectations, and like Amazon, showed promising growth in new businesses like cloud computing. Google rose $17.98, or 3 percent, to $564.95. The search and advertising company missed analysts\u2019 expectations; the company had strong growth in mobile advertising.</p><p> PIVOTING: Investors have been looking for Google, Microsoft and Amazon to show promise outside their bread-and-butter businesses. Microsoft cannot solely rely on PC sales to drive its profits, Amazon has very low profit margins on the products it sells and Google is heavily exposed to desktop computer advertising while the world is shifting to mobile.</p><p> \u201cI think we are starting to see actual evidence that their strategies are working, especially at Microsoft and Amazon,\u201d said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, who owns shares of all three companies.</p><p>GREECE: A meeting between Greece and its creditors ended without a deal. A top official said \u201csignificant\u201d progress is still needed. The lack of a deal keeps uncertainty over Greece, which is forecast to have enough money only for another few weeks.</p><p> WALK AWAY: Time Warner Cable and Comcast rose after the companies called off their $45 billion merger following pressure from regulators. Comcast rose 35 cents to $59.59 and Time Warner Cable rose $7.57, or 5 percent, to $156.32.</p><p> Shares of Time Warner Cable rose after The Wall Street Journal reported that Charter Communications, another cable company, was looking at making a bid for Time Warner Cable now that Comcast pulled out. Charter was up 84 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $184.27.</p><p>NASDAQ RECORD: On Thursday the Nasdaq composite rose to 5,056.06 points, beating the record of 5,048.62 it set on March 10, 2000 at the height of the dot-com boom.</p><p> ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 59 cents to close at $57.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude rose 43 cents to close at $65.28 a barrel in London.</p><p> CURRENCIES, BONDS: The dollar fell to 118.89 yen from 119.62 yen. The euro was little changed at $1.0865. U.S. government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.92 percent from 1.96 percent late Thursday.</p><p> METALS: Gold fell $19.30 to $1,175 an ounce, silver fell 19 cents to $15.64 an ounce and copper rose five cents to $2.75 a pound.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVT-704259995</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289730A6F0A1FA NWBKVT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FV8-9H11-JD6S-R322-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409761</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Rutland Herald.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Well, one to  know, this mall was open all of Thanksgiving until about 2:00 a.m., and  then they closed for a few hours, and now they're opening their doors again  to daytime Black Friday shoppers.  </p><p>We're seeing this happen all over the country where retailers are not only  rolling out early deals online, but also in stores and malls opening up on  Thanksgiving Day.  </p><p>So, people really don't have to wait late at night outside in the cold for  the mall to open before they're able to cash in on really good deals.  </p><p>So, we've a lot of people starting to trickle in and walk around.  Some of  them already have bags of things that they bought.</p><p>So, we're looking at some early sales data.  The mall here says that they  saw -- basically are expecting to at least have the same turnout in sales  that they had last year at this time, the same number of people, and  possibly purchase or even beat those estimates. </p><p>But some people are also, that have shopped online, are having trouble  getting online.  Walmart and Lululemon had some website access issues,  which is concerning some shoppers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like being able to see what it is that I'm buying  versus having wait and see when it comes, like, in the mail.  But -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And sometimes, I've had it crash, or have the  websites just, like, there's so many people on at the same time. </p><p>So, to be able to still get the deals and not have to worry about if  something sells out or crashes or whatever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  And for the first time ever, half of those shoppers online were  shopping on their phone, Dagen.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  We will check back in next hour.  </p><p>Hillary Vaughn out on Long Island for us. </p><p>Staying on the Trump economy, President Trump touting his administration's  economic success yesterday as this country kicks off its annual holiday  shopping season.</p><p>The Commander-in0Chief commenting on what he is thankful for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you most thankful for, Mr. President?  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For having a great family  and for having made a tremendous difference in this country.  I've made a  tremendous difference in the country.  </p><p>This country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office that  you wouldn't believe it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, Wall Street Global Economic Senator, Jon  HILSENRATH.  I'm thankful for myself.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  So I'm  thankful for myself, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come on, we -- that's funny.  That did make them laugh.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Did that make it around the table last night when you all said  what you were thankful for?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've got a great -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Thankful for what I've done for everybody around.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to grade myself.  I give myself an A plus.  Can I give  myself a higher grade than that?  Is that possible?</p><p>Jon, what do you make of the U.S. economy right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we're seeing some signs that it -- it's  slowing down a little bit.  We had numbers earlier this week on investment  durable goods orders.  </p><p>And they were soft and it was a little troubling after a third quarter in  which business investment numbers were kind of soft.</p><p>You all were talking earlier about retail sales.  I mean we're in a moment  right now where the consumer has so much power, with unemployment so low.  </p><p>And the benefits of these tax cuts that this might be a quarter, the fourth  quarter, where it's really the consumer driving thing more than anything  else.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that enough to turn the markets around, though?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you asked Michael yes or no question, I'm going to say  no.</p><p>You know, it does look like the economy is slowing, it does look like  earnings growth going into 2019 is slowing down.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So I think, you know, there's a lot this market has to be  worried about right now.</p><p>BLOCK:  So Jon, with all that, what is the fed thinking here?  You know,  you -- if you go back even a month, everyone was -- it was near certainty  that they were going to raise rates again on -- in December.</p><p>You know, now we're looking at a scenario where suddenly we're starting to  see blanks.  We've talked about it on this program.  </p><p>And the futures markets are starting to price in that this isn't a given  anymore.  </p><p>What is the fed thinking about right now?  What's most important to them?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the fed is thinking that it's going to go in  December, so, you know, we had John Williams, New York Fed President, out  speaking last week.  Jay Powell has been out there talking in the last few  weeks, and they haven't sent any signals that suggest they're wavering.  </p><p>You know, when they see the market volatility like this, they say, \"All  right, that's part of the going back to normal in an economy.  It's having  a market that has ups and downs.\"</p><p>And so I think they're going to look through what -- the volatility we're  seeing right now and go ahead and raise rates in December.</p><p>LI:  I think they have to go in December at this point, because if you  don't, it looks like you're kowtowing to the White House.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  To the President.  </p><p>LI:  You're supposed to be an independent institution, right?  </p><p>Four times that year, that's questionable to me.  That's what Goldman Sachs  is pricing in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean it's interesting because the President has really  been on Jay Powell, the Fed Chairman, about raising rates.</p><p>And he's kind of put the fed into position where if it doesn't raise rates,  which is what the President wants to happen, then it looks like the fed is  getting political -- </p><p>LI:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- and bending to the White House will.  So it's counter --  you could argue that it's counterproductive, but I think from the fed's  point of view, you have unemployment at a 50-year low.</p><p>Their model show that inflation should pick up when inflation gets this  low.  Powell isn't completely convinced of that, but we have seen inflation  pick up.  It's around two percent now.</p><p>So, I think they're going to go ahead in December and then see how things  play out next year.  The big question's what happens in 2019, and when they  meet next month, the big question is going to be how the forecast change  their forecast for 2019 come down.  </p><p>But I wouldn't expect them to back away from a December move at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's stay on the fed really quickly.  </p><p>The President, though, is -- many people think he's right to talk about  interest rates in the sense of that that is a concern that people are  worried about, the Fed Reserve overdoing it.  </p><p>We heard that from the economist, from the National Association of Retail - - excuse me, Realtors, existing home sales were up for the first time in  six months thankfully, but they're worried about the -- about rising  interest rates.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, we -- I mean it's interesting because the fed's been --  I'm sorry, the President has been talking about this for months.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And just now the markets are starting to come around to his  view that maybe the fed is being too aggressive.  </p><p>And the other thing that's interesting about the President's comments is,  you know, he's very vocal about his unhappiness with what Jerome Powell is  doing.</p><p>But he really isn't interfering personally with what the fed has been up  to.  He hasn't talked to Powell since before he was nominated.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this is -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So he's not -- you know, like we saw with LBJ back in the  1960s and President Nixon, they personally intervened with fed leaders and  say -- and said, \"Don't do this.  Don't do this to me.\"</p><p>And with Powell -- I'm sorry, with the President, he's speaking publicly  about it, but he isn't personally intervening with Jay Powell and telling  him to stop.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think anything changes with their balance sheet reduction  that something that Greg Ip was writing about, about the removal of  quantitative easing in Europe.  </p><p>LI:  That's quantitative tightening as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And -- well -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in Europe and Bank -- and the Bank of Japan and here in the  United States.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Well -- so the fed built up this four and half  trillion dollar balance sheet.  They bought all these treasury bonds, all  these mortgage-backed securities, to try to hold down -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- long-term interest rates and boost markets in the economy.</p><p>You know, they've been -- they've been at this for many months now, and  they said they were going to do it more than a year ago.</p><p>It shouldn't be a surprise to markets.  Markets are supposed to be forward- looking, and price in all of this activity.</p><p>LI:  But why do they need to do -- couldn't they hold these bonds to  maturity?  </p><p>I mean, you don't necessarily have to un-want the balance sheet and sell  off a bit -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what they -- that's what the -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, they -- they're not -- they're not selling -- they're  not selling any of the bonds.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, that's what they are doing now.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right?  They're not actively selling.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  They're allowing them -- they're allowing them -- when they  mature, they're just allowing them to retire.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- and they're not recycling them into new bonds.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But the point I was trying to make is, like, the market should  know this.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  So, the -- it shouldn't give be  an on -- </p><p>In theory, it shouldn't be an ongoing headwind to the market because it  should have been priced in a long time ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But a lot people would argue that it is because there's just  all the supply coming out of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're -- but we're assuming that investors are really smart.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And always make really good decisions looking ahead.  </p><p>I want to talk about china.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a lot of cover in this.  But President Trump is expected  to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at the G20 Summit in  Argentina.  </p><p>The President sounding confident on his trade strategy ahead of the much  anticipated meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I can say this China wants to make a deal very badly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think it's going to happen?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Because of the tariffs.  Because right now on $250 billion, they'll  be paying, as of January 1st, 25 percent.  </p><p>And in many cases, they're already paying 205 percent.  On the rest that  they're not, they're paying 10, but the 10 percent goes to 25 percent on  January 1st.</p><p>China is right now paying us.  Right now paying us billions of dollars a  month.  That's never happened before.  And soon, they're going to be paying  us many, many billions of dollars a month.  </p><p>But China wants to make a deal.  If we can make a deal, we will.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then on china, Jon, you guys have one major breaking story  every day, multiple stories a day, in fact.  </p><p>And today, it's the U.S. government has initiated an extraordinary outreach  campaign to foreign allies trying to persuade wireless and internet  providers from avoiding the Chinese telecom equipment maker, Huawei  Technologies.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're putting the hammer down on China in many ways, not  just the tariff and the trade fight.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But it's -- we're doing it in ways that are kind of  inconsistent and hard to read.  On one hand -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- you know, we're trying to convince Germany and Japan not to  buy equipment from Huawei because we're afraid that they're going use that  to spy, not only on Germany and Japan, but at our military installations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But on the other hand, you know, we had this band on U.S.  equipment sales, chip sales, to ZTE and then we reversed it.</p><p>So, it's kind of hard to tell where we're going in this battle.  But, it,  you know, when you look at it, you kind of think, you know, are we going to  do a deal with the Chinese next week and then all of a sudden everything is  fine?  </p><p>And you know economic relations are kind of back to normal with the Chinese  I don't think so.  I think this is a very long run -- confrontation that  we've got with China on its economic might and its technological might.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, to President Trump's credit, this is deliberately hard to  read.  </p><p>You know, the whole point here is exert pressure at various random points  in order to say -- in order to get dialogue going within China -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BLOCK:  -- and back channel saying, \"Hey, this guy is going after us.  Now  we need to step down and make a deal, and I can tell you from my personal  checks that that's feeling in China right now.  </p><p>But there is also this optimism that deals are going to get done with the  midterms out of the way going into the New Year.  </p><p>When Wilbur Ross said, \"Wait until next year,\" he wasn't kidding.  There's  things happening.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, final word, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think next week, with Xi Jinping and President Trump, this  is going to get a lot of attention.  I don't expect a big breakthrough.</p><p>I mean maybe they keep talking going into 2019.  But the President just --  and that hit didn't sound like he was ready for a deal.  </p><p>He said the Chinese want to do a deal.  He didn't say he's ready to do the  one himself.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's yesterday and then there's today.  So, maybe we'll  get a tweet in the next 45 minutes that's incredibly optimistic.  You just  never know.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Keep watching.  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Happy Thanksgiving, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Come back soon.  Jon Hilsenrath, Wall Street  Journal.  Stay tuned, our special Black Friday market coverage on Fox  Business.  </p><p>Markets close at 1:00, we're here until 2:00.  </p><p>And then coming up, border battle.  President Trump threatening to shut  down the entire U.S.-Mexico border if troops cannot get a handle on the  migrants looking to cross into this country.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dozens killed in a mosque blast in Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone  has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  We're  just getting some new details on this story.  </p><p>Here's what we know.  This was an explosion at a mosque in the Eastern  Afghan Province of Coast.  </p><p>The mosque was inside of an army base, this was evening prayers.  At least  26 people are dead, 50 wounded.  The victims, of course, had gathered there  to pray.  </p><p>No word on what caused that explosion, though.  We're going to, of course,  be updating this story throughout the morning for you.</p><p>Another headlines this morning, Black Friday shopping turning violent in an  Alabama mall last night.  </p><p>Police fatally shooting a suspected gunman who they say opened fire inside  a mall crowded with shoppers.  Two people, including a 12-year-old girl,  were injured.</p><p>The gunshots sent shoppers scurrying for cover and several were seen with  their guns drawn.</p><p>The gunfire started just before 10 p.m. at the Riverchase Galleria in  Hoover.  That's about 10 miles from Birmingham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was crazy in every direction.  And I just started  praying and praying that God would give the police wisdom and accuracy of  shot, protect the victims.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The suspect has not yet been identified.</p><p>Well, dozens were hurt after a charter bus overturned on an icy road in  Washington State.</p><p>That bus was carrying the University of Washington Marching Band and it  flipped on its side.</p><p>They were on their way to tonight's Apple Cup came against Washington  State.  </p><p>Nearly 40 of the 56 people onboard were injured, but none of those  injuries, luckily, are serious.</p><p>Well, Nissan's Board voting unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn from  his post.  </p><p>The Japanese automaker claims Ghosn used company money to buy personal  homes, including a condominium in Rio de Janeiro.  </p><p>Nissan also says that Ghosn uses subsidiary in the Netherlands to make  multiple payments totaling thousands of dollars to his older sister for  consulting.</p><p>Shares of the company are down about 14 percent so far this year, Dagen.  </p><p>And there is the year-to-date with chart.  A lot of pressure and a lot of  news coming out on Nissan as well.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  I'm reading \"The Wall Street  Journal's\" story that the auto -- Nissan found that Carlos Ghosn used a  subsidiary in the Netherlands, which Cher was talking about, to spend $18  million, buying, renovating personal homes.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It wasn't just a condo in Rio, but it was a home in Beirut that  his sister received 60,000 commission for advising on the housing in Rio.</p><p>LI:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But found no evidence that the sister actually performed such  work.</p><p>LI:  And he underreported his $44 million in earnings as well according to  these allegations in Japanese court.  </p><p>And so, yes, Japan doesn't take this lightly, as I mentioned to you.  It's  a very insular domestic oriented economy.  And when you're a foreign CEO  heading up one of the largest companies in the country, you know, that  doesn't look good for you, especially for a legacy.  </p><p>Someone like Carlos Ghosn who's been -- his tenure has been over 10 years  at the helm of Nissan.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they save Nissan -- he essentially saved Nissan from  bankruptcy.</p><p>LI:  Avoided, 2008.  Yes.</p><p>BLOCK:  That's -- then becomes a corporate rock star, and now this happens.   Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well they wanted to -- independence, I guess.  And now -- </p><p>LI:  But it took a while for them to actually kick him out because they  needed Renault's support in order to oust him as chairman and they finally  got it, so.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What happens to the alliance, guys?</p><p>LI:  I think it stays in place because it's been intact for so long.  It's  been successful.  I think they -- they're -- bringing in new people  obviously, new blood to front the new entity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you don't have to be a rock star to actually know how to run  a company or series of companies.  I'll just point that out.</p><p>BLOCK:  It's more -- </p><p>LI:  Maybe -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Boring is better sometimes.</p><p>LI:  Maybe stars only shine so long, I think that's the lesson.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>BLOCK:  You're a rock star, and don't steal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, caravan crisis, more asylum seekers gaining ground  near the U.S.-Mexico border, as President Trump threatens to shut it down  entirely.  </p><p>Plus subpoena sent, FBI Director James Comey urging for transparency, set  to answer house judiciary questions over the Clinton email investigation.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take a look at futures today.  We've got a market that's down  three percent or more so far this week.  There -- Monday and Tuesday being  horrible days in the stock market.</p><p>Now you have 124 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.  We'll be looking  into this, digging into this as the morning moves on.</p><p>Markets close today shortened trading session.  Close at 1 p.m. Eastern  Time.</p><p>Moving on to the border showdown, President Trump threatening to shut down  the United States border with Mexico if things cannot get under control.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  If we find that it's -- it gets to a level where we are going to  lose control, or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will  close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under  control.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You mean entire border of the country?  </p><p>TRUMP: The whole border.  I mean the whole border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This coming after reports that a small group separated from the  major migrant caravan within 500 feet of the U.S. border yesterday.</p><p>Joining us now, \"Weekly Standard\" Deputy Editor Kelly Jane Torrance.  What  do you make of what the President was talking about there?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes.  You know, it's  really coming to a showdown, isn't it, Dagen?  And I have mixed feelings.  </p><p>I mean you don't want to close the border to people who do have real  problems and who are seeking asylum, but at the same time, a lot of these  people are coming specifically for a showdown.</p><p>And, you know, the President says talking about closing down border, but  what he's not mentioning is actually the government knows about the caravan  and has been preparing for it for months now.</p><p>And what's interesting is the administration is actually implementing what  they call a Remain in Mexico plan, which is if you can show that you have  worries for your life, you need to get out of Mexico, you will be let into  the United States while your asylum claim is being processed.  </p><p>But if you can't, you're going to actually wait in Mexico while that claim  is being processed.</p><p>And, you know, President Trump has been complaining for a while about the,  you know, what he calls the, you know, detainee program now, and  complaining about people being released.  </p><p>Well, if they're going to have to wait in Mexico, it might actually stop  some people from coming to United States who think, \"Well, I can get here,  I can get to the United States.  And once they let me go, I can do what I  want.\"</p><p>So there's a lot going on here that the President isn't talking about  that's going on behind the scenes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Erin.  </p><p>ELMORE:  Yes.  Hi, Kelly.  Erin Elmore here.  Good morning.  We know that  immigration is a huge issue for the Trump voter and the Trump base.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p>ELMORE:  What do you think the right play is here?  We know 9th Circuit is  trying to control the situation, but what do you think the right play is?   What do you tell the President to do?</p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes, and, you know what, everyone's complaining about Donald  Trump talking about the politicized core, but let's face it, you had -- </p><p>Okay, so this is not the 9th Circuit, but it's the district court that  things go to the 9th Circuit.  The District Court of Northern California  complained that the President cannot make immigration law and it stopped,  you know, his recent laws.  </p><p>But let's face it, that same court actually thought that it was okay for  Obama, President Obama to make immigration law with DACA, with the, you  know, the DREAM Act.</p><p>And so then it was like, \"Oh, it's okay for the president to say -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  -- that we're going to have this DREAM Act in young people who  are here.  They had no problem with the President making immigration law  then they have a problem with Donald Trump doing it.</p><p>So I mean, you know, you don't want to criticize courts too much, you want  to let them do their job, but I think in this case, Donald Trump actually  has a point.  </p><p>And you say, you know, look at and it's like, \"Well, hey, we're -- Donald  Trump can't make immigration law but Barack Obama can.\"  He has a good  point there.</p><p>ELMORE:  So he's not relying on his own precedent, is what you're saying  basically.  And that's -- the beauty of courts is that their precedent  shows you what they're going to likely do in the future.  </p><p>And in this case, they're not relying on their own precedent and it is  politics.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Exactly.  I mean I agree with the court, actually, that it's  Congress who should be making immigration law.</p><p>But we -- of course we know that Congress has been trying since the George  W. Bush years to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill and it's not  going to happen.  </p><p>Let's face it, it's just never going to happen and that's why presidents  have been using executive orders to do things that they want and, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What -- well, I want to point out that one very well-known  Democrat, Hillary Clinton, weighed in on immigration.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Former Presidential candidate urging Europe to get a handle  on the migrant crisis there.  </p><p>This is in an interview with \"The Guardian.\"  </p><p>Hillary Clinton said this, \"I admire the very generous and compassionate  approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like German Chancellor,  Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part and  must send a very clear message.\"</p><p>\"We're not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support  because we don't deal with the immigration issue.  We'll continue to roil  the body politic.\"</p><p>Your reaction to that.  Again, it's -- she's talking about Europe, but why  not the United States?</p><p>TORRANCE:  Well -- and, of course, one of the reasons that Europe has this  crisis is because Angela Merkel actually welcomed migrants to come to  Germany.</p><p>People forget that the reason that you have this migrant crisis, one of the  reasons, is that Angela Merkel said, \"Hey, you guys need asylum?  Come  here.\"</p><p>And, of course, people listen.  But let's face it, why do we -- why does  Europe have that migrant crisis?  It's because of the war in Syria.  </p><p>And, you know, honestly, if we got rid of the terrible regime in Iran,  that's propping up Bashar al-Assad and making it impossible to live in  Syria, for regular Syrians who are facing, you know, terrible situations,  they wouldn't be doing that.</p><p>So, yes, let's look at the root causes of why people are leaving and I  think -- no, that's one of the things that Donald Trump is tried -- sort of  said is like, hey, we need to look at what's happening in Central America  and maybe help people at the source, so they don't feel they need to leave.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She -- Hillary Clinton did say that you need to handle the  immigration crisis if you want to stop the rise of right wing populist, in  the region.  But I'll point out.</p><p>Remember the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany that were virtually  not covered by the news media, here in the United States?  In large part,  because of this immigration crisis that Hillary Clinton is talking about  and I think that was two years ago, maybe, just to point that out.</p><p>TORRANCE:  It's not even just it wasn't covered here, it was actually not  covered in Germany so much, because police in Cologne actually wouldn't --  didn't want people to know about what was happening because they didn't  want people angry at the government that -- you know, welcome those people  to come.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Kelly Jane, Kelly Jane Torrance, this morning, Happy  Thanksgiving.</p><p>TORRANCE:  Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Black Friday madness.  It's the biggest shopping day  of the year.  We'll see if retail stocks get a boost or even the overall  market.  And live action Lion King, a sneak peek at the latest trailer from  Disney and all of the talent that comes along with it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, Black  Friday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, November 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Black Friday  is here.  More than 164 million people are expected to go shopping this  weekend, that, according to the National Retail Federation.</p><p>Checking out market actions this morning, Futures are pointing way, way  lower, 126-point loss on the Dow Futures.  Markets close at 1:00 p.m.  Eastern time, today.  But so far, in this shortened holiday week, the Dow,  S&amp;P and NASDAQ are all down more than three percent.  NASDAQ Composite down  nearly four percent.  That's the worst week in eight months, for the  NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe, markets have shown some mixed moves.  So far, we have green  across the screen, at the moment, slight gains in England, France and  Germany, and in Asia overnight, markets moving lower.  The Nikkei was  closed for trading, but the Hang Seng, Shanghai and KOSPI in South Korea,  all to the downside.</p><p>Crude awakening, we're watching oil prices amid oversupply concerns, we  have a four percent loss on the cost of crude this morning, the cost of  oil, at $52.32 a barrel.</p><p>Question for James Comey, the latest developments as the former FBI  director is vowing to fight a subpoena he received from House Republicans  before they pass the baton to the Democrats.</p><p>It's sky-high bid, the details as Virgin Atlantic reportedly discusses  purchasing struggling budget airline, Flybe.  Plus, a legendary face-off,  $9 million showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, that's ahead.   And the Lion King is back.  A sneak peek at the live-action reboot, later  this hour.  We will play this trailer over and over and over again.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, Futures are heading lower on the  busiest shopping day of the year, joining us now, Payne Capital Management  President, Ryan Payne.  Can -- do investors need to see even better-than- expected sales, this weekend?  Is that enough to turn this market around?</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Well, it wasn't earlier  in the weeks, so we had, you know, a couple big new retailers report  earnings on Tuesday.  You know, you got Kohl's report, you got Target  report, and they had great sales, and they sold off pretty unmercifully, I  would say.</p><p>LI:  But it's profit margins because people are thinking ahead, thinking  when (INAUDIBLE) a bite, when do supply chains get too expensive and when  do shoppers stop shopping when interest rates go up.</p><p>PAYNE:  And I think that is a big one.  I think everyone is worried, like,  has the consumer peaked here?  Is this as good as it going to get?  And I  think that's kind of been the overhang on the market.  Like, do we really  believe the economy is getting stronger?  At some point here, it's all  going to collapse.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, if you look at this, I want to stay on retail before we  move on, but if you look at these retail stocks, the only of this major  list of retail stocks that we follow, including Kohl'sNordstrom, Penney's,  Macy's, you name it, the only one up, so far this month, is -- </p><p>Well, you know, because I asked my (INAUDIBLE) about it.  It's Fred's.   Fred's is up on, but it's up 9-1/2 percent, but you've got an 18 percentage  point loss, almost 19 percent, like Abercrombie and Fitch, these are deep,  deep, deep losses for these retail stocks.</p><p>BLOCK:  We were watching T.V. earlier about Black Friday, and there was a  woman who was sitting at the mall and she was interviewed, and she said,  yes, I was getting 60 to 70 percent off at Aeropostale.  What does that  mean for an Abercrombie?  It's definitely difficult.</p><p>You know, one thing I'm looking at here is, earlier this year, we talk  about wage costs, freight costs.  Those are allegedly going to hit the  retail.  But what happened was, retailers were able to keep raising their  prices and they actually turned out decent margins.</p><p>With the Kohl's and Target reports earlier this week, we saw, A, there is  some concern about freight costs, both companies mentioned that, but also,  B -- you know -- B, there's also -- there are some issues with the price.   You know, what could save these stocks here?  What could help them?</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, I think at this point (INAUDIBLE) as an overall lifted  market, right?  They also sold off just because a whole market there is  capitulating in the short term, which I would argue it's probably a good  buying opportunity because now, valuations are even more reasonable.</p><p>And, you know, our belief in Payne Capital Management is, you know, the  retailer -- the retail investors are strong right now.  Consumer is strong  and it's going to continue to get stronger.  So, as long as the consumers  in good shape, I think it's going to be very good for those stocks, long  term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that argument about, I can find some bargains now.  People  have been saying that about technology and big technology stocks, and  you've continued to see a downdraft in all of these big names, and Apple,  really, putting pressure on the market, specifically, earlier in the week.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, you live by a (INAUDIBLE) right?  I mean, tech, has had a huge  move up, and now we've seen this, you know, huge move down.  So, at some  point, I think you have to find some kind of ground here where the market  says OK.</p><p>You know, valuations are reasonable.  I mean, techs never going to get  reasonable here.  I mean, you're still trading at like, 20 times forward  earnings, which is a premium to the market.</p><p>LI:  It's a growth stock though.  That's a growth sector.  That's kind of  how they're valued, aren't they?  You know, we -- </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>LI:  We actually had Facebook, admitting, going into the holiday, later on  Wednesday, that they did hire definers.  That was -- they did that on  purpose, so that we would miss the headlines on Thursday.  But, they  admitted to hiring definers, Sheryl Sandberg admitted to actually knowing  that they hired this opposition research team.</p><p>So, what about Facebook, in particular?  What about the reputational risk,  regulatory risk priced in?</p><p>PAYNE:  I (INAUDIBLE) priced in.  We had a lot of panic already.  And  anecdotally, I work the retail investor.  And invariably, the retail  investor is always wrong.  So, when they start to panic -- you know, I  think, when they start to panic, you're starting to see some panic in here,  that's actually very bullish for the markets.</p><p>You didn't see that before and we had a big selloff in the end of October,  and we kind of hit those lows again, this past week.  No, no one's really  panicking, that always concerned me, but now you're starting to see a  little bit of panic in there, which makes me think we're probably even  closer to some kind of bottom in here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what, I think our viewers, based on  their comments on Twitter, are quite smart about the markets, when what's  part --  a part of what's causing this downdraft, it's the smart money.   It's the smart money getting put out of business because they have been so  wrong.  Talk about that.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  Well, what's been going on, is Q3 was hard for one, the hedge  funds, they've got whipsawed by a lot these, moves higher in the big tech  stocks, and then, right when they -- right when they bought into that, it  traded down.  It was a rough October, rough November.</p><p>There's a lot of blood out there.  There's a lot of liquidation.  I'm  reading about somebody's energy focus funds.  There's an energy fund that's  down 15.7 percent, month to date, right now, and around, so there's a lot  going on.</p><p>Your clients, you do have -- you know, you claim retail investors aren't  smart, but you know, of course, yours are the smartest, and what are they  saying?  Like, are they excited about the market?  Are they apprehensive?   What's your biggest concern right now?</p><p>PAYNE:  When was the retail investor not smart?  But they tend to be very  emotional, right?  And that emotional Litmus test.  Then, you know, we can  argue, is the smart money really that smart?  Hedge funds have not done  that well in the last couple of years.</p><p>Just the fact they're selling, they might not -- they might be indicative  of making a bad decision as opposed to good decision.</p><p>BLOCK:  They're Mike Tyson-smart.  They're geniuses until they get punched  in the face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonas Ferris used that very quote on Wednesday, by the way.</p><p>BLOCK:  Great minds think alike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you were -- no, you were watching, is what -- </p><p>BLOCK:  Hi, Jonas.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just kidding.  Ryan Payne, good to see you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks so much.  Stay tuned.  Our special Black Friday on Fox  Business, we're here until 2:00 p.m. Eastern.  And coming up, he's urging  for transparency, former FBI Director James Comey, issuing -- issued a  subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee, over the Hillary Clinton E-mail  scandal.</p><p>Plus, showdown on the links, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods set to duke it  out today, in Vegas, with a $9 million purse.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Weird song.  Virgin Atlantic reportedly in talks to by Flybe.   Cheryl Casone has more.  Hey, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  That's weird.  All right, here's the news: Sky News says the  Britain's Virgin Atlantic is going to acquire regional airline, Flybe.   This comes a week after Flybe announced in talks to sell itself.  Virgin  Atlantic owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Delta Airlines.  Flybe  has got a market cap of about 27 million.  Last month, Flybe has shared a  proper warning, though; they said a weak demand and a weaker British  Pounds.  So, we'll see if Virgin Atlantic gets the deal. </p><p>Former FBI Director, James Comey says that Republicans have subpoenaed him  to testify at a closed-door meeting of the House Judiciary Committee early  next month.  In a Thanksgiving Day tweet, Comey says, that he would be  happy to answer the committee's questions but would resist doing it behind  closed doors for that his testimony will be leaked and distorted.  The  subpoena part of a congressional inquiry into allegations of anti-Trump  bias that led to the opening of the Russia investigation.  </p><p>Well, the head-to-head matchup between two of the biggest names in golf  takes place today.  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson is going to hit the  links in Las Vegas, the much-hyped $9 million winner take all match.   Organizers are hoping to recoup the money from fans willing to pay $19.99  for pay-per-view.  Woods and Mickelson are also putting up their own cash  and side bets that eventually, of course, is all going to charity.  Teatime  is set for 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Dagen, place your bet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a Disney classic reborn.  The first trailer for the  live-action \"Lion King\" wowing people; it basically broke the Internet  yesterday.  Coming up, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is wrong you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Start churning butter and put on your church shoes  little sister because we're about to blast off.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is it you're trying to say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to the Internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the new animated film \"Ralph Breaks the  Internet\"; the sequel to Disney's \"Wreck It Ralph,\" it premiers on  Wednesday.  Joining me now: \"IN THE FOX LIGHT\" Host, Michael Tammero. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The microphone is off?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is your take on \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" is he going to  break the box office?  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR MARKETING:   It's going to break all sorts of records this weekend, looking probably  about $100 million.  You know, this is a big weekend for the box office  every year; and so far, box office is up over 10 percent this year over  last year, with an -- attendance is up which is even a bigger story right  now.  It's not just, you know, the fact that tickets are more expensive,  but attendance is up about seven percent so far this year.  And this  weekend, looks to push those numbers even higher.  The Ralph, critics are  loving him and audiences are loving him as well and it about A- cinema  score. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What else is opening this weekend or is in competition -- </p><p>TAMMERO:  We have \"Creed 2,\" follow up to the big 2016 hit, Michael B.  Jordan -- what a year this guy has had.  He started the year with \"Black  Panther\" which grossed over $700 million.  \"Creed 2\" is getting also sorts  of critical acclaim; and who knows it could push him to an Oscar coming  down, an award season, you just never know with these things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right, so what broke yesterday, can we just watch it?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Oh, my God, yes!  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"The Lion King\" live-action trailer, the very first one.  Roll  it.  Do we have it?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Or not?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There we go. </p><p>TAMMERO:  Oh my god.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not all of it.  I'm just going to sit here (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>TAMMERO:  Over and over again.  Look, this formula has been really  successful for Disney: Bringing these animated movies to live-action  movies.  A lot of -- how is this going to look?  This broke yesterday.   People are going nuts.  I was driving home watching it from mother-in-law  and I said, oh my god, this look so good.  And my husband was like, enough  with \"The Lion King.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.</p><p>TAMMERO:  We've seen the Broadway show ten times, the movie, but guess  what?  Guess who was watching it last night and all of a sudden oh my god,  this looks incredible.  I'm like, see?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You caught your husband when you were in the other room watching  the trailer on his phone.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Sold.  He is sold, Jon Favreau is directing, Beyonce plays Nala,  Donald Glover is in this -- Darth Vader, I can't think of his name -- James  Earl Jones is in this as well plays Mufasa.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I actually -- because I'm such a nerd as Adam Driver but it  wasn't Adam Driver.  But it's -- the James Earl Jones does the voiceover  for the film.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is it about?  Is it this movie?  I know that they've really  brought back some iconic Disney films through this new live-action  technology but there's something about \"The Lion King:\" It's the music and  it's the story and the fact that it had life as an animated film and then  as a Broadway show -- which so many people have seen.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  It's a great story and the music is fantastic.  This is going to  have a whole remade score from Hans Zimmer, that we'd get to look forward  to.  And it's also -- it's the way they do these movies now; it's so  incredible.  When you think about the motion capture and the CGI tech --  watching this last night, I kept thinking: Wow, animation is no longer the  only execution to create a world; now it's just going to be a style of  execution.  When you can do things like this, you really don't need to know  the animation, this looks real.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE), from \"Swingers.\"  What an incredible -- but what an  amazing career as a director when a lot of people just thought he would  just be an actor.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  He's responsible for Disney's \"The Jungle Book\" which made  hundreds of dollars last year at the box office.  I cannot wait.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It looks --</p><p>TAMMERO:  2019 cannot come soon enough.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But now, Jon Favreau, you have to deliver.  It has to be as good  as the trailer.  It better be better than the trailer.  Happy Thanksgiving.   Loved your whole family; loved your husband, Michael Tammero.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Happy Thanksgiving.  Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, everybody, still ahead, it's the busiest shopping day  of the year and we're just getting started, the best Black Friday deals  more on the markets next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.

It is Friday, November 23rd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Get ready for shopping, and your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.  That  frenzy already underway.  It is Black Friday.  Shoppers have already  started to hit the stores in person and online.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When the dust settles, online sale set to hit a record level.  We'll keep  an eye on retailers this morning like -- Amazon will see if some holiday  shopping can put -- turn that stock around.  It's down in premarket trading  so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The futures are showing this in market action.  Loses across the board, in  fact.  The Dow Futures are down 132 points in what has been a rough week so  far the -- for the markets.</p><p> This is end of the week that's seen all three major market gauges down.   You can take a look at this.  This is 11/19 close as a rough, rough time  for stocks.</p><p> In Europe let's take look at trading in England, France, and Germany, some  mixed market action there, but just slight losses and gains of those three,  the FTSE-100 down ever so slightly.</p><p> The Asia markets closing lower overnight.  The Nikkei was not trading for  the day.  The Shanghai shedding two and a half percent.  </p><p> The price of crude oil slipping this morning.  Oil prices now at their  lowest level since late 2017 on an abundance of supply.  A five percent  lose on the cost of crude as we speak.  </p><p> And telecom trouble, the U.S. warning countries about dealing with Chinese  company Huawei Technologies.  This, ahead of the big meeting between  President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit next  week.  </p><p> Mortar battle.  President Trump threatening to shut down the entire Mexican  border if immigration becomes uncontrollable.  </p><p> This is a group breaks off from the migrant caravan just 500 feet away from  the U.S. border.  </p><p> Been the thriller on the green.  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson teeing off  today in a special pay-per-view match in Las Vegas with more than nine  million dollars at stake.  We have the details.  </p><p> And Lion King goes live action.  The trailer for the new Lion King movie  making its debut online, more of this incredible video coming up.  I've  already watched it about 10 times so far.  </p><p> That was how I spent my Thanksgiving.  </p><p> All of that and so much more coming up this morning.  </p><p> Fox Business Network's Susan Li, Chief Market Strategist at Third Seven  Advisors, Michael Block, and Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate,  Former -- and Former Republican Convention Deputy Press Secretary, Erin  Elmore.  </p><p> Great to see you one and all.  Hope you had a lovely -- </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Black Friday.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know.  I hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving, but we're back to  business.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, we are.  </p><p> ERIN ELMORE, FORMER REPUBLICAN CONVENTION DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And some of these retailers were open yesterday.  </p><p> LI:  Well, you can get your deals online already yesterday.  I know.  I was  sifting through all -- full transparency here, but it's going to be a  blowout shopping season.  </p><p> A trillion dollars for the first time should be spent.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the question is, can that turn the market around?  </p><p> Two words.  You get two words, yes or no?  May be.  May be's two words.  </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  Sneaking up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Michael.  We're going to get -- dig into all of this  as the morning wears on.  </p><p> Retail, the Super Bowl was officially here.  Black Friday shoppers braving  the cold, gearing up for major deals.  </p><p> Hillary Vaughn is live in Garden City, New York, where shoppers are scoring  some bargains.  Hey, Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, one to  know, this mall was open all of Thanksgiving until about 2:00 a.m., and  then they closed for a few hours, and now they're opening their doors again  to daytime Black Friday shoppers.  </p><p> We're seeing this happen all over the country where retailers are not only  rolling out early deals online, but also in stores and malls opening up on  Thanksgiving Day.  </p><p> So, people really don't have to wait late at night outside in the cold for  the mall to open before they're able to cash in on really good deals.  </p><p> So, we've a lot of people starting to trickle in and walk around.  Some of  them already have bags of things that they bought.</p><p> So, we're looking at some early sales data.  The mall here says that they  saw -- basically are expecting to at least have the same turnout in sales  that they had last year at this time, the same number of people, and  possibly purchase or even beat those estimates. </p><p> But some people are also, that have shopped online, are having trouble  getting online.  Walmart and Lululemon had some website access issues,  which is concerning some shoppers.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like being able to see what it is that I'm buying  versus having wait and see when it comes, like, in the mail.  But -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And sometimes, I've had it crash, or have the  websites just, like, there's so many people on at the same time. </p><p> So, to be able to still get the deals and not have to worry about if  something sells out or crashes or whatever.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> VAUGHN:  And for the first time ever, half of those shoppers online were  shopping on their phone, Dagen.  Back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  We will check back in next hour.  </p><p> Hillary Vaughn out on Long Island for us. </p><p> Staying on the Trump economy, President Trump touting his administration's  economic success yesterday as this country kicks off its annual holiday  shopping season.</p><p> The Commander-in0Chief commenting on what he is thankful for.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What are you most thankful for, Mr. President?  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For having a great family  and for having made a tremendous difference in this country.  I've made a  tremendous difference in the country.  </p><p> This country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office that  you wouldn't believe it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, Wall Street Global Economic Senator, Jon  HILSENRATH.  I'm thankful for myself.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  So I'm  thankful for myself, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Come on, we -- that's funny.  That did make them laugh.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Did that make it around the table last night when you all said  what you were thankful for?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've got a great -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Thankful for what I've done for everybody around.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm going to grade myself.  I give myself an A plus.  Can I give  myself a higher grade than that?  Is that possible?</p><p> Jon, what do you make of the U.S. economy right now?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, we're seeing some signs that it -- it's  slowing down a little bit.  We had numbers earlier this week on investment  durable goods orders.  </p><p> And they were soft and it was a little troubling after a third quarter in  which business investment numbers were kind of soft.</p><p> You all were talking earlier about retail sales.  I mean we're in a moment  right now where the consumer has so much power, with unemployment so low.  </p><p> And the benefits of these tax cuts that this might be a quarter, the fourth  quarter, where it's really the consumer driving thing more than anything  else.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is that enough to turn the markets around, though?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you asked Michael yes or no question, I'm going to say  no.</p><p> You know, it does look like the economy is slowing, it does look like  earnings growth going into 2019 is slowing down.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  So I think, you know, there's a lot this market has to be  worried about right now.</p><p> BLOCK:  So Jon, with all that, what is the fed thinking here?  You know,  you -- if you go back even a month, everyone was -- it was near certainty  that they were going to raise rates again on -- in December.</p><p> You know, now we're looking at a scenario where suddenly we're starting to  see blanks.  We've talked about it on this program.  </p><p> And the futures markets are starting to price in that this isn't a given  anymore.  </p><p> What is the fed thinking about right now?  What's most important to them?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the fed is thinking that it's going to go in  December, so, you know, we had John Williams, New York Fed President, out  speaking last week.  Jay Powell has been out there talking in the last few  weeks, and they haven't sent any signals that suggest they're wavering.  </p><p> You know, when they see the market volatility like this, they say, \"All  right, that's part of the going back to normal in an economy.  It's having  a market that has ups and downs.\"</p><p> And so I think they're going to look through what -- the volatility we're  seeing right now and go ahead and raise rates in December.</p><p> LI:  I think they have to go in December at this point, because if you  don't, it looks like you're kowtowing to the White House.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  To the President.  </p><p> LI:  You're supposed to be an independent institution, right?  </p><p> Four times that year, that's questionable to me.  That's what Goldman Sachs  is pricing in.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean it's interesting because the President has really  been on Jay Powell, the Fed Chairman, about raising rates.</p><p> And he's kind of put the fed into position where if it doesn't raise rates,  which is what the President wants to happen, then it looks like the fed is  getting political -- </p><p> LI:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- and bending to the White House will.  So it's counter --  you could argue that it's counterproductive, but I think from the fed's  point of view, you have unemployment at a 50-year low.</p><p> Their model show that inflation should pick up when inflation gets this  low.  Powell isn't completely convinced of that, but we have seen inflation  pick up.  It's around two percent now.</p><p> So, I think they're going to go ahead in December and then see how things  play out next year.  The big question's what happens in 2019, and when they  meet next month, the big question is going to be how the forecast change  their forecast for 2019 come down.  </p><p> But I wouldn't expect them to back away from a December move at this point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's stay on the fed really quickly.  </p><p> The President, though, is -- many people think he's right to talk about  interest rates in the sense of that that is a concern that people are  worried about, the Fed Reserve overdoing it.  </p><p> We heard that from the economist, from the National Association of Retail - - excuse me, Realtors, existing home sales were up for the first time in  six months thankfully, but they're worried about the -- about rising  interest rates.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, we -- I mean it's interesting because the fed's been --  I'm sorry, the President has been talking about this for months.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And just now the markets are starting to come around to his  view that maybe the fed is being too aggressive.  </p><p> And the other thing that's interesting about the President's comments is,  you know, he's very vocal about his unhappiness with what Jerome Powell is  doing.</p><p> But he really isn't interfering personally with what the fed has been up  to.  He hasn't talked to Powell since before he was nominated.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But this is -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  So he's not -- you know, like we saw with LBJ back in the  1960s and President Nixon, they personally intervened with fed leaders and  say -- and said, \"Don't do this.  Don't do this to me.\"</p><p> And with Powell -- I'm sorry, with the President, he's speaking publicly  about it, but he isn't personally intervening with Jay Powell and telling  him to stop.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think anything changes with their balance sheet reduction  that something that Greg Ip was writing about, about the removal of  quantitative easing in Europe.  </p><p> LI:  That's quantitative tightening as well.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And -- well -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- in Europe and Bank -- and the Bank of Japan and here in the  United States.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Well -- so the fed built up this four and half  trillion dollar balance sheet.  They bought all these treasury bonds, all  these mortgage-backed securities, to try to hold down -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- long-term interest rates and boost markets in the economy.</p><p> You know, they've been -- they've been at this for many months now, and  they said they were going to do it more than a year ago.</p><p> It shouldn't be a surprise to markets.  Markets are supposed to be forward- looking, and price in all of this activity.</p><p> LI:  But why do they need to do -- couldn't they hold these bonds to  maturity?  </p><p> I mean, you don't necessarily have to un-want the balance sheet and sell  off a bit -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what they -- that's what the -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, they -- they're not -- they're not selling -- they're  not selling any of the bonds.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, that's what they are doing now.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  The -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right?  They're not actively selling.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  They're allowing them -- they're allowing them -- when they  mature, they're just allowing them to retire.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- and they're not recycling them into new bonds.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But the point I was trying to make is, like, the market should  know this.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  So, the -- it shouldn't give be  an on -- </p><p> In theory, it shouldn't be an ongoing headwind to the market because it  should have been priced in a long time ago.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But a lot people would argue that it is because there's just  all the supply coming out of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're -- but we're assuming that investors are really smart.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And always make really good decisions looking ahead.  </p><p> I want to talk about china.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's a lot of cover in this.  But President Trump is expected  to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at the G20 Summit in  Argentina.  </p><p> The President sounding confident on his trade strategy ahead of the much  anticipated meeting.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I can say this China wants to make a deal very badly.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think it's going to happen?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Because of the tariffs.  Because right now on $250 billion, they'll  be paying, as of January 1st, 25 percent.  </p><p> And in many cases, they're already paying 205 percent.  On the rest that  they're not, they're paying 10, but the 10 percent goes to 25 percent on  January 1st.</p><p> China is right now paying us.  Right now paying us billions of dollars a  month.  That's never happened before.  And soon, they're going to be paying  us many, many billions of dollars a month.  </p><p> But China wants to make a deal.  If we can make a deal, we will.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then on china, Jon, you guys have one major breaking story  every day, multiple stories a day, in fact.  </p><p> And today, it's the U.S. government has initiated an extraordinary outreach  campaign to foreign allies trying to persuade wireless and internet  providers from avoiding the Chinese telecom equipment maker, Huawei  Technologies.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, we're putting the hammer down on China in many ways, not  just the tariff and the trade fight.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But it's -- we're doing it in ways that are kind of  inconsistent and hard to read.  On one hand -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- you know, we're trying to convince Germany and Japan not to  buy equipment from Huawei because we're afraid that they're going use that  to spy, not only on Germany and Japan, but at our military installations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But on the other hand, you know, we had this band on U.S.  equipment sales, chip sales, to ZTE and then we reversed it.</p><p> So, it's kind of hard to tell where we're going in this battle.  But, it,  you know, when you look at it, you kind of think, you know, are we going to  do a deal with the Chinese next week and then all of a sudden everything is  fine?  </p><p> And you know economic relations are kind of back to normal with the Chinese  I don't think so.  I think this is a very long run -- confrontation that  we've got with China on its economic might and its technological might.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, to President Trump's credit, this is deliberately hard to  read.  </p><p> You know, the whole point here is exert pressure at various random points  in order to say -- in order to get dialogue going within China -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BLOCK:  -- and back channel saying, \"Hey, this guy is going after us.  Now  we need to step down and make a deal, and I can tell you from my personal  checks that that's feeling in China right now.  </p><p> But there is also this optimism that deals are going to get done with the  midterms out of the way going into the New Year.  </p><p> When Wilbur Ross said, \"Wait until next year,\" he wasn't kidding.  There's  things happening.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, final word, Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think next week, with Xi Jinping and President Trump, this  is going to get a lot of attention.  I don't expect a big breakthrough.</p><p> I mean maybe they keep talking going into 2019.  But the President just --  and that hit didn't sound like he was ready for a deal.  </p><p> He said the Chinese want to do a deal.  He didn't say he's ready to do the  one himself.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But that's yesterday and then there's today.  So, maybe we'll  get a tweet in the next 45 minutes that's incredibly optimistic.  You just  never know.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Keep watching.  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Happy Thanksgiving, Jon.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take care.  Come back soon.  Jon Hilsenrath, Wall Street  Journal.  Stay tuned, our special Black Friday market coverage on Fox  Business.  </p><p> Markets close at 1:00, we're here until 2:00.  </p><p> And then coming up, border battle.  President Trump threatening to shut  down the entire U.S.-Mexico border if troops cannot get a handle on the  migrants looking to cross into this country.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dozens killed in a mosque blast in Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone  has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  We're  just getting some new details on this story.  </p><p> Here's what we know.  This was an explosion at a mosque in the Eastern  Afghan Province of Coast.  </p><p> The mosque was inside of an army base, this was evening prayers.  At least  26 people are dead, 50 wounded.  The victims, of course, had gathered there  to pray.  </p><p> No word on what caused that explosion, though.  We're going to, of course,  be updating this story throughout the morning for you.</p><p> Another headlines this morning, Black Friday shopping turning violent in an  Alabama mall last night.  </p><p> Police fatally shooting a suspected gunman who they say opened fire inside  a mall crowded with shoppers.  Two people, including a 12-year-old girl,  were injured.</p><p> The gunshots sent shoppers scurrying for cover and several were seen with  their guns drawn.</p><p> The gunfire started just before 10 p.m. at the Riverchase Galleria in  Hoover.  That's about 10 miles from Birmingham.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was crazy in every direction.  And I just started  praying and praying that God would give the police wisdom and accuracy of  shot, protect the victims.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The suspect has not yet been identified.</p><p> Well, dozens were hurt after a charter bus overturned on an icy road in  Washington State.</p><p> That bus was carrying the University of Washington Marching Band and it  flipped on its side.</p><p> They were on their way to tonight's Apple Cup came against Washington  State.  </p><p> Nearly 40 of the 56 people onboard were injured, but none of those  injuries, luckily, are serious.</p><p> Well, Nissan's Board voting unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn from  his post.  </p><p> The Japanese automaker claims Ghosn used company money to buy personal  homes, including a condominium in Rio de Janeiro.  </p><p>Nissan also says that Ghosn uses subsidiary in the Netherlands to make  multiple payments totaling thousands of dollars to his older sister for  consulting.</p><p> Shares of the company are down about 14 percent so far this year, Dagen.  </p><p> And there is the year-to-date with chart.  A lot of pressure and a lot of  news coming out on Nissan as well.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  I'm reading \"The Wall Street  Journal's\" story that the auto -- Nissan found that Carlos Ghosn used a  subsidiary in the Netherlands, which Cher was talking about, to spend $18  million, buying, renovating personal homes.</p><p> LI:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It wasn't just a condo in Rio, but it was a home in Beirut that  his sister received 60,000 commission for advising on the housing in Rio.</p><p> LI:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But found no evidence that the sister actually performed such  work.</p><p> LI:  And he underreported his $44 million in earnings as well according to  these allegations in Japanese court.  </p><p> And so, yes, Japan doesn't take this lightly, as I mentioned to you.  It's  a very insular domestic oriented economy.  And when you're a foreign CEO  heading up one of the largest companies in the country, you know, that  doesn't look good for you, especially for a legacy.  </p><p> Someone like Carlos Ghosn who's been -- his tenure has been over 10 years  at the helm of Nissan.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, they save Nissan -- he essentially saved Nissan from  bankruptcy.</p><p> LI:  Avoided, 2008.  Yes.</p><p> BLOCK:  That's -- then becomes a corporate rock star, and now this happens.   Unbelievable.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well they wanted to -- independence, I guess.  And now -- </p><p> LI:  But it took a while for them to actually kick him out because they  needed Renault's support in order to oust him as chairman and they finally  got it, so.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What happens to the alliance, guys?</p><p> LI:  I think it stays in place because it's been intact for so long.  It's  been successful.  I think they -- they're -- bringing in new people  obviously, new blood to front the new entity.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you don't have to be a rock star to actually know how to run  a company or series of companies.  I'll just point that out.</p><p> BLOCK:  It's more -- </p><p> LI:  Maybe -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Boring is better sometimes.</p><p> LI:  Maybe stars only shine so long, I think that's the lesson.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p> BLOCK:  You're a rock star, and don't steal.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, caravan crisis, more asylum seekers gaining ground  near the U.S.-Mexico border, as President Trump threatens to shut it down  entirely.  </p><p> Plus subpoena sent, FBI Director James Comey urging for transparency, set  to answer house judiciary questions over the Clinton email investigation.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Take a look at futures today.  We've got a market that's down  three percent or more so far this week.  There -- Monday and Tuesday being  horrible days in the stock market.</p><p> Now you have 124 point loss on the Dow Futures right now.  We'll be looking  into this, digging into this as the morning moves on.</p><p> Markets close today shortened trading session.  Close at 1 p.m. Eastern  Time.</p><p> Moving on to the border showdown, President Trump threatening to shut down  the United States border with Mexico if things cannot get under control.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  If we find that it's -- it gets to a level where we are going to  lose control, or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will  close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under  control.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You mean entire border of the country?  </p><p> TRUMP: The whole border.  I mean the whole border.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This coming after reports that a small group separated from the  major migrant caravan within 500 feet of the U.S. border yesterday.</p><p> Joining us now, \"Weekly Standard\" Deputy Editor Kelly Jane Torrance.  What  do you make of what the President was talking about there?</p><p> KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  Yes.  You know, it's  really coming to a showdown, isn't it, Dagen?  And I have mixed feelings.  </p><p> I mean you don't want to close the border to people who do have real  problems and who are seeking asylum, but at the same time, a lot of these  people are coming specifically for a showdown.</p><p> And, you know, the President says talking about closing down border, but  what he's not mentioning is actually the government knows about the caravan  and has been preparing for it for months now.</p><p> And what's interesting is the administration is actually implementing what  they call a Remain in Mexico plan, which is if you can show that you have  worries for your life, you need to get out of Mexico, you will be let into  the United States while your asylum claim is being processed.  </p><p> But if you can't, you're going to actually wait in Mexico while that claim  is being processed.</p><p> And, you know, President Trump has been complaining for a while about the,  you know, what he calls the, you know, detainee program now, and  complaining about people being released.  </p><p> Well, if they're going to have to wait in Mexico, it might actually stop  some people from coming to United States who think, \"Well, I can get here,  I can get to the United States.  And once they let me go, I can do what I  want.\"</p><p> So there's a lot going on here that the President isn't talking about  that's going on behind the scenes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Erin.  </p><p> ELMORE:  Yes.  Hi, Kelly.  Erin Elmore here.  Good morning.  We know that  immigration is a huge issue for the Trump voter and the Trump base.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p> ELMORE:  What do you think the right play is here?  We know 9th Circuit is  trying to control the situation, but what do you think the right play is?   What do you tell the President to do?</p><p> TORRANCE:  Yes, and, you know what, everyone's complaining about Donald  Trump talking about the politicized core, but let's face it, you had -- </p><p> Okay, so this is not the 9th Circuit, but it's the district court that  things go to the 9th Circuit.  The District Court of Northern California  complained that the President cannot make immigration law and it stopped,  you know, his recent laws.  </p><p> But let's face it, that same court actually thought that it was okay for  Obama, President Obama to make immigration law with DACA, with the, you  know, the DREAM Act.</p><p> And so then it was like, \"Oh, it's okay for the president to say -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> TORRANCE:  -- that we're going to have this DREAM Act in young people who  are here.  They had no problem with the President making immigration law  then they have a problem with Donald Trump doing it.</p><p> So I mean, you know, you don't want to criticize courts too much, you want  to let them do their job, but I think in this case, Donald Trump actually  has a point.  </p><p> And you say, you know, look at and it's like, \"Well, hey, we're -- Donald  Trump can't make immigration law but Barack Obama can.\"  He has a good  point there.</p><p> ELMORE:  So he's not relying on his own precedent, is what you're saying  basically.  And that's -- the beauty of courts is that their precedent  shows you what they're going to likely do in the future.  </p><p> And in this case, they're not relying on their own precedent and it is  politics.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Exactly.  I mean I agree with the court, actually, that it's  Congress who should be making immigration law.</p><p> But we -- of course we know that Congress has been trying since the George  W. Bush years to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill and it's not  going to happen.  </p><p> Let's face it, it's just never going to happen and that's why presidents  have been using executive orders to do things that they want and, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What -- well, I want to point out that one very well-known  Democrat, Hillary Clinton, weighed in on immigration.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Former Presidential candidate urging Europe to get a handle  on the migrant crisis there.  </p><p> This is in an interview with \"The Guardian.\"  </p><p> Hillary Clinton said this, \"I admire the very generous and compassionate  approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like German Chancellor,  Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part and  must send a very clear message.\"</p><p> \"We're not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support  because we don't deal with the immigration issue.  We'll continue to roil  the body politic.\"</p><p> Your reaction to that.  Again, it's -- she's talking about Europe, but why  not the United States?</p><p> TORRANCE:  Well -- and, of course, one of the reasons that Europe has this  crisis is because Angela Merkel actually welcomed migrants to come to  Germany.</p><p> People forget that the reason that you have this migrant crisis, one of the  reasons, is that Angela Merkel said, \"Hey, you guys need asylum?  Come  here.\"</p><p> And, of course, people listen.  But let's face it, why do we -- why does  Europe have that migrant crisis?  It's because of the war in Syria.  </p><p> And, you know, honestly, if we got rid of the terrible regime in Iran,  that's propping up Bashar al-Assad and making it impossible to live in  Syria, for regular Syrians who are facing, you know, terrible situations,  they wouldn't be doing that.</p><p> So, yes, let's look at the root causes of why people are leaving and I  think -- no, that's one of the things that Donald Trump is tried -- sort of  said is like, hey, we need to look at what's happening in Central America  and maybe help people at the source, so they don't feel they need to leave.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She -- Hillary Clinton did say that you need to handle the  immigration crisis if you want to stop the rise of right wing populist, in  the region.  But I'll point out.</p><p> Remember the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany that were virtually  not covered by the news media, here in the United States?  In large part,  because of this immigration crisis that Hillary Clinton is talking about  and I think that was two years ago, maybe, just to point that out.</p><p> TORRANCE:  It's not even just it wasn't covered here, it was actually not  covered in Germany so much, because police in Cologne actually wouldn't --  didn't want people to know about what was happening because they didn't  want people angry at the government that -- you know, welcome those people  to come.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you Kelly Jane, Kelly Jane Torrance, this morning, Happy  Thanksgiving.</p><p> TORRANCE:  Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Black Friday madness.  It's the biggest shopping day  of the year.  We'll see if retail stocks get a boost or even the overall  market.  And live action Lion King, a sneak peek at the latest trailer from  Disney and all of the talent that comes along with it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, Black  Friday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, November 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Black Friday  is here.  More than 164 million people are expected to go shopping this  weekend, that, according to the National Retail Federation.</p><p> Checking out market actions this morning, Futures are pointing way, way  lower, 126-point loss on the Dow Futures.  Markets close at 1:00 p.m.  Eastern time, today.  But so far, in this shortened holiday week, the Dow,  S&amp;P and NASDAQ are all down more than three percent.  NASDAQ Composite down  nearly four percent.  That's the worst week in eight months, for the  NASDAQ.</p><p> In Europe, markets have shown some mixed moves.  So far, we have green  across the screen, at the moment, slight gains in England, France and  Germany, and in Asia overnight, markets moving lower.  The Nikkei was  closed for trading, but the Hang Seng, Shanghai and KOSPI in South Korea,  all to the downside.</p><p> Crude awakening, we're watching oil prices amid oversupply concerns, we  have a four percent loss on the cost of crude this morning, the cost of  oil, at $52.32 a barrel.</p><p> Question for James Comey, the latest developments as the former FBI  director is vowing to fight a subpoena he received from House Republicans  before they pass the baton to the Democrats.</p><p> It's sky-high bid, the details as Virgin Atlantic reportedly discusses  purchasing struggling budget airline, Flybe.  Plus, a legendary face-off,  $9 million showdown between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, that's ahead.   And the Lion King is back.  A sneak peek at the live-action reboot, later  this hour.  We will play this trailer over and over and over again.</p><p> But to our top story this half hour, Futures are heading lower on the  busiest shopping day of the year, joining us now, Payne Capital Management  President, Ryan Payne.  Can -- do investors need to see even better-than- expected sales, this weekend?  Is that enough to turn this market around?</p><p> RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Well, it wasn't earlier  in the weeks, so we had, you know, a couple big new retailers report  earnings on Tuesday.  You know, you got Kohl's report, you got Target  report, and they had great sales, and they sold off pretty unmercifully, I  would say.</p><p> LI:  But it's profit margins because people are thinking ahead, thinking  when (INAUDIBLE) a bite, when do supply chains get too expensive and when  do shoppers stop shopping when interest rates go up.</p><p> PAYNE:  And I think that is a big one.  I think everyone is worried, like,  has the consumer peaked here?  Is this as good as it going to get?  And I  think that's kind of been the overhang on the market.  Like, do we really  believe the economy is getting stronger?  At some point here, it's all  going to collapse.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, if you look at this, I want to stay on retail before we  move on, but if you look at these retail stocks, the only of this major  list of retail stocks that we follow, including Kohl'sNordstrom, Penney's,  Macy's, you name it, the only one up, so far this month, is -- </p><p> Well, you know, because I asked my (INAUDIBLE) about it.  It's Fred's.   Fred's is up on, but it's up 9-1/2 percent, but you've got an 18 percentage  point loss, almost 19 percent, like Abercrombie and Fitch, these are deep,  deep, deep losses for these retail stocks.</p><p> BLOCK:  We were watching T.V. earlier about Black Friday, and there was a  woman who was sitting at the mall and she was interviewed, and she said,  yes, I was getting 60 to 70 percent off at Aeropostale.  What does that  mean for an Abercrombie?  It's definitely difficult.</p><p> You know, one thing I'm looking at here is, earlier this year, we talk  about wage costs, freight costs.  Those are allegedly going to hit the  retail.  But what happened was, retailers were able to keep raising their  prices and they actually turned out decent margins.</p><p> With the Kohl's and Target reports earlier this week, we saw, A, there is  some concern about freight costs, both companies mentioned that, but also,  B -- you know -- B, there's also -- there are some issues with the price.   You know, what could save these stocks here?  What could help them?</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, I think at this point (INAUDIBLE) as an overall lifted  market, right?  They also sold off just because a whole market there is  capitulating in the short term, which I would argue it's probably a good  buying opportunity because now, valuations are even more reasonable.</p><p> And, you know, our belief in Payne Capital Management is, you know, the  retailer -- the retail investors are strong right now.  Consumer is strong  and it's going to continue to get stronger.  So, as long as the consumers  in good shape, I think it's going to be very good for those stocks, long  term.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that argument about, I can find some bargains now.  People  have been saying that about technology and big technology stocks, and  you've continued to see a downdraft in all of these big names, and Apple,  really, putting pressure on the market, specifically, earlier in the week.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, you live by a (INAUDIBLE) right?  I mean, tech, has had a huge  move up, and now we've seen this, you know, huge move down.  So, at some  point, I think you have to find some kind of ground here where the market  says OK.</p><p> You know, valuations are reasonable.  I mean, techs never going to get  reasonable here.  I mean, you're still trading at like, 20 times forward  earnings, which is a premium to the market.</p><p> LI:  It's a growth stock though.  That's a growth sector.  That's kind of  how they're valued, aren't they?  You know, we -- </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.</p><p> LI:  We actually had Facebook, admitting, going into the holiday, later on  Wednesday, that they did hire definers.  That was -- they did that on  purpose, so that we would miss the headlines on Thursday.  But, they  admitted to hiring definers, Sheryl Sandberg admitted to actually knowing  that they hired this opposition research team.</p><p> So, what about Facebook, in particular?  What about the reputational risk,  regulatory risk priced in?</p><p> PAYNE:  I (INAUDIBLE) priced in.  We had a lot of panic already.  And  anecdotally, I work the retail investor.  And invariably, the retail  investor is always wrong.  So, when they start to panic -- you know, I  think, when they start to panic, you're starting to see some panic in here,  that's actually very bullish for the markets.</p><p> You didn't see that before and we had a big selloff in the end of October,  and we kind of hit those lows again, this past week.  No, no one's really  panicking, that always concerned me, but now you're starting to see a  little bit of panic in there, which makes me think we're probably even  closer to some kind of bottom in here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what, I think our viewers, based on  their comments on Twitter, are quite smart about the markets, when what's  part --  a part of what's causing this downdraft, it's the smart money.   It's the smart money getting put out of business because they have been so  wrong.  Talk about that.</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  Well, what's been going on, is Q3 was hard for one, the hedge  funds, they've got whipsawed by a lot these, moves higher in the big tech  stocks, and then, right when they -- right when they bought into that, it  traded down.  It was a rough October, rough November.</p><p> There's a lot of blood out there.  There's a lot of liquidation.  I'm  reading about somebody's energy focus funds.  There's an energy fund that's  down 15.7 percent, month to date, right now, and around, so there's a lot  going on.</p><p> Your clients, you do have -- you know, you claim retail investors aren't  smart, but you know, of course, yours are the smartest, and what are they  saying?  Like, are they excited about the market?  Are they apprehensive?   What's your biggest concern right now?</p><p> PAYNE:  When was the retail investor not smart?  But they tend to be very  emotional, right?  And that emotional Litmus test.  Then, you know, we can  argue, is the smart money really that smart?  Hedge funds have not done  that well in the last couple of years.</p><p> Just the fact they're selling, they might not -- they might be indicative  of making a bad decision as opposed to good decision.</p><p> BLOCK:  They're Mike Tyson-smart.  They're geniuses until they get punched  in the face.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jonas Ferris used that very quote on Wednesday, by the way.</p><p> BLOCK:  Great minds think alike.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you were -- no, you were watching, is what -- </p><p> BLOCK:  Hi, Jonas.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just kidding.  Ryan Payne, good to see you.</p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks so much.  Stay tuned.  Our special Black Friday on Fox  Business, we're here until 2:00 p.m. Eastern.  And coming up, he's urging  for transparency, former FBI Director James Comey, issuing -- issued a  subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee, over the Hillary Clinton E-mail  scandal.</p><p> Plus, showdown on the links, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods set to duke it  out today, in Vegas, with a $9 million purse.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Weird song.  Virgin Atlantic reportedly in talks to by Flybe.   Cheryl Casone has more.  Hey, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  That's weird.  All right, here's the news: Sky News says the  Britain's Virgin Atlantic is going to acquire regional airline, Flybe.   This comes a week after Flybe announced in talks to sell itself.  Virgin  Atlantic owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Delta Airlines.  Flybe  has got a market cap of about 27 million.  Last month, Flybe has shared a  proper warning, though; they said a weak demand and a weaker British  Pounds.  So, we'll see if Virgin Atlantic gets the deal. </p><p> Former FBI Director, James Comey says that Republicans have subpoenaed him  to testify at a closed-door meeting of the House Judiciary Committee early  next month.  In a Thanksgiving Day tweet, Comey says, that he would be  happy to answer the committee's questions but would resist doing it behind  closed doors for that his testimony will be leaked and distorted.  The  subpoena part of a congressional inquiry into allegations of anti-Trump  bias that led to the opening of the Russia investigation.  </p><p> Well, the head-to-head matchup between two of the biggest names in golf  takes place today.  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson is going to hit the  links in Las Vegas, the much-hyped $9 million winner take all match.   Organizers are hoping to recoup the money from fans willing to pay $19.99  for pay-per-view.  Woods and Mickelson are also putting up their own cash  and side bets that eventually, of course, is all going to charity.  Teatime  is set for 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Dagen, place your bet.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a Disney classic reborn.  The first trailer for the  live-action \"Lion King\" wowing people; it basically broke the Internet  yesterday.  Coming up, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is wrong you?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Start churning butter and put on your church shoes  little sister because we're about to blast off.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ralph, what is it you're trying to say?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to the Internet.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was a clip from the new animated film \"Ralph Breaks the  Internet\"; the sequel to Disney's \"Wreck It Ralph,\" it premiers on  Wednesday.  Joining me now: \"IN THE FOX LIGHT\" Host, Michael Tammero. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The microphone is off?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What is your take on \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" is he going to  break the box office?  </p><p> MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR MARKETING:   It's going to break all sorts of records this weekend, looking probably  about $100 million.  You know, this is a big weekend for the box office  every year; and so far, box office is up over 10 percent this year over  last year, with an -- attendance is up which is even a bigger story right  now.  It's not just, you know, the fact that tickets are more expensive,  but attendance is up about seven percent so far this year.  And this  weekend, looks to push those numbers even higher.  The Ralph, critics are  loving him and audiences are loving him as well and it about A- cinema  score. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What else is opening this weekend or is in competition -- </p><p> TAMMERO:  We have \"Creed 2,\" follow up to the big 2016 hit, Michael B.  Jordan -- what a year this guy has had.  He started the year with \"Black  Panther\" which grossed over $700 million.  \"Creed 2\" is getting also sorts  of critical acclaim; and who knows it could push him to an Oscar coming  down, an award season, you just never know with these things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right, so what broke yesterday, can we just watch it?  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Oh, my God, yes!  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  \"The Lion King\" live-action trailer, the very first one.  Roll  it.  Do we have it?  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Or not?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There we go. </p><p> TAMMERO:  Oh my god.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's not all of it.  I'm just going to sit here (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p> TAMMERO:  Over and over again.  Look, this formula has been really  successful for Disney: Bringing these animated movies to live-action  movies.  A lot of -- how is this going to look?  This broke yesterday.   People are going nuts.  I was driving home watching it from mother-in-law  and I said, oh my god, this look so good.  And my husband was like, enough  with \"The Lion King.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.</p><p> TAMMERO:  We've seen the Broadway show ten times, the movie, but guess  what?  Guess who was watching it last night and all of a sudden oh my god,  this looks incredible.  I'm like, see?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You caught your husband when you were in the other room watching  the trailer on his phone.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Sold.  He is sold, Jon Favreau is directing, Beyonce plays Nala,  Donald Glover is in this -- Darth Vader, I can't think of his name -- James  Earl Jones is in this as well plays Mufasa.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I actually -- because I'm such a nerd as Adam Driver but it  wasn't Adam Driver.  But it's -- the James Earl Jones does the voiceover  for the film.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What is it about?  Is it this movie?  I know that they've really  brought back some iconic Disney films through this new live-action  technology but there's something about \"The Lion King:\" It's the music and  it's the story and the fact that it had life as an animated film and then  as a Broadway show -- which so many people have seen.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  It's a great story and the music is fantastic.  This is going to  have a whole remade score from Hans Zimmer, that we'd get to look forward  to.  And it's also -- it's the way they do these movies now; it's so  incredible.  When you think about the motion capture and the CGI tech --  watching this last night, I kept thinking: Wow, animation is no longer the  only execution to create a world; now it's just going to be a style of  execution.  When you can do things like this, you really don't need to know  the animation, this looks real.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE), from \"Swingers.\"  What an incredible -- but what an  amazing career as a director when a lot of people just thought he would  just be an actor.  </p><p> TAMMERO:  He's responsible for Disney's \"The Jungle Book\" which made  hundreds of dollars last year at the box office.  I cannot wait.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It looks --</p><p> TAMMERO:  2019 cannot come soon enough.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But now, Jon Favreau, you have to deliver.  It has to be as good  as the trailer.  It better be better than the trailer.  Happy Thanksgiving.   Loved your whole family; loved your husband, Michael Tammero.</p><p> TAMMERO:  Happy Thanksgiving.  Good to see you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, everybody, still ahead, it's the busiest shopping day  of the year and we're just getting started, the best Black Friday deals  more on the markets next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Friday, November 23rd. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It is Friday, November 23rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Get ready for shopping, and your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern. That frenzy already underway. It is Black Friday. Shoppers have already started to hit the stores in person and online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the dust settles, online sale set to hit a record level. We'll keep an eye on retailers this morning like -- Amazon will see if some holiday shopping can put -- turn that stock around. It's down in premarket trading so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The futures are showing this in market action. Loses across the board, in fact. The Dow Futures are down 132 points in what has been a rough week so far the -- for the markets.</p><p>This is end of the week that's seen all three major market gauges down. You can take a look at this. This is 11/19 close as a rough, rough time for stocks.</p><p>In Europe let's take look at trading in England, France, and Germany, some mixed market action there, but just slight losses and gains of those three, the FTSE-100 down ever so slightly.</p><p>The Asia markets closing lower overnight. The Nikkei was not trading for the day. The Shanghai shedding two and a half percent.</p><p>The price of crude oil slipping this morning. Oil prices now at their lowest level since late 2017 on an abundance of supply. A five percent lose on the cost of crude as we speak.</p><p>And telecom trouble, the U.S. warning countries about dealing with Chinese company Huawei Technologies. This, ahead of the big meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit next week.</p><p>Mortar battle. President Trump threatening to shut down the entire Mexican border if immigration becomes uncontrollable.</p><p>This is a group breaks off from the migrant caravan just 500 feet away from the U.S. border.</p><p>Been the thriller on the green. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson teeing off today in a special pay-per-view match in Las Vegas with more than nine million dollars at stake. We have the details.</p><p>And Lion King goes live action. The trailer for the new Lion King movie making its debut online, more of this incredible video coming up. I've already watched it about 10 times so far.</p><p>That was how I spent my Thanksgiving.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning.</p><p>Fox Business Network's Susan Li, Chief Market Strategist at Third Seven Advisors, Michael Block, and Republican Strategist, Former Trump Surrogate, Former -- and Former Republican Convention Deputy Press Secretary, Erin Elmore.</p><p>Great to see you one and all. Hope you had a lovely --</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Black Friday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know. I hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving, but we're back to business.</p><p>LI: Yes, we are.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, FORMER REPUBLICAN CONVENTION DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And some of these retailers were open yesterday.</p><p>LI: Well, you can get your deals online already yesterday. I know. I was sifting through all -- full transparency here, but it's going to be a blowout shopping season.</p><p>A trillion dollars for the first time should be spent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the question is, can that turn the market around?</p><p>Two words. You get two words, yes or no? May be. May be's two words.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS: Sneaking up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Michael. We're going to get -- dig into all of this as the morning wears on.</p><p>Retail, the Super Bowl was officially here. Black Friday shoppers braving the cold, gearing up for major deals.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn is live in Garden City, New York, where shoppers are scoring some bargains. Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, Dagen. Well, one to know, this mall was open all of Thanksgiving until about 2:00 a.m., and then they closed for a few hours, and now they're opening their doors again to daytime Black Friday shoppers.</p><p>We're seeing this happen all over the country where retailers are not only rolling out early deals online, but also in stores and malls opening up on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>So, people really don't have to wait late at night outside in the cold for the mall to open before they're able to cash in on really good deals.</p><p>So, we've a lot of people starting to trickle in and walk around. Some of them already have bags of things that they bought.</p><p>So, we're looking at some early sales data. The mall here says that they saw -- basically are expecting to at least have the same turnout in sales that they had last year at this time, the same number of people, and possibly purchase or even beat those estimates.</p><p>But some people are also, that have shopped online, are having trouble getting online. Walmart and Lululemon had some website access issues, which is concerning some shoppers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I like being able to see what it is that I'm buying versus having wait and see when it comes, like, in the mail. But --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And sometimes, I've had it crash, or have the websites just, like, there's so many people on at the same time.</p><p>So, to be able to still get the deals and not have to worry about if something sells out or crashes or whatever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: And for the first time ever, half of those shoppers online were shopping on their phone, Dagen. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Hillary. We will check back in next hour.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn out on Long Island for us.</p><p>Staying on the Trump economy, President Trump touting his administration's economic success yesterday as this country kicks off its annual holiday shopping season.</p><p>The Commander-in0Chief commenting on what he is thankful for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you most thankful for, Mr. President?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For having a great family and for having made a tremendous difference in this country. I've made a tremendous difference in the country.</p><p>This country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office that you wouldn't believe it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining me now, Wall Street Global Economic Senator, Jon HILSENRATH. I'm thankful for myself.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL: So I'm thankful for myself, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Come on, we -- that's funny. That did make them laugh.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Did that make it around the table last night when you all said what you were thankful for?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've got a great --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Thankful for what I've done for everybody around.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to grade myself. I give myself an A plus. Can I give myself a higher grade than that? Is that possible?</p><p>Jon, what do you make of the U.S. economy right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, we're seeing some signs that it -- it's slowing down a little bit. We had numbers earlier this week on investment durable goods orders.</p><p>And they were soft and it was a little troubling after a third quarter in which business investment numbers were kind of soft.</p><p>You all were talking earlier about retail sales. I mean we're in a moment right now where the consumer has so much power, with unemployment so low.</p><p>And the benefits of these tax cuts that this might be a quarter, the fourth quarter, where it's really the consumer driving thing more than anything else.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is that enough to turn the markets around, though?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you asked Michael yes or no question, I'm going to say no.</p><p>You know, it does look like the economy is slowing, it does look like earnings growth going into 2019 is slowing down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So I think, you know, there's a lot this market has to be worried about right now.</p><p>BLOCK: So Jon, with all that, what is the fed thinking here? You know, you -- if you go back even a month, everyone was -- it was near certainty that they were going to raise rates again on -- in December.</p><p>You know, now we're looking at a scenario where suddenly we're starting to see blanks. We've talked about it on this program.</p><p>And the futures markets are starting to price in that this isn't a given anymore.</p><p>What is the fed thinking about right now? What's most important to them?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, the fed is thinking that it's going to go in December, so, you know, we had John Williams, New York Fed President, out speaking last week. Jay Powell has been out there talking in the last few weeks, and they haven't sent any signals that suggest they're wavering.</p><p>You know, when they see the market volatility like this, they say, \"All right, that's part of the going back to normal in an economy. It's having a market that has ups and downs.\"</p><p>And so I think they're going to look through what -- the volatility we're seeing right now and go ahead and raise rates in December.</p><p>LI: I think they have to go in December at this point, because if you don't, it looks like you're kowtowing to the White House.</p><p>HILSENRATH: To the President.</p><p>LI: You're supposed to be an independent institution, right?</p><p>Four times that year, that's questionable to me. That's what Goldman Sachs is pricing in.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I mean it's interesting because the President has really been on Jay Powell, the Fed Chairman, about raising rates.</p><p>And he's kind of put the fed into position where if it doesn't raise rates, which is what the President wants to happen, then it looks like the fed is getting political --</p><p>LI: Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- and bending to the White House will. So it's counter -- you could argue that it's counterproductive, but I think from the fed's point of view, you have unemployment at a 50-year low.</p><p>Their model show that inflation should pick up when inflation gets this low. Powell isn't completely convinced of that, but we have seen inflation pick up. It's around two percent now.</p><p>So, I think they're going to go ahead in December and then see how things play out next year. The big question's what happens in 2019, and when they meet next month, the big question is going to be how the forecast change their forecast for 2019 come down.</p><p>But I wouldn't expect them to back away from a December move at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's stay on the fed really quickly.</p><p>The President, though, is -- many people think he's right to talk about interest rates in the sense of that that is a concern that people are worried about, the Fed Reserve overdoing it.</p><p>We heard that from the economist, from the National Association of Retail - - excuse me, Realtors, existing home sales were up for the first time in six months thankfully, but they're worried about the -- about rising interest rates.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, we -- I mean it's interesting because the fed's been -- I'm sorry, the President has been talking about this for months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And just now the markets are starting to come around to his view that maybe the fed is being too aggressive.</p><p>And the other thing that's interesting about the President's comments is, you know, he's very vocal about his unhappiness with what Jerome Powell is doing.</p><p>But he really isn't interfering personally with what the fed has been up to. He hasn't talked to Powell since before he was nominated.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this is --</p><p>HILSENRATH: So he's not -- you know, like we saw with LBJ back in the 1960s and President Nixon, they personally intervened with fed leaders and say -- and said, \"Don't do this. Don't do this to me.\"</p><p>And with Powell -- I'm sorry, with the President, he's speaking publicly about it, but he isn't personally intervening with Jay Powell and telling him to stop.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think anything changes with their balance sheet reduction that something that Greg Ip was writing about, about the removal of quantitative easing in Europe.</p><p>LI: That's quantitative tightening as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And -- well --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in Europe and Bank -- and the Bank of Japan and here in the United States.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right. Well -- so the fed built up this four and half trillion dollar balance sheet. They bought all these treasury bonds, all these mortgage-backed securities, to try to hold down --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- long-term interest rates and boost markets in the economy.</p><p>You know, they've been -- they've been at this for many months now, and they said they were going to do it more than a year ago.</p><p>It shouldn't be a surprise to markets. Markets are supposed to be forward- looking, and price in all of this activity.</p><p>LI: But why do they need to do -- couldn't they hold these bonds to maturity?</p><p>I mean, you don't necessarily have to un-want the balance sheet and sell off a bit --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, that's what they -- that's what the --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, they -- they're not -- they're not selling -- they're not selling any of the bonds.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, that's what they are doing now.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right? They're not actively selling.</p><p>HILSENRATH: They're allowing them -- they're allowing them -- when they mature, they're just allowing them to retire.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- and they're not recycling them into new bonds.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But the point I was trying to make is, like, the market should know this. This shouldn't be a surprise. So, the -- it shouldn't give be an on --</p><p>In theory, it shouldn't be an ongoing headwind to the market because it should have been priced in a long time ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But --</p><p>HILSENRATH: But a lot people would argue that it is because there's just all the supply coming out of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're -- but we're assuming that investors are really smart.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right. Yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And always make really good decisions looking ahead.</p><p>I want to talk about china.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a lot of cover in this. But President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at the G20 Summit in Argentina.</p><p>The President sounding confident on his trade strategy ahead of the much anticipated meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I can say this China wants to make a deal very badly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think it's going to happen?</p><p>TRUMP: Because of the tariffs. Because right now on $250 billion, they'll be paying, as of January 1st, 25 percent.</p><p>And in many cases, they're already paying 205 percent. On the rest that they're not, they're paying 10, but the 10 percent goes to 25 percent on January 1st.</p><p>China is right now paying us. Right now paying us billions of dollars a month. That's never happened before. And soon, they're going to be paying us many, many billions of dollars a month.</p><p>But China wants to make a deal. If we can make a deal, we will.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then on china, Jon, you guys have one major breaking story every day, multiple stories a day, in fact.</p><p>And today, it's the U.S. government has initiated an extraordinary outreach campaign to foreign allies trying to persuade wireless and internet providers from avoiding the Chinese telecom equipment maker, Huawei Technologies.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, we're putting the hammer down on China in many ways, not just the tariff and the trade fight.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But it's -- we're doing it in ways that are kind of inconsistent and hard to read. On one hand --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- you know, we're trying to convince Germany and Japan not to buy equipment from Huawei because we're afraid that they're going use that to spy, not only on Germany and Japan, but at our military installations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But on the other hand, you know, we had this band on U.S. equipment sales, chip sales, to ZTE and then we reversed it.</p><p>So, it's kind of hard to tell where we're going in this battle. But, it, you know, when you look at it, you kind of think, you know, are we going to do a deal with the Chinese next week and then all of a sudden everything is fine?</p><p>And you know economic relations are kind of back to normal with the Chinese I don't think so. I think this is a very long run -- confrontation that we've got with China on its economic might and its technological might.</p><p>BLOCK: You know, to President Trump's credit, this is deliberately hard to read.</p><p>You know, the whole point here is exert pressure at various random points in order to say -- in order to get dialogue going within China --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BLOCK: -- and back channel saying, \"Hey, this guy is going after us. Now we need to step down and make a deal, and I can tell you from my personal checks that that's feeling in China right now.</p><p>But there is also this optimism that deals are going to get done with the midterms out of the way going into the New Year.</p><p>When Wilbur Ross said, \"Wait until next year,\" he wasn't kidding. There's things happening.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick, final word, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think next week, with Xi Jinping and President Trump, this is going to get a lot of attention. I don't expect a big breakthrough.</p><p>I mean maybe they keep talking going into 2019. But the President just -- and that hit didn't sound like he was ready for a deal.</p><p>He said the Chinese want to do a deal. He didn't say he's ready to do the one himself.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But that's yesterday and then there's today. So, maybe we'll get a tweet in the next 45 minutes that's incredibly optimistic. You just never know.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Keep watching. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Happy Thanksgiving, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care. Come back soon. Jon Hilsenrath, Wall Street Journal. Stay tuned, our special Black Friday market coverage on Fox Business.</p><p>Markets close at 1:00, we're here until 2:00.</p><p>And then coming up, border battle. President Trump threatening to shut down the entire U.S.-Mexico border if troops cannot get a handle on the migrants looking to cross into this country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dozens killed in a mosque blast in Afghanistan. Cheryl Casone has more details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Dagen. We're just getting some new details on this story.</p><p>Here's what we know. This was an explosion at a mosque in the Eastern Afghan Province of Coast.</p><p>The mosque was inside of an army base, this was evening prayers. At least 26 people are dead, 50 wounded. The victims, of course, had gathered there to pray.</p><p>No word on what caused that explosion, though. We're going to, of course, be updating this story throughout the morning for you.</p><p>Another headlines this morning, Black Friday shopping turning violent in an Alabama mall last night.</p><p>Police fatally shooting a suspected gunman who they say opened fire inside a mall crowded with shoppers. Two people, including a 12-year-old girl, were injured.</p><p>The gunshots sent shoppers scurrying for cover and several were seen with their guns drawn.</p><p>The gunfire started just before 10 p.m. at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover. That's about 10 miles from Birmingham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was crazy in every direction. And I just started praying and praying that God would give the police wisdom and accuracy of shot, protect the victims.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The suspect has not yet been identified.</p><p>Well, dozens were hurt after a charter bus overturned on an icy road in Washington State.</p><p>That bus was carrying the University of Washington Marching Band and it flipped on its side.</p><p>They were on their way to tonight's Apple Cup came against Washington State.</p><p>Nearly 40 of the 56 people onboard were injured, but none of those injuries, luckily, are serious.</p><p>Well, Nissan's Board voting unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn from his post.</p><p>The Japanese automaker claims Ghosn used company money to buy personal homes, including a condominium in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Nissan also says that Ghosn uses subsidiary in the Netherlands to make multiple payments totaling thousands of dollars to his older sister for consulting.</p><p>Shares of the company are down about 14 percent so far this year, Dagen.</p><p>And there is the year-to-date with chart. A lot of pressure and a lot of news coming out on Nissan as well.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. I'm reading \"The Wall Street Journal's\" story that the auto -- Nissan found that Carlos Ghosn used a subsidiary in the Netherlands, which Cher was talking about, to spend $18 million, buying, renovating personal homes.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It wasn't just a condo in Rio, but it was a home in Beirut that his sister received 60,000 commission for advising on the housing in Rio.</p><p>LI: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But found no evidence that the sister actually performed such work.</p><p>LI: And he underreported his $44 million in earnings as well according to these allegations in Japanese court.</p><p>And so, yes, Japan doesn't take this lightly, as I mentioned to you. It's a very insular domestic oriented economy. And when you're a foreign CEO heading up one of the largest companies in the country, you know, that doesn't look good for you, especially for a legacy.</p><p>Someone like Carlos Ghosn who's been -- his tenure has been over 10 years at the helm of Nissan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, they save Nissan -- he essentially saved Nissan from bankruptcy.</p><p>LI: Avoided, 2008. Yes.</p><p>BLOCK: That's -- then becomes a corporate rock star, and now this happens. Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well they wanted to -- independence, I guess. And now --</p><p>LI: But it took a while for them to actually kick him out because they needed Renault's support in order to oust him as chairman and they finally got it, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What happens to the alliance, guys?</p><p>LI: I think it stays in place because it's been intact for so long. It's been successful. I think they -- they're -- bringing in new people obviously, new blood to front the new entity.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So you don't have to be a rock star to actually know how to run a company or series of companies. I'll just point that out.</p><p>BLOCK: It's more --</p><p>LI: Maybe --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Boring is better sometimes.</p><p>LI: Maybe stars only shine so long, I think that's the lesson.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, that's right.</p><p>BLOCK: You're a rock star, and don't steal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, caravan crisis, more asylum seekers gaining ground near the U.S.-Mexico border, as President Trump threatens to shut it down entirely.</p><p>Plus subpoena sent, FBI Director James Comey urging for transparency, set to answer house judiciary questions over the Clinton email investigation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take a look at futures today. We've got a market that's down three percent or more so far this week. There -- Monday and Tuesday being horrible days in the stock market.</p><p>Now you have 124 point loss on the Dow Futures right now. We'll be looking into this, digging into this as the morning moves on.</p><p>Markets close today shortened trading session. Close at 1 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Moving on to the border showdown, President Trump threatening to shut down the United States border with Mexico if things cannot get under control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If we find that it's -- it gets to a level where we are going to lose control, or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You mean entire border of the country?</p><p>TRUMP: The whole border. I mean the whole border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This coming after reports that a small group separated from the major migrant caravan within 500 feet of the U.S. border yesterday.</p><p>Joining us now, \"Weekly Standard\" Deputy Editor Kelly Jane Torrance. What do you make of what the President was talking about there?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes. You know, it's really coming to a showdown, isn't it, Dagen? And I have mixed feelings.</p><p>I mean you don't want to close the border to people who do have real problems and who are seeking asylum, but at the same time, a lot of these people are coming specifically for a showdown.</p><p>And, you know, the President says talking about closing down border, but what he's not mentioning is actually the government knows about the caravan and has been preparing for it for months now.</p><p>And what's interesting is the administration is actually implementing what they call a Remain in Mexico plan, which is if you can show that you have worries for your life, you need to get out of Mexico, you will be let into the United States while your asylum claim is being processed.</p><p>But if you can't, you're going to actually wait in Mexico while that claim is being processed.</p><p>And, you know, President Trump has been complaining for a while about the, you know, what he calls the, you know, detainee program now, and complaining about people being released.</p><p>Well, if they're going to have to wait in Mexico, it might actually stop some people from coming to United States who think, \"Well, I can get here, I can get to the United States. And once they let me go, I can do what I want.\"</p><p>So there's a lot going on here that the President isn't talking about that's going on behind the scenes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Erin.</p><p>ELMORE: Yes. Hi, Kelly. Erin Elmore here. Good morning. We know that immigration is a huge issue for the Trump voter and the Trump base.</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes.</p><p>ELMORE: What do you think the right play is here? We know 9th Circuit is trying to control the situation, but what do you think the right play is? What do you tell the President to do?</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes, and, you know what, everyone's complaining about Donald Trump talking about the politicized core, but let's face it, you had --</p><p>Okay, so this is not the 9th Circuit, but it's the district court that things go to the 9th Circuit. The District Court of Northern California complained that the President cannot make immigration law and it stopped, you know, his recent laws.</p><p>But let's face it, that same court actually thought that it was okay for Obama, President Obama to make immigration law with DACA, with the, you know, the DREAM Act.</p><p>And so then it was like, \"Oh, it's okay for the president to say --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>TORRANCE: -- that we're going to have this DREAM Act in young people who are here. They had no problem with the President making immigration law then they have a problem with Donald Trump doing it.</p><p>So I mean, you know, you don't want to criticize courts too much, you want to let them do their job, but I think in this case, Donald Trump actually has a point.</p><p>And you say, you know, look at and it's like, \"Well, hey, we're -- Donald Trump can't make immigration law but Barack Obama can.\" He has a good point there.</p><p>ELMORE: So he's not relying on his own precedent, is what you're saying basically. And that's -- the beauty of courts is that their precedent shows you what they're going to likely do in the future.</p><p>And in this case, they're not relying on their own precedent and it is politics.</p><p>TORRANCE: Exactly. I mean I agree with the court, actually, that it's Congress who should be making immigration law.</p><p>But we -- of course we know that Congress has been trying since the George W. Bush years to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill and it's not going to happen.</p><p>Let's face it, it's just never going to happen and that's why presidents have been using executive orders to do things that they want and, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What -- well, I want to point out that one very well-known Democrat, Hillary Clinton, weighed in on immigration.</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Former Presidential candidate urging Europe to get a handle on the migrant crisis there.</p><p>This is in an interview with \"The Guardian.\"</p><p>Hillary Clinton said this, \"I admire the very generous and compassionate approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part and must send a very clear message.\"</p><p>\"We're not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support because we don't deal with the immigration issue. We'll continue to roil the body politic.\"</p><p>Your reaction to that. Again, it's -- she's talking about Europe, but why not the United States?</p><p>TORRANCE: Well -- and, of course, one of the reasons that Europe has this crisis is because Angela Merkel actually welcomed migrants to come to Germany.</p><p>People forget that the reason that you have this migrant crisis, one of the reasons, is that Angela Merkel said, \"Hey, you guys need asylum? Come here.\"</p><p>And, of course, people listen. But let's face it, why do we -- why does Europe have that migrant crisis? It's because of the war in Syria.</p><p>And, you know, honestly, if we got rid of the terrible regime in Iran, that's propping up Bashar al-Assad and making it impossible to live in Syria, for regular Syrians who are facing, you know, terrible situations, they wouldn't be doing that.</p><p>So, yes, let's look at the root causes of why people are leaving and I think -- no, that's one of the things that Donald Trump is tried -- sort of said is like, hey, we need to look at what's happening in Central America and maybe help people at the source, so they don't feel they need to leave.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She -- Hillary Clinton did say that you need to handle the immigration crisis if you want to stop the rise of right wing populist, in the region. But I'll point out.</p><p>Remember the mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany that were virtually not covered by the news media, here in the United States? In large part, because of this immigration crisis that Hillary Clinton is talking about and I think that was two years ago, maybe, just to point that out.</p><p>TORRANCE: It's not even just it wasn't covered here, it was actually not covered in Germany so much, because police in Cologne actually wouldn't -- didn't want people to know about what was happening because they didn't want people angry at the government that -- you know, welcome those people to come.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you Kelly Jane, Kelly Jane Torrance, this morning, Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>TORRANCE: Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, Black Friday madness. It's the biggest shopping day of the year. We'll see if retail stocks get a boost or even the overall market. And live action Lion King, a sneak peek at the latest trailer from Disney and all of the talent that comes along with it.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA, Black Friday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday, November 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. Black Friday is here. More than 164 million people are expected to go shopping this weekend, that, according to the National Retail Federation.</p><p>Checking out market actions this morning, Futures are pointing way, way lower, 126-point loss on the Dow Futures. Markets close at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time, today. But so far, in this shortened holiday week, the Dow, S&amp;P and NASDAQ are all down more than three percent. NASDAQ Composite down nearly four percent. That's the worst week in eight months, for the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe, markets have shown some mixed moves. So far, we have green across the screen, at the moment, slight gains in England, France and Germany, and in Asia overnight, markets moving lower. The Nikkei was closed for trading, but the Hang Seng, Shanghai and KOSPI in South Korea, all to the downside.</p><p>Crude awakening, we're watching oil prices amid oversupply concerns, we have a four percent loss on the cost of crude this morning, the cost of oil, at $52.32 a barrel.</p><p>Question for James Comey, the latest developments as the former FBI director is vowing to fight a subpoena he received from House Republicans before they pass the baton to the Democrats.</p><p>It's sky-high bid, the details as Virgin Atlantic reportedly discusses purchasing struggling budget airline, Flybe.

We will play this trailer over and over and over again.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, Futures are heading lower on the busiest shopping day of the year, joining us now, Payne Capital Management President, Ryan Payne. Can -- do investors need to see even better-than- expected sales, this weekend? Is that enough to turn this market around?</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Well, it wasn't earlier in the weeks, so we had, you know, a couple big new retailers report earnings on Tuesday. You know, you got Kohl's report, you got Target report, and they had great sales, and they sold off pretty unmercifully, I would say.</p><p>LI: But it's profit margins because people are thinking ahead, thinking when (INAUDIBLE) a bite, when do supply chains get too expensive and when do shoppers stop shopping when interest rates go up.</p><p>PAYNE: And I think that is a big one. I think everyone is worried, like, has the consumer peaked here? Is this as good as it going to get? And I think that's kind of been the overhang on the market. Like, do we really believe the economy is getting stronger? At some point here, it's all going to collapse.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, if you look at this, I want to stay on retail before we move on, but if you look at these retail stocks, the only of this major list of retail stocks that we follow, including Kohl'sNordstrom, Penney's, Macy's, you name it, the only one up, so far this month, is --</p><p>Well, you know, because I asked my (INAUDIBLE) about it. It's Fred's. Fred's is up on, but it's up 9-1/2 percent, but you've got an 18 percentage point loss, almost 19 percent, like Abercrombie and Fitch, these are deep, deep, deep losses for these retail stocks.</p><p>BLOCK: We were watching T.V. earlier about Black Friday, and there was a woman who was sitting at the mall and she was interviewed, and she said, yes, I was getting 60 to 70 percent off at Aeropostale. What does that mean for an Abercrombie? It's definitely difficult.</p><p>You know, one thing I'm looking at here is, earlier this year, we talk about wage costs, freight costs. Those are allegedly going to hit the retail. But what happened was, retailers were able to keep raising their prices and they actually turned out decent margins.</p><p>With the Kohl's and Target reports earlier this week, we saw, A, there is some concern about freight costs, both companies mentioned that, but also, B -- you know -- B, there's also -- there are some issues with the price. You know, what could save these stocks here? What could help them?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I think at this point (INAUDIBLE) as an overall lifted market, right? They also sold off just because a whole market there is capitulating in the short term, which I would argue it's probably a good buying opportunity because now, valuations are even more reasonable.</p><p>And, you know, our belief in Payne Capital Management is, you know, the retailer -- the retail investors are strong right now. Consumer is strong and it's going to continue to get stronger. So, as long as the consumers in good shape, I think it's going to be very good for those stocks, long term.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, that argument about, I can find some bargains now. People have been saying that about technology and big technology stocks, and you've continued to see a downdraft in all of these big names, and Apple, really, putting pressure on the market, specifically, earlier in the week.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, you live by a (INAUDIBLE) right? I mean, tech, has had a huge move up, and now we've seen this, you know, huge move down. So, at some point, I think you have to find some kind of ground here where the market says OK.</p><p>You know, valuations are reasonable. I mean, techs never going to get reasonable here. I mean, you're still trading at like, 20 times forward earnings, which is a premium to the market.</p><p>LI: It's a growth stock though. That's a growth sector. That's kind of how they're valued, aren't they? You know, we --</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>LI: We actually had Facebook, admitting, going into the holiday, later on Wednesday, that they did hire definers. That was -- they did that on purpose, so that we would miss the headlines on Thursday. But, they admitted to hiring definers, Sheryl Sandberg admitted to actually knowing that they hired this opposition research team.</p><p>So, what about Facebook, in particular? What about the reputational risk, regulatory risk priced in?</p><p>PAYNE: I (INAUDIBLE) priced in. We had a lot of panic already. And anecdotally, I work the retail investor. And invariably, the retail investor is always wrong. So, when they start to panic -- you know, I think, when they start to panic, you're starting to see some panic in here, that's actually very bullish for the markets.</p><p>You didn't see that before and we had a big selloff in the end of October, and we kind of hit those lows again, this past week. No, no one's really panicking, that always concerned me, but now you're starting to see a little bit of panic in there, which makes me think we're probably even closer to some kind of bottom in here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what -- you know what, I think our viewers, based on their comments on Twitter, are quite smart about the markets, when what's part -- a part of what's causing this downdraft, it's the smart money. It's the smart money getting put out of business because they have been so wrong. Talk about that.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes. Well, what's been going on, is Q3 was hard for one, the hedge funds, they've got whipsawed by a lot these, moves higher in the big tech stocks, and then, right when they -- right when they bought into that, it traded down. It was a rough October, rough November.</p><p>There's a lot of blood out there. There's a lot of liquidation. I'm reading about somebody's energy focus funds. There's an energy fund that's down 15.7 percent, month to date, right now, and around, so there's a lot going on.</p><p>Your clients, you do have -- you know, you claim retail investors aren't smart, but you know, of course, yours are the smartest, and what are they saying? Like, are they excited about the market? Are they apprehensive? What's your biggest concern right now?</p><p>PAYNE: When was the retail investor not smart? But they tend to be very emotional, right? And that emotional Litmus test. Then, you know, we can argue, is the smart money really that smart? Hedge funds have not done that well in the last couple of years.</p><p>Just the fact they're selling, they might not -- they might be indicative of making a bad decision as opposed to good decision.</p><p>BLOCK: They're Mike Tyson-smart. They're geniuses until they get punched in the face.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jonas Ferris used that very quote on Wednesday, by the way.</p><p>BLOCK: Great minds think alike.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So you were -- no, you were watching, is what --</p><p>BLOCK: Hi, Jonas.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I'm just kidding. Ryan Payne, good to see you.</p><p>PAYNE: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thanks so much. Stay tuned. Our special Black Friday on Fox Business, we're here until 2:00 p.m. Eastern. And coming up, he's urging for transparency, former FBI Director James Comey, issuing -- issued a subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee, over the Hillary Clinton E-mail scandal.</p><p>Plus, showdown on the links, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods set to duke it out today, in Vegas, with a $9 million purse.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Weird song. Virgin Atlantic reportedly in talks to by Flybe. Cheryl Casone has more. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's weird. All right, here's the news: Sky News says the Britain's Virgin Atlantic is going to acquire regional airline, Flybe. This comes a week after Flybe announced in talks to sell itself. Virgin Atlantic owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Delta Airlines. Flybe has got a market cap of about 27 million. Last month, Flybe has shared a proper warning, though; they said a weak demand and a weaker British Pounds. So, we'll see if Virgin Atlantic gets the deal.</p><p>Former FBI Director, James Comey says that Republicans have subpoenaed him to testify at a closed-door meeting of the House Judiciary Committee early next month. In a Thanksgiving Day tweet, Comey says, that he would be happy to answer the committee's questions but would resist doing it behind closed doors for that his testimony will be leaked and distorted. The subpoena part of a congressional inquiry into allegations of anti-Trump bias that led to the opening of the Russia investigation.</p><p>Well, the head-to-head matchup between two of the biggest names in golf takes place today. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson is going to hit the links in Las Vegas, the much-hyped $9 million winner take all match. Organizers are hoping to recoup the money from fans willing to pay $19.99 for pay-per-view. Woods and Mickelson are also putting up their own cash and side bets that eventually, of course, is all going to charity. Teatime is set for 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Dagen, place your bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, a Disney classic reborn. The first trailer for the live-action \"Lion King\" wowing people; it basically broke the Internet yesterday. Coming up, stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ralph, what is wrong you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Start churning butter and put on your church shoes little sister because we're about to blast off.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ralph, what is it you're trying to say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to the Internet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was a clip from the new animated film \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\"; the sequel to Disney's \"Wreck It Ralph,\" it premiers on Wednesday. Joining me now: \"IN THE FOX LIGHT\" Host, Michael Tammero.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The microphone is off?</p><p>MCDOWELL: What is your take on \"Ralph Breaks the Internet,\" is he going to break the box office?</p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR MARKETING: It's going to break all sorts of records this weekend, looking probably about $100 million. You know, this is a big weekend for the box office every year; and so far, box office is up over 10 percent this year over last year, with an -- attendance is up which is even a bigger story right now. It's not just, you know, the fact that tickets are more expensive, but attendance is up about seven percent so far this year. And this weekend, looks to push those numbers even higher. The Ralph, critics are loving him and audiences are loving him as well and it about A- cinema score.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What else is opening this weekend or is in competition --</p><p>TAMMERO: We have \"Creed 2,\" follow up to the big 2016 hit, Michael B. Jordan -- what a year this guy has had. He started the year with \"Black Panther\" which grossed over $700 million. \"Creed 2\" is getting also sorts of critical acclaim; and who knows it could push him to an Oscar coming down, an award season, you just never know with these things.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right, so what broke yesterday, can we just watch it?</p><p>TAMMERO: Oh, my God, yes!</p><p>MCDOWELL: \"The Lion King\" live-action trailer, the very first one. Roll it. Do we have it?</p><p>TAMMERO: Or not?</p><p>MCDOWELL: There we go.</p><p>TAMMERO: Oh my god.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's not all of it. I'm just going to sit here (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>TAMMERO: Over and over again. Look, this formula has been really successful for Disney: Bringing these animated movies to live-action movies. A lot of -- how is this going to look? This broke yesterday. People are going nuts. I was driving home watching it from mother-in-law and I said, oh my god, this look so good. And my husband was like, enough with \"The Lion King.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, no, no.</p><p>TAMMERO: We've seen the Broadway show ten times, the movie, but guess what? Guess who was watching it last night and all of a sudden oh my god, this looks incredible. I'm like, see?</p><p>MCDOWELL: You caught your husband when you were in the other room watching the trailer on his phone.</p><p>TAMMERO: Sold. He is sold, Jon Favreau is directing, Beyonce plays Nala, Donald Glover is in this -- Darth Vader, I can't think of his name -- James Earl Jones is in this as well plays Mufasa.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I actually -- because I'm such a nerd as Adam Driver but it wasn't Adam Driver. But it's -- the James Earl Jones does the voiceover for the film.</p><p>TAMMERO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What is it about? Is it this movie? I know that they've really brought back some iconic Disney films through this new live-action technology but there's something about \"The Lion King:\" It's the music and it's the story and the fact that it had life as an animated film and then as a Broadway show -- which so many people have seen.</p><p>TAMMERO: It's a great story and the music is fantastic. This is going to have a whole remade score from Hans Zimmer, that we'd get to look forward to. And it's also -- it's the way they do these movies now; it's so incredible. When you think about the motion capture and the CGI tech -- watching this last night, I kept thinking: Wow, animation is no longer the only execution to create a world; now it's just going to be a style of execution. When you can do things like this, you really don't need to know the animation, this looks real.</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE), from \"Swingers.\" What an incredible -- but what an amazing career as a director when a lot of people just thought he would just be an actor.</p><p>TAMMERO: He's responsible for Disney's \"The Jungle Book\" which made hundreds of dollars last year at the box office. I cannot wait.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It looks --</p><p>TAMMERO: 2019 cannot come soon enough.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But now, Jon Favreau, you have to deliver. It has to be as good as the trailer. It better be better than the trailer. Happy Thanksgiving. Loved your whole family; loved your husband, Michael Tammero.</p><p>TAMMERO: Happy Thanksgiving. Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, everybody, still ahead, it's the busiest shopping day of the year and we're just getting started, the best Black Friday deals more on the markets next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday, November 23rd.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I'm Renee Montagne.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite some ups and downs, the stock market had a good year in 2010. To find out why and what it portends for the economy, we turn to Dave Wessel now. He's economics editor of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning.</p><p>Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Economics Editor, The Wall Street Journal): Good morning, Renee.</p><p>MONTAGNE: David, how good was this year for stocks?</p><p>Mr. WESSEL: Well, it was pretty good. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 11 percent in 2010, on top of a 15 percent rise in 2009. It's basically put the stock market, more than two years after the disaster of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008, its back to where it was before we had that calamity.</p><p>We have this great chart in The Wall Street Journal today, that shows that nearly all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 were down in 2008, 425 of them were up in 2009, 392 were up this year. And the same is true in most of the foreign stock markets - Germany, Canada, Britain.</p><p>It seems that investors think that, well, corporate profits are doing pretty well and investors have decided that the worst is behind us - that the risk of a double dip recession has faded. Capital gains taxes are not going to go up in the U.S. next year, as some had feared. And they seem to think the economy will get better - maybe slowly - but will get better from here.</p><p>MONTAGNE: Which sounds like good times are coming, but how good a predictor is the stock market for the rest of the economy?</p><p>Mr. WESSEL: Not great. The late economist, Paul Samuelson, once joked that the stock market predicted nine out of the last five recessions. If there's some bad news on the economy, some surprise in oil markets or tension in the Middle East, or in North Korea or something, the stock market could dive again.</p><p>But it does suggest some optimism, that, about the durability of the economic recovery. And there's one thing that really does matter: higher stock prices mean that people have more money - at least the ones who own stocks.</p><p>The value of the stock market, of the whole stock market, is up about $2 trillion over the year. Now, even though most people's assets are in houses in America - and house prices are not going up - still, there's more money in the stock market than there is in the housing market. And so, the more money people have and the better businessmen feel about the stock market, the more likely they are to spend.</p><p>MONTAGNE: Give us a little scorecard. Which industries and stocks did best this year, and which ones lagged?</p><p>Mr. WESSEL: Well, as I said, most did better. Commodity prices are up a lot and that help the shares of companies that produce them, or help produce them. Caterpillar had a great year, the equipment maker. DuPont, which makes chemicals and sells agricultural seeds, was up roughly 50 percent. In general, smaller companies did better than big ones.</p><p>As consumers began to spend again, companies that sell to them had a good year in the stock market: Ford, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Amazon, Apple was up 50 percent, Netflix was up 227 percent.</p><p>And one of the biggest winners of all, ironically, was AIG - the insurance company that was bailed out by the government - its shares nearly doubled in 2010, although they're still not worth anything like they were before the crisis.</p><p>On the down side, some of the big tech companies, Hewlett Packard and Cisco had lousy years. And so did a number of companies that got in trouble with the government, shares of for-profit trade schools, for instance. And Johnson and Johnson, the medical products maker, they had some regulatory issues and they were down for the year, as well.</p><p>MONTAGNE: But very briefly, David, unemployment is close to 10 percent still. I mean back to that question of the economy and the stock market. How can companies prosper when their customers aren't?</p><p>Mr. WESSEL: That's a good question. The first thing is they can't for long. The second is that those people who have money are spending. The third thing is that companies are getting a lot of productivity out of their existing workers, which means they're making more profit out of each worker.</p><p>And finally, nearly half the revenue of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, come not from selling to Americans but to selling from abroad. And a number of foreign economies, particularly in Asia, are doing quite well.</p><p>MONTAGNE: David, thanks very much and a happy New Year to you.</p><p>Mr. WESSEL: You're welcome, Renee, and happy New Year to you.</p><p>MONTAGNE: David Wessel is economics editor of The Wall Street Journal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201012311100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51V6-HGK1-DY2S-N0YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition (NPR)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>December 31, 2010 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002HGB</classCode><className>LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00096KO</classCode><className>HOUSING MARKET</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CZTI</classCode><className>STOCK PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X0S</classCode><className>ECONOMIC RECOVERY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000971E</classCode><className>PRICE INCREASES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000254</classCode><className>CAPITAL GAINS TAX</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODI3M0UzQTkzQ0I2NDg2RjlBMjk3QjQyNzhCRjVBRjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REYxOUQ3RkNDNEJBNEMzNEI4RUZEMjYzQTNCRDNEOEE</classCode><className>Capital Gains &amp;

All three had been much lower in the last hour of trading.</p><p>\"There's a number of different factors affecting the markets,\" said Sarat Sethi, a portfolio manager at Douglas C. Lane &amp; Associates. \"We're getting near the end of the year and with the S&amp;P 500 up around 20 percent, there's a lot of portfolio pruning going on, with people taking profits, or choosing to sell for tax purposes.\"</p><p>The weakness of the dollar and the Dow's struggle to break though and hold above the 10,000 level added to the choppy trade, Sethi said.</p><p>Of Thursday's most market-moving economic news, November retail sales are expected to show a gain of 0.7 percent after showing a decline of 0.3 percent last month. Sales excluding autos are expected to show a gain of 0.3 percent after rising 0.2 percent last month.</p><p>Weekly jobless claims are expected to have fallen to 359,000 last week from 365,000 the previous week. Both reports are due before the start of trading.</p><p>Thursday morning's pre-market earnings report from telecom networking company Ciena could be of interest. The company is forecast to have lost nine cents per share, after losing 15 cents per share a year earlier, according to First Call estimates.</p><p>Stocks sold off Tuesday after the Dow crossed 10,000 for the first time in 18 months, and in response to the latest Fed comments on the economy accompanying the most recent policy decision.</p><p>The central bank kept interest rates steady, as had been expected, and kept the \"considerable period\" phrase of its statement intact, but surprised investors by saying that the risks of inflation and deflation were almost equal. Some investors took this to be a way of preparing the market for a future short-term rate hike and used it as an excuse to take profits.</p><p>Twice during Tuesday's session, the Dow briefly crossed 10,000, a key psychological barrier, before retreating. Last week the Nasdaq crossed 2,000, its own key level, intraday, before backing off.</p><p>\"The Dow tried twice yesterday to get past 10,000 and failed, but I think it's really just a matter of time,\" said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Global Partners Securities. \"We could see that happen by the end of the year.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>The movers</p><p>Telecom gear maker Lucent Technologies said in a regulatory filing that its backlog of orders rose 16 percent from last year. However, with the stock up 132 percent this year, as of Tuesday's close, investors used the good news as an opportunity to take profits. Shares dropped 4.4 percent and topped the NYSE's most-active list.</p><p>Shares of Washington Mutual continued to slide in active NYSE trade one session after the bank warned that its 2003 and 2004 earnings would come in lower than expected. The company also said it had cut 4,500 jobs since August due to smaller demand for mortgage loans.</p><p>Adding to the industry's woes, data showed that Americans filed the smallest number of new mortgage requests in almost a year-and-a-half. The news also pressured homebuilder stocks.</p><p>Verizon Communications said late Tuesday that it will record approximately $3.7 billion in charges during the current quarter and first quarter of 2004, due to severance payments to cover an early retirement plan and pension settlements.</p><p>Dow component SBC Communications said late Tuesday that it would cut around 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in the fourth quarter as a means of cutting costs in response to its declining revenue.</p><p>Shares of the two companies both gained around 2.5 percent following their news. Verizon and SBC are two of the worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks of the year, down more than 11 percent and almost 16 percent, respectively.</p><p>\"We are seeing a continuation of this rotation process, with people selling some of the big tech and other gainers of the year, and putting money in sectors that still have room to gain, namely, industrials, metals, anything commodity-related,\" Global Partners Securities' Cardillo added.</p><p>Market breadth was negative, with almost five stocks falling for every three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.40 billion shares changed hands, and by nearly two to one on the Nasdaq, where 1.93 billion shares traded.</p><p>Treasury prices rose. The 10-year note rose 10/32 of a point in price, taking its yield to 4.31 percent, down from 4.35 percent late Tuesday. The dollar rallied sharply versus the yen, due to the Japanese government's intervention to stop the fall of the greenback. The U.S. currency was marginally lower versus the euro.</p><p>Douglas C. Lane's Sethi said that if the dollar's decline is small and steady, the market can withstand it, but that if there is suddenly a big drop, that would have a pronounced negative effect. He said that barring such an occurrence or any big international event, the market is likely to close out the year a few percentage points higher than where it is now.</p><p>NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures gained 12 cents to settle at $31.88 a barrel. COMEX gold fell $1.90 to settle at $407 an ounce.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source

Stocks slip on recovery fears and political risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Disney delays. No big movie releases now until 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And California dreaming? The Governor calls for all cars to be zero emissions by 2035.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Thursday. Let's make a move.</p><p>A warm welcome as always to FIRST MOVE. Coming up on the show today, we are showcasing the role of science and technology in helping improve lives.</p><p>Queen Maxima of the Netherlands will join us to discuss how the United Nations is working with both the public and the private sector to foster greater financial inclusion around the world.</p><p>Plus, I will be speaking to the CEO of the scientific data analytics firms Airfinity, a firm that tracks and compares standards in the global vaccine race. Those standards, of course, so important.</p><p>But first, as always, U.S. futures, turning sharply lower in the past hour, a continuation of Wednesday's stock market pullback. That set the mood, I think across the Asia session overnight. You can see it, Hong Kong falling to four-month lows. Tech once again led us lower. Apple, Amazon and Netflix among the hardest hit. Tesla, in fact, as you can see there, tumbling more than 10 percent.</p><p>All are under pressure once again premarket. The S&amp;P approaching correction territory, so what do we mean by that? We are near a 10 percent pullback from recent highs. There is no shortage of reasons either.</p><p>High stock market valuations, concerns about a second wave of COVID infections, U.S. election uncertainty, too, and of course fading hopes here in the United States, at least, of more financial support, despite pleas from several policy Fed makers yesterday.</p><p>In that vein, Goldman Sachs today slashing its fourth quarter U.S. growth forecast in half, now expecting just a three percent annualized GDP growth number for the fourth quarter as a result.</p><p>All of this, amid word that a greater than expected 870,000 people signed up for first-time benefits last week in the United States. More than 26 million people still getting some form of government support.</p><p>As a result, what about the U.K.? Well, today announcing sweeping new measures to support workers, and more support is needed here and elsewhere, too.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers. Christine Romans joins us now. Christine, the U.K. may have made a decision, but the United States simply can't, despite the pleas from Federal Reserve policy makers this week. It was actually Richard Clarida that coined it best, I think. He said the recovery is happening robustly, but we are still in a deep hole, and that's the key.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: And can you continue to have that recovery continue when you have so many people every week filing for first-time unemployment benefits.</p><p>When you add to that devastating 870,000 first-time unemployment benefits, the people -- the self-employed people filing under pandemic insurance, you have got 1.5 million people for the very first time going to their state unemployment office or the unemployment office and asking for help. That is a real problem when you are trying to sustain a recovery here. So I am worried about the jobs part of the recovery.</p><p>You also have Congress that is going to be heading home until after the election without pandemic relief, without those shock absorbers so many of these families need.</p><p>So we have heard from the Fed, we have heard from industries, like airlines, small business, hotel, anything related to travel, they are asking for help, saying their industries are being devastated.</p><p>Millions of families who need help paying the bills and avoiding eviction, and still some talk that the recovery is under way, but fragile. It is a kind of a dangerous moment here. Throw in political uncertainty in Washington, and it is a little nerve-racking to be frank.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's throw that in then, because there are confusion and concerns about how long it takes to work out who the next President is going to be and then President Trump last night throwing a level of confusion in the mix by seemingly refusing to hand over power. Just listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to have to see what happens, you know that. I have been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster --</p><p>QUESTION: But people are rioting. Do you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful transferal of power?</p><p>TRUMP: No, we want to -- we want to -- you get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very trans -- we will have a very peaceful -- there won't be a transfer frankly. There will be a continuation.</p><p>The ballots are out of control. You know it and you know who knows it better than anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:05:20]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: This is unprecedented. Markets we know and we discuss on a regular basis don't like uncertainty. I think there is a real nervousness everywhere, outside of markets and beyond about what the next two, three, four months are going to bring.</p><p>ROMANS: We know that there could not be -- potentially there might not be a decision on Election Night. We have seen that before over periods of history. You are not guaranteed to know who the new President will be on Election Night. It could take some time.</p><p>We have a lot of people who are afraid of going to cast their ballot on Election Day because of the pandemic, and that's a justifiable fear depending where you live.</p><p>There are concerns about how rocky the process could be in some states. I will say it, CNN.com, we have an entire voter how-to guide for where you live and what the process is where you live. So people need to really do their homework and figure out how to cast their ballot.</p><p>But a President casting doubt on the trust of the system and the validity of the process is the bedrock of American democracy is just unheard of.</p><p>I will say, back in 2000, there was a contested election, you'll remember. Markets handled it okay, but you had two leaders who were very careful in their words, two candidates, I should say, who were very careful in their words, and there was trust, I think, in the process eventually that the Supreme Court would get to a decision and it was accepted and there was a peaceful transfer of power.</p><p>But to not commit to a peaceful transfer of power is certainly something that on Wall Street, everyone is scratching their heads trying to figure out what would that look like for business, for how the country runs and for investors.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And in a pandemic. I read, I think it was an eight percent decline in 2000 over the unresolved election. But you make some great points. I mean, we do an eight percent pullback in a few days in these markets, but --</p><p>ROMANS: Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, plenty of uncertainty. Christine Romans, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Disney leaving the film industry on a cliff hanger. The entertainment titan pushing back the release of a whole slate of movies into 2021. Paul La Monica -- get my words out -- joins us now. Paul, great to have you with us.</p><p>It says a couple of things to me, one about the ability during a pandemic to bring people back into cinemas and two, perhaps, a decision over how potent putting these releases on Disney Plus is. Let's talk about the first.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I think that when you look at Disney's decision, I think Disney was probably watching like the rest of the industry very closely what was happening with \"Tenet,\" the Warner Brothers movie -- our parent company owns that studio -- to see how it would do.</p><p>And I think because there has been some concerns whether or not people are really willing to go back to movie theaters just yet, you saw Warner Brothers already delay \"Wonder Woman 1984,\" a highly anticipated movie in its DC franchise from October of this year to Christmas, and I think that's really kind of set the stage for Disney to say, you know what, we aren't so sure even about November, and we don't want to probably put \"Black Widow\" up against \"Wonder Woman.\" So we are going to move that all the way into May, which is kind of the traditional start of the summer movie season anyway, and hopefully, by next summer, things might be more normal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, next summer is a long time for some of these movie companies, some of these cinemas to hang on in there, quite frankly, and you saw that stock reaction yesterday where they all tumbled.</p><p>What does it also say though about Disney Plus, particularly in light of \"Mulan\"? We know it was a controversial movie. But we did see downloads. How is that done and can we tell anything about this decision from what we saw with \"Mulan\"?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think really, what it comes down to with \"Mulan\" is that Disney had been steadfast from the beginning saying that this was a one- time thing. Don't expect other highly anticipated theatrical releases to shift to Disney Plus especially because you have people wondering will people really want to spend $30.00 to rent a movie, especially if it was going to be on Disney Plus in a couple of months after that for free.</p><p>But even though Disney have been saying it wasn't going to make \"Black Widow\" and other movies in its slate on Disney Plus the way it did with \"Mulan,\" I think people still were hopeful because, quite frankly, I want to see \"Black Widow.\" I don't want to necessarily go to a movie theater to see it any time soon, but I probably would rent it on Disney Plus, and I think a lot of other people felt the same way.</p><p>But with Disney, \"Black Widow\" is the next phase of the highly anticipated Marvel cinematic universe, where that franchise is heading, and I think that you know, even though \"Mulan\" is a well-regarded movie based on a beloved animated classic, it's not really in the same league, so to speak, as Marvel and that franchise with all of those super heroes, so I can understand why Disney wants to keep \"Black Widow\" as a theatrical event if they can do that hopefully in May of 2021.</p><p>[09:10:26]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. We are not making the same comparison, and quite frankly, we are watching a lot more TV during the pandemic than we ever have before, so we were allowed to be hopeful. And now, it has been vanquished.</p><p>Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>Protests overnight in cities across the United States over the death of Breonna Taylor. The Kentucky Attorney General announced no murder charges for any of the police officers involved in her killing in March. It is sparking outrage from her family and demonstrations demanding justice.

Mob justice is not justice.</p><p>Breonna Taylor's death has become a part of a national story and conversation, but we must also remember the facts and the collection of evidence in this case are different than cases elsewhere in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GINGRAS (voice over): The Kentucky Attorney General says Mattingly and Cosgrove identified themselves before breaking down Taylor's door.</p><p>Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was there with her that night disputes that claim saying he fired a warning shot because police did not identify themselves.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNETH WALKER, BREONNA TAYLOR'S BOYFRIEND: They refused to answer when we yelled, \"Who is it?\" Fifteen minutes later, Breonna was dead from a hail of police gunfire.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GINGRAS (voice over): The Attorney General says an F.B.I. analysis that show Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Taylor, but a state investigation was inconclusive on that point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMERON: Because our investigation showed and the grand jury agreed that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their return of deadly fire after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GINGRAS (voice over): Mattingly's attorney writing in a statement, \"The system worked,\" adding, \"These officers did not act in a reckless or unprofessional matter.\"</p><p>But for Taylor's family, their attorney say it is difficult to make sense of the ruling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LONITA BAKER, ATTORNEY FOR BREONNA TAYLOR'S FAMILY: They are upset, justifiably, and we are upset and outraged at the decision that was made.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Brynn joins us now from Louisville, Kentucky. Brynn, great to have you with us. Facts, justice, evidence. But clearly, people aren't happy here. What next?</p><p>GINGRAS: Well, what's next is probably, Julia, another night of protests. We are here at Jefferson Square Park where the protest usually begin. This is the Memorial that has been set up for months now. There is still a curfew in this city today and tomorrow night at least.</p><p>And as far as the investigation, well, people still want answers. That's why they are protesting. And it is possible there may be more that comes to light.</p><p>We know that there is a civil suit that has been filed by Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. The attorney hopes there will be some evidence and some information to come out of those proceedings as that makes its way through the courts.</p><p>And then, of course, as we mentioned in the piece, Kentucky's Governor has said that he wants the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings to be released if they do not conflict with the ongoing criminal case.</p><p>So we will see if that actually happens, although it doesn't seem like it will according to the A.G.'s news conference yesterday, and then separately from that, there is an F.B.I. investigation and an internal investigation at Louisville PD.</p><p>So, we will see what comes out of Louisville in the coming months, maybe even years. But I can tell you that on the ground, we know the people here, they are emotional. They are raw.</p><p>You saw the shootings of the two officers, and it is going to be a long time before this place can heal, if it ever does -- Julia.</p><p>[09:15:18]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it is not over, by any means. Brynn, great to have you with us. Thank you for that. Brynn Gingras there.</p><p>All right, still to come on FIRST MOVE, how Fintech could help the world's poorest people weather the pandemic. We are joined by the Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, special advocate on behalf of the U.N.'s Secretary General.</p><p>And clarity on the COVID vaccine. With every day, bringing you updates on trials and timelines, we will get data analysis. What we know and what we don't. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. The economic consequences of the pandemic has been felt all over the world presenting huge challenges for millions, but especially the most vulnerable in society, and those without access to the technologies that can help.</p><p>Her Majesty, Queen Maxima of the Netherland has been then U.N. Secretary General's Special Adviser on Financial Inclusion for Development since 2009. Her work has taken her to Ethiopia, Myanmar, Pakistan, South Africa among other places. And the good news is, huge progress has been made.</p><p>Since 2011, the number of people with a financial account has grown by again by 1.2 billion people. And yet, there are still 1.7 billion with no access to a traditional form of banking.</p><p>Her Majesty, Queen Maxima joins us now. Your Majesty, fantastic to have you on the show. We have spelled out the progress, but also the challenges. Could you just give us a sense of what you understand by financial inclusion and the benefits?</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA OF THE NETHERLAND, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL'S SPECIAL ADVOCATE: Well, thank you very much for having me today. Yes, financial inclusion is something we have been working on more than ten years and we have actually seen a number of progress.</p><p>It looks like a railroad or looks like a road. It is the infrastructure that a country needs to have to be able to include everybody in an economic system. It is the opportunity the make payments in a very cheap and efficient way.</p><p>[09:20:18]</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: It is a way to actually -- savings in a former way for a rainy day or to invest in your children's education. To be able to insure yourself against risks, maybe health problems, maybe an accident. But above all, also, to be able to invest in opportunities and generate income.</p><p>So we have actually been working very hard with many countries having more than 50 countries around the globe having had our strategies for financial inclusion and the financial technology is playing a very important role.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, its advantages and tools that many of us, not all of us, I will admit, but many of us in the developed world simply take for granted.</p><p>If we look at what happened in light of COVID-19, a shift to digitization and those of us that could make digital payments did so. Others were left in incredibly vulnerable situations and circumstances. What have you seen? And who are the most vulnerable?</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: Well, certainly, what started as a health crisis ended up very quickly in an economic crisis and a social crisis, and certainly, in emerging countries, there is an issue of formality.</p><p>The people that work in the informal sector are extremely vulnerable because they do not have access to the formal things we all have and take for granted like you just said.</p><p>And also, they don't have access to government safety nets. They don't have access to formal insurance services. And also, within that, daily wages, for example, were the first ones to lose their jobs. Within that, the groups that have actually suffered the most, certainly are women. They really have taken the big -- most amount of the burden on this issue. Small and medium-sized enterprises, and of course, all of those farmers and rural people.</p><p>What we have actually seen in terms of SMEs is of course, they had to be shut down. Supply chains were actually disturbed, and we know from a survey that two-thirds of SMEs around the world have actually seen a decrease in their sales, some of them to nearly 80 percent.</p><p>That meant that one-third of them had to reduce work force, which actually ends up in unemployment across the board.</p><p>In the case of women, this is even worse. You know, women that actually -- they have to have their own business to be able to survive. We know in Sub Sahara Africa for example, 60 percent of women-owned businesses have seen a complete loss of their income, three times more loss of income than men.</p><p>So this is something we have to look into a lot more and the issue with women as well is because they are 25 percent less likely to own a phone or have access to internet, they cannot really turn their businesses very quickly into a digital option having more access to markets or be able to sell without contact. So they have actually suffered a lot more.</p><p>So these issues have been something we have been seeing across the board. And certainly, that's where our governments have actually jumped in to make a lot of social payments and programs to, you know, being able to balance these problems.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, that's just an astonishing statistic. Women 25 percent less likely to own a phone or have internet access. I think that brings it home to all of us in many ways.</p><p>There are positive cases, though, and I do want to talk about this, for a country that had some kind of platform or plan for promoting financial inclusion, and that's Pakistan, and how they handled what happened during COVID-19. Can you just explain what you saw there?</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: Well, the issue is, you know, as you very well know, technology plays a very important part in financial inclusion. Today, you can actually receive a payment on your mobile phone. And you can actually exchange that for money in your local merchant.</p><p>You can actually save through it. You can actually get a credit, you know, with the amount of transactions you do, even if you do not have an asset as collateral. So these are actually extraordinary advancements.</p><p>Now, a country has to be able to allow to do that. They have to be able to allow innovation. It has to be safe, and it has to be able for everybody, so connectivity, and having a smart phone or even having a phone is extremely important.</p><p>Like I said before, 50 countries have been working very hard on the financial inclusion structures, one of them being Pakistan. They have had invested a lot in a robust ID system, identification system. Plus, they have actually changed the regulations and actually made it possible for people to receive money in their digital wallets in their phones.</p><p>So, since the start of the COVID pandemic, they have actually been very fast in actually turning all the social programs into this digital payment. And it actually reached 17 million people, so which is actually incredible. They haven't been able to do that before.</p><p>[09:25:18]</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: But also other countries. Even Togo has had a fantastic mechanism to actually give social payments to people, which 500,000 or more people have actually received it digitally, but also countries like South Africa have actually done the same.</p><p>So we have actually seen other countries that have been investing in digital financial inclusion and have been able to very quickly give emergency payments to the most vulnerable in their communities.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. I mean we have spoken to many of these Fintech players, these start-ups all over the world, PayTM in India, Paga in Nigeria, and the private sector's understanding trying to get these people access to financial tools, it is whether the government and regulators sort of understand that and they are all working together.</p><p>Surely, this is the critical piece here, it's everybody understanding it is a collaborative effort.</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: Absolutely, and there is a role for everybody to have. We call them a set of public goods. You have to have connectivity.</p><p>If only the urban areas have connectivity, have a phone and the rural areas do not have any, I mean, it is -- talking about mobile money accessible for all is just something that is not possible, right?</p><p>So, you know, the telecom companies together with the government have to work together to make connectivity really a reality for everybody, and for women. How do we actually get cheap handhelds for women? You know, having us market for a woman is not a luxury item anymore. It is like this -- it is like, you know, having fair competition, being able to have systems that are interruptible so the customers can actually have freedom of choice of one system to the other with better prices and better options for them to have.</p><p>So, all of these issues need to be done from the regulatory perspective from the government side also and in corporation and private sector because they also have to come up with their products that are right for people because there is no use to have a bank account and they cannot really assess the needs of women in the rural areas that they really -- she really needs to have very small short-term credit just in case she had illiquid moments.</p><p>Or you know, very much for the things -- products that incentivize her to save at the moment when she doesn't have to pay school fees. But when she has to pay school fees that she can actually disburse it.</p><p>So being mindful about people's needs and developing those products is also part of the private sector's role. So the cooperation between the public and private sectors is really essentially.</p><p>I have a story to make. We have a group of CEOs of cross sector companies from consumer goods to technology to telecom to banking and what we have been doing is actually having them work together in certain markets to really digitize all the merchants in a given region so that all of these mom and pop shops can actually receive mobile payments, they can actually - - also to the suppliers, but also to the customers.</p><p>And with that, they have actually much more access to credit and to insurance, and you see that the whole supply chain starts elevating itself in terms of quality.</p><p>These types of cooperation, not only with the public sector but also the private sector among themselves is extremely important.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It actually gives me goosebumps hearing it. The idea that you tailor the products to the individual and then, it is not just about giving them financial access, it is actually about giving them access to products they can use. It is so important.</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What we've seen in COVID has accelerated digitization, the focus, it has emphasized the need. Just in terms of your work going forward, and the U.N.'s work, what's the plan now? How do we use this moment, harness this moment to accelerate the progress you have made?</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: You know, funny enough, 10 years ago, we had to make the case why financial inclusion and why technology was so important. I don't think I have to do that anymore.</p><p>The issue is now the how. It is to really help countries really scale up and really make this a reality and really getting the cooperation between the public and the private sector going, and sometimes it takes a little bit of figuring out how the supply chains work.</p><p>For example, in the farming sectors, you know in the rural sectors, what happens with merchants? How can we improve that side? How do we cater a lot more for women? I think there is a lot more work that need to be done on the women needs on why do women use things and why they don't? Why -- how can we actually make it a lot more incentivized for them to save and take better credits and inform them better?</p><p>I think there is a lot of things we have to learn also to actually cater this probably better for women. And in terms of its needs, I feel digitization will be extremely important thing that we should be focusing on, definitely.</p><p>[09:30:19]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. I'm enthused. I can see you are enthused. Hopefully everyone else watching will feel the same after this.</p><p>Your Majesty, fantastic to chat with you. Thank you so much. I hope you come back soon. Thank you once again.</p><p>QUEEN MAXIMA: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Queen Maxima of the Netherlands there, the United Nations Secretary General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.</p><p>FIRST MOVE continues after the break. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. That was the opening bell, and as expected, we have a lower open for U.S. stocks with the greatest losses once again coming in the tech sector. We are off by around six-tenths of one percent.</p><p>Stocks falling as the U.S. records a greater than expected jump in jobless claims last week, a rise in fact of 870,000 claims. We have also got the S&amp;P 500 flirting with correction levels once again.</p><p>The dollar has been a big beneficiary in fact of September's market volatility ticking higher once again today. We are currently trading near a two and a half month high. That's putting some pressure on gold prices which have fallen below that psychological level of $1,900.00 an ounce and we are off again some five-tenths of one percent.</p><p>In the meantime, significant action from the Turkish Central Bank raising interest rates by two percentage points. That is to help curb inflation and has triggered a rally in the lira.</p><p>As you can see, the dollar lower there, the Turkish lira actually higher at this moment by some seven-tenths of one percent.</p><p>Now, tech stocks may have had a great run since the March lows, but my next guest says trouble is brewing. A study conducted by Deutsche Bank revealing that in the United States, anger towards Big Tech is building, as is a huge digital racial gap.</p><p>The predicted consequences are pretty terrifying. Here's just one. The study says the majority of black and Hispanic-Americans could be shut out of 86 percent of jobs in America by 2045, that's just one generation.</p><p>Apjit Walia is the Global Head of Technology Investment Strategy at Deutsche Bank and he joins me now. Sir, terrifying study. Fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>[09:35:39]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I just want to start by asking you, when you talk to your clients of Deutsche Bank and you say, look, I'm really worried about the tech sector, how much pushback at this moment do you get?</p><p>APJIT WALIA, GLOBAL HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT STRATEGY, DEUTSCHE BANK: Yes, good to be here, Julia. So right about since September 2nd, a few weeks ago, a study was looking at society and tech, obviously very different indication in both and we talked about tech.</p><p>The most salient point in tech we found in that study was that two out of three Americans are unhappy with Big Tech. I think there was a lot of anger towards China earlier in the year and we felt a lot of people's sentiment is going towards tech given what is happening with privacy, given what's happening with antitrust.</p><p>As we head into the elections and beyond, we believe a lot of the scrutiny in tech continues and you are obviously seeing that. Most of the sentiment, I believe when we talked about it, there was pushback on tech itself. It felt people maybe data is going to start to improve, but we have seen, I guess, in the last couple of weeks the action -- the price action -- there has been a lot of negativity towards Big Tech and stock have actually underperformed. And we believe, until elections, this will continue.</p><p>Our view is, no matter what happens in November, Big Tech is going to be looked at from very different areas in terms of what can we do to improve it to find ways to make, I guess the e-commerce curve has come forward so fast that it found ways to make society equal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it is interesting, isn't it? Because we have seen tech stocks rise a dramatic amount since the lows back in March. We are talking about a bit of a pullback here, but it is minor relative to the gains that we have had.</p><p>So when you turn around you say actually, two-thirds of consumers in the United States are really angry with big tech, you can understand why people are going, what are you talking about?</p><p>WALIA: Absolutely, because what is happened is, you know, the tech itself had sucked our productivity from the bottom half, from people not scaled and essentially has pulled it towards the top half or the top five percent, and we can see that reflected in the way the markets are acting and what is happening in the underlying economy, and that's what we are trying to say that while digitization has a lot of benefits, there is also a difficult underbelly which one has to tackle where large parts of society whether it is unskilled and obviously, in our study, people of color with less training in digitalization are struggling.</p><p>And COVID was a litmus test to what digitization might look like in a generation from here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And the curtain was drawn back. I am going to plant another statistic. You say blacks and Hispanics are 10 years behind whites in levels of broadband access, almost four times more blacks have poor tech connectivity than whites, and those kind of limitations for minority communities relative to others culminates in what you are saying in just one generation alone will mean 86 percent of those communities will be underprepared or locked out in just 20 to 25 years.</p><p>WALIA: Yes. As digitization works, it gets elliptical. Tech has always surprised the upside and things happen faster than you think and the gap is wide and it is there in the urban cities.</p><p>In terms of access to training, access to skills, access to connectivity, and it is not addressed and it stays exactly where it is, and we started with COVID, you we project 25 years now, the same world, you have large swathes of society which will be underprepared.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, if I look at the gains that the five Big Tech stocks have made since the pandemic began, approaching $2 trillion, maybe even a bit more, give or take, how much should they be spending to try and tackle some of these issues to deflect some of this anger that you are talking about?</p><p>WALIA: So I see it two ways. Most industries -- and if you go back to the last couple of years where they are in the curve, where tech is, they made the mistake of essentially not paying attention to the growth they have had and potentially what has been hurt.</p><p>I believe tech can do it differently. Tech has done so much for the world, so much for the country. At this point, this is a problem which is well defined. It's fixable if someone rolls up their sleeves. They have the logistics. They have the know-how to come in and you know, our plan is -- we were talking about $15 billion, which is looking at families of color, black and Hispanic under $30,000.00, providing them with connectivity and providing them with training and hardware for three to five years.</p><p>[09:40:10]</p><p>WALIA: It starts to make a dent in the digital gap. I believe if tech does it, it cascades into a bigger movement. And so the two reasons, I believe, they can do it. One, of course, we talked about it. They are getting unpopular. This is something which will bring a lot of goodwill in the country across the political spectrum to help the unskilled and families of color.</p><p>The second, I believe, is this is a growing market. If I told you this is a market of X million people which are untapped, don't have digitization, don't have connectivity, one would go into that country and get very aggressive in trying to tap into it.</p><p>Well that market exists here in the U.S., in New York, in L.A., in Chicago. Large swathes of society. And guess what? In 25 years' time, they would be consumers. The level of entrenchment you can gain by getting there now will repay back multi-folds in the future.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we just had a conversation about the challenges in emerging markets and some so-called developed markets have big issues that they need to tackle as well. I think every lawmaker should read your report. It was great.</p><p>Apjit Walia, thank you so much for joining us on the show. Come back soon, please.</p><p>The Global Head for Technology Investment Strategy at Deutsche Bank joining us there.</p><p>All right, it has become a global competition, finding a vaccine for COVID- 19. When we come back, we will speak to an expert about the testing involved, and when we should expect a proven vaccine based on the data. Stay with us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Drug companies around the world are racing to complete clinical trials for their various coronavirus vaccine candidates. Now some experts are questioning whether the rush to make a vaccine available could threaten the integrity of the entire process.</p><p>Amid the confusion, it is still not clear when an effective vaccine may be released or made available to the masses. Here's Dr. Fauci on that.</p><p>[09:45:05]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: My projection is that it likely would be November and December. It is conceivable that it could be October.</p><p>I mean, there is no doubt that that could happen. I think more likely, it would be November and December, and then, at that point, if one or more vaccines reaches that critical point, then the F.D.A. will make their decision and then we can start rolling out the vaccine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's get the take of another expert on all the data out there and there is plenty of it. Rasmus Bech Hansen joins us now. He is the CEO of Airfinity, a scientific data analytics company.</p><p>Sir, fantastic to have you on the show. Just explain briefly how Airfinity works. What data are you using? How do you put it to use?</p><p>RASMUS BECH HANSEN, CEO, AIRFINITY: Hi, Julia, it is great to be on. So we have a setup that listens to all the new pieces of new science information out there globally -- China, Russia, everywhere. We listen to journals, social media, and preprints. You know, there is a flurry of new information.</p><p>So we use that to provide a comprehensive view that really helps decision makers make better decisions that are informed by the new science and we also do predictive models that help kind of forecast where science is going.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, there is an overwhelming amount of data out there. So even just being able to hone that and get a sense of that timetable is critical.</p><p>Let's talk about. Four companies, I think being discussed: Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Who is in the lead in terms of getting their vaccine trials finished and then approved, according to your analysis?</p><p>HANSEN: Yes. So that's the question everyone is asking, right? So from our data, we can see that Pfizer is really the frontrunner at the moment. I think the only company that has a realistic chance of meeting the F.D.A. requirements before the U.S. presidential election is Pfizer.</p><p>We expect that first interim data coming out fairly soon on Pfizer and then Astra, Moderna will come shortly after, and then Johnson &amp; Johnson is a little bit later. But you know, we have 320 vaccines out there. So there is a lot of more science to be expected in the coming months and quarters.</p><p>I think the speed of these trials is just incredible. And it's -- we look into the details of the protocols, so kind of how these trials actually set up. There is no doubt that they basically set up to maximize speed at the expense of some other things, and I think that's one of the key things we really need to watch out for when we interpret the data that's coming out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: At the expense of what? Because I think this is key when we are looking at even Pfizer because haven't they lowered the bar in terms of what they are actually looking for with respect to this virus?</p><p>HANSEN: Yes, I think that's a fair point. So kind of simply put, what they have decided to do, they have decided to basically test against mild symptoms of COVID-19. So a cough, a sore throat, fever, et cetera, that counts as a case and it is somewhat similar for the others.</p><p>You can argue that actually what we need, we need a vaccine that works against hospitalization, deaths, et cetera, not just the mild version but the severe version and that's really the compromise they made here. I don't know, it might be worth just like looking a little bit at how these vaccine trials actually work.</p><p>Say you have a 30,000 trial. You have 50,000 that gets the vaccine, the other 50,000 are in the so-called placebo group. They just get like saltwater and currently in the U.S., we have an infection rate of around 1.32 percent, which means that 1.32 people gets the virus daily out of 10,000.</p><p>So calculate those numbers, and then you would say that over a, let's say 100-day period you would have around 200 cases with both mild and severe disease in the placebo group and around 40 of those would have very severe diseases and around 160 would then have the mild version.</p><p>The F.D.A. has said, to approve a vaccine, we need to get to a threshold of minimum 150 cases in the placebo group assuming an efficacy of 50 percent. I mean, 50 percent less in the vaccinated group. So you can see, in this case, you would then actually be able to say okay, from the perspective of a mild disease that's fine, we can improve the vaccine.</p><p>But if you needed 150 of the severely ill, hospitalized and potentially dead, you would have to wait much longer and that's really -- that's really the dilemma for these companies. That's really the kind of key decisions that are being made, and I think that raises some very important questions also of the public's willingness to take a vaccine that has actually only been proven to work against the milder versions of the disease.</p><p>[09:50:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: This is such an important point, because if you are challenging this vaccine in a relatively low infection environment, it is simply going to take longer to judge the placebo group, relative to those that have been vaccinated, and this is a timing aspect, a critical timing aspect in addition to your point that the degree of symptoms here that we are looking at.</p><p>Let's talk China and Russia very quickly. In terms of antibody production, what can you tell us about the efficacy of the Russian -- let's go for Sputnik, the Russian vaccine. What are your thoughts on this one?</p><p>HANSEN: Well, first of all, it is a great name, right? I think the other vaccine candidates have similar innovative names. Though, jokes aside, I think Sputnik is actually -- what we have seen from the Phase 1 is very similar to the other candidates. It's not like it is significantly worse or better works, it works slightly better on some population groups than others.</p><p>But really from the Phase 1 trial, it is hard to say that Sputnik is either/or. I think it is promising candidate. I think we also see a lot of promising candidates from China. China is moving really fast in the space and they have only kind of decided a slightly different strategy to the western countries.</p><p>They have gone for what's called whole virus vaccines which is more kind the traditional approach, which kind of from a production perspective, it would probably be easier to scale up production because that has been done before.</p><p>A lot of these genetic vaccines have actually never been produced at scale before, so that's one of the kind of key risk factors. So I think we are probably underestimating a little bit what happening in China, and I think that they have a number of candidates that are very likely to come out soon and maybe even before some of the western -- the front runners in the west.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. So regulators need to be looking at everything. They just need to be provided enough data to make a judgment.</p><p>As always, there is never enough time. Rasmus, come back and talk to me, because I have plenty more questions for you, sir. One of our experts -- and I should make the point that you work for governments, for corporations, for hedge funds, giving them this critical information, too, as this race goes on. Great to have you with us, the CEO of Airfinity.</p><p>HANSEN: Thanks, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. All right, when we come back, California dreaming -- of a day without gasoline-powered cars it seems. It is coming faster, perhaps, than you might think -- perhaps.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: California has just announced an ambitious new plan that would ban the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles in the state by the year 2035. Paul la Monica is back with us to discuss.</p><p>We are keeping you busy today, Paul. Biggest car market in the United States. Biggest EV market in the United States. Talk us through what the game plan is here.</p><p>[09:55:01]</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, Gavin Newsom hoping that by 2035, new vehicles will be zero emissions. So that is obviously, good news for the likes of Tesla and all the big automotive companies that are ramping up production of electric vehicles.</p><p>The question, I think, is will this be legally challenged? Because there are concerns that maybe it is a little too ambitious to try over the next 15 years to completely scale back the gas guzzler type cars.</p><p>And the other important thing to note, Julia is that this is for new cars. So if you currently own in the State of California or plan to buy this the next ten years or so, a car that is running on old-fashioned fossil fuels, you can still drive it. You are not going to be prohibited from driving it, and you can still sell it as a used car as well.</p><p>So this doesn't mean that gas guzzlers go away. It is just trying to stop and prevent the new sale of gas guzzling cars after 2035.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. So this is a really important point. So if you are buying a second hand car, even up to that and beyond that point, it is okay. This is simply for new cars. Because the price point at least today is still too high for many people. It's just not viable.</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly, and that is something that Elon Musk has pointed out himself with Tesla battery day.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Of course.</p><p>LA MONICA: And they are still relying on Panasonic and other manufacturers. They are trying to make more of their own batteries at massive scale.</p><p>Hopefully within the next 15 years, you have the cost of those batteries come down and if that's the case, the Model S, Model X, whatever future Tesla models that come in the next 15 years, and you know, should be cheaper and maybe on a cost comparison, you know, more analogous to what you could buy in a similar gas guzzling car right now. That's really --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I know. What a coincidence of timing, $25,000.00 Tesla, and then we get this announcement from California today. Fantastic. Paul La Monica. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>That's it for FIRST MOVE. We'll be back tomorrow. Stay safe.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020092401cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XF-2021-DXH2-60FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

And good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday, it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Busy morning on earnings this morning.  We will hear from UPS, General Electric, both ahead of the open this morning.  Big technology still in focus, Facebook reporting last night after the close, big quarter for Facebook, Amazon will be the one to watch today after the close tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the arctic blast turns deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their lowest levels in decades.  We will take you to the Minneapolis region this morning, where the negative 24 degrees is having a real impact.  The push to tax the wealthy, J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly saying that the richest Americans can afford to pay higher taxes, but there's a catch.  Then, Roger Goodell breaking his silence, what he said about the infamous no-call during the NFC championship game coming up later this hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets this morning.  Let's check Futures showing a mixed opening this morning after a huge day yesterday.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 15 points at the open.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ up fractionally right now after a solid day of trading that all stock surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell signaled that the Central Bank may pause interest rate hikes for now.  The Fed on pause.</p><p>Technology giant, Facebook, meanwhile also reporting fourth-quarter earnings.  Look at that market yesterday, up 434 points at the close, it was a big day.  And that, by the way, was off of the highs of the day after the Fed meeting.  Facebook earnings beat expectations posting a record profit for what has been a difficult year for the social media company.  Take a look at Facebook shares this morning, up 11-1/3 percent right now, 167 and change.  Earnings season rolling on today with Amazon reporting after the bell tonight.  Take a look at all the names that we're expecting today in what is really the busiest week -- one of the busiest weeks for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Here now, the founder of Disruptive Technology Research Lou Basenese.  Lou, it's good to see you.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on Facebook, your reaction to the quarter last night.</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, I am just shocked and disappointed in this rally.  I mean, I think this is really putting forward that investors and management favor profit growth over ethics.  I mean, look, this week, we had -- I think one of the -- just biggest disappointments in privacy protection with the Facebook research app.  I mean, just total disregard for Apple's wishes, total disregard for teenage users' privacy, and yet, investors are cheering profit growth.  So, look, I can't argue with the fundamental numbers.  I mean, the stock is reasonably valued, you've seen growth come back in the U.S. as the key market, and advertisers just don't have any other outlet, any other alternative to reach 2 billion potential viewers.  So, it's one of those things, it's a toxic investment, to me.  So, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you wouldn't touch it?</p><p>BASENESE:  I wouldn't touch it.  Look, I think there's a lot of risk embedded there.  What's the next privacy scandal that's going to come to light?  Facebook, over the years, has really made more excuses than changes to what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's talk about the Fed -- the Fed essentially on hold yesterday saying it's on hold, indicating that more dovish stance when it comes to interest rate hikes.  What was your reaction to what the Fed said in particular also saying that the balance sheet unwind is also a way that they could pull back and perhaps stop the 50 billion sales a month.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, I don't think I can remember in my lifetime just a more dramatic turn of sentiment at the Fed.  I mean, in October, they were saying that we're a long way from neutral and now, yesterday's statement said that we're within range.  I mean, they went from playing hardball with the President to playing patty cake, and you know, investors love that.  So, you know, more easy monetary policy coming.  I think they gave themselves some flexibility on unwinding the balance sheet.  Not that they didn't say that they were going to be data dependent before, but now they just made that much more of a point to communicate to the markets that there's not going to be a fast and hard unwind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we were sort of expecting this in the last couple of months, that's for sure.  But would this be a signal for you to put new money to work in stocks?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think absolutely.  Look, the Fed has been supportive of stock prices.  I mean, there's a lot of people that would argue this bull market would not be around without the Fed.  So, with the Fed being very accommodative, I think it's time to come back into the market, we're going to see that.  You've seen a dramatic reversal even in the more speculative areas of the market.  And I think I pointed out before in another appearance that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tremendous bounce off the lows, up almost 20 percent, and about to breakthrough to the 200-day moving average.  So, yes, it's risk on again.  At least to the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Two more things on stocks, we've got earnings, obviously, the middle in -- we're in the middle of a very busy period.  DowDupont just reported they beat on earnings per share at $0.88 a share but they missed on revenue at 20.1 billion versus an estimate of 20.9 billion, how would you characterize the earnings season so far, and what does that telling you about the backdrop?</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, it's a mixed bag.  We haven't really seen a huge beat rate on the earnings on the bottomline.  I think the top like is being less impressive.  So, on DuPont's report, it's epitomizing it, right?  We're seeing some earnings growth but the demand on the top line is not there.  So, look, I think we're in more of a stock picker's market.  It points more towards active management and really trying to find those companies that are overcoming the China hangover that are finding strength despite some pockets of weakness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a focus is economic data for you?  We've got the January job's report out Friday morning, tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting 165,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9 percent.  We had the ADP numbers earlier this week, they were strong.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes.  No, they're very strong.  Look, I'm a tech guy first, but I'd love to see tailwinds and the job's market supporting that.  I think many people thought we might have a slowdown just because of the government shutdown, and just that extreme volatility in December that might have put some businesses a little uneasy about hiring.  But the ADP Report like you mentioned this week, pointing to just continued strength, so another positive for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you're thinking we're going to get a pretty good year, 2019.</p><p>BASENESE:  As of now -- look, a lot can change, I mean, look what happened in December.  So, I don't want to go on the record and say it's a -- it's a foregone conclusion 2019 is going to be great, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you've got put money to work either way, so what do you do?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think -- I put money to work.  Look, I like the semiconductor industry particularly companies like NXP, really undervalued at about 11 times earnings.  And the chipmakers are going to make this world go, from here into the future.  About a trillion semiconductors shipped last year.  They go into every big growth trend that you can think of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess.  I mean, even more so with 5G on the way.  Lou, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lou Basanese joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow morning.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January job's report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We've got our \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" special where we identify where the jobs are right now.  Meanwhile, Amazon earnings after the bell, the company poking fun in its own Alexa devices for going haywire in this year's Super Bowl ad.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Your take on that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I love Super Bowl ads, and Amazon is advertising during the big game for the fourth straight year, two spots including part of this one, we're going to show you a 90-second spot with some popular names.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But trust me, there are a lot of fails.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Alexa, play my podcast.</p><p>ALEXA:  When you heard that, did that surprise (INAUDIBLE) that seems exciting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need an Alexa dog collar.  Four dogs.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering dog food, ordering dog food.</p><p>HARRISON FORD, ACTOR:  You can bark all you want, I'm not paying for any more dog food.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering gravy.  Ordering sausages.</p><p>FORD:  Hey, you better cancel that order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa hot tub sucked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa, play music.  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, that's just a little bit of a snippet of that ad, Maria.  Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker among the well-known celebrities in that ad.  Just that 90-second spot will set Amazon back more than $15 million, $5 million per 30-second spot for Super Bowl ads.  This is a little ironic because Amazon has really ramped up spending on national television advertising, you know, a real innovator in terms of online advertising, streaming video, but Amazon spends every year now on national T.V. advertising, $680 million a year, that's about doubled from 2015.  It spends more than Toyota and even McDonalds every year on T.V. ads.  Why the Super Bowl?  Do we even need to tell you, more than 100 million people are going to watch this, and it has a very diverse viewing base, about 47 percent of the viewers last year ladies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we watch for the commercials or do we watch for the game?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The game.  The game always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both, I'm both.  That commercial really resonated though with the dog ordering everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who doesn't love Harrison Ford.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you.  We will keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deadly polar vortex sweeping through the Midwest.  Lauren Simonetti with the details on that.  Lauren, it is cold there.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is cold.  And speaking of Amazon, they're not delivering in some Midwest cities because it is so cold, but at least -- this is deadly, at least nine people have died in causes related to the historic -- this historic arctic blast when 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.  Windchill temperatures falling to minus 50 degrees in Chicago.  And near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.</p><p>According to FlightAware, since yesterday, there have been more than 21,000 flight delays and more than 6,000 cancellations.  Seven people stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were around minus four degrees with windchill of minus 30.  Coastguard officials say the seven people were near Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, but couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>Some General Motors plants in Michigan halting production due to the extremely cold weather and also a shortage of natural gas following a fire at a compressor station.  A dozen plants affected and all the utility there.  Also, asking customers to please reduce their use of natural gas, but there is such demand at this time of year.  Let's take a look at shares of G.M. down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And then, there's this, firefighters battling a massive blaze at an historic factory in New Jersey below freezing temperatures.  The Marcal Paper plant burning overnight, the bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out, as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries fortunately reported here.  It is unclear how this fire started.  The paper factory is 86 years old.  It survived several fires in the past.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, even in the face of that cold weather, fire burning wildly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren, thanks.  Coming up, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon now saying he has no problem with the wealthiest Americans paying even more taxes.  There is a catch, though, we're going to bring you what he said.  Then, breaking his silence, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no-call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.  But the Saints player and a coach weigh in on Goodell and the controversy.  All ahead right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining us, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Member, Sean Duffy, is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N. and former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson, is with us.  FanDuel CEO Matthew King join us ahead of the Super Bowl.  And PopSockets Founder, CEO David Barnett joining us as well.  The Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and stockbroker Ross Stripling is with us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>We kick it off here with this, paying your fair share, the push from the far left getting reaction from corporate America now.  J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, reportedly saying that he is willing to pay higher taxes that the wealthiest Americans can afford to pay more.  He also said that those dollars, though, need to be spent wisely by the government.  Here's what he told me earlier this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on what we're hearing now from, for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  She says she think that the top-end of earners should pay as high as 70, 80 percent tax rates?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  Yes.  Look, I -- you know, I always separate the corporate side, the business side, which I think we need it to be competitive with the individual side.  And so, you know, people have all different theories, but individual side would maximize returns and stuff like that.  So, I'm not -- I don't get involved in that debate because I'll leave that to politicians.  That is actually less important for economic growth than the business side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The top 10 percent already pay 80 percent of all the tax.</p><p>DIMON:  They do.  But in America, you have to look at tax (INAUDIBLE) I mean, a lot of payroll tax are aggressive, sales tax are aggressive, real estate tax are aggressive.  So, you look at the big picture, anyone would say, we should relook at this and make it better and more efficient and fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, is here along with former Arkansas Governor, Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee, great to see you, guys.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Wonderful to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  Your reaction to Jamie Dimon.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He can pay all the taxes he wants.  There's not a thing in the federal code that prohibits him from writing a check to the federal government.  If he's feeling guilty that he's not paying enough, do it.  When I was governor, I did a fund called the \"tax me more fund\" because a bunch of legislators kept saying we need to raise taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So I had envelopes printed and everywhere I went to make a speech, I pass them out, and said, you don't think you're paying enough, send it in, as much as you want until you feel better.  In two years, we raised $1168, a thousand, which was given by one Democrat legislator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is good.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because nobody wants to pay more taxes.  They say they do but they don't.  That's just a lie.  And so, this nonsense that I'd like to pay more taxes, do it, go ahead, be the first, write the check then prove it to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's -- there's just such a range of the ultra-rich, somebody like Jamie Dimon with $1 billion, somebody like a Warren Buffett with, what, $45 billion to other rich people as well with, what, $250,000 or $1 million, right?  So, the range is so huge.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, he's close to -- at his age, he's close to retirement so he doesn't really need to worry about income taxes that much.  Ask him about the Elizabeth Warren wealth tax, where she's going to come and confiscate his money.  How does he feel about that?  Because by the way, if he's talking about income taxes, half of this country doesn't pay any income taxes, and any net income taxes.  So, our Defense Department isn't funded by half this country.  Education at the federal level not funded by half this country.  Somebody has got to pay.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Top one percent as you alluded to in the interview, currently paying more than the bottom 90 percent combined in terms of federal income taxes.  But this is really about how you distribute wealth.  Let's think about growth, let's think about how to get everyone making more instead of how to take it from some people, but I think he does raise a good question, which is -- isn't really better for our society if we take more from Jamie Dimon and give it to the government, and the question of who's going to invest it better, random government agency or Jamie Dimon, who probably perhaps puts it in to public companies, maybe he invests in financial technology start-ups.  I think the track record would say Jamie Dimon is probably going to invest that money better than a Washington bureaucracy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You got to be kidding, James, you mean to tell me --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Controversial statement, I know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- that you think Washington would squander money after we send it to them?  Well, I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  Such --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, and I think the shutdown --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- stewards of our tax money.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the shutdown really raises questions about whether the federal bureaucracy is currently overstaffed as we -- as we think about spending.  It took a long time for most people to notice an impact and it was basically when the essential workers started furloughing themselves at TSA gates.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the air traffic controllers, really, that caused the problems over the -- over the weekend.  I just want to point that out.  But again, it's appalling to make people work and not pay them, I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's get to now the 2020 line-up because Howard Schultz and other wealthy business guys, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Fox News yesterday, telling Dana Perino that President Trump should not be taking credit for the strength of the economy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the reduction in the corporate tax rate of 21 percent was wrong and irrational.  He missed a massive opportunity for comprehensive tax reform.  But if you look at the facts, the facts are 40 percent of the American people do not have $400 in the bank.  5 million young people in America, mostly Black and Latino are not in school and not in work.  One out of six Americans are food insecure.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Yes.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  So, no, I don't give him, the President credit for any of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHULTZ:  And I do not give him credit for saying for two years that the stock market is proxy for the economy.  He is going to fall on his sword for that because that economy is not going to last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, your reaction.  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know how you argue that the higher growth in the Trump presidency during the Trump era is unrelated to his policies of cutting taxes and regulation.  I understand Mr. Schultz is a Democrat now thinking of running as Independent.  He's sort of charting a middle course, he's saying Trump doesn't get credit for the company, while also saying Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax is a bad idea.  But I think on this count he's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, it's crazy to actually look at what has happened in 2018 with the growth numbers and not tie it to not just the tax cuts but also the deregulation, the policies of the Trump administration did move the needle on growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can take the other side of that.  I think it's pretty clear that what the Federal Reserve has been doing is really what has propped up the stock market in a major way, and you saw the rally yesterday now that interest rates are on hold.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the last couple of months.  But I'm talking about 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we are in a position where we're not going to keep growing at three percent right now for myriad reasons, whether it's the global economic slowdown, or problems here at home.  But according to the Wall Street Journal survey of economists conducted this week, we're now below two percent growth in the first quarter and at 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter.  So, right now, we don't look like we can sustain that three percent growth number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's a guess.  That's an estimate, we should point out.  We'll get the hard data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I don't think there is a reason we can't continue to grow at three percent.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but the big mistake Schultz made was that he dried to say I won't go after the Republican voters.  And then he insulted Republicans by saying that tax cuts and deregulation really don't matter.  Ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We got to talk about the Federal Reserve coming up and what did the Fed say yesterday.  Then, justice for Senator Rand Paul, he's awarded damages after being attacked by his neighbor in 2017.  We will tell you how much money is coming to him.  Then, sky high entertainment, we'll tell you how competition is heating up between airlines over who's keeping their passengers entertained better.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Lexington Herald-Leader calling out the Kentucky Governor for saying, \"America is weak for closing schools during the polar vortex.\"  Governor Matt Bevin also said, \"We're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in a fetal position somewhere in a warm place.\"  He did add that he was being a little facetious.  The Star Tribune in Minnesota writing this morning about how veterans are suing saying 3M combat earplugs caused hearing injuries.  At least 11 lawsuits by that have filed -- have been filed this month against the company, accusing of knowingly selling defective earplugs for use in combat.  This is after 3M had already paid $9.1 million to settle government allegations.</p><p>The L.A. Times taking a look at the in-flight entertainment arms race in a tight competition for flyers, airlines stepping up their free offerings.  The article details how airlines are trying to one-up each other from United's free T.V. on some of its planes through American Airlines free T.V. and Apple music.  I haven't seen any of this, what about you, James?  Dagen?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, at what point in the -- at what temperature should kids not have to walk to school?  I don't know.  I'm not sure the governor -- you don't -- you don't necessarily need to swing at every pitch.  I think Mr. Huckabee could tell us about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I've swung at a few I wished I hadn't, absolutely.  Matt Bevin is a great governor.  I'm going to be with him Saturday night in Elizabethtown, in fact, so I'll pass along your sentiments.  But I think it's one of those things that he said in not so much specifically about the vortex, just that as a whole, we are as a country, raising softer kids, and I think that's probably an assessment.  In the context of how cold it was yesterday, maybe the timing, you know, is not perfect, but I think I understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, right, left, or middle of the road, as a nation, we've lost the ability to shut up and say nothing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're like virtue signaling about everything and looking for validation based on a retweet, whether it's by the President himself or Alyssa Milano.  That's how we get out -- that's how we derive our self-worth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We have 250 channels on television plus satellite and internet, 168 hours a week and something has got to fill up that space.  So, that's where we are as a culture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And gone is the lowly book.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe the kids should go out in that weather but get medals for it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  For participating in --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pat on the back for that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the Russia probe, President Trump is reportedly leaving the Mueller report decision in the hands of the Department of Justice.  We'll tell you about what went down yesterday.  And then a big day for earnings, G.E. set to hit the tape in just a few minutes.  We will have the numbers for you, and take a look at how it's impacting markets.  The stock is up two percent ahead of the report.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>General Electric just coming out, and the earnings are below expectations.  The stock right now is higher in the premarket.  Company's reporting $0.17 cents a share, versus an estimate of $0.22 cents a share, as you can see.  Stock at $9.21 a share, we'll keep watching this as we dig through these numbers.</p><p>More big names reporting today, UPS, ConocoPhillips, MasterCard, out later this morning, we'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Revenue on G.E. is better-than-expected at $33.28 billion versus an estimate of $32.6 billion.</p><p>So, maybe that's what's really moving the stock this morning, revenue, better-than-expected on General Electric.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning, take a look at markets, we are expecting a flat opening right now, after a monster rally yesterday, Dow Industrials unchanged, S&amp;P 500 up 3 points, and the NASDAQ up 28.  The major indices tacked on big gains yesterday after the fed said that it was on hold, in terms of raising interest rates for the foreseeable Future.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 435 points at the close, one and three quarters of a percent, and that was off of the highs of the day.  The S&amp;P 500 finished up 41, that was 1-1/2 percent higher, the NASDAQ was up 154 points, the Fed signaling that maybe, maybe, two rate hikes come this year, but it was all dependent on the data.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices look like this, as you see, higher across the board, FT 100 up 43 points, two-thirds of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index up nine points, fractional move, in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, mostly higher, as you see there, best performer, Hong Kong and Japan, up better than one percent a piece.</p><p>Back in the U.S., Arctic conditions have left at least nine people dead, nearly 15,000 flights have been cancelled or delayed due to the weather, and the polar vortex bringing a phenomenon to the skies.  We've got the details, coming up.</p><p>Then, justice for Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator has been awarded damages after he was attacked by his neighbor, we'll tell you how much.</p><p>Plus, breaking his silence, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Whenever officiating is part of any kind of discussion, post gate, is never a good outcome for us.  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.</p><p>We are getting a first look at General Electric earnings this morning, it is a mixed report, $0.17 cents a share is weaker than the estimated $0.22 cents a share, but the revenue is much higher than estimated, $33.28 billion on revenue for the fourth quarter, on General Electric.</p><p>Joining us right now is Pacer ETFs Distributors President, Sean O'Hara, and it is good to see you, Sean.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETF'S DISTRIBUTORS:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll go in to some of the flows and what you're seeing in terms of ETFs, how would you characterize the earning season, give us your take on the backdrop, so far?</p><p>O'HARA:  I think the backdrop is sort of like what we talked about last time I was here, which is you're starting to see a little bit of a slowing in terms of the earnings.  So, we got a little bit spoiled, perhaps, in 2018, we're such, you know, meteoric, if you will, earnings growth, 20, 25, 26, 28 percent.</p><p>And now, we're getting into a phase in the market where, you know -- it's just not sustainable to continue to do that.  So, I think we're adjusting to what's going on with regard to earnings more than anything.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, maybe if expectations have been set too low, we've been, sort of, discussing whether the U.S. can hit three percent growth again, this year, I mean, what does it -- what does it mean if we are growing at three percent?  Are these -- are these stocks cheap at this point?</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't know that stocks are necessarily cheap.  If we get to 3 or 3-1/2 or 4 percent, then I think they're cheap.  And I think that's the big wild card.  Are we going to get that kind of economic growth, particularly since we don't really know yet what the effect on the economy is going to be to shut down?</p><p>I mean, this was not a normal shutdown.  This was not like three or four days until they argue, and then somebody gave in, this was over a month.  And so, there's going to be some effect.  I just don't think we know exactly what it is yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of the Federal Reserve, yesterday, on hold at this point, even talking, as we expected, Dagen, about the balance sheet, possibly pulling back on the -- on the unwind as well.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes, I mean, there was -- there's generally been three, like, headwinds, if you will, for the market, one was what's the fed going to do, one was trade in China, and then the third is the slowing earnings thing that we talked about.</p><p>What I saw yesterday and what I think I heard yesterday, everybody sort of hears their own interpretation of what's going on.  But what I heard is, is that the Fed is going to be more accommodative than they have been, as far as their posture is going forward.</p><p>I don't know if that's reaction to the stock market, I don't know if that's a reaction to something they see with regard to earnings or the economy.  But I think one of those headwinds was essentially removed yesterday from what people's expectations are, going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will raise this issue.  Clearly, investors love what they heard from the Federal Reserve.  But it was a complete about-face from what they've said six weeks ago.  And at some point, do investors start wringing their hands about the economy, about economic growth around the globe, and even here at home.</p><p>We've seen weak growth in France and Germany, that's the story in the Wall Street Journal today.  Will you have a different reaction in the days ahead, when people really digest whoa, what is Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve see, in the months, in the year to come, in the U.S. economy?</p><p>O'HARA:  I mean, of the three things we've talked about, the Fed, trade in China and earnings, clearly to me, the earnings piece of it is the most important part.  That's what drives stock prices from a fundamental perspective is what are they making in terms of earnings, from free cash flow.</p><p>So, I think that's the big one, but I think if you're a little bit of a skeptic and you wanted -- you want to be a little bit more intellectually curious, if you will, I think what you would do is you would do what you're doing, Dagen, and say I wonder what they know that they're not telling us yet, because they really have made a pretty remarkable change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I would say in the last couple of weeks, I think it became clear that we were seeing real issues in Europe and China -- I mean, you know, whether it'd be France, the budget issues in Italy, Brexit and the uncertainty in the U.K.</p><p>So, we knew, going into the Fed meeting that Europe was slowing and China growth has slowed.  And in fact, I think it was becoming more and more well-known that the Federal Reserve had pivoted.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, you said you were stunned in the commercial break.  I wasn't stunned by yesterday's -- I mean, I wasn't stunned, at all, actually.  I was expecting the Federal Reserve to tell us they were on hold.</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't think they said they were -- what I said I was stunned by was, how aggressive I feel like Powell was, in his position, saying that we will use anything we have, including the balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>O'HARA:  That was the new one.  It's always been about ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what Dagen --</p><p>O'HARA:  -- the balance sheet came in to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What Dagen is saying is, the backdrop, what the Fed is recognizing, is what we -- what we are starting to understand better.  And that is we're talking about a slowdown.  We're looking at a slowdown and that is -- we don't live in a vacuum.  Of course, the U.S. is going to be impacted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why you weren't surprised, because of your interview with Ray Dalio and your ongoing interviews with Ray Dalio and what he said.  What did he say last week?  That the Federal Reserve is not going to raise this year and could cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- or do something with balance sheet to be more accommodated.  That's what they said.  But I don't think that the rest of the market has quite digested that.  They need to go back and watch your Ray Dalio interview.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and all interviews in Davos last week.  It was pretty much unanimous that we're facing a U.S. slowdown.  What wasn't unanimous was how steep it might be.  Look, G.E. and debt, the company's debt is now over $100 billion.  The Journal is reporting if G.E. were to sell its jet leasing business, it could eliminate up to $40 billion in corporate debt.</p><p>G.E. capital owns and leases thousands of planes and helicopters to carriers around the world.  The stock is up two and a quarter percent, I don't know.  The earnings, amiss, but I guess people like the fact that the revenue is better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and this is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And low expectations for this company --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That too.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- and stocks, generally.  By the way, I'm not sure the Fed has changed all that much.  What we are seeing is this is the Jay Powell strategy of we're not going to let locked into a long-term plan, we're going to watch the data, as you said, the market signals lately, have been bad, inflation lately, signals that it's mild.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But at the end of the fourth quarter, they were on auto pilot.  They were like, $50 billion a month, three rate hikes, right?  So that is where the pivot is that I'm referring to.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  But I don't think it means we're not getting rate hikes this year.  If the economy grows faster than the consensus, and I happen to think it probably will, then you could see some rate hikes.  But they're saying we're watching the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They might not hike at all, like Ray Dalio said, they might end up cutting, because from the last hike to the first cut, it's as usually a six-month period, granted they need to slow down the balance sheet reduction before they do that.</p><p>One thing I want to note, to connect the G.E., the level of debt there, and what the Federal Reserve did, that's why the market was freaking out when the Fed was continuing to move a quarter point every three months, or every -- because of the level of indebtedness of corporations, the level of indebtedness of the United States and individuals in this country.</p><p>We are a nation that can't handle even three percent short-term rates and that should be frightening to people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you've said that a lot, actually, Sean O'Hara, great to see you.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining.  We didn't even mentioned your INDS, which Kevin Kelly wanted us to, up 14 percent year to date, using money flows into some cooler ETFs.</p><p>O'HARA:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Sean.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Turning to the Mueller report this morning, President Trump says he will leave the decision up to the Department of Justice, according to the Daily Caller exclusive.  Joining us now is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Chris, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  You have an exclusive interview with President Trump, tell us what you learned.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER:  We learned that he's going to keep his hands off of the Department of Justice, for the Mueller report and how to handle that.  He's going to leave the ball in that court.  We learned that he's very concerned about some bigotry in the Democratic Party.</p><p>We talked to him about the new fight yesterday with Governor Northam about abortion.  These are -- and we also learned something very interested to think it's been a little bit under pledge so far, that he's going to put an end to any potential deal that's been reported out on the ninth circuit, on allowing Democratic judges to be re-nominated on the ninth circuit.</p><p>He said he's going to put an end to that deal and try to stack the ninth circuit with judges who are more in line with President Trump's view of how they should be.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think that's an important point you just made, Christopher, because of all the things that the President is doing that even his critics have to appreciate, I'm talking about his Republican critics, is that he is reshaping the judiciary to a constructionist point of view, and if he were to reneged on that, I think it would be disastrous for him and frankly, disastrous for the entire country.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think anyone on the right will certainly agree with that.  He had -- that's one of the major accomplishments he's made, and there's still a lot more that they can do.  There are currently more vacancies in the court than they were when he took office.</p><p>There's a lot more that Mitch McConnell can be doing to pushing this and moving it faster.  But one thing that -- one thing that is certain is, with the control of the Senate, the GOP has really no incentive to give any leeway on this, the ninth circuit has been thorn on the side of the administration over and over and over again --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  -- and to make any deal like the Wall Street Journal reported would not be in the benefit to the President.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Chris, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if you've covered this with the President, but related to these various probes, investigations, did he give any indication that he's thinking or planning to release more documents, declassify more documents, get the full story out about the 2016 election and how our government came to spy on people affiliated with this campaign.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We were pretty careful when we pushed him on the issue.  He said over and over again, that he was going to leave the decisions, for now, to his Department of Justice.  The ball was on their court.  He was hoping that they made the right decisions, but that he was going to allow them to make them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the big -- the big cojones, if you will.  Maybe he's wait to release the declassified documents when another opportunity arises where he needs to offset some investigation there, because there are a lot of investigations that are unwinding right now from the Democrats in Congress.  Did he say anything about that?  What his strategy is, in the face of all of these investigations?</p><p>BEDFORD:  So far, he doesn't need to make any moves right now.  He appeared last night when we were speaking to him to be more hands off on this matter.  But he can make any decision he wants to when it regards to declassification --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: -- or, at least, a report later on.  There's no need for him to cause a tizzy in the Congress.  And we've seen the executive branch has been lawyering up as the Democrats prepare for investigations.  Those are coming either way, but he hasn't -- he didn't show his cards too strongly on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford from the Daily Caller, there.  Coming up, breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, finally addressing the controversial no-call that pushed the Rams into the Super Bowl finals.</p><p>And a rare sun phenomenon appears in the Midwest.  Check this out, after one of the coldest weather snaps in decades, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Justice for Senator Rand Paul after a brutal attack.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A Kentucky jury, Maria, awarding Senator Paul more than $580,000 in damages in his lawsuit against his neighbor who attacked him in 2017.  Earlier this month, the Republican senator sat down with you, Maria, talking about his injuries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I had six broken ribs, three of them broken and then separated so they were round upon each other for months until they healed.  I had pneumonia twice, I had fluid around my lung and now I have hernia (INAUDIBLE) repaired from this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The senator says, the verdict sends a clear message that violence is not the answer.  The neighbor's lawyer says, they will appeal.</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaking publicly for the very first time about the blatant non-call in the NFC championship game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODELL:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Goodell says, he spoke with Saints players about that play.  But one player denies that and says, he hasn't heard from Goodell at all.  Well, the Saints coach, Sean Payton, may not be buying what Goodell is saying either.  Twitter pointing out that, at a recent press conference, Sean Payton appeared to be wearing a t-shirt that shows Roger Goodell dressed as a clown.  There you go -- the comparison.  Either way, the Super Bowl, without the Saints, is just three days away and our very own Cheryl Casone will have live coverage from Atlanta starting tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And to the weather outside, the polar vortex bringing a rare weather effect to parts of the Midwest and plains -- and it's pretty beautiful, called the Sundog.  It happens when ice crystals in the atmosphere interact with sunlight in a certain way.  More Sundogs are expected in the Midwest as this deep freeze continues for a little bit longer, but what a pretty picture in the sky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very pretty.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor and I both tell Lauren how to say Sundog -- Sundog.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Sundog.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get it right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, corn dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, winter weather gripping the nation, as you just heard.  We will take you live to Minneapolis next.  And then, an eye on earnings this morning, big day for energy companies.  Plus, Amazon announces its quarterly numbers after the bell; we have got the preview back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are talking about the deadly polar vortex.  The Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades.  Ray Bogan is in Minneapolis this morning with the very latest where the temperature is negative 25-degrees, Ray.</p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning, it is very cold here.  You know, it was supposed to be about 0-degrees today, forecasted to be at one point.  However, it's not, just a couple of minutes ago, actually, it got even colder.  It is now negative 30-degrees.  I just saw a picture of the thermometer at the National Weather Service here in Minneapolis.  We're at the Minneapolis Airport where all morning planes have been taking off and landing throughout the week.  They've had relatively few cancellations and delays, they've been lucky in that way, but that has not been the case around the Midwest where there have been thousands of cancellations and delays.  The worst of those being at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports.  A few people have gotten stranded as a result of all of -- all of this.</p><p>Now, take a look at some of these record low temperatures.  It's been freezing out in Chicago.  They had negative 23-degrees, that's the lowest since 1985.  In Minneapolis, we had a reading of negative 28 -- that was the lowest since 1996 and in Des Moines, Iowa, they set a new daily record low of negative 20-degrees.  And you could see, it's having a big impact on nature too.  This is Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, a beautiful lake during the summer time where you can go boating, eat at restaurants along the shore but now it is frozen over.  That is definitely not happening, but on Sunday, there's the possibility that here in Minneapolis, it could be 75-degrees warmer than it is right now and people are looking forward to it.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's incredible that we are talking about these temperatures now.  But next week, they go all the way back up.  Ray, thanks very much for braving the cold for us and showing us, really, firsthand what it's like out there.  Ray Bogan is live in Minneapolis.  We felt the cold this morning even in New York, and it's only what -- it was one-degree when you scale it out.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think Governor Bevin would be proud of Ray for doing that report outside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I thought Ray was getting ready to rob a 7Eleven, the way he was dressed.  I wasn't sure.  You know, it's cold.  I flew it from Florida yesterday to come to here.  And I'm thinking why, what was I thinking?  What's wrong with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why.  This is why you're in Virginia?  I mean, in New York?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank God you're not doing this show outdoors today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we wouldn't do that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, when you were in Davos, how cold was it?  It was like five-degrees.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was five or 10-degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You sat outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we did for three --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For three hours, at least, if not longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I had lots of layers on and got my ice breakers on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can confirm, Ray is correct that Lake Geneva is lovely in the summer time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, big day for earnings.

We're taking a look at the big business of gambling and how it's changing the sports world.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down.  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good to be with you.  Thank you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Going to be interesting.  We've heard a lot about how the shutdown was supposed to have a big impact on the economy.  And we're going to start getting some numbers.  Got the ADP report number yesterday, maybe not so big.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The ADP numbers were very strong.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Better than expected.  Job creation in the private sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see if the jobs numbers tomorrow, actually, meet what we saw yesterday from the ADP numbers.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And we'll get the NFIB small business numbers on our \"Journal\" Web site later this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We had a discussion about Howard Schultz's comments about the economy, what the tax cuts did for the economy, President Trump's policies.</p><p>But I'll say this.  We finally have wages growing.  And we're going to hear this tomorrow.  Wages growing north of 3 percent in this country which is not something that we've seen in a decade.  Not during all the years that President Obama was president did wages in this nation grow north of 3 percent.  And that's a really -- that's a very positive sign and people are feeling it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  And I think it's a very, very important sign that employment for minorities, both Hispanics and African Americans, are at record highs.  And that is very significant because there's nothing that is more stimulating to the economy than people having employment and having a job.</p><p>It not only cuts the cost of government where the government has to subsidize people, but it empowers people and gives them something that they can put on the table for their families that otherwise they couldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that in this presidential election as all these Democrats get their -- sharpen their elbows and start basically sticking each other in the neck, that that's going to be -- and the attacks on Howard Schultz by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that he didn't climb the ladder -- I'm paraphrasing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this is what it's going to come down to.  Do you root for the success of individuals in this country and is our policy and our regulation, is it set up to basically encourage that success, to climb out of a housing project in Canarsie, to run and basically create one of the greatest American success stories of the last 50 years which is what Howard Schultz did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the question of socialism is ultimately does it lead to equality or does it lead to mediocrity.  And if you look around the world historically it does not lead to equality.  Equality lifting everybody's boat.  It leads to mediocrity if not disaster.  And Venezuela is a wonderful example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There was a time Venezuela was quite vibrant.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, incredible.  Prosperous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But let me just tell you that the earnings have come out.  Blackstone Group reporting better than expected revenue -- $505 million, versus $381 million estimate.  The revenue was better than expected.</p><p>The UPS numbers are better than expected on the earnings line, $1.94 versus an estimate of $1.91.</p><p>We've got a mixed story.  The Industrial Average has worsened here.  Dow is now down 25 points.  But the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are higher as we do get some mixed stories in terms of fourth quarter earnings this morning.</p><p>All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here.  Former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is here.  As well as the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Popsockets CEO David Barnett is with us along with Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling.</p><p>Don't miss a moment it.  We've got a big show.  And we want to kick it off right here with our top story this hour.  And that is big tech on tap.  A slew of technology giants reporting earnings this week.  We already heard from Facebook last night and the stock is soaring this morning.  It posted a record profit.</p><p>It reported last night.  It comes after a rocky year for the social media company over privacy concerns.  That stock is up 11 and two-thirds percent.</p><p>We are watching Amazon this morning because it is set to report after the close tonight.  We want to know how Amazon did in the fourth quarter certainly, not just because of the Amazon numbers but because it is an indicator of how the economy did for the holiday season.  It's up one and two-thirds percent right now and Amazon, as you see, at $1,697.</p><p>Check Tesla rattling investors yesterday after falling short on earnings and announcing the exit of its chief financial officer.  The company did however post back to back profits for the first time in its 15 year history.  The stock is down 4.5 percent.  CEO Elon Musk announcing his goal for the year is to see profit in every quarter.</p><p>Let's talk more about that, as we talk with ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's most important in your portfolio of companies in terms of an indicator of more than just that company?</p><p>KEENEY:  So, yes.  When we look at the tech industry overall, so first of all, we're focused on disruptive innovation.  So in times I'd say of economic distress, we often find that the fundamentals of our companies are improving even if, you know, there's more volatility in the market.  And we actually like to take advantage of that volatility.</p><p>So particularly when earnings comes around we have sort of a mixed earnings season, you'll see us doing that through our trading.</p><p>So in particular for Tesla, you know, a lot of people are concerned, the CFO is leaving.  You could take that as he now thinks that the company is sort of ready to fly without him.</p><p>You know, it went through a tough period and he's now ready to head out.  So does it change our long-term thesis that Tesla's going to be a leader in autonomous electric vehicles?  No.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When you talk about Tesla and autonomous technology, this is -- I know you see it, a lot of people see it as a huge market.  But what is it that Tesla has that gives them a specific edge in autonomous transportation?</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So actually last night on the call Musk highlighted this.  We think that their advantage is really in data collection.  They're the only automaker that is collecting data from its cars on the road.</p><p>So last night Musk said that he thinks every other player that's collecting autonomous data has 5 percent of what Tesla has.  That's what you use to train your machine learning algorithm and ultimately make the car improve.  So really with that, we think Tesla can speed away from the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>Yes.  Because that's going to inform on insurance.  That's going to have a lot of implications in terms of all that data that you can get from the car.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  There are a lot of off-shooting effects of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from Amazon?  Tell us your reaction to Facebook.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So Amazon, you know, I'd say overall -- you know, we don't necessarily make quarter to quarter predictions but I will say as we're talking about Tesla, Amazon -- I mean, this is a company that's also moving into the autonomous space.  They're really transforming logistics.</p><p>So we expect them to continue to disrupt companies like UPS, like the other carriers.  So we're excited to see what's coming.</p><p>For Facebook, you know, mobile ad revenue surprised.  It grew 36 percent, more than expected.  This shows that their ad products are really best in class, you know, no matter the controversy that we're seeing in the news.</p><p>And actually from my perspective, Facebook is an interesting company because they could see more viewership or more customers in the back seat of autonomous cars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Why is Facebook up?  I don't get that.  Because there's so many things going wrong with them in terms of the invasion of privacy, selling of private data, yet their stocks are up.  So explain that for me.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  You know, again, I'd say that this quarter really shows that their ad products are just best in class.  And they're one of the only ways to reach users on a widespread basis in today's sort of Internet age.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the metrics are telling you so much about the customer, telling the advertisers so much, so you can really target who you want to talk to.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And those users are sticky and they have Instagram which is increasingly popular.</p><p>One really interesting thing that happened yesterday, we talked about it on this program about this Facebook app that they were pushing on young adults and teens to gather information.  They were paying them like $20 a pop to do that.</p><p>And I think we talked about this yesterday.  Apple has banned that app used by Facebook from its -- basically said that you can't -- they revoked Facebook's permission to maintain that research app that targeted teens and young adults.</p><p>This is really important because this is self-regulation.  We keep talking about the regulation of these technology companies and the regulation by Washington of like Facebook and other social media giants.</p><p>This is self-regulation.  Apple's stepping in and saying no more.  And I think that's very telling about what the road ahead might look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When you've been saying they need to self-regulate for a long time.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned Instagram.  I have been so active on Instagram @MariaBartiromo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're blowing it up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check it out.  Today is throwback Thursday and I put a picture there, back from 1985 and I want to he see your throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I posted it.  And it's really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell, @MorningsMaria.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really, really awful but I did it for you.  My photo is absolutely hideous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't give it away.  We're going o talk about it later on in the show.  Hey, do have you a throwback Thursday photo that you want to share?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm working on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was a child in the 1980s.  I don't remember it very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  I'm loving Instagram.  I'm having fun with it.</p><p>Tasha -- good to see you.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Tasha Keeney joining us.</p><p>Make sure you tune in tomorrow.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January jobs report.  It starts at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow right where we identify where the jobs are right now.</p><p>Before we take a break, check out President Trump's tweet this morning.  He just tweeted, \"He said so great to watch and listen to all these people who write books and talk about my presidential campaign and so many other things related to winning and how I should be doing it.  As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around and say gee, I'm in the White House and they're not.\"</p><p>Yes, the President just wrote that a moment ago.</p><p>We're going to take a break.  When we come back, yes, it is deadly cold -- the record-breaking temperatures causing chaos across the country.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Then the big business of sports betting, millions of Americans will be watching the big game on Sunday, hoping to make some money.  We'll take a look at how the gambling industry is changing the sports world, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A deadly polar vortex is sweeping through the Midwest right now.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It is cold and it is dangerous.  At least nine people have died in causes related to this arctic blast.  One 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.</p><p>The wind chill temps fell to minus 50 degrees in Chicago and, get this, near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.  Flight Aware says that since yesterday there have been more than 21,000 flight delays plus more than 6,000 cancellations.</p><p>Seven people, take a look at this video, stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were about minus 4 degrees and on the water, with a wind chill of minus 30.  Coast Guard officials say the seven people were near Surgeon Bay, Wisconsin near Lake Michigan but they couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>General Motors plants in Michigan are halting production due to the extremely cold weather.  And there's shortage of natural gas following a fire out of a compressor station.  A dozen plants in all are affected.  The utility there is asking customers to voluntarily reduce their use of natural gas.</p><p>Take a look at General Motors' stock, down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And this, firefighters battle a massive blaze at a historic factory in below freezing temperatures.  The Markel Paper Plant burning overnight in New Jersey.  The bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries reported.  It's unclear how the fire started.</p><p>The 86-year=old paper factory has survived several fires in the past but this one happening in the cold weather, pretty historic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  that is incredible how fierce this fire is even in these incredible temperatures.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And then it spread because of the strong wind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Of course.  Yes.</p><p>All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  Well, lot of stories over the cold.  Dagen -- your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We see these stories, we report them and it's always a reminder to think about our first responders, the people who put their lives on the line to protect us all and go out and whether it's police officers, whether it's firefighters, particularly in these horrific weather conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Save people's lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break.</p><p>Place your bets, next up.  Sports betting in focus with the Super Bowl this Sunday.  Millions expected to place a wager on the big game.  The business ramifications next.</p><p>And then hitting board games -- luxury hitting board games, Fashion designer Louis Vuitton with a new twist on Jenga.  Plus a robot who taught himself to play the game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting.  He says this, \"Large sections of the wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go.  Renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border.  The wall is getting done one way or another,\" writes the President.</p><p>Well, \"let's just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games, a wall is a wall,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right.  Super Bowl LIII is just three days away now.  The big game of the season for the Rams and the Patriots.  Also the biggest gaming event, gambling event of the year for fans.  The American Gaming Association projecting Americans will bet upwards of $6 billion legally and illegally on the NFL finale.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Matthew -- it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW KING, CEO, FANDUEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How big of a deal is the Super Bowl for FanDuel?</p><p>KING:  Super Bowl is a huge deal.  If you look across all of our product lines, in the fantasy business we run one of our largest fantasy contests of the year on the Super Bowl.</p><p>We also have big game bingo for those people that aren't interested in fantasy or sports betting.  And then for sports betting, since this is the first year we're going through it in New Jersey, nobody knows how big it's going to be.</p><p>What we know is that it's going to be a huge season for people to try the product for the first time.  It's also going to be a place where in time where people will do more (INAUDIBLE) than they've ever done before.  So it's betting on all the different things.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like how many times Trump will tweet during the game.  That's a prop that you can make.  I don't know.  I just wanted to raise that issue like it's become that granular.</p><p>KING: It is.  I'm sure we can set a line on that.  I don't if we can get approval for it.  We'll have over 450 things you can bet on during the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are some of the more popular ones?</p><p>KING:  Everybody loves the coin toss because it's the first thing.  Most of the volume will still be on the big markets, the money line and the spread.  But then we have a lot of just fun things like who's going to catch the first pass, who makes the first touchdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And how many times does Gronk get targeted, et cetera.  Do you have to be in New Jersey to bet through FanDuel.</p><p>KING:  You absolutely have to.  You have to be in New Jersey.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In other words, the software will not let you bet if you're, saying you're from somewhere else.</p><p>KING:  If you're literally on one side of the bridge, it will let you bet.  If you're on the other side of the bridge, it won't let you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's on the wrong side of the New Jersey tunnel bridge.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can get a taxi.</p><p>KING: We can go.  You know, I am happy to escort you to New Jersey after that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who sits down and thinks of the things to bet on?  And then who sits down and decides here's what the line is going to be?</p><p>KING:  So in terms of the things to bet on, we have a global expertise across a number of markets because we're part of the Paddy Power BetFair portfolio of families.  And so we have decades of bookmaking experience and our marquee is how many things can we think of?</p><p>And so we literally have hundreds of people thinking up what all can you bet on.  And then we also frankly listen to users.  And so we'll talk a lot about what do they want to bet on.  And if they come up with a good idea, we'll set a line for it.  So it's the beauty of having a bunch of analysts and kind of modelers who can really set a line on anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has this business changed in the last, I don't know, two years or so?  I mean your business has gotten much bigger.</p><p>KING:  It has gotten a lot bigger.  So as an industry we've continued to grow the fantasy business.  As a company, we merged our business with Paddy Power BetFair's U.S. subsidiary.  We created the largest online real money gaming business in the U.S. by factor of two.  So really kind of span all of the product verticals that are available.  And then with sports betting we've built the largest online sports betting business in the country in a very quick fashion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the Supreme Court --</p><p>KING:  After the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- decision overturning the federal ban on sports betting.</p><p>KING:  Yes.  So it's been quite a run in the last six months.  We opened our retail location at the meadowlands in July.  It's quickly become one of the largest sports books in the world from a standing start.  And then the Web site has just taken off.  You know, orders of magnitude beyond our expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about working with some sports leagues to try and improve their popularity?  I mean I raise the issue of Nascar.  Nascar is in dire need of something to really get people re-engaged with the sport and make them excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even baseball on a smaller level.</p><p>KING:  So baseball, we're going to see -- you know, half a season of baseball.  And baseball was actually a great case study in how betting can help the sport.  If you think about baseball, because you have different innings, it creates a very easy, digestible kind of instance for people to bet on.</p><p>So we actually have people betting on the first five innings.  We have people betting on each inning.  Baseball was really the surprise for us in terms of how much more engagement you could palpably see with people as they went through the sport, just because it makes each game so much more exciting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ask Pete Rose how that worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about Nascar?</p><p>KING:  Nascar, again, every sport has an opportunity to work together.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  First to wreck.  First to wreck -- classic bet.</p><p>KING:  A lot of it comes down to also helping the leagues with their data, right.  So a lot of the leagues have all of this new data that's available and in some cases they're not 100 percent sure what to do with it.  But that's actually our core business, right.</p><p>So if you think about what we've done in fantasy, what we do in sports betting, what we do in horse racing, it's use data and create ways for fans to more deeply engage with the games that they love.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You take a bet up to the person's credit card limit or what is the limit here?  Is there a limit?</p><p>KING:  So we do have limits and we look at it from the perspective of -- the issue kind of revolves around responsible gaming.  And it's an issue we take very, very serious and so we have a standard set of limits.  And then we actually have an entire function that actually thinks about and works with users to make sure that people are playing within their limits because at the end of the day this is a fun product and it should be a fun product.  But we have to be cognizant of responsible gaming issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say -- Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was just going to say when talking about baseball, I said how did that work out for Pete Rose?  It didn't work out real well for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Not so much.</p><p>KING:  But I think you also have to -- I mean there has to be integrity of the sport.  We work very closely with the leagues around how we maintain integrity.  And again, that's a place where we leverage our global expertise.</p><p>I think the other piece is, it highlights the need for regulated gaming, right, because what you see and you can see it in the AGA stats, a majority of what's going to be bet on the Super Bowl is in the illegal markets.  And so part of the reason to push legislation is actually bring that betting activity into the regulated markets where it can be more closely controlled.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gambling and marijuana, we've come a long way in the last 20 years in terms of what's acceptable and what's legal.</p><p>KING:  It is:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Perfectly legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matthew -- thank you so much.</p><p>KING:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  We'll be watching the big game and FanDuel.  Matthew King.</p><p>Remember our own Cheryl Casone will be live in Atlanta tomorrow for the big game.  We'll talk with the legendary Joe Theismann and Shaquille O'Neal with Cheryl tomorrow.  So stay with us for that.</p><p>First -- before we take a break, President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He just said this.  \"Very sadly murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33 percent from 2017 -- to just 33,341.  this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout the country, worse even than Afghanistan, much caused by drugs.  Wall is being built,\" writes the President.</p><p>Quick break and then trade talks in focus, the U.S. and China working on a deal, day two of those talks today.</p><p>Plus security concerns in Europe over Huawei.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>Then big money real estate, Chinese billionaire Xian Jin (ph) who I spoke with in Davos last week at a center of a mega real estate deal.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in high gear now, DowDuPont and General Electric making big moves in the premarket this morning after reporting their fourth quarter.  DowDuPont down 5-3/4 percent right now.  General Electric up 7-1/2 percent, revenue better than estimates, up $0.68 a share at 9.78 on G.E.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning.  Take a look at what we're expecting at the open.  Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning, down 45 points, fractional move but nonetheless had been fractionally lower earlier.  S&amp;P is up just by about a point and the NASDAQ is up 31 points right now, one-half of one percent.</p><p>Celgene hitting the tape, revenue above expectations as earnings on Celgene.  This after the major indices surged yesterday on the Federal Reserve's dovish approach to raising rates for the rest of the year.  Basically the Fed said they're on hold, data-dependent.  Dow Industrials were up better than 500 points at their best at the close.  The Dow closed up 434 points, 1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent, 41 points higher and the NASDAQ up 155 points at the close, 2-a quarter percent higher on NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.  Take a look, mostly higher, FT-100 is up about 30 points, one-half a percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up five points, the DAX Index is lower by 22.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher overnight, as you'll see here with the exception of Korea.</p><p>Parents beware, what you need to know about the expanding ibuprofen recall for infants.  We've got the story.</p><p>And so much for the Chinese pulling out of U.S. real estate, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke within Davos last week, reportedly ready to spend big money for an apartment in New York.  We'll tell you how much.</p><p>And the next step for artificial intelligence, a robot taught itself to play Jenga.  See if you'll stack up later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour, trade tensions, it is now day two of the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C.  President Trump set to meet with China's trade negotiator later today.  Last week, China, a very big topic throughout the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION:  As China right now seems to focus on you know, macro demand management.  The supply side policy has not been stopped and then we continue to push forward for supply-side, well because supply-side structural reform.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  China is at the moment reacting with demand side measures, both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling.  But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in opening the market, that creates a lot of growth potential, that creates productivity enhancement.</p><p>DR. KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb.  So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>WEI SUN CHRISTIANSON, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY CHINA:  I think the China's slowdown is a short-term and it's largely driven by the deleveraging initiative of the government and also the trade tension and weakened sentiment.  But I think if you look at this government reaction to the slowdown is very interesting.  In the past, that they will take it the easy way out and by resorting to this credit-driven stimulus tools and to boost the economy.</p><p>But now, they're more careful because they want to preserve the good result of the deleveraging and the financial sector cleanup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was some comments from Davos last week.  One of the few comments in the -- in the panel related to whether or not China is going to open-up its market, governor, I want to get your take on this.  Because what I found from Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials from China running the financial services industry last week, he showed a real willingness to open up the markets in financial services but is that going to be enough?  That doesn't impact the Trump manufacturing regions of the country.  It doesn't certainly address some of the bigger issues like espionage, like forced transfer of tech and I.P. theft.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But after decades of going the wrong direction, we're taking steps in the right direction.  And I think the pressure that the president has put on China is incredibly positive and people need to give him some air here on this because China is hurting more than the United States is hurting.  They have to play ball.  They're going to have to come to the table and start playing fair.  They haven't done it in decades because nobody made them.  This is a president that's forcing them to have to rethink the way they do trade.  The results is, there's 33,000 new manufacturing jobs.  That's a lot of manufacturing when we were told manufacturing is dead in America.  Well, it isn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the editorial board yesterday had a piece on the separating the Huawei issues from the I.P. theft and the -- and the forced transfer of technology.  James, explain this.  Because I don't understand how you can separate these two.  I mean, if you're talking about stealing trade secrets isn't that what Huawei did?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you separate them in the sense that asking another country to obey the criminal laws of the United States is kind of baseline.  It should be expected of everyone regardless of what the particulars of a trade agreement are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I think -- and I think enforcing our laws is a great step in holding China to account.  But what we're really after is not just don't come here and break our laws, but in your country, give our businesses a fair opportunity, respect our technology and I think part of the sales pitch to China has to be look at the upside for you if you start respecting intellectual property.  It will encourage and energize your entrepreneurs who lately are not that excited about the communist government taking a tighter grip of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just wonder if it's too late.  I mean, I just wonder if at this point China has stolen what it is going to steal, forced enough transfer of technology and now they've invested in patents, they've invested in innovation, they're probably on their way to being number one in all of these industries that the U.S. wanted to be number one in, like robotics and like block chain and the rest.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think you look at the earnings of our great semiconductor companies, you look at Apple, you look at various measures, the answer would be it's not over yet.  The value is still being created in the United States.</p><p>Long-term, obviously we don't know but I don't think it's a -- and this is maybe a reason why this is the moment as the governor said, we are still the world's preeminent economy and preeminent creator of new technology.  Maybe we won't be forever, but this is the time to strike a deal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But we're still innovating and they're still having to steal.  That's the big difference.  And I do believe that entrepreneurship is alive and well in the United States and it needs to continue.  That's the key is making the incentive there and the incentive is still there, at least for now, for American companies to innovate and create something that's disruptive and globe changing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To do that -- to that point, and this is (INAUDIBLE) this morning when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, this is the number one story on the Wall Street Journal website that the United States is changing the visa process for highly skilled workers.  These are the H-1B visas and that starting this April it will basically offer more changes to how the visas are for people who have master's degrees.  Mre than 5,000 more immigrants with master's degrees or higher will get selected for this type of visa.  We need to make sure -- and this is part of the overall immigration issue, make sure that these smart people stay here in the United States.</p><p>And one other thing, Maria, because the Journal also writes about this and you've been talking about this, with all of your guests, particularly at Davos.  That one area where we can push our businesses into China is through services, through banking, through insurance, through consulting.  It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be satisfied with that because he likes to focus on goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the question I asked the governor, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Soybeans, pork.  Because when he talks about the (INAUDIBLE) our trade relationship with Canada, I remembered he say we'll have a trade deficit.  Yes, with goods.  But if you include the services which and we're a service economy, we have a trade surplus with Canada.  So, will a greater export of services into China satisfy President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's not going to satisfy.  The -- what I know is that China wants to open its markets.  It's willing to open its markets in financial services.  Already UBS has gotten the go-ahead.  They own 51 percent of a bank in China.  They're going to be able to own 100 percent of that company within three years.</p><p>Number one, Steven Mnuchin said to me yesterday or two days ago when I was in D.C., well, why are we waiting three years for 100 percent?  They want it sooner, not in three years and financial services doesn't really address President Trump's base, the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, I think China -- we'll see.  I mean, if it's a shell and it's nothing in between, but definitely I think China is willing to do financial services 100 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Foxconn backed off its plans to add manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.  That they're going to focus on research, development and design jobs but they said to make these liquid crystal displays in Wisconsin, that it's too expensive.  So, I don't know how that plays with trade negotiations.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And never forget one important thing, people also want to live in the United States more than they want to live in China for the freedom, for the opportunities.  The most important thing that we in this country that we export to the world --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But will we accept those immigrants?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- is liberty, never forget that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will we accept those immigrants?  That is the core of what is going on in Washington right now.  Do we have open arms and will we raise the number of people we allow to immigrate to this country legally every year?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If China won't embrace the entrepreneurial economy, let's recruit their talent.  And this White House policy, what he's doing is he's reshuffling the existing slots.  What the president ought to say in the State of the Union is we're going to increase the number of PhD engineers that we bring in from China, India and elsewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, parents beware, big story here, infant ibuprofen recalled over potential dangers.  We've got the story and the details next.</p><p>And then a major real estate play, Chinese billionaire  Zhang Xin who I spoke with in Davos last week building her portfolio in the United States, she continues to expand, details on the price tag, next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A nationwide infant ibuprofen recall has been expanded.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Parents listen up, Tris Pharma is expanding avoluntary recall of its infant ibuprofen because the product might contain a higher concentration of ibuprofen than labeled.  The company has added three more lots to the recall list, they were manufactured for CVS and Walmart.  Tris Pharma says there have been no reports of any illness.</p><p>A Chinese billionaire in talks to buy a $60 million apartment in New York City.  The New York post says Zhang Xin is close to acquiring a full floor unit at 432 Park Ave. the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere.  Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of China's largest property developer SOHO China.  And Maria, you talked with Zhang about real estate at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZHANG XIN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SOHO CHINA:  Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buying real estate, and so -- and but now they're worrying on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down.  So then, what does the government do and you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate, buying real estate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The New York Posts says two other units at 432 Park Avenue on the market for $40 million are currently under contract.</p><p>And this, researchers at MIT are showing off their new robot that taught itself to play Jenga.  Using a camera for ayes and two small prongs for fingers.  It can gently remove the pieces.  The robot determines which move is the best one to make by touching the pieces first, testing them out.</p><p>And speaking of Jenga, Louis Vuitton is releasing a $2,400 luxury Jenga set, the 54 L.V. monogrammed pieces are made from plexiglass, not wood.  So, if you ever need an expensive gift, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, making the world better through business, the story of pop sockets and how it's using sales to help charities around the world.  Good story next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pop sockets are taking over cell phones.  They stick to your device to help you get a better grip and make it easier to watch videos.  Today the company is launching the next phase of Poptivism, which it says is aimed at making the world better.</p><p>Here now in an exclusive interview is the CEO and founder of PopSockets, David Barnett.  David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BARNETT, CEO AND FOUNDER, POPSOCKETS:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And PopSockets, what a great idea.  How did you come up with this idea?</p><p>BARNETT:  Well, back in 2010, I was tired of my headset tangling in my pocket.  Each time I took it out, it was tangled.  So, I went down to the nearest fabric store and glued a couple of huge clothing buttons to the backside of my iPhone 3 and wrapped my head set around them, it looked ridiculous.  I got made fun of.  And so, I started tinkering with mechanisms to get the button to expand and collapse, so that it would look a little more respectable and have more functionality, act as a stand, and act as a grip for the phone.  Eventually --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you started off thinking you could just put your headphones around it, but then you realized there were so many other ideas.</p><p>BARNETT:  That was the initial problem which is a lesson for me, that the problem that motivates you start tinkering is not always the problem you end up solving.  So, the current product does solve for that problem.  But that's not what most people use it for.  So, I ended up settling on this accordion mechanism.  And we just finished our fifth year of business.  So, I started out of my garage, in Boulder, Colorado.  And we've sold about a hundred million of these so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A hundred million pop sockets, wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You were a philosophy professor.</p><p>BARNETT:  That is correct.  I'm ready for questions.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When was the moment where you decided iPhone accessories were a better line of work?</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes, all it was -- I would say some -- half of the philosophy professors watching this are laughing at me.  And the other half are probably pretty jealous.</p><p>So, it is -- it can be a lot more fun than being a philosophy professor and sometimes, the problems we're dealing with are a little bit easier, usually.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but an assassin is the mother of invention and you invent something out of necessity.  And I just love entrepreneurial ideas that come from necessity.  You created something.  I'm absolutely in awe of people who do something so simple and when I see it, I say why didn't I think of that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how are you giving back?</p><p>BARNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNETT:  Sure, today, I'd love to share with you.  Today we launched our Poptivism program to the public.  And it encourages anybody sitting here to go to our website, you create your own grip.  So, you upload your own art work, hopefully it work with an artist, unless you're a natural artist.  So, you upload some beautiful graphic and then you can tag any charity you want.  So, any five O's, 503 --</p><p>FREEMAN:  501(c)(3)</p><p>BARNETT:  501(c)(3), thank you, that you would like.  So we have a bunch already lined up for you.  And 50 percent of every sale of that product will go to that charity.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  50 percent of the sale, not the --</p><p>BARNETT:  Not the profit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- income, not the profit, which is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes.  I don't know any other -- any other brand giving this much away and allowing you to design the product.  So it's customized impact.  We have a bunch of different categories of charities including some charities around veteran services, so the Wounded Warrior, Bob Woodruff Foundation, The Mission Continues.  Anyway, long list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  And what are this retail for pop grips?</p><p>BARNETT:  They start at $10.00 for the graphics and they go up to -- there's Swarovski for $50.00.  I have a marble on my -- a genuine marble on my phone today.  And it's -- I believe it's $30.00 for the marble.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you give these to influencers so they use them?  Because I see them all over like reality television.</p><p>BARNETT:  So, the virality of this is partly explained by the fact that celebrities got a hold of them organically.  We don't -- we don't seed the influencers.  We've made some -- we've had some partnerships with influencers but originally this blew up around Los Angeles because celebrities we saw Gigi Hadid and Ryan Seacrest.  And it's just a long list of celebrities using them and that really led to their -- to their growth, quickly.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And that's because it's a great handle for a selfie?</p><p>BARNETT:  Sorry, I should explain it, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Or was it mainly a fashion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  let me see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNETT:  I haven't yet even explained it, you're right.  It collapses and expands and it allows you to move your hand away from the backside of your phone.  I have one of our wallets underneath it.  It allows you to move your hand away.  Once you do that, you can access your whole screen with your thumb.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.</p><p>BARNETT:  Without having to drop your phone.  You can take selfies, photographs much more easily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be doing that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 31, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 013103cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the busiest day for earnings so far, General Electric out last hour.  The stock keeps rising over the last hour.  It is now up better than nine percent on better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>We have an eye on big tech this morning.  Facebook soaring this morning on a record profit reported last night, stock is up 11-3/4 percent even in the face of the privacy scandal.  The stock to watch after the close, Amazon.  Amazon shares right now up two percent.  The company reports earnings after the close tonight.  Markets this morning are looking at a mixed open for the broader averages.</p><p>Take a look.  Dow Industrials right now down 36 points but the S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ, higher by 35 points right now.  This after a sharp rally yesterday fueled by Federal Reserve.  The Dow Industrials up 435 points at the close yesterday.  1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 41, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up 155 points, up 2-1/4 quarter percent.  And the Federal Reserve officially told us they are on hold in terms of data dependency on interest rate hikes.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this.  The European indices right now are most higher.  FT-100 up 35 points, one-half of one percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris up 3-1/2 points, fractional move.  DAX index in Germany down 38 points, one-third of one percent.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, best performer is Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than one percent.</p><p>Back in U.S.  The arctic blast has turned deadly.

We will tell you.  Plus this, attacking the wealthy again.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz answers critics about his success.  Then Roger Goodell breaks his silence.  What he said about the infamous no call during the NHC championship game later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.  And former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you very much.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  The kind of interesting we've been talking about for the last year really, Facebook, how much do users care about these privacy issues.  And last summer we got those results looked look like maybe users aren't really digging this but this latest numbers, you got to say, it looks like users care less about the privacy issues than those of us in media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then they have other areas other than the Facebook business to monetize.  Like with WhatsApp, Messenger, which they're not actually getting any advertising from so far.  So one thing not monetize those think there's an expectations from a business perspective that there's going to be even more growth</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Instagram is kind of the great juggernaut that they have -- or that they're growing, incredibly rapidly but I point this out that because Apple banned this basically data gathering app where they were getting young people in teens to give them all data this is Facebook, Apple bans it, well -- from this app store.  You know what's interesting?  That self-regulation.</p><p>Again, it's not going to be the government that comes in, it's going to be all of these tech companies maybe regulating each other and realizing it might be in their best business interests to not just help them grow incredibly strong but also limit their growth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm more worried about Facebook censoring content.  I don't mean the censoring the classic sense of the government but deciding what people get to see, that worries me more than the privacy issue.  When you sign up for Facebook, you know you're giving away privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't realize is that Facebook is picking for you what you get to see and with 60 percent of Americans now getting most of their news from Facebook.  That's really disturbing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what the Congress is looking at and that's why got those guys, Facebook, Google executives to testify.  Last year in Capitol Hill to see if in fact they are censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentioned Instagram, check out our Instagram post today, it is throwback Thursday.  And posted a shot of way back in 1985, you posted a shot of yourself in the 80s.  Where is your picture?  Post your picture from throwback Thursday Instagram.  I'm having the best time on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  If I looked like you did in the 80s, I would be posting throwback photos while -- may even look like you now but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You look gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No, no.  Maria looks like Sophia Loren and I look -- well, not so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of good looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some good looks this morning.  So check out our Instagram pages.  Meanwhile, we've got a big hour coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Sean Duffy is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson is with us.  Along with L.A. Dodger pitcher Ross Stripling joining us this morning.</p><p>And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in as always.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We kick it off right here with this.  General Electric shares are soaring this morning on strong earnings.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Stock is up nine percent, Susan.  Good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Good morning to you, Maria.  And congratulations for mastering Instagram.  We'll talk about Facebook in just a bit.  But yes, G.E. shares are higher rallying in the premarket and this is because they got a revenue beat, it's actually pretty good for G.E. as you know, it's been shrinking.  There's been problems with the company.  But aviation was strong for G.E. in the quarter and that offset the slowdown.</p><p>And so as some problems that we're seeing in the capital business and also their power businesses as well.  G.E. also by the way settling that DOJ subprime settlements of just around $1-1/2 billion.  This goes back to the 2008 financial crisis.  And as you know, they have been spinning off several businesses in 2018 to spring off some cash flow and to try to make some profit.</p><p>Let's talk about Facebook because also rallying in the premarket, Faceboook shares and as you mentioned stories doing very well for them on Instagram and also on Facebook as well.  And they grew, daily active users and all geographic locations and this is after a downturn of course in Europe and also plateau in North America.  So that's important to watch. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Susan.  Thank you so much.  Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade, the President tweeting about it this morning saying this, China's top trade negotiators are in the United States meeting with our representatives.  Meeting are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides.  China does not want to -- an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal, they're correct.</p><p>I will be meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in Oval Office, no final deal will be made until my friend, President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the longstanding and more difficult points.  Very comprehensive transaction.  Writes the President.  He goes on to say, Chinese representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table.</p><p>All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully revolved.  Tariffs on China increased to 25 percent on March 1st.  So, all working hard to complete by that date.  My next guest is the cosponsor of a bill that will give President Trump executive power to raise tariffs and joining me right now is Wisconsin Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member, Sean Duffy.  Congressman, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  It's good to be with you, Maria.  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DOBBS:  So in the President's tweet just now, he said everything is on the table, all of these tough issues, does that mean that he is also talking about espionage, the forced transfer of technology and the I.P. theft?</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.  I think he is talking about all these issues.  When you have a relationship with trading partner like China, you can't do business for very long.  We have a country like China stealing our intellectual property or the force transfer of intellectual property.  So, yes.  No, this is all on the table.  Here's what I think is going on now, Maria.  We understand that China lies and they cheat and they steal, right?</p><p>So we want to get a deal before March 1st so we don't have that increase in tariffs.  But I don't know that all the other tariffs currently imposed are going to come off on March 1st if a deal is struck because even if you get a deal with China, are they going to implement the deal?  And that's going to take time.  So, we got to actually -- we don't have this trust but verify like Reagan said with the Russians.</p><p>We have I think a philosophy of don't trust and verify with the Chinese because we -- they can sign a document with us, an agreement with us but that doesn't mean they're going to implement that document.  So, folks, if a deal comes and tariffs are lifted, I don't think that's a strategy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that because they did that on beef, right?  They said that they would buy certain amount of beef and then they didn't.</p><p>DUFFY:  Right.  Yes.  You're absolutely correct.  And, so, you know, again, I -- we believe in free trade and we think, you know, having a great trading partner like China where we can, you know, lower tariffs and respect each other's intellectual property is a great relationship but when you see the rising threat of China militarily and their -- and their substantial growth, we have to take a second look at, you know, what they're doing and what risk that poses to our to American way one of life.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, what's -- you know, what President Trump has done brilliantly is, you know, because of these tariffs but also, you know, the knowledge of the force transfer of technology, you see the whole global supply chain changing away from China.  And you can't do business for that long when you steal a technology to people who come to your country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  And Americans are getting -- China is not a good home for business.  There's other places that we can go outside of China and it's having a real impact even on American earnings as you reported are American companies missing some of their numbers, Apple, Nvidia because of lack of sales that are happening inside of China because of the slowdown that has been led by Donald Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, it's interesting because we actually had Steve Ballmer on a couple of months ago, former CEO of Microsoft and he said that the theft from China costs Microsoft $10 billion in profits because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system only a fraction, one percent actually pay for it.  So, there's all of this theft going on.</p><p>What are the metrics that you want to use to check to verify that in fact if you do do a deal that they will follow through on it?  And do I hear you saying that there is no way that tariffs are going to be gone?  That you can't lift tariffs at all because you can't trust what they say they're going to follow through on?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  I think metric is time, Maria.  I mean, we have to give this time to see with actual implementation.  And so I don't know if that's a year or two years, I think -- I think you have a longer runway here on the tariff front with China but you might mentioned intellectual property I think the Chinese are suing us at the WTO for $50 billion of tariffs that President Trump put on the Chinese for intellectual property theft.</p><p>And our analysis is that they steel $250 to $600 billion a year of American technology and they're -- they have their goal to sue us over the $50 billion in tariffs.  I mean, this is rich stuff with the Chinese and I just -- I think we have a president -- President Trump who's willing to actually fight this out for the American people and try to win for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about Foxconn, a major reversal.  We talked about you in the electronics' giant first announced their new Wisconsin factory that was supposed to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs.  Now the research centers for scientists and engineers.  Congressman, what about the manufacturing jobs, how disappointed are you by this reversal?</p><p>DUFFY:  So they're still -- they're still committed to the R&amp;D side of it but you're right on the manufacturing side.  They haven't necessarily pulled out but they have signaled that they will on the manufacturing side of Foxconn.  And Maria, first of all, so they invested $100 million in the University of Wisconsin system to train our workers.  That's fantastic.  They bought buildings, they have land to build their facilities.</p><p>But what's happening, Wisconsin, why is this decision made?  Scott Walker lost.  The guy that won, Tony Evers in Wisconsin was bashing this deal from the very beginning.  So now you have an unfriendly government in Wisconsin who doesn't want Foxconn there.  This a massive investment.  And if you're going to make it, you better have a governor who goes, yes, you know, come to my state, bring us the jobs, I'm happy to have you.</p><p>And that's hasn't been Tony Evers.  And so, they've been attacking this deal from the very beginning.  I don't think this will happen if Scott Walker had won in Wisconsin but it is now because, you know, business -- Foxconn is under attack in our state because of our new governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So you -- so you blame the new governor as --</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For this, how many jobs will be cut then?</p><p>DUFFY:  Well, so they haven't walked away.  They had a promise of 13 million jobs to $10-billion investment.  They haven't walked away from that number.  And by the way, the incentives that we gave for Foxconn to come were tied to the investment and the jobs.  And so they just missed a $10-million incentive because they didn't hit the job number.  So, again, this is still up in the air for us but if you're Foxconn, you really have to consider the politics of our state and what's changed in the last, you know, two months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Before you go, what are you dealing with, negative 26 degrees right there in Wisconsin, Congressman?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  So, it's 27 below, windchills hit up to 50 below, just have been -- people don't get this in the south but our cars don't start here.  The post office, it never shuts down, the post office is shut down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Our ski hill is shut down.  My Congressional office yesterday was shut down.  People couldn't get to work.  So, you know, it's crazy cold and by the way, kids, we have eight kids, seven of them are at home, you coop up kids for two days in the house because they can't go outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Crazy fights are going and you can only watch so many movies, Maria, and play some of the games monopoly before your house is ready to explode.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the whole Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades, so they're staying home from school, right?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  You can't send these little kids out waiting, you know, for a bus to go to school.  I mean, listen you people get hurt in this kind of weather.  So it breaks today, this afternoon we start to see a breaks.  We go from minus 27, I think we have a high today of minus four.  That's the heat wave that's coming our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DUFFY:  And if I can make one last point, Maria, I just watch through the 80s and 90s, I have pull up Instagram pictures of your throwback Thursday.  Huge fan when you're on other networks, I'm a huge fan of you here.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- I'm looking forward too.  If Dagen is up, so we're going to check out Dagen from back in the 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  You know, she has some big, you know, 80s hair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the throwback Thursday, yes.  Well, that picture that I posted in the Instagram is from 1985.  Post your picture, Congressman.  Thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  I got some really bad ones too.  I got big old -- yes.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you soon.  Sean Duffy joining us there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Midwest is facing the coldest temperatures in decades.  The extreme freeze is turning deadly.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice?</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  Yes.  Unfortunately, we're going to have one more day of this and then the cold air will start to retreat but you can see the windchill is most dangerous part of this cold air.  Is across the northern plains, the great lakes, now into the northeast where it feels like minus 13 in New York, it feels like zero in D.C. but minus 40 Fargo, minus 41 is what it feels like in Chicago.</p><p>Those incredible pictures coming out of Chicago of the rivers just freezing.  Green Bay, air temperature, minus 23, windchill minus 23, air temperature in Chicago by the way is minus 21 but it is the windchill that's potentially deadly.  That's why people are urged to stay indoors.  If you've got kids, if you got pets and you want to check on the elderly.  Today will be the really cold day and things will start to improve Friday.</p><p>But windchill advisories and warnings in place for millions of people where the windchill is anywhere from minus 25 to minus 60 especially across the northern plains in the upper Midwest.  OK.  So here is our polar vortex that is dipped as far south as the Tennessee River Valley, Ohio.  By Saturday it retreats up into Canada but we're not done yet heading into Monday.  We start to see it move southward again across the plain states across the great lakes.</p><p>So we're not done.  Now, this cold air, the really cold air is probably done for the season but we're still going to see below freezing temperatures as we get into next week.  But I will tell you as we head into the weekend, Maria, look at this, so minus one, today is the daytime high for Minneapolis but will be in the 40s by Sunday.  And then, Monday, things will start to come down again.</p><p>Here is Chicago where we are dealing with minus 40 degree windchills, by Saturday and Sunday even Monday, 53 degrees.  I mean, that is a 60-degree temperature difference from today and Monday.  So something we're going to have to watch.  These are weather extremes.  Certainly, we'll watch it.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Thanks so much.  Janice Dean with the latest there.  Coming up.  We are watching markets this morning on last trading day of the month today.  Busiest day for earnings.  Dow Industrials down 51, S&amp;P and NASDAQ up.  Next up, L.A. Dodgers pitcher turns stock broker, Ross Stripling in the house with his take on market action.</p><p>Then breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the path to the Super Bowl.  What he had to say right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets in focus this morning, futures indicating a mixed opening for the markets this morning on this.  The last trading day of the month.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 60 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher fractionally.  This after the major indices rallied yesterday big time after the Federal Reserve indicated it has done raising interest rates for now, it will be data dependent.</p><p>But the Dow Industrials were as high as 500 points, better than 500.  it ended up 434 on the Dow.  154 points higher on the NASDAQ.  Joining us right now is Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and B. Riley Wealth Management stock broker, Ross Stripling.  Ross, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, STOCK BROKER, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we got to talk sports but we want to first talk money.  Tell us what you think about what you heard from the Fed yesterday and how you're telling clients to allocate capital right now.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, that was definitely optimistic, you know, coming out and saying that, you know, our economy is growing, spending is strong, they're going to be patient moving forward with the -- with the rate hikes, you know, October, November, December were certainly ugly for me as a -- as a growth investor, you know, that got out of hand but, you know, I definitely think we got oversold.</p><p>And, you know, so we're kind of telling investors, you know, it's a good time to be patient and a good time to be, you know, long-term mined I think if you think back to January 2016,you know, it definitely got oversold in that month and then all the market did was rally 10,000 points over the next two years.  So, I think it's a good time to be patient, you're getting a good -- so you can get some good names at low valuations and obviously, get some of that money back lost that we lost late last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can we go to baseball questions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go for it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So -- I apologize, I didn't watch this when it happened but Wikipedia says, your very first major league start, you had no hitter into the 7th inning and you got pulled out.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So this is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  Thanks for bringing that back up.  No, I'm just kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Basically, the highs and lows of baseball in your first professional appearance.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I mean, man, if you just think about what goes into the -- to a debut of Major League Baseball, I mean, I was just so nervous that day and then to finally get up to game time and then to -- like you said, to be able to go over seven innings of no-hit baseball and then -- and then you get pulled.  I mean, it happens so fast, you know, and I certainly thought about it more since then that, you know, things that will never get to know how would have finished but I've always said that I understood the decision to pull me out.</p><p>I was coming off for Tommy John surgery, I've already thrown a hundred pitches, that was the most I've thrown in two years.  So, you know, we'll never know how it would have ended like I said but I've have always been open about understanding that decision and, you know, maybe I'll get another shot and no-hitter someday.</p><p>MINERD:  Hey, Ross, this is Mike Huckabee and one of the things that I'm most intrigue by is your use of data to prepare for ballgames.  It sounded like a real-life version of Moneyball in modern times.  So explain how do you collect the data and how do you go about using that to plan your own pitching strategy because I think that's fascinating.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Sure.  You know, I'll try and give you the shortest version of that question as possible.  And, you know, the Dodgers are probably kind of leading the way in all that, you know, analytics and things like that.  So we have a whole division that kind of gets the data for me and I mean, they can give you as much as you want and I -- at first when I got up I wanted it all, just give me all the data possible and I will just get what I want out of it.</p><p>But now, after three years, you know, you got to cut it down to what you want which is usually, you know, what guys slug in certain counts, what they hit the hardest, what's their biggest swing and missed pitch.  You can even look like what the man on second base, you know, do they get more aggressive.  There's just tons of data out there, so you kind of pick and choose what you want and use it when you're on the mound.</p><p>That way you're not just like boggled down with data while you're on the mound, you know, at the end of the day you just got to trust your ability to get major league hitters out but you want to use to it come up with a plan and each guy is different and you go over with your pitching coach and your catcher and all of that and you have a plan against every batter, one through nine for any situation and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  -- you know, that's kind of thought.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is really smart.  Let me ask you before you go, Ross, Super Bowl 53, three days away, who are you betting on?  Your hometown Rams or the Patriots?</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I got to go hometown Rams.  I think McVay have some up his sleeve that Bellatrix never seen and they made a lot of acquisitions in offseason on that defense, maybe they can get a big stop on Brady.  So I'll take the Rams.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Ross, great to have you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow, we'll bring you live coverage of the January jobs' report starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

Blake Burman is live this morning at the White House with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  Just one meeting among that group, 17 Democrats, Republicans trying to hash out a border security package, and already this morning, we are seeing a pretty big amount of frustration being expressed by President Trump.  Just moments ago, he sent out the following tweet about that group saying the following quote, \"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time.  Democrats, despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not goings to give money to build the desperately needed wall.  I've got you covered, wall is already being built, I don't expect much help.\"</p><p>You'll remember over the last few weeks as well as the President was trying to hash out a deal or at least Democrats and Republicans were, about securing wall funding that the President said, Well maybe we can call this steel slats or a physical barrier.  Doesn't need necessarily need to be called a wall.  He's backing off that today as well because he tweeted this this morning, \"Let's just call them wolves from now on, and stop political games, a wall is wall, give you a pretty good idea of where his mindset is after just one meeting from this group up on Capitol Hill.  Meantime, the Pentagon says that several thousand more troops are going to be heading to the Southern Border.  The Undersecretary for policy testifying up on Capitol Hill earlier this week that several caravans are headed north.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN C. ROOD, UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY:  Current information shows a caravan of over 12,000 people.  There's three that we are tracking, the Department of Homeland Security's tracking en route, and one of which is over 12,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Didn't get an exact number from the Pentagon, Maria.  Currently, there are 2,500 give or take active duty service members down at the Southern border.  That is down from a high of nearly 6,000, but the pentagon says several thousand more are headed that way.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the White House this morning.  Let's bring in Former New Mexico Governor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations, and Former Presidential Candidate, Bill Richardson.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much for joining us this day, this mooring.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean this whole idea of -- that they can't get together, on an agreement for the wall or for any kind of barrier, what do you think this means?  I mean is this going to be the next two years where the Congressional Democrats are constantly resisting everything the President wants?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, the first thing you need to do is the President needs to get off this idea that unless he gets his way, there's going to be a government shutdown.  That was very damaging to the country.  And I think to the President, too.  This is early.  Look, the early talks, did not go well yesterday.  But we got until February 15th.  You don't negotiate until the very end to get the best deal for both of you.  But, look, if there are more caravans, we're sending more troops.  I was a border governor, like Mike Huckabee, governors, we got to deal with these things directly.</p><p>What we need is more border detection equipment at the border crossings, Coast Guard needs to have more facilities.  You don't need a wall.  You go under a wall, over a wall, you have tunnels like El Chapo.  That's not going to solve the problem.  Let's have significant border security and agree on increase border patrol agents' budget --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, I want to -- I want to bring in Governor Huckabee in a moment, but you said we don't need a wall.  Are -- isn't it true though that in some border security agree on we need a wall.  For example, there is a wall in Nancy Pelosi state right now, which separates Tijuana and San Diego.  We're at the very dense area.  You've got three million people on one side of the Tijuana wall, and other three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear down that wall, isn't it -- doesn't it -- I mean do you think those people would just assimilate into the United States?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look, I'm not advocating tearing down what is existing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but you said we don't need a wall.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I'm saying that for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That wall worked.  Would you say that that will work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No.  Well, that deal does not -- or no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why not tear it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, it's -- no, it's not working.  It's not working.  It's that they have good border patrol agents, detection equipment, they know what they're doing ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would be OK tearing it down then?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- they have (INAUDIBLE) the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then you would be OK tearing it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Makes no difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think that the three million people on the Tijuana side would assimilate into the three million people in the San Diego (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, I don't.  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Without that wall?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't.  You're using scare tactics.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not scare -- I'm just saying the facts, sir.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Border enforcement -- no, no, no, you're not.  Those are not facts.  Border immigration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- illegal immigration has gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's gone down.  It's gone down.  Totally all across the border.  It's gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All I'm asking you is does that wall work to separate Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't think it makes much of a difference, but I'm saying leave it where it is.  But give them more resource, more border patrol agents detection equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think the President's just saying that as well.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Go in depth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, jump in here because I think that the President does want a wall in certain areas but in other areas said, you said that agrees with the Democrats in terms of technology and drones.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ambassador, you're one of my favorite democrats.  You know I love you, but I remember when Duncan Hunter was the one who put the appropriation in for that wall in San Diego, 95 percent of the drug trafficking stopped.  I'm looking at Israel.  They put up a wall, a security fence.  They were condemned for it, but they went from a thousand suicide bombers.  I agree that walls don't need to go for the entire border because there are certain y natural barriers, some electronics, but I just can't believe that people say that walls in certain places, whether it's a fence, whether it's a steel slat, just would not have an effect, and if that's true then we should tear down the 600 miles that we already have, and I don't know of anybody who realistically thinks that makes good sense.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, Mike, first of all, the tactics that are being used to get that wall, which I think is very dubious to build because I don't think it'll work and it's too expensive is that if the President doesn't get his way, he's going to shut down the government, and he's going to do harm to 800,000 Federal workers, businesses, and then this wall, Mike, I mean it's going to take landowners out of there, it's going to take ranchers, indigenous people, wildlife.  You're right, and most of the border, you can't build the wall because of the hills, because of the terrain, so --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Bill he has been very flexible in saying that it's a combination of all of those things, it's not just a wall.  But you say he's not been willing to give.  I've not seen Nancy Pelosi give one inch, not one inch, and he's offering DACA, he's offering all sorts of concessions, he's making compromise, but where -- tell  me exactly where Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer is offering any kind of concession or compromise.  I can't find it.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, they are offering significant funding increases in Border Enforcement and Detection Equipment, that will work, that will work, Mike.  And then the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's not just to answer President Trump.  That's because --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- says, \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down -- I'm going to shut down the government.  That is unprecedented, that is damaging the country.  Are we going to allow any President, they don't get their way, that the answer's got to be I'm going to down the go of year?  Mike you're a good politician.  You're my favorite Republican Politician.  This border shutdown was not good for the President for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, actually I think that the --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The country blinds him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when you look at the polls, the President really didn't get impacted very much.  Nancy Pelosi's approvals actually went down.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, I don't know what poll you're reading, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- and the President is tweeting -- wait.  Governor, the President just tweeting this morning --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't know what poll you're reading.  It was significant damage to the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning.  Let me tell you what he says.  He says, \"Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime.  Your reaction.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Oh, I mean this -- you know, he's into his campaign mode.  This is like when he says to his intelligence people that we spend over $20 billion in intelligence, CIA, NSA, Department of Defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that -- is that tweet incorrect?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- all of North Korea, they're my -- they're my buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that -- is that tweet inaccurate?  Wait, is that tweet inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally inaccurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate?  What's inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The whole thing.  The whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, late term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's like the President's saying to his intelligence fee --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- higher taxes?  Which one?  Later term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Open borders?  Wait, which one?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know, this is -- this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate, governor?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  This is ridiculous.  No.  Open borders?  That's ridiculous.  All of that is ridiculous.  There should be serious negotiations right now.  And it's not happening.  And the President's not helping with these tweets.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know the thing is?  I mean I know that a lot of your colleagues say that they're for border security, but they didn't vote for Kate's law, they didn't vote to end Sanctuary Cities, they didn't vote for a border wall, so how can you say you're for border security when you actually haven't done so in terms of your voting record?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look at what the Democrats are proposing for this showdown, one, more border patrol agents, two, more Coast Guard assistance, three, more drones, four, all kinds of new technologies that will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they voted for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  A border wall is not going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they vote --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did Nancy Pelosi vote for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That -- perhaps that wall she voted for on her border.  All I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is that not immoral?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- let's make this work.  Let's make this work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  But not threaten border shutdowns, not end the government working, that's what the President is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  All right.  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook reporting a record profit.  The stock is soaring this morning.  Joining me now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, good morning, Maria.  You know, I wasn't looking at that profit report for the profit number or profit margin, I was looking at it to see how many active monthly users they've got.  When I saw that number come over, 2.7 billion, I figured that Facebook was out of the woods.  Think of all the scandal, all the bad publicity, all the privacy questions that have been leveled against Facebook in the last, what, year or six months?  It--- it's not touched their business.  I thought that the scandal may have reduced the number of monthly users, active users on the -- on the base, but it didn't.  They've actually increased.  And that's why I think Facebook is up so much this morning, 11 percent gain for a stock like that is absolutely enormous.  My bottom line is this, all the scandal did not touch its financial business.  The heart of its business was not touched by all the political goings-on around it.  Facebook, 167.  Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible.  You're right, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It really is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis.  I know you have a lot more in about 12 minutes' time.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we'll see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank so much.  \"Varney &amp; Co.\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

I grew up literally in public housing in the projects.  And I have succeeded in America I always thought that was something to be celebrated, that my success should not be something that is punitive.  My success is living proof of the promise of the country.  I can't find the answers why people are all of a sudden chastising me for being successful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Many Democrats are caffeinated against him, criticizing Schultz over his potential presidential run saying he will only help to reelect President Trump.

We're showing you our best looks from the 80s, that's next stay, with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is throwback Thursdays here on the MORNINGS WITH MARIA set.  Here's me from circa 19857.  I was working in a photo lab, printing pictures.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I told you, Sophia Loren.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Care-free days.  I don't even know that I was thinking about what stock to buy.  I don't even know that I was thinking about me being a journalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at this complexion.  This is even before -- well, it's before the internet really, but the no photo filters, you're glowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see yours, Dagen McDowell.  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I told you I'm really ugly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do they have it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, Governor Huckabee with his daughter.

And lastly, the photo James Freeman gave us.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so this is me.  You asked for a throwback --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- Thursday photo of James Freeman.  Apparently, this is the Reverend James Freeman.  Apparently, he was an outstanding preacher.  Governor, you might want to grade his performance, I don't know, but very influential in Boston.  My kids ran across this a few weeks ago while sightseeing, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You couldn't find any shots of yourself as a baby.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I -- well, I did -- if you give me more time, I'll try and find it.  But I told you, I never went with the mullet.  My great regret, so I don't know if we're going to have really fun 80s photos, but I'll do my best.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  Deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday, we'll do another throwback Thursday, how's that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You got to let me know in advance and so we I can dig some photos out of my -- well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.

Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God, you're lucky the game has been great in the last year, Goodell, because you're terrible and people hate you.  No more than --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, people hate him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us how you really feel.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  What do you really think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, let's call some folks down in New Orleans and ask them how they feel.  Anyway.  No, they do, people don't -- excuse me, they don't like him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.

And good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday, it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Busy morning on earnings this morning.  We will hear from UPS, General Electric, both ahead of the open this morning.  Big technology still in focus, Facebook reporting last night after the close, big quarter for Facebook, Amazon will be the one to watch today after the close tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the arctic blast turns deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their lowest levels in decades.  We will take you to the Minneapolis region this morning, where the negative 24 degrees is having a real impact.  The push to tax the wealthy, J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly saying that the richest Americans can afford to pay higher taxes, but there's a catch.  Then, Roger Goodell breaking his silence, what he said about the infamous no-call during the NFC championship game coming up later this hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets this morning.  Let's check Futures showing a mixed opening this morning after a huge day yesterday.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 15 points at the open.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ up fractionally right now after a solid day of trading that all stock surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell signaled that the Central Bank may pause interest rate hikes for now.  The Fed on pause.</p><p>Technology giant, Facebook, meanwhile also reporting fourth-quarter earnings.  Look at that market yesterday, up 434 points at the close, it was a big day.  And that, by the way, was off of the highs of the day after the Fed meeting.  Facebook earnings beat expectations posting a record profit for what has been a difficult year for the social media company.  Take a look at Facebook shares this morning, up 11-1/3 percent right now, 167 and change.  Earnings season rolling on today with Amazon reporting after the bell tonight.  Take a look at all the names that we're expecting today in what is really the busiest week -- one of the busiest weeks for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Here now, the founder of Disruptive Technology Research Lou Basenese.  Lou, it's good to see you.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on Facebook, your reaction to the quarter last night.</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, I am just shocked and disappointed in this rally.  I mean, I think this is really putting forward that investors and management favor profit growth over ethics.  I mean, look, this week, we had -- I think one of the -- just biggest disappointments in privacy protection with the Facebook research app.  I mean, just total disregard for Apple's wishes, total disregard for teenage users' privacy, and yet, investors are cheering profit growth.  So, look, I can't argue with the fundamental numbers.  I mean, the stock is reasonably valued, you've seen growth come back in the U.S. as the key market, and advertisers just don't have any other outlet, any other alternative to reach 2 billion potential viewers.  So, it's one of those things, it's a toxic investment, to me.  So, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you wouldn't touch it?</p><p>BASENESE:  I wouldn't touch it.  Look, I think there's a lot of risk embedded there.  What's the next privacy scandal that's going to come to light?  Facebook, over the years, has really made more excuses than changes to what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's talk about the Fed -- the Fed essentially on hold yesterday saying it's on hold, indicating that more dovish stance when it comes to interest rate hikes.  What was your reaction to what the Fed said in particular also saying that the balance sheet unwind is also a way that they could pull back and perhaps stop the 50 billion sales a month.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, I don't think I can remember in my lifetime just a more dramatic turn of sentiment at the Fed.  I mean, in October, they were saying that we're a long way from neutral and now, yesterday's statement said that we're within range.  I mean, they went from playing hardball with the President to playing patty cake, and you know, investors love that.  So, you know, more easy monetary policy coming.  I think they gave themselves some flexibility on unwinding the balance sheet.  Not that they didn't say that they were going to be data dependent before, but now they just made that much more of a point to communicate to the markets that there's not going to be a fast and hard unwind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we were sort of expecting this in the last couple of months, that's for sure.  But would this be a signal for you to put new money to work in stocks?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think absolutely.  Look, the Fed has been supportive of stock prices.  I mean, there's a lot of people that would argue this bull market would not be around without the Fed.  So, with the Fed being very accommodative, I think it's time to come back into the market, we're going to see that.  You've seen a dramatic reversal even in the more speculative areas of the market.  And I think I pointed out before in another appearance that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tremendous bounce off the lows, up almost 20 percent, and about to breakthrough to the 200-day moving average.  So, yes, it's risk on again.  At least to the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Two more things on stocks, we've got earnings, obviously, the middle in -- we're in the middle of a very busy period.  DowDupont just reported they beat on earnings per share at $0.88 a share but they missed on revenue at 20.1 billion versus an estimate of 20.9 billion, how would you characterize the earnings season so far, and what does that telling you about the backdrop?</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, it's a mixed bag.  We haven't really seen a huge beat rate on the earnings on the bottomline.  I think the top like is being less impressive.  So, on DuPont's report, it's epitomizing it, right?  We're seeing some earnings growth but the demand on the top line is not there.  So, look, I think we're in more of a stock picker's market.  It points more towards active management and really trying to find those companies that are overcoming the China hangover that are finding strength despite some pockets of weakness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a focus is economic data for you?  We've got the January job's report out Friday morning, tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting 165,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9 percent.  We had the ADP numbers earlier this week, they were strong.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes.  No, they're very strong.  Look, I'm a tech guy first, but I'd love to see tailwinds and the job's market supporting that.  I think many people thought we might have a slowdown just because of the government shutdown, and just that extreme volatility in December that might have put some businesses a little uneasy about hiring.  But the ADP Report like you mentioned this week, pointing to just continued strength, so another positive for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you're thinking we're going to get a pretty good year, 2019.</p><p>BASENESE:  As of now -- look, a lot can change, I mean, look what happened in December.  So, I don't want to go on the record and say it's a -- it's a foregone conclusion 2019 is going to be great, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you've got put money to work either way, so what do you do?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think -- I put money to work.  Look, I like the semiconductor industry particularly companies like NXP, really undervalued at about 11 times earnings.  And the chipmakers are going to make this world go, from here into the future.  About a trillion semiconductors shipped last year.  They go into every big growth trend that you can think of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess.  I mean, even more so with 5G on the way.  Lou, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lou Basanese joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow morning.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January job's report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We've got our \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" special where we identify where the jobs are right now.  Meanwhile, Amazon earnings after the bell, the company poking fun in its own Alexa devices for going haywire in this year's Super Bowl ad.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Your take on that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I love Super Bowl ads, and Amazon is advertising during the big game for the fourth straight year, two spots including part of this one, we're going to show you a 90-second spot with some popular names.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But trust me, there are a lot of fails.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Alexa, play my podcast.</p><p>ALEXA:  When you heard that, did that surprise (INAUDIBLE) that seems exciting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need an Alexa dog collar.  Four dogs.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering dog food, ordering dog food.</p><p>HARRISON FORD, ACTOR:  You can bark all you want, I'm not paying for any more dog food.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering gravy.  Ordering sausages.</p><p>FORD:  Hey, you better cancel that order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa hot tub sucked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa, play music.  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, that's just a little bit of a snippet of that ad, Maria.  Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker among the well-known celebrities in that ad.  Just that 90-second spot will set Amazon back more than $15 million, $5 million per 30-second spot for Super Bowl ads.  This is a little ironic because Amazon has really ramped up spending on national television advertising, you know, a real innovator in terms of online advertising, streaming video, but Amazon spends every year now on national T.V. advertising, $680 million a year, that's about doubled from 2015.  It spends more than Toyota and even McDonalds every year on T.V. ads.  Why the Super Bowl?  Do we even need to tell you, more than 100 million people are going to watch this, and it has a very diverse viewing base, about 47 percent of the viewers last year ladies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we watch for the commercials or do we watch for the game?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The game.  The game always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both, I'm both.  That commercial really resonated though with the dog ordering everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who doesn't love Harrison Ford.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you.  We will keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deadly polar vortex sweeping through the Midwest.  Lauren Simonetti with the details on that.  Lauren, it is cold there.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is cold.  And speaking of Amazon, they're not delivering in some Midwest cities because it is so cold, but at least -- this is deadly, at least nine people have died in causes related to the historic -- this historic arctic blast when 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.  Windchill temperatures falling to minus 50 degrees in Chicago.  And near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.</p><p>According to FlightAware, since yesterday, there have been more than 21,000 flight delays and more than 6,000 cancellations.  Seven people stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were around minus four degrees with windchill of minus 30.  Coastguard officials say the seven people were near Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, but couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>Some General Motors plants in Michigan halting production due to the extremely cold weather and also a shortage of natural gas following a fire at a compressor station.  A dozen plants affected and all the utility there.  Also, asking customers to please reduce their use of natural gas, but there is such demand at this time of year.  Let's take a look at shares of G.M. down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And then, there's this, firefighters battling a massive blaze at an historic factory in New Jersey below freezing temperatures.  The Marcal Paper plant burning overnight, the bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out, as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries fortunately reported here.  It is unclear how this fire started.  The paper factory is 86 years old.  It survived several fires in the past.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, even in the face of that cold weather, fire burning wildly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren, thanks.  Coming up, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon now saying he has no problem with the wealthiest Americans paying even more taxes.  There is a catch, though, we're going to bring you what he said.  Then, breaking his silence, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no-call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.  But the Saints player and a coach weigh in on Goodell and the controversy.  All ahead right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining us, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Member, Sean Duffy, is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N. and former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson, is with us.  FanDuel CEO Matthew King join us ahead of the Super Bowl.  And PopSockets Founder, CEO David Barnett joining us as well.  The Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and stockbroker Ross Stripling is with us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>We kick it off here with this, paying your fair share, the push from the far left getting reaction from corporate America now.  J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, reportedly saying that he is willing to pay higher taxes that the wealthiest Americans can afford to pay more.  He also said that those dollars, though, need to be spent wisely by the government.  Here's what he told me earlier this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on what we're hearing now from, for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  She says she think that the top-end of earners should pay as high as 70, 80 percent tax rates?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  Yes.  Look, I -- you know, I always separate the corporate side, the business side, which I think we need it to be competitive with the individual side.  And so, you know, people have all different theories, but individual side would maximize returns and stuff like that.  So, I'm not -- I don't get involved in that debate because I'll leave that to politicians.  That is actually less important for economic growth than the business side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The top 10 percent already pay 80 percent of all the tax.</p><p>DIMON:  They do.  But in America, you have to look at tax (INAUDIBLE) I mean, a lot of payroll tax are aggressive, sales tax are aggressive, real estate tax are aggressive.  So, you look at the big picture, anyone would say, we should relook at this and make it better and more efficient and fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, is here along with former Arkansas Governor, Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee, great to see you, guys.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Wonderful to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  Your reaction to Jamie Dimon.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He can pay all the taxes he wants.  There's not a thing in the federal code that prohibits him from writing a check to the federal government.  If he's feeling guilty that he's not paying enough, do it.  When I was governor, I did a fund called the \"tax me more fund\" because a bunch of legislators kept saying we need to raise taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So I had envelopes printed and everywhere I went to make a speech, I pass them out, and said, you don't think you're paying enough, send it in, as much as you want until you feel better.  In two years, we raised $1168, a thousand, which was given by one Democrat legislator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is good.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because nobody wants to pay more taxes.  They say they do but they don't.  That's just a lie.  And so, this nonsense that I'd like to pay more taxes, do it, go ahead, be the first, write the check then prove it to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's -- there's just such a range of the ultra-rich, somebody like Jamie Dimon with $1 billion, somebody like a Warren Buffett with, what, $45 billion to other rich people as well with, what, $250,000 or $1 million, right?  So, the range is so huge.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, he's close to -- at his age, he's close to retirement so he doesn't really need to worry about income taxes that much.  Ask him about the Elizabeth Warren wealth tax, where she's going to come and confiscate his money.  How does he feel about that?  Because by the way, if he's talking about income taxes, half of this country doesn't pay any income taxes, and any net income taxes.  So, our Defense Department isn't funded by half this country.  Education at the federal level not funded by half this country.  Somebody has got to pay.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Top one percent as you alluded to in the interview, currently paying more than the bottom 90 percent combined in terms of federal income taxes.  But this is really about how you distribute wealth.  Let's think about growth, let's think about how to get everyone making more instead of how to take it from some people, but I think he does raise a good question, which is -- isn't really better for our society if we take more from Jamie Dimon and give it to the government, and the question of who's going to invest it better, random government agency or Jamie Dimon, who probably perhaps puts it in to public companies, maybe he invests in financial technology start-ups.  I think the track record would say Jamie Dimon is probably going to invest that money better than a Washington bureaucracy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You got to be kidding, James, you mean to tell me --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Controversial statement, I know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- that you think Washington would squander money after we send it to them?  Well, I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  Such --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, and I think the shutdown --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- stewards of our tax money.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the shutdown really raises questions about whether the federal bureaucracy is currently overstaffed as we -- as we think about spending.  It took a long time for most people to notice an impact and it was basically when the essential workers started furloughing themselves at TSA gates.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the air traffic controllers, really, that caused the problems over the -- over the weekend.  I just want to point that out.  But again, it's appalling to make people work and not pay them, I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's get to now the 2020 line-up because Howard Schultz and other wealthy business guys, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Fox News yesterday, telling Dana Perino that President Trump should not be taking credit for the strength of the economy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the reduction in the corporate tax rate of 21 percent was wrong and irrational.  He missed a massive opportunity for comprehensive tax reform.  But if you look at the facts, the facts are 40 percent of the American people do not have $400 in the bank.  5 million young people in America, mostly Black and Latino are not in school and not in work.  One out of six Americans are food insecure.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Yes.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  So, no, I don't give him, the President credit for any of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHULTZ:  And I do not give him credit for saying for two years that the stock market is proxy for the economy.  He is going to fall on his sword for that because that economy is not going to last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, your reaction.  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know how you argue that the higher growth in the Trump presidency during the Trump era is unrelated to his policies of cutting taxes and regulation.  I understand Mr. Schultz is a Democrat now thinking of running as Independent.  He's sort of charting a middle course, he's saying Trump doesn't get credit for the company, while also saying Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax is a bad idea.  But I think on this count he's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, it's crazy to actually look at what has happened in 2018 with the growth numbers and not tie it to not just the tax cuts but also the deregulation, the policies of the Trump administration did move the needle on growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can take the other side of that.  I think it's pretty clear that what the Federal Reserve has been doing is really what has propped up the stock market in a major way, and you saw the rally yesterday now that interest rates are on hold.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the last couple of months.  But I'm talking about 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we are in a position where we're not going to keep growing at three percent right now for myriad reasons, whether it's the global economic slowdown, or problems here at home.  But according to the Wall Street Journal survey of economists conducted this week, we're now below two percent growth in the first quarter and at 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter.  So, right now, we don't look like we can sustain that three percent growth number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's a guess.  That's an estimate, we should point out.  We'll get the hard data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I don't think there is a reason we can't continue to grow at three percent.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but the big mistake Schultz made was that he dried to say I won't go after the Republican voters.  And then he insulted Republicans by saying that tax cuts and deregulation really don't matter.  Ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We got to talk about the Federal Reserve coming up and what did the Fed say yesterday.  Then, justice for Senator Rand Paul, he's awarded damages after being attacked by his neighbor in 2017.  We will tell you how much money is coming to him.  Then, sky high entertainment, we'll tell you how competition is heating up between airlines over who's keeping their passengers entertained better.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Lexington Herald-Leader calling out the Kentucky Governor for saying, \"America is weak for closing schools during the polar vortex.\"  Governor Matt Bevin also said, \"We're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in a fetal position somewhere in a warm place.\"  He did add that he was being a little facetious.  The Star Tribune in Minnesota writing this morning about how veterans are suing saying 3M combat earplugs caused hearing injuries.  At least 11 lawsuits by that have filed -- have been filed this month against the company, accusing of knowingly selling defective earplugs for use in combat.  This is after 3M had already paid $9.1 million to settle government allegations.</p><p>The L.A. Times taking a look at the in-flight entertainment arms race in a tight competition for flyers, airlines stepping up their free offerings.  The article details how airlines are trying to one-up each other from United's free T.V. on some of its planes through American Airlines free T.V. and Apple music.  I haven't seen any of this, what about you, James?  Dagen?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, at what point in the -- at what temperature should kids not have to walk to school?  I don't know.  I'm not sure the governor -- you don't -- you don't necessarily need to swing at every pitch.  I think Mr. Huckabee could tell us about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I've swung at a few I wished I hadn't, absolutely.  Matt Bevin is a great governor.  I'm going to be with him Saturday night in Elizabethtown, in fact, so I'll pass along your sentiments.  But I think it's one of those things that he said in not so much specifically about the vortex, just that as a whole, we are as a country, raising softer kids, and I think that's probably an assessment.  In the context of how cold it was yesterday, maybe the timing, you know, is not perfect, but I think I understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, right, left, or middle of the road, as a nation, we've lost the ability to shut up and say nothing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're like virtue signaling about everything and looking for validation based on a retweet, whether it's by the President himself or Alyssa Milano.  That's how we get out -- that's how we derive our self-worth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We have 250 channels on television plus satellite and internet, 168 hours a week and something has got to fill up that space.  So, that's where we are as a culture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And gone is the lowly book.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe the kids should go out in that weather but get medals for it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  For participating in --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pat on the back for that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the Russia probe, President Trump is reportedly leaving the Mueller report decision in the hands of the Department of Justice.  We'll tell you about what went down yesterday.  And then a big day for earnings, G.E. set to hit the tape in just a few minutes.  We will have the numbers for you, and take a look at how it's impacting markets.  The stock is up two percent ahead of the report.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>General Electric just coming out, and the earnings are below expectations.  The stock right now is higher in the premarket.  Company's reporting $0.17 cents a share, versus an estimate of $0.22 cents a share, as you can see.  Stock at $9.21 a share, we'll keep watching this as we dig through these numbers.</p><p>More big names reporting today, UPS, ConocoPhillips, MasterCard, out later this morning, we'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Revenue on G.E. is better-than-expected at $33.28 billion versus an estimate of $32.6 billion.</p><p>So, maybe that's what's really moving the stock this morning, revenue, better-than-expected on General Electric.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning, take a look at markets, we are expecting a flat opening right now, after a monster rally yesterday, Dow Industrials unchanged, S&amp;P 500 up 3 points, and the NASDAQ up 28.  The major indices tacked on big gains yesterday after the fed said that it was on hold, in terms of raising interest rates for the foreseeable Future.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 435 points at the close, one and three quarters of a percent, and that was off of the highs of the day.  The S&amp;P 500 finished up 41, that was 1-1/2 percent higher, the NASDAQ was up 154 points, the Fed signaling that maybe, maybe, two rate hikes come this year, but it was all dependent on the data.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices look like this, as you see, higher across the board, FT 100 up 43 points, two-thirds of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index up nine points, fractional move, in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, mostly higher, as you see there, best performer, Hong Kong and Japan, up better than one percent a piece.</p><p>Back in the U.S., Arctic conditions have left at least nine people dead, nearly 15,000 flights have been cancelled or delayed due to the weather, and the polar vortex bringing a phenomenon to the skies.  We've got the details, coming up.</p><p>Then, justice for Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator has been awarded damages after he was attacked by his neighbor, we'll tell you how much.</p><p>Plus, breaking his silence, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Whenever officiating is part of any kind of discussion, post gate, is never a good outcome for us.  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.</p><p>We are getting a first look at General Electric earnings this morning, it is a mixed report, $0.17 cents a share is weaker than the estimated $0.22 cents a share, but the revenue is much higher than estimated, $33.28 billion on revenue for the fourth quarter, on General Electric.</p><p>Joining us right now is Pacer ETFs Distributors President, Sean O'Hara, and it is good to see you, Sean.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETF'S DISTRIBUTORS:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll go in to some of the flows and what you're seeing in terms of ETFs, how would you characterize the earning season, give us your take on the backdrop, so far?</p><p>O'HARA:  I think the backdrop is sort of like what we talked about last time I was here, which is you're starting to see a little bit of a slowing in terms of the earnings.  So, we got a little bit spoiled, perhaps, in 2018, we're such, you know, meteoric, if you will, earnings growth, 20, 25, 26, 28 percent.</p><p>And now, we're getting into a phase in the market where, you know -- it's just not sustainable to continue to do that.  So, I think we're adjusting to what's going on with regard to earnings more than anything.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, maybe if expectations have been set too low, we've been, sort of, discussing whether the U.S. can hit three percent growth again, this year, I mean, what does it -- what does it mean if we are growing at three percent?  Are these -- are these stocks cheap at this point?</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't know that stocks are necessarily cheap.  If we get to 3 or 3-1/2 or 4 percent, then I think they're cheap.  And I think that's the big wild card.  Are we going to get that kind of economic growth, particularly since we don't really know yet what the effect on the economy is going to be to shut down?</p><p>I mean, this was not a normal shutdown.  This was not like three or four days until they argue, and then somebody gave in, this was over a month.  And so, there's going to be some effect.  I just don't think we know exactly what it is yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of the Federal Reserve, yesterday, on hold at this point, even talking, as we expected, Dagen, about the balance sheet, possibly pulling back on the -- on the unwind as well.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes, I mean, there was -- there's generally been three, like, headwinds, if you will, for the market, one was what's the fed going to do, one was trade in China, and then the third is the slowing earnings thing that we talked about.</p><p>What I saw yesterday and what I think I heard yesterday, everybody sort of hears their own interpretation of what's going on.  But what I heard is, is that the Fed is going to be more accommodative than they have been, as far as their posture is going forward.</p><p>I don't know if that's reaction to the stock market, I don't know if that's a reaction to something they see with regard to earnings or the economy.  But I think one of those headwinds was essentially removed yesterday from what people's expectations are, going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will raise this issue.  Clearly, investors love what they heard from the Federal Reserve.  But it was a complete about-face from what they've said six weeks ago.  And at some point, do investors start wringing their hands about the economy, about economic growth around the globe, and even here at home.</p><p>We've seen weak growth in France and Germany, that's the story in the Wall Street Journal today.  Will you have a different reaction in the days ahead, when people really digest whoa, what is Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve see, in the months, in the year to come, in the U.S. economy?</p><p>O'HARA:  I mean, of the three things we've talked about, the Fed, trade in China and earnings, clearly to me, the earnings piece of it is the most important part.  That's what drives stock prices from a fundamental perspective is what are they making in terms of earnings, from free cash flow.</p><p>So, I think that's the big one, but I think if you're a little bit of a skeptic and you wanted -- you want to be a little bit more intellectually curious, if you will, I think what you would do is you would do what you're doing, Dagen, and say I wonder what they know that they're not telling us yet, because they really have made a pretty remarkable change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I would say in the last couple of weeks, I think it became clear that we were seeing real issues in Europe and China -- I mean, you know, whether it'd be France, the budget issues in Italy, Brexit and the uncertainty in the U.K.</p><p>So, we knew, going into the Fed meeting that Europe was slowing and China growth has slowed.  And in fact, I think it was becoming more and more well-known that the Federal Reserve had pivoted.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, you said you were stunned in the commercial break.  I wasn't stunned by yesterday's -- I mean, I wasn't stunned, at all, actually.  I was expecting the Federal Reserve to tell us they were on hold.</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't think they said they were -- what I said I was stunned by was, how aggressive I feel like Powell was, in his position, saying that we will use anything we have, including the balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>O'HARA:  That was the new one.  It's always been about ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what Dagen --</p><p>O'HARA:  -- the balance sheet came in to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What Dagen is saying is, the backdrop, what the Fed is recognizing, is what we -- what we are starting to understand better.  And that is we're talking about a slowdown.  We're looking at a slowdown and that is -- we don't live in a vacuum.  Of course, the U.S. is going to be impacted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why you weren't surprised, because of your interview with Ray Dalio and your ongoing interviews with Ray Dalio and what he said.  What did he say last week?  That the Federal Reserve is not going to raise this year and could cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- or do something with balance sheet to be more accommodated.  That's what they said.  But I don't think that the rest of the market has quite digested that.  They need to go back and watch your Ray Dalio interview.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and all interviews in Davos last week.  It was pretty much unanimous that we're facing a U.S. slowdown.  What wasn't unanimous was how steep it might be.  Look, G.E. and debt, the company's debt is now over $100 billion.  The Journal is reporting if G.E. were to sell its jet leasing business, it could eliminate up to $40 billion in corporate debt.</p><p>G.E. capital owns and leases thousands of planes and helicopters to carriers around the world.  The stock is up two and a quarter percent, I don't know.  The earnings, amiss, but I guess people like the fact that the revenue is better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and this is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And low expectations for this company --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That too.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- and stocks, generally.  By the way, I'm not sure the Fed has changed all that much.  What we are seeing is this is the Jay Powell strategy of we're not going to let locked into a long-term plan, we're going to watch the data, as you said, the market signals lately, have been bad, inflation lately, signals that it's mild.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But at the end of the fourth quarter, they were on auto pilot.  They were like, $50 billion a month, three rate hikes, right?  So that is where the pivot is that I'm referring to.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  But I don't think it means we're not getting rate hikes this year.  If the economy grows faster than the consensus, and I happen to think it probably will, then you could see some rate hikes.  But they're saying we're watching the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They might not hike at all, like Ray Dalio said, they might end up cutting, because from the last hike to the first cut, it's as usually a six-month period, granted they need to slow down the balance sheet reduction before they do that.</p><p>One thing I want to note, to connect the G.E., the level of debt there, and what the Federal Reserve did, that's why the market was freaking out when the Fed was continuing to move a quarter point every three months, or every -- because of the level of indebtedness of corporations, the level of indebtedness of the United States and individuals in this country.</p><p>We are a nation that can't handle even three percent short-term rates and that should be frightening to people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you've said that a lot, actually, Sean O'Hara, great to see you.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining.  We didn't even mentioned your INDS, which Kevin Kelly wanted us to, up 14 percent year to date, using money flows into some cooler ETFs.</p><p>O'HARA:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Sean.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Turning to the Mueller report this morning, President Trump says he will leave the decision up to the Department of Justice, according to the Daily Caller exclusive.  Joining us now is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Chris, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  You have an exclusive interview with President Trump, tell us what you learned.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER:  We learned that he's going to keep his hands off of the Department of Justice, for the Mueller report and how to handle that.  He's going to leave the ball in that court.  We learned that he's very concerned about some bigotry in the Democratic Party.</p><p>We talked to him about the new fight yesterday with Governor Northam about abortion.  These are -- and we also learned something very interested to think it's been a little bit under pledge so far, that he's going to put an end to any potential deal that's been reported out on the ninth circuit, on allowing Democratic judges to be re-nominated on the ninth circuit.</p><p>He said he's going to put an end to that deal and try to stack the ninth circuit with judges who are more in line with President Trump's view of how they should be.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think that's an important point you just made, Christopher, because of all the things that the President is doing that even his critics have to appreciate, I'm talking about his Republican critics, is that he is reshaping the judiciary to a constructionist point of view, and if he were to reneged on that, I think it would be disastrous for him and frankly, disastrous for the entire country.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think anyone on the right will certainly agree with that.  He had -- that's one of the major accomplishments he's made, and there's still a lot more that they can do.  There are currently more vacancies in the court than they were when he took office.</p><p>There's a lot more that Mitch McConnell can be doing to pushing this and moving it faster.  But one thing that -- one thing that is certain is, with the control of the Senate, the GOP has really no incentive to give any leeway on this, the ninth circuit has been thorn on the side of the administration over and over and over again --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  -- and to make any deal like the Wall Street Journal reported would not be in the benefit to the President.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Chris, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if you've covered this with the President, but related to these various probes, investigations, did he give any indication that he's thinking or planning to release more documents, declassify more documents, get the full story out about the 2016 election and how our government came to spy on people affiliated with this campaign.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We were pretty careful when we pushed him on the issue.  He said over and over again, that he was going to leave the decisions, for now, to his Department of Justice.  The ball was on their court.  He was hoping that they made the right decisions, but that he was going to allow them to make them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the big -- the big cojones, if you will.  Maybe he's wait to release the declassified documents when another opportunity arises where he needs to offset some investigation there, because there are a lot of investigations that are unwinding right now from the Democrats in Congress.  Did he say anything about that?  What his strategy is, in the face of all of these investigations?</p><p>BEDFORD:  So far, he doesn't need to make any moves right now.  He appeared last night when we were speaking to him to be more hands off on this matter.  But he can make any decision he wants to when it regards to declassification --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: -- or, at least, a report later on.  There's no need for him to cause a tizzy in the Congress.  And we've seen the executive branch has been lawyering up as the Democrats prepare for investigations.  Those are coming either way, but he hasn't -- he didn't show his cards too strongly on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford from the Daily Caller, there.  Coming up, breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, finally addressing the controversial no-call that pushed the Rams into the Super Bowl finals.</p><p>And a rare sun phenomenon appears in the Midwest.  Check this out, after one of the coldest weather snaps in decades, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Justice for Senator Rand Paul after a brutal attack.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A Kentucky jury, Maria, awarding Senator Paul more than $580,000 in damages in his lawsuit against his neighbor who attacked him in 2017.  Earlier this month, the Republican senator sat down with you, Maria, talking about his injuries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I had six broken ribs, three of them broken and then separated so they were round upon each other for months until they healed.  I had pneumonia twice, I had fluid around my lung and now I have hernia (INAUDIBLE) repaired from this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The senator says, the verdict sends a clear message that violence is not the answer.  The neighbor's lawyer says, they will appeal.</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaking publicly for the very first time about the blatant non-call in the NFC championship game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODELL:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Goodell says, he spoke with Saints players about that play.  But one player denies that and says, he hasn't heard from Goodell at all.  Well, the Saints coach, Sean Payton, may not be buying what Goodell is saying either.  Twitter pointing out that, at a recent press conference, Sean Payton appeared to be wearing a t-shirt that shows Roger Goodell dressed as a clown.  There you go -- the comparison.  Either way, the Super Bowl, without the Saints, is just three days away and our very own Cheryl Casone will have live coverage from Atlanta starting tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And to the weather outside, the polar vortex bringing a rare weather effect to parts of the Midwest and plains -- and it's pretty beautiful, called the Sundog.  It happens when ice crystals in the atmosphere interact with sunlight in a certain way.  More Sundogs are expected in the Midwest as this deep freeze continues for a little bit longer, but what a pretty picture in the sky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very pretty.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor and I both tell Lauren how to say Sundog -- Sundog.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Sundog.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get it right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, corn dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, winter weather gripping the nation, as you just heard.  We will take you live to Minneapolis next.  And then, an eye on earnings this morning, big day for energy companies.  Plus, Amazon announces its quarterly numbers after the bell; we have got the preview back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are talking about the deadly polar vortex.  The Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades.  Ray Bogan is in Minneapolis this morning with the very latest where the temperature is negative 25-degrees, Ray.</p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning, it is very cold here.  You know, it was supposed to be about 0-degrees today, forecasted to be at one point.  However, it's not, just a couple of minutes ago, actually, it got even colder.  It is now negative 30-degrees.  I just saw a picture of the thermometer at the National Weather Service here in Minneapolis.  We're at the Minneapolis Airport where all morning planes have been taking off and landing throughout the week.  They've had relatively few cancellations and delays, they've been lucky in that way, but that has not been the case around the Midwest where there have been thousands of cancellations and delays.  The worst of those being at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports.  A few people have gotten stranded as a result of all of -- all of this.</p><p>Now, take a look at some of these record low temperatures.  It's been freezing out in Chicago.  They had negative 23-degrees, that's the lowest since 1985.  In Minneapolis, we had a reading of negative 28 -- that was the lowest since 1996 and in Des Moines, Iowa, they set a new daily record low of negative 20-degrees.  And you could see, it's having a big impact on nature too.  This is Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, a beautiful lake during the summer time where you can go boating, eat at restaurants along the shore but now it is frozen over.  That is definitely not happening, but on Sunday, there's the possibility that here in Minneapolis, it could be 75-degrees warmer than it is right now and people are looking forward to it.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's incredible that we are talking about these temperatures now.  But next week, they go all the way back up.  Ray, thanks very much for braving the cold for us and showing us, really, firsthand what it's like out there.  Ray Bogan is live in Minneapolis.  We felt the cold this morning even in New York, and it's only what -- it was one-degree when you scale it out.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think Governor Bevin would be proud of Ray for doing that report outside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I thought Ray was getting ready to rob a 7Eleven, the way he was dressed.  I wasn't sure.  You know, it's cold.  I flew it from Florida yesterday to come to here.  And I'm thinking why, what was I thinking?  What's wrong with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why.  This is why you're in Virginia?  I mean, in New York?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank God you're not doing this show outdoors today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we wouldn't do that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, when you were in Davos, how cold was it?  It was like five-degrees.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was five or 10-degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You sat outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we did for three --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For three hours, at least, if not longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I had lots of layers on and got my ice breakers on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can confirm, Ray is correct that Lake Geneva is lovely in the summer time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, big day for earnings.  We're hearing names like Blackstone Group, UPS, ConocoPhillips at the top of the hour, at 7:00 a.m.  All the numbers, what they're doing for markets, when we come back.

We finally have wages growing.  And we're going to hear this tomorrow.  Wages growing north of 3 percent in this country which is not something that we've seen in a decade.  Not during all the years that President Obama was president did wages in this nation grow north of 3 percent.  And that's a really -- that's a very positive sign and people are feeling it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  And I think it's a very, very important sign that employment for minorities, both Hispanics and African Americans, are at record highs.  And that is very significant because there's nothing that is more stimulating to the economy than people having employment and having a job.</p><p>It not only cuts the cost of government where the government has to subsidize people, but it empowers people and gives them something that they can put on the table for their families that otherwise they couldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that in this presidential election as all these Democrats get their -- sharpen their elbows and start basically sticking each other in the neck, that that's going to be -- and the attacks on Howard Schultz by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that he didn't climb the ladder -- I'm paraphrasing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this is what it's going to come down to.  Do you root for the success of individuals in this country and is our policy and our regulation, is it set up to basically encourage that success, to climb out of a housing project in Canarsie, to run and basically create one of the greatest American success stories of the last 50 years which is what Howard Schultz did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the question of socialism is ultimately does it lead to equality or does it lead to mediocrity.  And if you look around the world historically it does not lead to equality.  Equality lifting everybody's boat.  It leads to mediocrity if not disaster.  And Venezuela is a wonderful example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There was a time Venezuela was quite vibrant.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, incredible.  Prosperous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But let me just tell you that the earnings have come out.  Blackstone Group reporting better than expected revenue -- $505 million, versus $381 million estimate.  The revenue was better than expected.</p><p>The UPS numbers are better than expected on the earnings line, $1.94 versus an estimate of $1.91.</p><p>We've got a mixed story.  The Industrial Average has worsened here.  Dow is now down 25 points.  But the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are higher as we do get some mixed stories in terms of fourth quarter earnings this morning.</p><p>All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here.  Former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is here.  As well as the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Popsockets CEO David Barnett is with us along with Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling.</p><p>Don't miss a moment it.  We've got a big show.  And we want to kick it off right here with our top story this hour.  And that is big tech on tap.  A slew of technology giants reporting earnings this week.  We already heard from Facebook last night and the stock is soaring this morning.  It posted a record profit.</p><p>It reported last night.  It comes after a rocky year for the social media company over privacy concerns.  That stock is up 11 and two-thirds percent.</p><p>We are watching Amazon this morning because it is set to report after the close tonight.  We want to know how Amazon did in the fourth quarter certainly, not just because of the Amazon numbers but because it is an indicator of how the economy did for the holiday season.  It's up one and two-thirds percent right now and Amazon, as you see, at $1,697.</p><p>Check Tesla rattling investors yesterday after falling short on earnings and announcing the exit of its chief financial officer.  The company did however post back to back profits for the first time in its 15 year history.  The stock is down 4.5 percent.  CEO Elon Musk announcing his goal for the year is to see profit in every quarter.</p><p>Let's talk more about that, as we talk with ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's most important in your portfolio of companies in terms of an indicator of more than just that company?</p><p>KEENEY:  So, yes.  When we look at the tech industry overall, so first of all, we're focused on disruptive innovation.  So in times I'd say of economic distress, we often find that the fundamentals of our companies are improving even if, you know, there's more volatility in the market.  And we actually like to take advantage of that volatility.</p><p>So particularly when earnings comes around we have sort of a mixed earnings season, you'll see us doing that through our trading.</p><p>So in particular for Tesla, you know, a lot of people are concerned, the CFO is leaving.  You could take that as he now thinks that the company is sort of ready to fly without him.</p><p>You know, it went through a tough period and he's now ready to head out.  So does it change our long-term thesis that Tesla's going to be a leader in autonomous electric vehicles?  No.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When you talk about Tesla and autonomous technology, this is -- I know you see it, a lot of people see it as a huge market.  But what is it that Tesla has that gives them a specific edge in autonomous transportation?</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So actually last night on the call Musk highlighted this.  We think that their advantage is really in data collection.  They're the only automaker that is collecting data from its cars on the road.</p><p>So last night Musk said that he thinks every other player that's collecting autonomous data has 5 percent of what Tesla has.  That's what you use to train your machine learning algorithm and ultimately make the car improve.  So really with that, we think Tesla can speed away from the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>Yes.  Because that's going to inform on insurance.  That's going to have a lot of implications in terms of all that data that you can get from the car.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  There are a lot of off-shooting effects of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from Amazon?  Tell us your reaction to Facebook.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So Amazon, you know, I'd say overall -- you know, we don't necessarily make quarter to quarter predictions but I will say as we're talking about Tesla, Amazon -- I mean, this is a company that's also moving into the autonomous space.  They're really transforming logistics.</p><p>So we expect them to continue to disrupt companies like UPS, like the other carriers.  So we're excited to see what's coming.</p><p>For Facebook, you know, mobile ad revenue surprised.  It grew 36 percent, more than expected.  This shows that their ad products are really best in class, you know, no matter the controversy that we're seeing in the news.</p><p>And actually from my perspective, Facebook is an interesting company because they could see more viewership or more customers in the back seat of autonomous cars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Why is Facebook up?  I don't get that.  Because there's so many things going wrong with them in terms of the invasion of privacy, selling of private data, yet their stocks are up.  So explain that for me.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  You know, again, I'd say that this quarter really shows that their ad products are just best in class.  And they're one of the only ways to reach users on a widespread basis in today's sort of Internet age.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the metrics are telling you so much about the customer, telling the advertisers so much, so you can really target who you want to talk to.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And those users are sticky and they have Instagram which is increasingly popular.</p><p>One really interesting thing that happened yesterday, we talked about it on this program about this Facebook app that they were pushing on young adults and teens to gather information.  They were paying them like $20 a pop to do that.</p><p>And I think we talked about this yesterday.  Apple has banned that app used by Facebook from its -- basically said that you can't -- they revoked Facebook's permission to maintain that research app that targeted teens and young adults.</p><p>This is really important because this is self-regulation.  We keep talking about the regulation of these technology companies and the regulation by Washington of like Facebook and other social media giants.</p><p>This is self-regulation.  Apple's stepping in and saying no more.  And I think that's very telling about what the road ahead might look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When you've been saying they need to self-regulate for a long time.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned Instagram.  I have been so active on Instagram @MariaBartiromo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're blowing it up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check it out.  Today is throwback Thursday and I put a picture there, back from 1985 and I want to he see your throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I posted it.  And it's really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell, @MorningsMaria.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really, really awful but I did it for you.  My photo is absolutely hideous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't give it away.  We're going o talk about it later on in the show.  Hey, do have you a throwback Thursday photo that you want to share?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm working on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was a child in the 1980s.  I don't remember it very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  I'm loving Instagram.  I'm having fun with it.</p><p>Tasha -- good to see you.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Tasha Keeney joining us.</p><p>Make sure you tune in tomorrow.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January jobs report.  It starts at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow right where we identify where the jobs are right now.</p><p>Before we take a break, check out President Trump's tweet this morning.  He just tweeted, \"He said so great to watch and listen to all these people who write books and talk about my presidential campaign and so many other things related to winning and how I should be doing it.  As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around and say gee, I'm in the White House and they're not.\"</p><p>Yes, the President just wrote that a moment ago.</p><p>We're going to take a break.  When we come back, yes, it is deadly cold -- the record-breaking temperatures causing chaos across the country.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Then the big business of sports betting, millions of Americans will be watching the big game on Sunday, hoping to make some money.  We'll take a look at how the gambling industry is changing the sports world, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A deadly polar vortex is sweeping through the Midwest right now.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It is cold and it is dangerous.  At least nine people have died in causes related to this arctic blast.  One 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.</p><p>The wind chill temps fell to minus 50 degrees in Chicago and, get this, near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.  Flight Aware says that since yesterday there have been more than 21,000 flight delays plus more than 6,000 cancellations.</p><p>Seven people, take a look at this video, stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were about minus 4 degrees and on the water, with a wind chill of minus 30.  Coast Guard officials say the seven people were near Surgeon Bay, Wisconsin near Lake Michigan but they couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>General Motors plants in Michigan are halting production due to the extremely cold weather.  And there's shortage of natural gas following a fire out of a compressor station.  A dozen plants in all are affected.  The utility there is asking customers to voluntarily reduce their use of natural gas.</p><p>Take a look at General Motors' stock, down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And this, firefighters battle a massive blaze at a historic factory in below freezing temperatures.  The Markel Paper Plant burning overnight in New Jersey.  The bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries reported.  It's unclear how the fire started.</p><p>The 86-year=old paper factory has survived several fires in the past but this one happening in the cold weather, pretty historic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  that is incredible how fierce this fire is even in these incredible temperatures.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And then it spread because of the strong wind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Of course.  Yes.</p><p>All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  Well, lot of stories over the cold.  Dagen -- your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We see these stories, we report them and it's always a reminder to think about our first responders, the people who put their lives on the line to protect us all and go out and whether it's police officers, whether it's firefighters, particularly in these horrific weather conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Save people's lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break.</p><p>Place your bets, next up.  Sports betting in focus with the Super Bowl this Sunday.  Millions expected to place a wager on the big game.  The business ramifications next.</p><p>And then hitting board games -- luxury hitting board games, Fashion designer Louis Vuitton with a new twist on Jenga.  Plus a robot who taught himself to play the game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting.  He says this, \"Large sections of the wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go.  Renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border.  The wall is getting done one way or another,\" writes the President.</p><p>Well, \"let's just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games, a wall is a wall,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right.  Super Bowl LIII is just three days away now.  The big game of the season for the Rams and the Patriots.  Also the biggest gaming event, gambling event of the year for fans.  The American Gaming Association projecting Americans will bet upwards of $6 billion legally and illegally on the NFL finale.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Matthew -- it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW KING, CEO, FANDUEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How big of a deal is the Super Bowl for FanDuel?</p><p>KING:  Super Bowl is a huge deal.  If you look across all of our product lines, in the fantasy business we run one of our largest fantasy contests of the year on the Super Bowl.</p><p>We also have big game bingo for those people that aren't interested in fantasy or sports betting.  And then for sports betting, since this is the first year we're going through it in New Jersey, nobody knows how big it's going to be.</p><p>What we know is that it's going to be a huge season for people to try the product for the first time.  It's also going to be a place where in time where people will do more (INAUDIBLE) than they've ever done before.  So it's betting on all the different things.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like how many times Trump will tweet during the game.  That's a prop that you can make.  I don't know.  I just wanted to raise that issue like it's become that granular.</p><p>KING: It is.  I'm sure we can set a line on that.  I don't if we can get approval for it.  We'll have over 450 things you can bet on during the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are some of the more popular ones?</p><p>KING:  Everybody loves the coin toss because it's the first thing.  Most of the volume will still be on the big markets, the money line and the spread.  But then we have a lot of just fun things like who's going to catch the first pass, who makes the first touchdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And how many times does Gronk get targeted, et cetera.  Do you have to be in New Jersey to bet through FanDuel.</p><p>KING:  You absolutely have to.  You have to be in New Jersey.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In other words, the software will not let you bet if you're, saying you're from somewhere else.</p><p>KING:  If you're literally on one side of the bridge, it will let you bet.  If you're on the other side of the bridge, it won't let you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's on the wrong side of the New Jersey tunnel bridge.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can get a taxi.</p><p>KING: We can go.  You know, I am happy to escort you to New Jersey after that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who sits down and thinks of the things to bet on?  And then who sits down and decides here's what the line is going to be?</p><p>KING:  So in terms of the things to bet on, we have a global expertise across a number of markets because we're part of the Paddy Power BetFair portfolio of families.  And so we have decades of bookmaking experience and our marquee is how many things can we think of?</p><p>And so we literally have hundreds of people thinking up what all can you bet on.  And then we also frankly listen to users.  And so we'll talk a lot about what do they want to bet on.  And if they come up with a good idea, we'll set a line for it.  So it's the beauty of having a bunch of analysts and kind of modelers who can really set a line on anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has this business changed in the last, I don't know, two years or so?  I mean your business has gotten much bigger.</p><p>KING:  It has gotten a lot bigger.  So as an industry we've continued to grow the fantasy business.  As a company, we merged our business with Paddy Power BetFair's U.S. subsidiary.  We created the largest online real money gaming business in the U.S. by factor of two.  So really kind of span all of the product verticals that are available.  And then with sports betting we've built the largest online sports betting business in the country in a very quick fashion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the Supreme Court --</p><p>KING:  After the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- decision overturning the federal ban on sports betting.</p><p>KING:  Yes.  So it's been quite a run in the last six months.  We opened our retail location at the meadowlands in July.  It's quickly become one of the largest sports books in the world from a standing start.  And then the Web site has just taken off.  You know, orders of magnitude beyond our expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about working with some sports leagues to try and improve their popularity?  I mean I raise the issue of Nascar.  Nascar is in dire need of something to really get people re-engaged with the sport and make them excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even baseball on a smaller level.</p><p>KING:  So baseball, we're going to see -- you know, half a season of baseball.  And baseball was actually a great case study in how betting can help the sport.  If you think about baseball, because you have different innings, it creates a very easy, digestible kind of instance for people to bet on.</p><p>So we actually have people betting on the first five innings.  We have people betting on each inning.  Baseball was really the surprise for us in terms of how much more engagement you could palpably see with people as they went through the sport, just because it makes each game so much more exciting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ask Pete Rose how that worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about Nascar?</p><p>KING:  Nascar, again, every sport has an opportunity to work together.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  First to wreck.  First to wreck -- classic bet.</p><p>KING:  A lot of it comes down to also helping the leagues with their data, right.  So a lot of the leagues have all of this new data that's available and in some cases they're not 100 percent sure what to do with it.  But that's actually our core business, right.</p><p>So if you think about what we've done in fantasy, what we do in sports betting, what we do in horse racing, it's use data and create ways for fans to more deeply engage with the games that they love.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You take a bet up to the person's credit card limit or what is the limit here?  Is there a limit?</p><p>KING:  So we do have limits and we look at it from the perspective of -- the issue kind of revolves around responsible gaming.  And it's an issue we take very, very serious and so we have a standard set of limits.  And then we actually have an entire function that actually thinks about and works with users to make sure that people are playing within their limits because at the end of the day this is a fun product and it should be a fun product.  But we have to be cognizant of responsible gaming issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say -- Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was just going to say when talking about baseball, I said how did that work out for Pete Rose?  It didn't work out real well for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Not so much.</p><p>KING:  But I think you also have to -- I mean there has to be integrity of the sport.  We work very closely with the leagues around how we maintain integrity.  And again, that's a place where we leverage our global expertise.</p><p>I think the other piece is, it highlights the need for regulated gaming, right, because what you see and you can see it in the AGA stats, a majority of what's going to be bet on the Super Bowl is in the illegal markets.  And so part of the reason to push legislation is actually bring that betting activity into the regulated markets where it can be more closely controlled.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gambling and marijuana, we've come a long way in the last 20 years in terms of what's acceptable and what's legal.</p><p>KING:  It is:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Perfectly legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matthew -- thank you so much.</p><p>KING:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  We'll be watching the big game and FanDuel.  Matthew King.</p><p>Remember our own Cheryl Casone will be live in Atlanta tomorrow for the big game.  We'll talk with the legendary Joe Theismann and Shaquille O'Neal with Cheryl tomorrow.  So stay with us for that.</p><p>First -- before we take a break, President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He just said this.  \"Very sadly murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33 percent from 2017 -- to just 33,341.  this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout the country, worse even than Afghanistan, much caused by drugs.  Wall is being built,\" writes the President.</p><p>Quick break and then trade talks in focus, the U.S. and China working on a deal, day two of those talks today.</p><p>Plus security concerns in Europe over Huawei.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>Then big money real estate, Chinese billionaire Xian Jin (ph) who I spoke with in Davos last week at a center of a mega real estate deal.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in high gear now, DowDuPont and General Electric making big moves in the premarket this morning after reporting their fourth quarter.  DowDuPont down 5-3/4 percent right now.  General Electric up 7-1/2 percent, revenue better than estimates, up $0.68 a share at 9.78 on G.E.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning.  Take a look at what we're expecting at the open.  Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning, down 45 points, fractional move but nonetheless had been fractionally lower earlier.  S&amp;P is up just by about a point and the NASDAQ is up 31 points right now, one-half of one percent.</p><p>Celgene hitting the tape, revenue above expectations as earnings on Celgene.  This after the major indices surged yesterday on the Federal Reserve's dovish approach to raising rates for the rest of the year.  Basically the Fed said they're on hold, data-dependent.  Dow Industrials were up better than 500 points at their best at the close.  The Dow closed up 434 points, 1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent, 41 points higher and the NASDAQ up 155 points at the close, 2-a quarter percent higher on NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.  Take a look, mostly higher, FT-100 is up about 30 points, one-half a percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up five points, the DAX Index is lower by 22.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher overnight, as you'll see here with the exception of Korea.</p><p>Parents beware, what you need to know about the expanding ibuprofen recall for infants.  We've got the story.</p><p>And so much for the Chinese pulling out of U.S. real estate, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke within Davos last week, reportedly ready to spend big money for an apartment in New York.  We'll tell you how much.</p><p>And the next step for artificial intelligence, a robot taught itself to play Jenga.  See if you'll stack up later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour, trade tensions, it is now day two of the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C.  President Trump set to meet with China's trade negotiator later today.  Last week, China, a very big topic throughout the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION:  As China right now seems to focus on you know, macro demand management.  The supply side policy has not been stopped and then we continue to push forward for supply-side, well because supply-side structural reform.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  China is at the moment reacting with demand side measures, both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling.  But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in opening the market, that creates a lot of growth potential, that creates productivity enhancement.</p><p>DR. KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb.  So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>WEI SUN CHRISTIANSON, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY CHINA:  I think the China's slowdown is a short-term and it's largely driven by the deleveraging initiative of the government and also the trade tension and weakened sentiment.  But I think if you look at this government reaction to the slowdown is very interesting.  In the past, that they will take it the easy way out and by resorting to this credit-driven stimulus tools and to boost the economy.</p><p>But now, they're more careful because they want to preserve the good result of the deleveraging and the financial sector cleanup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was some comments from Davos last week.  One of the few comments in the -- in the panel related to whether or not China is going to open-up its market, governor, I want to get your take on this.  Because what I found from Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials from China running the financial services industry last week, he showed a real willingness to open up the markets in financial services but is that going to be enough?  That doesn't impact the Trump manufacturing regions of the country.  It doesn't certainly address some of the bigger issues like espionage, like forced transfer of tech and I.P. theft.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But after decades of going the wrong direction, we're taking steps in the right direction.  And I think the pressure that the president has put on China is incredibly positive and people need to give him some air here on this because China is hurting more than the United States is hurting.  They have to play ball.  They're going to have to come to the table and start playing fair.  They haven't done it in decades because nobody made them.  This is a president that's forcing them to have to rethink the way they do trade.  The results is, there's 33,000 new manufacturing jobs.  That's a lot of manufacturing when we were told manufacturing is dead in America.  Well, it isn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the editorial board yesterday had a piece on the separating the Huawei issues from the I.P. theft and the -- and the forced transfer of technology.  James, explain this.  Because I don't understand how you can separate these two.  I mean, if you're talking about stealing trade secrets isn't that what Huawei did?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you separate them in the sense that asking another country to obey the criminal laws of the United States is kind of baseline.  It should be expected of everyone regardless of what the particulars of a trade agreement are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I think -- and I think enforcing our laws is a great step in holding China to account.  But what we're really after is not just don't come here and break our laws, but in your country, give our businesses a fair opportunity, respect our technology and I think part of the sales pitch to China has to be look at the upside for you if you start respecting intellectual property.  It will encourage and energize your entrepreneurs who lately are not that excited about the communist government taking a tighter grip of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just wonder if it's too late.  I mean, I just wonder if at this point China has stolen what it is going to steal, forced enough transfer of technology and now they've invested in patents, they've invested in innovation, they're probably on their way to being number one in all of these industries that the U.S. wanted to be number one in, like robotics and like block chain and the rest.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think you look at the earnings of our great semiconductor companies, you look at Apple, you look at various measures, the answer would be it's not over yet.  The value is still being created in the United States.</p><p>Long-term, obviously we don't know but I don't think it's a -- and this is maybe a reason why this is the moment as the governor said, we are still the world's preeminent economy and preeminent creator of new technology.  Maybe we won't be forever, but this is the time to strike a deal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But we're still innovating and they're still having to steal.  That's the big difference.  And I do believe that entrepreneurship is alive and well in the United States and it needs to continue.  That's the key is making the incentive there and the incentive is still there, at least for now, for American companies to innovate and create something that's disruptive and globe changing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To do that -- to that point, and this is (INAUDIBLE) this morning when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, this is the number one story on the Wall Street Journal website that the United States is changing the visa process for highly skilled workers.  These are the H-1B visas and that starting this April it will basically offer more changes to how the visas are for people who have master's degrees.  Mre than 5,000 more immigrants with master's degrees or higher will get selected for this type of visa.  We need to make sure -- and this is part of the overall immigration issue, make sure that these smart people stay here in the United States.</p><p>And one other thing, Maria, because the Journal also writes about this and you've been talking about this, with all of your guests, particularly at Davos.  That one area where we can push our businesses into China is through services, through banking, through insurance, through consulting.  It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be satisfied with that because he likes to focus on goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the question I asked the governor, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Soybeans, pork.  Because when he talks about the (INAUDIBLE) our trade relationship with Canada, I remembered he say we'll have a trade deficit.  Yes, with goods.  But if you include the services which and we're a service economy, we have a trade surplus with Canada.  So, will a greater export of services into China satisfy President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's not going to satisfy.  The -- what I know is that China wants to open its markets.  It's willing to open its markets in financial services.  Already UBS has gotten the go-ahead.  They own 51 percent of a bank in China.  They're going to be able to own 100 percent of that company within three years.</p><p>Number one, Steven Mnuchin said to me yesterday or two days ago when I was in D.C., well, why are we waiting three years for 100 percent?  They want it sooner, not in three years and financial services doesn't really address President Trump's base, the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, I think China -- we'll see.  I mean, if it's a shell and it's nothing in between, but definitely I think China is willing to do financial services 100 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Foxconn backed off its plans to add manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.  That they're going to focus on research, development and design jobs but they said to make these liquid crystal displays in Wisconsin, that it's too expensive.  So, I don't know how that plays with trade negotiations.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And never forget one important thing, people also want to live in the United States more than they want to live in China for the freedom, for the opportunities.  The most important thing that we in this country that we export to the world --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But will we accept those immigrants?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- is liberty, never forget that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will we accept those immigrants?  That is the core of what is going on in Washington right now.  Do we have open arms and will we raise the number of people we allow to immigrate to this country legally every year?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If China won't embrace the entrepreneurial economy, let's recruit their talent.  And this White House policy, what he's doing is he's reshuffling the existing slots.  What the president ought to say in the State of the Union is we're going to increase the number of PhD engineers that we bring in from China, India and elsewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, parents beware, big story here, infant ibuprofen recalled over potential dangers.  We've got the story and the details next.</p><p>And then a major real estate play, Chinese billionaire  Zhang Xin who I spoke with in Davos last week building her portfolio in the United States, she continues to expand, details on the price tag, next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A nationwide infant ibuprofen recall has been expanded.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Parents listen up, Tris Pharma is expanding avoluntary recall of its infant ibuprofen because the product might contain a higher concentration of ibuprofen than labeled.  The company has added three more lots to the recall list, they were manufactured for CVS and Walmart.  Tris Pharma says there have been no reports of any illness.</p><p>A Chinese billionaire in talks to buy a $60 million apartment in New York City.  The New York post says Zhang Xin is close to acquiring a full floor unit at 432 Park Ave. the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere.  Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of China's largest property developer SOHO China.  And Maria, you talked with Zhang about real estate at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZHANG XIN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SOHO CHINA:  Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buying real estate, and so -- and but now they're worrying on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down.  So then, what does the government do and you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate, buying real estate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The New York Posts says two other units at 432 Park Avenue on the market for $40 million are currently under contract.</p><p>And this, researchers at MIT are showing off their new robot that taught itself to play Jenga.  Using a camera for ayes and two small prongs for fingers.  It can gently remove the pieces.  The robot determines which move is the best one to make by touching the pieces first, testing them out.</p><p>And speaking of Jenga, Louis Vuitton is releasing a $2,400 luxury Jenga set, the 54 L.V. monogrammed pieces are made from plexiglass, not wood.  So, if you ever need an expensive gift, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, making the world better through business, the story of pop sockets and how it's using sales to help charities around the world.  Good story next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pop sockets are taking over cell phones.  They stick to your device to help you get a better grip and make it easier to watch videos.  Today the company is launching the next phase of Poptivism, which it says is aimed at making the world better.</p><p>Here now in an exclusive interview is the CEO and founder of PopSockets, David Barnett.  David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BARNETT, CEO AND FOUNDER, POPSOCKETS:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And PopSockets, what a great idea.  How did you come up with this idea?</p><p>BARNETT:  Well, back in 2010, I was tired of my headset tangling in my pocket.  Each time I took it out, it was tangled.  So, I went down to the nearest fabric store and glued a couple of huge clothing buttons to the backside of my iPhone 3 and wrapped my head set around them, it looked ridiculous.  I got made fun of.  And so, I started tinkering with mechanisms to get the button to expand and collapse, so that it would look a little more respectable and have more functionality, act as a stand, and act as a grip for the phone.  Eventually --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you started off thinking you could just put your headphones around it, but then you realized there were so many other ideas.</p><p>BARNETT:  That was the initial problem which is a lesson for me, that the problem that motivates you start tinkering is not always the problem you end up solving.  So, the current product does solve for that problem.  But that's not what most people use it for.  So, I ended up settling on this accordion mechanism.  And we just finished our fifth year of business.  So, I started out of my garage, in Boulder, Colorado.  And we've sold about a hundred million of these so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A hundred million pop sockets, wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You were a philosophy professor.</p><p>BARNETT:  That is correct.  I'm ready for questions.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When was the moment where you decided iPhone accessories were a better line of work?</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes, all it was -- I would say some -- half of the philosophy professors watching this are laughing at me.  And the other half are probably pretty jealous.</p><p>So, it is -- it can be a lot more fun than being a philosophy professor and sometimes, the problems we're dealing with are a little bit easier, usually.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but an assassin is the mother of invention and you invent something out of necessity.  And I just love entrepreneurial ideas that come from necessity.  You created something.  I'm absolutely in awe of people who do something so simple and when I see it, I say why didn't I think of that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how are you giving back?</p><p>BARNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNETT:  Sure, today, I'd love to share with you.  Today we launched our Poptivism program to the public.  And it encourages anybody sitting here to go to our website, you create your own grip.  So, you upload your own art work, hopefully it work with an artist, unless you're a natural artist.  So, you upload some beautiful graphic and then you can tag any charity you want.  So, any five O's, 503 --</p><p>FREEMAN:  501(c)(3)</p><p>BARNETT:  501(c)(3), thank you, that you would like.  So we have a bunch already lined up for you.  And 50 percent of every sale of that product will go to that charity.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  50 percent of the sale, not the --</p><p>BARNETT:  Not the profit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- income, not the profit, which is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes.  I don't know any other -- any other brand giving this much away and allowing you to design the product.  So it's customized impact.  We have a bunch of different categories of charities including some charities around veteran services, so the Wounded Warrior, Bob Woodruff Foundation, The Mission Continues.  Anyway, long list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  And what are this retail for pop grips?</p><p>BARNETT:  They start at $10.00 for the graphics and they go up to -- there's Swarovski for $50.00.  I have a marble on my -- a genuine marble on my phone today.  And it's -- I believe it's $30.00 for the marble.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you give these to influencers so they use them?  Because I see them all over like reality television.</p><p>BARNETT:  So, the virality of this is partly explained by the fact that celebrities got a hold of them organically.  We don't -- we don't seed the influencers.  We've made some -- we've had some partnerships with influencers but originally this blew up around Los Angeles because celebrities we saw Gigi Hadid and Ryan Seacrest.  And it's just a long list of celebrities using them and that really led to their -- to their growth, quickly.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And that's because it's a great handle for a selfie?</p><p>BARNETT:  Sorry, I should explain it, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Or was it mainly a fashion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  let me see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNETT:  I haven't yet even explained it, you're right.  It collapses and expands and it allows you to move your hand away from the backside of your phone.  I have one of our wallets underneath it.  It allows you to move your hand away.  Once you do that, you can access your whole screen with your thumb.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.</p><p>BARNETT:  Without having to drop your phone.  You can take selfies, photographs much more easily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be doing that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 31, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 013103cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the busiest day for earnings so far, General Electric out last hour.  The stock keeps rising over the last hour.  It is now up better than nine percent on better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>We have an eye on big tech this morning.  Facebook soaring this morning on a record profit reported last night, stock is up 11-3/4 percent even in the face of the privacy scandal.  The stock to watch after the close, Amazon.  Amazon shares right now up two percent.  The company reports earnings after the close tonight.  Markets this morning are looking at a mixed open for the broader averages.</p><p>Take a look.  Dow Industrials right now down 36 points but the S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ, higher by 35 points right now.  This after a sharp rally yesterday fueled by Federal Reserve.  The Dow Industrials up 435 points at the close yesterday.  1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 41, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up 155 points, up 2-1/4 quarter percent.  And the Federal Reserve officially told us they are on hold in terms of data dependency on interest rate hikes.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this.  The European indices right now are most higher.  FT-100 up 35 points, one-half of one percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris up 3-1/2 points, fractional move.  DAX index in Germany down 38 points, one-third of one percent.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, best performer is Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than one percent.</p><p>Back in U.S.  The arctic blast has turned deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their levels in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's like hard to take a breath and it stick to my lungs a little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The winds, the windchill is probably the worst of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a look at when millions of Americans can expect temperatures to fall.  We will tell you.  Plus this, attacking the wealthy again.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz answers critics about his success.  Then Roger Goodell breaks his silence.  What he said about the infamous no call during the NHC championship game later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.  And former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you very much.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  The kind of interesting we've been talking about for the last year really, Facebook, how much do users care about these privacy issues.  And last summer we got those results looked look like maybe users aren't really digging this but this latest numbers, you got to say, it looks like users care less about the privacy issues than those of us in media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then they have other areas other than the Facebook business to monetize.  Like with WhatsApp, Messenger, which they're not actually getting any advertising from so far.  So one thing not monetize those think there's an expectations from a business perspective that there's going to be even more growth</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Instagram is kind of the great juggernaut that they have -- or that they're growing, incredibly rapidly but I point this out that because Apple banned this basically data gathering app where they were getting young people in teens to give them all data this is Facebook, Apple bans it, well -- from this app store.  You know what's interesting?  That self-regulation.</p><p>Again, it's not going to be the government that comes in, it's going to be all of these tech companies maybe regulating each other and realizing it might be in their best business interests to not just help them grow incredibly strong but also limit their growth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm more worried about Facebook censoring content.  I don't mean the censoring the classic sense of the government but deciding what people get to see, that worries me more than the privacy issue.  When you sign up for Facebook, you know you're giving away privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't realize is that Facebook is picking for you what you get to see and with 60 percent of Americans now getting most of their news from Facebook.  That's really disturbing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what the Congress is looking at and that's why got those guys, Facebook, Google executives to testify.  Last year in Capitol Hill to see if in fact they are censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentioned Instagram, check out our Instagram post today, it is throwback Thursday.  And posted a shot of way back in 1985, you posted a shot of yourself in the 80s.  Where is your picture?  Post your picture from throwback Thursday Instagram.  I'm having the best time on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  If I looked like you did in the 80s, I would be posting throwback photos while -- may even look like you now but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You look gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No, no.  Maria looks like Sophia Loren and I look -- well, not so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of good looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some good looks this morning.  So check out our Instagram pages.  Meanwhile, we've got a big hour coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Sean Duffy is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson is with us.  Along with L.A. Dodger pitcher Ross Stripling joining us this morning.</p><p>And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in as always.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We kick it off right here with this.  General Electric shares are soaring this morning on strong earnings.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Stock is up nine percent, Susan.  Good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Good morning to you, Maria.  And congratulations for mastering Instagram.  We'll talk about Facebook in just a bit.  But yes, G.E. shares are higher rallying in the premarket and this is because they got a revenue beat, it's actually pretty good for G.E. as you know, it's been shrinking.  There's been problems with the company.  But aviation was strong for G.E. in the quarter and that offset the slowdown.</p><p>And so as some problems that we're seeing in the capital business and also their power businesses as well.  G.E. also by the way settling that DOJ subprime settlements of just around $1-1/2 billion.  This goes back to the 2008 financial crisis.  And as you know, they have been spinning off several businesses in 2018 to spring off some cash flow and to try to make some profit.</p><p>Let's talk about Facebook because also rallying in the premarket, Faceboook shares and as you mentioned stories doing very well for them on Instagram and also on Facebook as well.  And they grew, daily active users and all geographic locations and this is after a downturn of course in Europe and also plateau in North America.  So that's important to watch. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Susan.  Thank you so much.  Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade, the President tweeting about it this morning saying this, China's top trade negotiators are in the United States meeting with our representatives.  Meeting are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides.  China does not want to -- an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal, they're correct.</p><p>I will be meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in Oval Office, no final deal will be made until my friend, President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the longstanding and more difficult points.  Very comprehensive transaction.  Writes the President.  He goes on to say, Chinese representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table.</p><p>All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully revolved.  Tariffs on China increased to 25 percent on March 1st.  So, all working hard to complete by that date.  My next guest is the cosponsor of a bill that will give President Trump executive power to raise tariffs and joining me right now is Wisconsin Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member, Sean Duffy.  Congressman, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  It's good to be with you, Maria.  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DOBBS:  So in the President's tweet just now, he said everything is on the table, all of these tough issues, does that mean that he is also talking about espionage, the forced transfer of technology and the I.P. theft?</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.  I think he is talking about all these issues.  When you have a relationship with trading partner like China, you can't do business for very long.  We have a country like China stealing our intellectual property or the force transfer of intellectual property.  So, yes.  No, this is all on the table.  Here's what I think is going on now, Maria.  We understand that China lies and they cheat and they steal, right?</p><p>So we want to get a deal before March 1st so we don't have that increase in tariffs.  But I don't know that all the other tariffs currently imposed are going to come off on March 1st if a deal is struck because even if you get a deal with China, are they going to implement the deal?  And that's going to take time.  So, we got to actually -- we don't have this trust but verify like Reagan said with the Russians.</p><p>We have I think a philosophy of don't trust and verify with the Chinese because we -- they can sign a document with us, an agreement with us but that doesn't mean they're going to implement that document.  So, folks, if a deal comes and tariffs are lifted, I don't think that's a strategy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that because they did that on beef, right?  They said that they would buy certain amount of beef and then they didn't.</p><p>DUFFY:  Right.  Yes.  You're absolutely correct.  And, so, you know, again, I -- we believe in free trade and we think, you know, having a great trading partner like China where we can, you know, lower tariffs and respect each other's intellectual property is a great relationship but when you see the rising threat of China militarily and their -- and their substantial growth, we have to take a second look at, you know, what they're doing and what risk that poses to our to American way one of life.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, what's -- you know, what President Trump has done brilliantly is, you know, because of these tariffs but also, you know, the knowledge of the force transfer of technology, you see the whole global supply chain changing away from China.  And you can't do business for that long when you steal a technology to people who come to your country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  And Americans are getting -- China is not a good home for business.  There's other places that we can go outside of China and it's having a real impact even on American earnings as you reported are American companies missing some of their numbers, Apple, Nvidia because of lack of sales that are happening inside of China because of the slowdown that has been led by Donald Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, it's interesting because we actually had Steve Ballmer on a couple of months ago, former CEO of Microsoft and he said that the theft from China costs Microsoft $10 billion in profits because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system only a fraction, one percent actually pay for it.  So, there's all of this theft going on.</p><p>What are the metrics that you want to use to check to verify that in fact if you do do a deal that they will follow through on it?  And do I hear you saying that there is no way that tariffs are going to be gone?  That you can't lift tariffs at all because you can't trust what they say they're going to follow through on?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  I think metric is time, Maria.  I mean, we have to give this time to see with actual implementation.  And so I don't know if that's a year or two years, I think -- I think you have a longer runway here on the tariff front with China but you might mentioned intellectual property I think the Chinese are suing us at the WTO for $50 billion of tariffs that President Trump put on the Chinese for intellectual property theft.</p><p>And our analysis is that they steel $250 to $600 billion a year of American technology and they're -- they have their goal to sue us over the $50 billion in tariffs.  I mean, this is rich stuff with the Chinese and I just -- I think we have a president -- President Trump who's willing to actually fight this out for the American people and try to win for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about Foxconn, a major reversal.  We talked about you in the electronics' giant first announced their new Wisconsin factory that was supposed to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs.  Now the research centers for scientists and engineers.  Congressman, what about the manufacturing jobs, how disappointed are you by this reversal?</p><p>DUFFY:  So they're still -- they're still committed to the R&amp;D side of it but you're right on the manufacturing side.  They haven't necessarily pulled out but they have signaled that they will on the manufacturing side of Foxconn.  And Maria, first of all, so they invested $100 million in the University of Wisconsin system to train our workers.  That's fantastic.  They bought buildings, they have land to build their facilities.</p><p>But what's happening, Wisconsin, why is this decision made?  Scott Walker lost.  The guy that won, Tony Evers in Wisconsin was bashing this deal from the very beginning.  So now you have an unfriendly government in Wisconsin who doesn't want Foxconn there.  This a massive investment.  And if you're going to make it, you better have a governor who goes, yes, you know, come to my state, bring us the jobs, I'm happy to have you.</p><p>And that's hasn't been Tony Evers.  And so, they've been attacking this deal from the very beginning.  I don't think this will happen if Scott Walker had won in Wisconsin but it is now because, you know, business -- Foxconn is under attack in our state because of our new governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So you -- so you blame the new governor as --</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For this, how many jobs will be cut then?</p><p>DUFFY:  Well, so they haven't walked away.  They had a promise of 13 million jobs to $10-billion investment.  They haven't walked away from that number.  And by the way, the incentives that we gave for Foxconn to come were tied to the investment and the jobs.  And so they just missed a $10-million incentive because they didn't hit the job number.  So, again, this is still up in the air for us but if you're Foxconn, you really have to consider the politics of our state and what's changed in the last, you know, two months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Before you go, what are you dealing with, negative 26 degrees right there in Wisconsin, Congressman?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  So, it's 27 below, windchills hit up to 50 below, just have been -- people don't get this in the south but our cars don't start here.  The post office, it never shuts down, the post office is shut down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Our ski hill is shut down.  My Congressional office yesterday was shut down.  People couldn't get to work.  So, you know, it's crazy cold and by the way, kids, we have eight kids, seven of them are at home, you coop up kids for two days in the house because they can't go outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Crazy fights are going and you can only watch so many movies, Maria, and play some of the games monopoly before your house is ready to explode.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the whole Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades, so they're staying home from school, right?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  You can't send these little kids out waiting, you know, for a bus to go to school.  I mean, listen you people get hurt in this kind of weather.  So it breaks today, this afternoon we start to see a breaks.  We go from minus 27, I think we have a high today of minus four.  That's the heat wave that's coming our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DUFFY:  And if I can make one last point, Maria, I just watch through the 80s and 90s, I have pull up Instagram pictures of your throwback Thursday.  Huge fan when you're on other networks, I'm a huge fan of you here.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- I'm looking forward too.  If Dagen is up, so we're going to check out Dagen from back in the 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  You know, she has some big, you know, 80s hair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the throwback Thursday, yes.  Well, that picture that I posted in the Instagram is from 1985.  Post your picture, Congressman.  Thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  I got some really bad ones too.  I got big old -- yes.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you soon.  Sean Duffy joining us there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Midwest is facing the coldest temperatures in decades.  The extreme freeze is turning deadly.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice?</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  Yes.  Unfortunately, we're going to have one more day of this and then the cold air will start to retreat but you can see the windchill is most dangerous part of this cold air.  Is across the northern plains, the great lakes, now into the northeast where it feels like minus 13 in New York, it feels like zero in D.C. but minus 40 Fargo, minus 41 is what it feels like in Chicago.</p><p>Those incredible pictures coming out of Chicago of the rivers just freezing.  Green Bay, air temperature, minus 23, windchill minus 23, air temperature in Chicago by the way is minus 21 but it is the windchill that's potentially deadly.  That's why people are urged to stay indoors.  If you've got kids, if you got pets and you want to check on the elderly.  Today will be the really cold day and things will start to improve Friday.</p><p>But windchill advisories and warnings in place for millions of people where the windchill is anywhere from minus 25 to minus 60 especially across the northern plains in the upper Midwest.  OK.  So here is our polar vortex that is dipped as far south as the Tennessee River Valley, Ohio.  By Saturday it retreats up into Canada but we're not done yet heading into Monday.  We start to see it move southward again across the plain states across the great lakes.</p><p>So we're not done.  Now, this cold air, the really cold air is probably done for the season but we're still going to see below freezing temperatures as we get into next week.  But I will tell you as we head into the weekend, Maria, look at this, so minus one, today is the daytime high for Minneapolis but will be in the 40s by Sunday.  And then, Monday, things will start to come down again.</p><p>Here is Chicago where we are dealing with minus 40 degree windchills, by Saturday and Sunday even Monday, 53 degrees.  I mean, that is a 60-degree temperature difference from today and Monday.  So something we're going to have to watch.  These are weather extremes.  Certainly, we'll watch it.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Thanks so much.  Janice Dean with the latest there.  Coming up.  We are watching markets this morning on last trading day of the month today.  Busiest day for earnings.  Dow Industrials down 51, S&amp;P and NASDAQ up.  Next up, L.A. Dodgers pitcher turns stock broker, Ross Stripling in the house with his take on market action.</p><p>Then breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the path to the Super Bowl.  What he had to say right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets in focus this morning, futures indicating a mixed opening for the markets this morning on this.  The last trading day of the month.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 60 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher fractionally.  This after the major indices rallied yesterday big time after the Federal Reserve indicated it has done raising interest rates for now, it will be data dependent.</p><p>But the Dow Industrials were as high as 500 points, better than 500.  it ended up 434 on the Dow.  154 points higher on the NASDAQ.  Joining us right now is Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and B. Riley Wealth Management stock broker, Ross Stripling.  Ross, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, STOCK BROKER, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we got to talk sports but we want to first talk money.  Tell us what you think about what you heard from the Fed yesterday and how you're telling clients to allocate capital right now.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, that was definitely optimistic, you know, coming out and saying that, you know, our economy is growing, spending is strong, they're going to be patient moving forward with the -- with the rate hikes, you know, October, November, December were certainly ugly for me as a -- as a growth investor, you know, that got out of hand but, you know, I definitely think we got oversold.</p><p>And, you know, so we're kind of telling investors, you know, it's a good time to be patient and a good time to be, you know, long-term mined I think if you think back to January 2016,you know, it definitely got oversold in that month and then all the market did was rally 10,000 points over the next two years.  So, I think it's a good time to be patient, you're getting a good -- so you can get some good names at low valuations and obviously, get some of that money back lost that we lost late last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can we go to baseball questions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go for it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So -- I apologize, I didn't watch this when it happened but Wikipedia says, your very first major league start, you had no hitter into the 7th inning and you got pulled out.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So this is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  Thanks for bringing that back up.  No, I'm just kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Basically, the highs and lows of baseball in your first professional appearance.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I mean, man, if you just think about what goes into the -- to a debut of Major League Baseball, I mean, I was just so nervous that day and then to finally get up to game time and then to -- like you said, to be able to go over seven innings of no-hit baseball and then -- and then you get pulled.  I mean, it happens so fast, you know, and I certainly thought about it more since then that, you know, things that will never get to know how would have finished but I've always said that I understood the decision to pull me out.</p><p>I was coming off for Tommy John surgery, I've already thrown a hundred pitches, that was the most I've thrown in two years.  So, you know, we'll never know how it would have ended like I said but I've have always been open about understanding that decision and, you know, maybe I'll get another shot and no-hitter someday.</p><p>MINERD:  Hey, Ross, this is Mike Huckabee and one of the things that I'm most intrigue by is your use of data to prepare for ballgames.  It sounded like a real-life version of Moneyball in modern times.  So explain how do you collect the data and how do you go about using that to plan your own pitching strategy because I think that's fascinating.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Sure.  You know, I'll try and give you the shortest version of that question as possible.  And, you know, the Dodgers are probably kind of leading the way in all that, you know, analytics and things like that.  So we have a whole division that kind of gets the data for me and I mean, they can give you as much as you want and I -- at first when I got up I wanted it all, just give me all the data possible and I will just get what I want out of it.</p><p>But now, after three years, you know, you got to cut it down to what you want which is usually, you know, what guys slug in certain counts, what they hit the hardest, what's their biggest swing and missed pitch.  You can even look like what the man on second base, you know, do they get more aggressive.  There's just tons of data out there, so you kind of pick and choose what you want and use it when you're on the mound.</p><p>That way you're not just like boggled down with data while you're on the mound, you know, at the end of the day you just got to trust your ability to get major league hitters out but you want to use to it come up with a plan and each guy is different and you go over with your pitching coach and your catcher and all of that and you have a plan against every batter, one through nine for any situation and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  -- you know, that's kind of thought.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is really smart.  Let me ask you before you go, Ross, Super Bowl 53, three days away, who are you betting on?  Your hometown Rams or the Patriots?</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I got to go hometown Rams.  I think McVay have some up his sleeve that Bellatrix never seen and they made a lot of acquisitions in offseason on that defense, maybe they can get a big stop on Brady.  So I'll take the Rams.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Ross, great to have you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow, we'll bring you live coverage of the January jobs' report starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

Blake Burman is live this morning at the White House with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  Just one meeting among that group, 17 Democrats, Republicans trying to hash out a border security package, and already this morning, we are seeing a pretty big amount of frustration being expressed by President Trump.  Just moments ago, he sent out the following tweet about that group saying the following quote, \"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time.  Democrats, despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not goings to give money to build the desperately needed wall.  I've got you covered, wall is already being built, I don't expect much help.\"</p><p>You'll remember over the last few weeks as well as the President was trying to hash out a deal or at least Democrats and Republicans were, about securing wall funding that the President said, Well maybe we can call this steel slats or a physical barrier.  Doesn't need necessarily need to be called a wall.  He's backing off that today as well because he tweeted this this morning, \"Let's just call them wolves from now on, and stop political games, a wall is wall, give you a pretty good idea of where his mindset is after just one meeting from this group up on Capitol Hill.  Meantime, the Pentagon says that several thousand more troops are going to be heading to the Southern Border.  The Undersecretary for policy testifying up on Capitol Hill earlier this week that several caravans are headed north.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN C. ROOD, UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY:  Current information shows a caravan of over 12,000 people.  There's three that we are tracking, the Department of Homeland Security's tracking en route, and one of which is over 12,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Didn't get an exact number from the Pentagon, Maria.  Currently, there are 2,500 give or take active duty service members down at the Southern border.  That is down from a high of nearly 6,000, but the pentagon says several thousand more are headed that way.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the White House this morning.  Let's bring in Former New Mexico Governor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations, and Former Presidential Candidate, Bill Richardson.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much for joining us this day, this mooring.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean this whole idea of -- that they can't get together, on an agreement for the wall or for any kind of barrier, what do you think this means?  I mean is this going to be the next two years where the Congressional Democrats are constantly resisting everything the President wants?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, the first thing you need to do is the President needs to get off this idea that unless he gets his way, there's going to be a government shutdown.  That was very damaging to the country.  And I think to the President, too.  This is early.  Look, the early talks, did not go well yesterday.  But we got until February 15th.  You don't negotiate until the very end to get the best deal for both of you.  But, look, if there are more caravans, we're sending more troops.  I was a border governor, like Mike Huckabee, governors, we got to deal with these things directly.</p><p>What we need is more border detection equipment at the border crossings, Coast Guard needs to have more facilities.  You don't need a wall.  You go under a wall, over a wall, you have tunnels like El Chapo.  That's not going to solve the problem.  Let's have significant border security and agree on increase border patrol agents' budget --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, I want to -- I want to bring in Governor Huckabee in a moment, but you said we don't need a wall.  Are -- isn't it true though that in some border security agree on we need a wall.  For example, there is a wall in Nancy Pelosi state right now, which separates Tijuana and San Diego.  We're at the very dense area.  You've got three million people on one side of the Tijuana wall, and other three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear down that wall, isn't it -- doesn't it -- I mean do you think those people would just assimilate into the United States?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look, I'm not advocating tearing down what is existing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but you said we don't need a wall.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I'm saying that for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That wall worked.  Would you say that that will work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No.  Well, that deal does not -- or no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why not tear it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, it's -- no, it's not working.  It's not working.  It's that they have good border patrol agents, detection equipment, they know what they're doing ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would be OK tearing it down then?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- they have (INAUDIBLE) the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then you would be OK tearing it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Makes no difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think that the three million people on the Tijuana side would assimilate into the three million people in the San Diego (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, I don't.  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Without that wall?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't.  You're using scare tactics.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not scare -- I'm just saying the facts, sir.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Border enforcement -- no, no, no, you're not.  Those are not facts.  Border immigration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- illegal immigration has gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's gone down.  It's gone down.  Totally all across the border.  It's gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All I'm asking you is does that wall work to separate Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't think it makes much of a difference, but I'm saying leave it where it is.  But give them more resource, more border patrol agents detection equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think the President's just saying that as well.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Go in depth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, jump in here because I think that the President does want a wall in certain areas but in other areas said, you said that agrees with the Democrats in terms of technology and drones.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ambassador, you're one of my favorite democrats.  You know I love you, but I remember when Duncan Hunter was the one who put the appropriation in for that wall in San Diego, 95 percent of the drug trafficking stopped.  I'm looking at Israel.  They put up a wall, a security fence.  They were condemned for it, but they went from a thousand suicide bombers.  I agree that walls don't need to go for the entire border because there are certain y natural barriers, some electronics, but I just can't believe that people say that walls in certain places, whether it's a fence, whether it's a steel slat, just would not have an effect, and if that's true then we should tear down the 600 miles that we already have, and I don't know of anybody who realistically thinks that makes good sense.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, Mike, first of all, the tactics that are being used to get that wall, which I think is very dubious to build because I don't think it'll work and it's too expensive is that if the President doesn't get his way, he's going to shut down the government, and he's going to do harm to 800,000 Federal workers, businesses, and then this wall, Mike, I mean it's going to take landowners out of there, it's going to take ranchers, indigenous people, wildlife.  You're right, and most of the border, you can't build the wall because of the hills, because of the terrain, so --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Bill he has been very flexible in saying that it's a combination of all of those things, it's not just a wall.  But you say he's not been willing to give.  I've not seen Nancy Pelosi give one inch, not one inch, and he's offering DACA, he's offering all sorts of concessions, he's making compromise, but where -- tell  me exactly where Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer is offering any kind of concession or compromise.  I can't find it.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, they are offering significant funding increases in Border Enforcement and Detection Equipment, that will work, that will work, Mike.  And then the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's not just to answer President Trump.  That's because --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- says, \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down -- I'm going to shut down the government.  That is unprecedented, that is damaging the country.  Are we going to allow any President, they don't get their way, that the answer's got to be I'm going to down the go of year?  Mike you're a good politician.  You're my favorite Republican Politician.  This border shutdown was not good for the President for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, actually I think that the --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The country blinds him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when you look at the polls, the President really didn't get impacted very much.  Nancy Pelosi's approvals actually went down.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, I don't know what poll you're reading, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- and the President is tweeting -- wait.  Governor, the President just tweeting this morning --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't know what poll you're reading.  It was significant damage to the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning.  Let me tell you what he says.  He says, \"Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime.  Your reaction.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Oh, I mean this -- you know, he's into his campaign mode.  This is like when he says to his intelligence people that we spend over $20 billion in intelligence, CIA, NSA, Department of Defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that -- is that tweet incorrect?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- all of North Korea, they're my -- they're my buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that -- is that tweet inaccurate?  Wait, is that tweet inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally inaccurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate?  What's inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The whole thing.  The whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, late term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's like the President's saying to his intelligence fee --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- higher taxes?  Which one?  Later term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Open borders?  Wait, which one?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know, this is -- this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate, governor?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  This is ridiculous.  No.  Open borders?  That's ridiculous.  All of that is ridiculous.  There should be serious negotiations right now.  And it's not happening.  And the President's not helping with these tweets.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know the thing is?  I mean I know that a lot of your colleagues say that they're for border security, but they didn't vote for Kate's law, they didn't vote to end Sanctuary Cities, they didn't vote for a border wall, so how can you say you're for border security when you actually haven't done so in terms of your voting record?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look at what the Democrats are proposing for this showdown, one, more border patrol agents, two, more Coast Guard assistance, three, more drones, four, all kinds of new technologies that will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they voted for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  A border wall is not going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they vote --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did Nancy Pelosi vote for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That -- perhaps that wall she voted for on her border.  All I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is that not immoral?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- let's make this work.  Let's make this work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  But not threaten border shutdowns, not end the government working, that's what the President is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  All right.  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook reporting a record profit.  The stock is soaring this morning.  Joining me now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, good morning, Maria.  You know, I wasn't looking at that profit report for the profit number or profit margin, I was looking at it to see how many active monthly users they've got.  When I saw that number come over, 2.7 billion, I figured that Facebook was out of the woods.  Think of all the scandal, all the bad publicity, all the privacy questions that have been leveled against Facebook in the last, what, year or six months?  It--- it's not touched their business.  I thought that the scandal may have reduced the number of monthly users, active users on the -- on the base, but it didn't.  They've actually increased.  And that's why I think Facebook is up so much this morning, 11 percent gain for a stock like that is absolutely enormous.  My bottom line is this, all the scandal did not touch its financial business.  The heart of its business was not touched by all the political goings-on around it.  Facebook, 167.  Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible.  You're right, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It really is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis.

I grew up literally in public housing in the projects.  And I have succeeded in America I always thought that was something to be celebrated, that my success should not be something that is punitive.  My success is living proof of the promise of the country.  I can't find the answers why people are all of a sudden chastising me for being successful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Many Democrats are caffeinated against him, criticizing Schultz over his potential presidential run saying he will only help to reelect President Trump.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Listen, I'm looking at this.  We are celebrating throwback Thursday this morning.  We're showing you our best looks from the 80s, that's next stay, with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is throwback Thursdays here on the MORNINGS WITH MARIA set.  Here's me from circa 19857.  I was working in a photo lab, printing pictures.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I told you, Sophia Loren.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Care-free days.  I don't even know that I was thinking about what stock to buy.  I don't even know that I was thinking about me being a journalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at this complexion.  This is even before -- well, it's before the internet really, but the no photo filters, you're glowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see yours, Dagen McDowell.  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I told you I'm really ugly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do they have it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, Governor Huckabee with his daughter.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, there I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's Dagen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I jumped in a swimming pool fully clothed right after that was taken.  And I am not making that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is about 1980 --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  88.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  88.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the summer after my freshman year in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Huckabee with your daughter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.  Aww.  That is too cute.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's about 1984.  She was about two years old at that time.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So great.  That's beautiful shot.  And lastly, the photo James Freeman gave us.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so this is me.  You asked for a throwback --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- Thursday photo of James Freeman.  Apparently, this is the Reverend James Freeman.  Apparently, he was an outstanding preacher.  Governor, you might want to grade his performance, I don't know, but very influential in Boston.  My kids ran across this a few weeks ago while sightseeing, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You couldn't find any shots of yourself as a baby.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I -- well, I did -- if you give me more time, I'll try and find it.  But I told you, I never went with the mullet.  My great regret, so I don't know if we're going to have really fun 80s photos, but I'll do my best.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  Deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday, we'll do another throwback Thursday, how's that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You got to let me know in advance and so we I can dig some photos out of my -- well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So we have a week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- drawer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we didn't even talk about this.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke publicly for the first time about that blatant non-call in the NFC Championship game.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God, you're lucky the game has been great in the last year, Goodell, because you're terrible and people hate you.  No more than --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, people hate him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us how you really feel.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  What do you really think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, let's call some folks down in New Orleans and ask them how they feel.  Anyway.  No, they do, people don't -- excuse me, they don't like him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.  Hey, you've got a neat throwback Thursday shots you want to share, Stu?</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2174420965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB8-TVN1-JBHT-D49G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

And good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday, it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Busy morning on earnings this morning.  We will hear from UPS, General Electric, both ahead of the open this morning.  Big technology still in focus, Facebook reporting last night after the close, big quarter for Facebook, Amazon will be the one to watch today after the close tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the arctic blast turns deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their lowest levels in decades.  We will take you to the Minneapolis region this morning, where the negative 24 degrees is having a real impact.  The push to tax the wealthy, J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly saying that the richest Americans can afford to pay higher taxes, but there's a catch.  Then, Roger Goodell breaking his silence, what he said about the infamous no-call during the NFC championship game coming up later this hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets this morning.  Let's check Futures showing a mixed opening this morning after a huge day yesterday.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 15 points at the open.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ up fractionally right now after a solid day of trading that all stock surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell signaled that the Central Bank may pause interest rate hikes for now.  The Fed on pause.</p><p>Technology giant, Facebook, meanwhile also reporting fourth-quarter earnings.  Look at that market yesterday, up 434 points at the close, it was a big day.  And that, by the way, was off of the highs of the day after the Fed meeting.  Facebook earnings beat expectations posting a record profit for what has been a difficult year for the social media company.  Take a look at Facebook shares this morning, up 11-1/3 percent right now, 167 and change.  Earnings season rolling on today with Amazon reporting after the bell tonight.  Take a look at all the names that we're expecting today in what is really the busiest week -- one of the busiest weeks for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Here now, the founder of Disruptive Technology Research Lou Basenese.  Lou, it's good to see you.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on Facebook, your reaction to the quarter last night.</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, I am just shocked and disappointed in this rally.  I mean, I think this is really putting forward that investors and management favor profit growth over ethics.  I mean, look, this week, we had -- I think one of the -- just biggest disappointments in privacy protection with the Facebook research app.  I mean, just total disregard for Apple's wishes, total disregard for teenage users' privacy, and yet, investors are cheering profit growth.  So, look, I can't argue with the fundamental numbers.  I mean, the stock is reasonably valued, you've seen growth come back in the U.S. as the key market, and advertisers just don't have any other outlet, any other alternative to reach 2 billion potential viewers.  So, it's one of those things, it's a toxic investment, to me.  So, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you wouldn't touch it?</p><p>BASENESE:  I wouldn't touch it.  Look, I think there's a lot of risk embedded there.  What's the next privacy scandal that's going to come to light?  Facebook, over the years, has really made more excuses than changes to what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's talk about the Fed -- the Fed essentially on hold yesterday saying it's on hold, indicating that more dovish stance when it comes to interest rate hikes.  What was your reaction to what the Fed said in particular also saying that the balance sheet unwind is also a way that they could pull back and perhaps stop the 50 billion sales a month.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, I don't think I can remember in my lifetime just a more dramatic turn of sentiment at the Fed.  I mean, in October, they were saying that we're a long way from neutral and now, yesterday's statement said that we're within range.  I mean, they went from playing hardball with the President to playing patty cake, and you know, investors love that.  So, you know, more easy monetary policy coming.  I think they gave themselves some flexibility on unwinding the balance sheet.  Not that they didn't say that they were going to be data dependent before, but now they just made that much more of a point to communicate to the markets that there's not going to be a fast and hard unwind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we were sort of expecting this in the last couple of months, that's for sure.  But would this be a signal for you to put new money to work in stocks?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think absolutely.  Look, the Fed has been supportive of stock prices.  I mean, there's a lot of people that would argue this bull market would not be around without the Fed.  So, with the Fed being very accommodative, I think it's time to come back into the market, we're going to see that.  You've seen a dramatic reversal even in the more speculative areas of the market.  And I think I pointed out before in another appearance that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tremendous bounce off the lows, up almost 20 percent, and about to breakthrough to the 200-day moving average.  So, yes, it's risk on again.  At least to the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Two more things on stocks, we've got earnings, obviously, the middle in -- we're in the middle of a very busy period.  DowDupont just reported they beat on earnings per share at $0.88 a share but they missed on revenue at 20.1 billion versus an estimate of 20.9 billion, how would you characterize the earnings season so far, and what does that telling you about the backdrop?</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, it's a mixed bag.  We haven't really seen a huge beat rate on the earnings on the bottomline.  I think the top like is being less impressive.  So, on DuPont's report, it's epitomizing it, right?  We're seeing some earnings growth but the demand on the top line is not there.  So, look, I think we're in more of a stock picker's market.  It points more towards active management and really trying to find those companies that are overcoming the China hangover that are finding strength despite some pockets of weakness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a focus is economic data for you?  We've got the January job's report out Friday morning, tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting 165,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9 percent.  We had the ADP numbers earlier this week, they were strong.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes.  No, they're very strong.  Look, I'm a tech guy first, but I'd love to see tailwinds and the job's market supporting that.  I think many people thought we might have a slowdown just because of the government shutdown, and just that extreme volatility in December that might have put some businesses a little uneasy about hiring.  But the ADP Report like you mentioned this week, pointing to just continued strength, so another positive for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you're thinking we're going to get a pretty good year, 2019.</p><p>BASENESE:  As of now -- look, a lot can change, I mean, look what happened in December.  So, I don't want to go on the record and say it's a -- it's a foregone conclusion 2019 is going to be great, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you've got put money to work either way, so what do you do?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think -- I put money to work.  Look, I like the semiconductor industry particularly companies like NXP, really undervalued at about 11 times earnings.  And the chipmakers are going to make this world go, from here into the future.  About a trillion semiconductors shipped last year.  They go into every big growth trend that you can think of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess.  I mean, even more so with 5G on the way.  Lou, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lou Basanese joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow morning.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January job's report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We've got our \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" special where we identify where the jobs are right now.  Meanwhile, Amazon earnings after the bell, the company poking fun in its own Alexa devices for going haywire in this year's Super Bowl ad.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Your take on that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I love Super Bowl ads, and Amazon is advertising during the big game for the fourth straight year, two spots including part of this one, we're going to show you a 90-second spot with some popular names.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But trust me, there are a lot of fails.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Alexa, play my podcast.</p><p>ALEXA:  When you heard that, did that surprise (INAUDIBLE) that seems exciting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need an Alexa dog collar.  Four dogs.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering dog food, ordering dog food.</p><p>HARRISON FORD, ACTOR:  You can bark all you want, I'm not paying for any more dog food.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering gravy.  Ordering sausages.</p><p>FORD:  Hey, you better cancel that order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa hot tub sucked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa, play music.  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, that's just a little bit of a snippet of that ad, Maria.  Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker among the well-known celebrities in that ad.  Just that 90-second spot will set Amazon back more than $15 million, $5 million per 30-second spot for Super Bowl ads.  This is a little ironic because Amazon has really ramped up spending on national television advertising, you know, a real innovator in terms of online advertising, streaming video, but Amazon spends every year now on national T.V. advertising, $680 million a year, that's about doubled from 2015.  It spends more than Toyota and even McDonalds every year on T.V. ads.  Why the Super Bowl?  Do we even need to tell you, more than 100 million people are going to watch this, and it has a very diverse viewing base, about 47 percent of the viewers last year ladies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we watch for the commercials or do we watch for the game?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The game.  The game always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both, I'm both.  That commercial really resonated though with the dog ordering everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who doesn't love Harrison Ford.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you.  We will keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deadly polar vortex sweeping through the Midwest.  Lauren Simonetti with the details on that.  Lauren, it is cold there.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is cold.  And speaking of Amazon, they're not delivering in some Midwest cities because it is so cold, but at least -- this is deadly, at least nine people have died in causes related to the historic -- this historic arctic blast when 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.  Windchill temperatures falling to minus 50 degrees in Chicago.  And near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.</p><p>According to FlightAware, since yesterday, there have been more than 21,000 flight delays and more than 6,000 cancellations.  Seven people stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were around minus four degrees with windchill of minus 30.  Coastguard officials say the seven people were near Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, but couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>Some General Motors plants in Michigan halting production due to the extremely cold weather and also a shortage of natural gas following a fire at a compressor station.  A dozen plants affected and all the utility there.  Also, asking customers to please reduce their use of natural gas, but there is such demand at this time of year.  Let's take a look at shares of G.M. down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And then, there's this, firefighters battling a massive blaze at an historic factory in New Jersey below freezing temperatures.  The Marcal Paper plant burning overnight, the bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out, as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries fortunately reported here.  It is unclear how this fire started.  The paper factory is 86 years old.  It survived several fires in the past.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, even in the face of that cold weather, fire burning wildly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren, thanks.  Coming up, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon now saying he has no problem with the wealthiest Americans paying even more taxes.  There is a catch, though, we're going to bring you what he said.  Then, breaking his silence, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no-call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.  But the Saints player and a coach weigh in on Goodell and the controversy.  All ahead right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining us, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Member, Sean Duffy, is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N. and former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson, is with us.  FanDuel CEO Matthew King join us ahead of the Super Bowl.  And PopSockets Founder, CEO David Barnett joining us as well.  The Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and stockbroker Ross Stripling is with us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>We kick it off here with this, paying your fair share, the push from the far left getting reaction from corporate America now.  J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, reportedly saying that he is willing to pay higher taxes that the wealthiest Americans can afford to pay more.  He also said that those dollars, though, need to be spent wisely by the government.  Here's what he told me earlier this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on what we're hearing now from, for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  She says she think that the top-end of earners should pay as high as 70, 80 percent tax rates?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  Yes.  Look, I -- you know, I always separate the corporate side, the business side, which I think we need it to be competitive with the individual side.  And so, you know, people have all different theories, but individual side would maximize returns and stuff like that.  So, I'm not -- I don't get involved in that debate because I'll leave that to politicians.  That is actually less important for economic growth than the business side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The top 10 percent already pay 80 percent of all the tax.</p><p>DIMON:  They do.  But in America, you have to look at tax (INAUDIBLE) I mean, a lot of payroll tax are aggressive, sales tax are aggressive, real estate tax are aggressive.  So, you look at the big picture, anyone would say, we should relook at this and make it better and more efficient and fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, is here along with former Arkansas Governor, Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee, great to see you, guys.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Wonderful to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  Your reaction to Jamie Dimon.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He can pay all the taxes he wants.  There's not a thing in the federal code that prohibits him from writing a check to the federal government.  If he's feeling guilty that he's not paying enough, do it.  When I was governor, I did a fund called the \"tax me more fund\" because a bunch of legislators kept saying we need to raise taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So I had envelopes printed and everywhere I went to make a speech, I pass them out, and said, you don't think you're paying enough, send it in, as much as you want until you feel better.  In two years, we raised $1168, a thousand, which was given by one Democrat legislator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is good.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because nobody wants to pay more taxes.  They say they do but they don't.  That's just a lie.  And so, this nonsense that I'd like to pay more taxes, do it, go ahead, be the first, write the check then prove it to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's -- there's just such a range of the ultra-rich, somebody like Jamie Dimon with $1 billion, somebody like a Warren Buffett with, what, $45 billion to other rich people as well with, what, $250,000 or $1 million, right?  So, the range is so huge.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, he's close to -- at his age, he's close to retirement so he doesn't really need to worry about income taxes that much.  Ask him about the Elizabeth Warren wealth tax, where she's going to come and confiscate his money.  How does he feel about that?  Because by the way, if he's talking about income taxes, half of this country doesn't pay any income taxes, and any net income taxes.  So, our Defense Department isn't funded by half this country.  Education at the federal level not funded by half this country.  Somebody has got to pay.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Top one percent as you alluded to in the interview, currently paying more than the bottom 90 percent combined in terms of federal income taxes.  But this is really about how you distribute wealth.  Let's think about growth, let's think about how to get everyone making more instead of how to take it from some people, but I think he does raise a good question, which is -- isn't really better for our society if we take more from Jamie Dimon and give it to the government, and the question of who's going to invest it better, random government agency or Jamie Dimon, who probably perhaps puts it in to public companies, maybe he invests in financial technology start-ups.  I think the track record would say Jamie Dimon is probably going to invest that money better than a Washington bureaucracy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You got to be kidding, James, you mean to tell me --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Controversial statement, I know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- that you think Washington would squander money after we send it to them?  Well, I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  Such --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, and I think the shutdown --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- stewards of our tax money.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the shutdown really raises questions about whether the federal bureaucracy is currently overstaffed as we -- as we think about spending.  It took a long time for most people to notice an impact and it was basically when the essential workers started furloughing themselves at TSA gates.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the air traffic controllers, really, that caused the problems over the -- over the weekend.  I just want to point that out.  But again, it's appalling to make people work and not pay them, I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's get to now the 2020 line-up because Howard Schultz and other wealthy business guys, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Fox News yesterday, telling Dana Perino that President Trump should not be taking credit for the strength of the economy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the reduction in the corporate tax rate of 21 percent was wrong and irrational.  He missed a massive opportunity for comprehensive tax reform.  But if you look at the facts, the facts are 40 percent of the American people do not have $400 in the bank.  5 million young people in America, mostly Black and Latino are not in school and not in work.  One out of six Americans are food insecure.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Yes.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  So, no, I don't give him, the President credit for any of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHULTZ:  And I do not give him credit for saying for two years that the stock market is proxy for the economy.  He is going to fall on his sword for that because that economy is not going to last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, your reaction.  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know how you argue that the higher growth in the Trump presidency during the Trump era is unrelated to his policies of cutting taxes and regulation.  I understand Mr. Schultz is a Democrat now thinking of running as Independent.  He's sort of charting a middle course, he's saying Trump doesn't get credit for the company, while also saying Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax is a bad idea.  But I think on this count he's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, it's crazy to actually look at what has happened in 2018 with the growth numbers and not tie it to not just the tax cuts but also the deregulation, the policies of the Trump administration did move the needle on growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can take the other side of that.  I think it's pretty clear that what the Federal Reserve has been doing is really what has propped up the stock market in a major way, and you saw the rally yesterday now that interest rates are on hold.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the last couple of months.  But I'm talking about 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we are in a position where we're not going to keep growing at three percent right now for myriad reasons, whether it's the global economic slowdown, or problems here at home.  But according to the Wall Street Journal survey of economists conducted this week, we're now below two percent growth in the first quarter and at 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter.  So, right now, we don't look like we can sustain that three percent growth number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's a guess.  That's an estimate, we should point out.  We'll get the hard data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I don't think there is a reason we can't continue to grow at three percent.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but the big mistake Schultz made was that he dried to say I won't go after the Republican voters.  And then he insulted Republicans by saying that tax cuts and deregulation really don't matter.  Ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We got to talk about the Federal Reserve coming up and what did the Fed say yesterday.  Then, justice for Senator Rand Paul, he's awarded damages after being attacked by his neighbor in 2017.  We will tell you how much money is coming to him.  Then, sky high entertainment, we'll tell you how competition is heating up between airlines over who's keeping their passengers entertained better.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Lexington Herald-Leader calling out the Kentucky Governor for saying, \"America is weak for closing schools during the polar vortex.\"  Governor Matt Bevin also said, \"We're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in a fetal position somewhere in a warm place.\"  He did add that he was being a little facetious.  The Star Tribune in Minnesota writing this morning about how veterans are suing saying 3M combat earplugs caused hearing injuries.  At least 11 lawsuits by that have filed -- have been filed this month against the company, accusing of knowingly selling defective earplugs for use in combat.  This is after 3M had already paid $9.1 million to settle government allegations.</p><p>The L.A. Times taking a look at the in-flight entertainment arms race in a tight competition for flyers, airlines stepping up their free offerings.  The article details how airlines are trying to one-up each other from United's free T.V. on some of its planes through American Airlines free T.V. and Apple music.  I haven't seen any of this, what about you, James?  Dagen?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, at what point in the -- at what temperature should kids not have to walk to school?  I don't know.  I'm not sure the governor -- you don't -- you don't necessarily need to swing at every pitch.  I think Mr. Huckabee could tell us about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I've swung at a few I wished I hadn't, absolutely.  Matt Bevin is a great governor.  I'm going to be with him Saturday night in Elizabethtown, in fact, so I'll pass along your sentiments.  But I think it's one of those things that he said in not so much specifically about the vortex, just that as a whole, we are as a country, raising softer kids, and I think that's probably an assessment.  In the context of how cold it was yesterday, maybe the timing, you know, is not perfect, but I think I understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, right, left, or middle of the road, as a nation, we've lost the ability to shut up and say nothing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're like virtue signaling about everything and looking for validation based on a retweet, whether it's by the President himself or Alyssa Milano.  That's how we get out -- that's how we derive our self-worth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We have 250 channels on television plus satellite and internet, 168 hours a week and something has got to fill up that space.  So, that's where we are as a culture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And gone is the lowly book.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe the kids should go out in that weather but get medals for it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  For participating in --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pat on the back for that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the Russia probe, President Trump is reportedly leaving the Mueller report decision in the hands of the Department of Justice.  We'll tell you about what went down yesterday.  And then a big day for earnings, G.E. set to hit the tape in just a few minutes.  We will have the numbers for you, and take a look at how it's impacting markets.  The stock is up two percent ahead of the report.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>General Electric just coming out, and the earnings are below expectations.  The stock right now is higher in the premarket.  Company's reporting $0.17 cents a share, versus an estimate of $0.22 cents a share, as you can see.  Stock at $9.21 a share, we'll keep watching this as we dig through these numbers.</p><p>More big names reporting today, UPS, ConocoPhillips, MasterCard, out later this morning, we'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Revenue on G.E. is better-than-expected at $33.28 billion versus an estimate of $32.6 billion.</p><p>So, maybe that's what's really moving the stock this morning, revenue, better-than-expected on General Electric.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning, take a look at markets, we are expecting a flat opening right now, after a monster rally yesterday, Dow Industrials unchanged, S&amp;P 500 up 3 points, and the NASDAQ up 28.  The major indices tacked on big gains yesterday after the fed said that it was on hold, in terms of raising interest rates for the foreseeable Future.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 435 points at the close, one and three quarters of a percent, and that was off of the highs of the day.  The S&amp;P 500 finished up 41, that was 1-1/2 percent higher, the NASDAQ was up 154 points, the Fed signaling that maybe, maybe, two rate hikes come this year, but it was all dependent on the data.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices look like this, as you see, higher across the board, FT 100 up 43 points, two-thirds of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index up nine points, fractional move, in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, mostly higher, as you see there, best performer, Hong Kong and Japan, up better than one percent a piece.</p><p>Back in the U.S., Arctic conditions have left at least nine people dead, nearly 15,000 flights have been cancelled or delayed due to the weather, and the polar vortex bringing a phenomenon to the skies.  We've got the details, coming up.</p><p>Then, justice for Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator has been awarded damages after he was attacked by his neighbor, we'll tell you how much.</p><p>Plus, breaking his silence, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Whenever officiating is part of any kind of discussion, post gate, is never a good outcome for us.  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.</p><p>We are getting a first look at General Electric earnings this morning, it is a mixed report, $0.17 cents a share is weaker than the estimated $0.22 cents a share, but the revenue is much higher than estimated, $33.28 billion on revenue for the fourth quarter, on General Electric.</p><p>Joining us right now is Pacer ETFs Distributors President, Sean O'Hara, and it is good to see you, Sean.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETF'S DISTRIBUTORS:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll go in to some of the flows and what you're seeing in terms of ETFs, how would you characterize the earning season, give us your take on the backdrop, so far?</p><p>O'HARA:  I think the backdrop is sort of like what we talked about last time I was here, which is you're starting to see a little bit of a slowing in terms of the earnings.  So, we got a little bit spoiled, perhaps, in 2018, we're such, you know, meteoric, if you will, earnings growth, 20, 25, 26, 28 percent.</p><p>And now, we're getting into a phase in the market where, you know -- it's just not sustainable to continue to do that.  So, I think we're adjusting to what's going on with regard to earnings more than anything.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, maybe if expectations have been set too low, we've been, sort of, discussing whether the U.S. can hit three percent growth again, this year, I mean, what does it -- what does it mean if we are growing at three percent?  Are these -- are these stocks cheap at this point?</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't know that stocks are necessarily cheap.  If we get to 3 or 3-1/2 or 4 percent, then I think they're cheap.  And I think that's the big wild card.  Are we going to get that kind of economic growth, particularly since we don't really know yet what the effect on the economy is going to be to shut down?</p><p>I mean, this was not a normal shutdown.  This was not like three or four days until they argue, and then somebody gave in, this was over a month.  And so, there's going to be some effect.  I just don't think we know exactly what it is yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of the Federal Reserve, yesterday, on hold at this point, even talking, as we expected, Dagen, about the balance sheet, possibly pulling back on the -- on the unwind as well.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes, I mean, there was -- there's generally been three, like, headwinds, if you will, for the market, one was what's the fed going to do, one was trade in China, and then the third is the slowing earnings thing that we talked about.</p><p>What I saw yesterday and what I think I heard yesterday, everybody sort of hears their own interpretation of what's going on.  But what I heard is, is that the Fed is going to be more accommodative than they have been, as far as their posture is going forward.</p><p>I don't know if that's reaction to the stock market, I don't know if that's a reaction to something they see with regard to earnings or the economy.  But I think one of those headwinds was essentially removed yesterday from what people's expectations are, going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will raise this issue.  Clearly, investors love what they heard from the Federal Reserve.  But it was a complete about-face from what they've said six weeks ago.  And at some point, do investors start wringing their hands about the economy, about economic growth around the globe, and even here at home.</p><p>We've seen weak growth in France and Germany, that's the story in the Wall Street Journal today.  Will you have a different reaction in the days ahead, when people really digest whoa, what is Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve see, in the months, in the year to come, in the U.S. economy?</p><p>O'HARA:  I mean, of the three things we've talked about, the Fed, trade in China and earnings, clearly to me, the earnings piece of it is the most important part.  That's what drives stock prices from a fundamental perspective is what are they making in terms of earnings, from free cash flow.</p><p>So, I think that's the big one, but I think if you're a little bit of a skeptic and you wanted -- you want to be a little bit more intellectually curious, if you will, I think what you would do is you would do what you're doing, Dagen, and say I wonder what they know that they're not telling us yet, because they really have made a pretty remarkable change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I would say in the last couple of weeks, I think it became clear that we were seeing real issues in Europe and China -- I mean, you know, whether it'd be France, the budget issues in Italy, Brexit and the uncertainty in the U.K.</p><p>So, we knew, going into the Fed meeting that Europe was slowing and China growth has slowed.  And in fact, I think it was becoming more and more well-known that the Federal Reserve had pivoted.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, you said you were stunned in the commercial break.  I wasn't stunned by yesterday's -- I mean, I wasn't stunned, at all, actually.  I was expecting the Federal Reserve to tell us they were on hold.</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't think they said they were -- what I said I was stunned by was, how aggressive I feel like Powell was, in his position, saying that we will use anything we have, including the balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>O'HARA:  That was the new one.  It's always been about ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what Dagen --</p><p>O'HARA:  -- the balance sheet came in to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What Dagen is saying is, the backdrop, what the Fed is recognizing, is what we -- what we are starting to understand better.  And that is we're talking about a slowdown.  We're looking at a slowdown and that is -- we don't live in a vacuum.  Of course, the U.S. is going to be impacted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why you weren't surprised, because of your interview with Ray Dalio and your ongoing interviews with Ray Dalio and what he said.  What did he say last week?  That the Federal Reserve is not going to raise this year and could cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- or do something with balance sheet to be more accommodated.  That's what they said.  But I don't think that the rest of the market has quite digested that.  They need to go back and watch your Ray Dalio interview.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and all interviews in Davos last week.  It was pretty much unanimous that we're facing a U.S. slowdown.  What wasn't unanimous was how steep it might be.  Look, G.E. and debt, the company's debt is now over $100 billion.  The Journal is reporting if G.E. were to sell its jet leasing business, it could eliminate up to $40 billion in corporate debt.</p><p>G.E. capital owns and leases thousands of planes and helicopters to carriers around the world.  The stock is up two and a quarter percent, I don't know.  The earnings, amiss, but I guess people like the fact that the revenue is better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and this is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And low expectations for this company --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That too.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- and stocks, generally.  By the way, I'm not sure the Fed has changed all that much.  What we are seeing is this is the Jay Powell strategy of we're not going to let locked into a long-term plan, we're going to watch the data, as you said, the market signals lately, have been bad, inflation lately, signals that it's mild.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But at the end of the fourth quarter, they were on auto pilot.  They were like, $50 billion a month, three rate hikes, right?  So that is where the pivot is that I'm referring to.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  But I don't think it means we're not getting rate hikes this year.  If the economy grows faster than the consensus, and I happen to think it probably will, then you could see some rate hikes.  But they're saying we're watching the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They might not hike at all, like Ray Dalio said, they might end up cutting, because from the last hike to the first cut, it's as usually a six-month period, granted they need to slow down the balance sheet reduction before they do that.</p><p>One thing I want to note, to connect the G.E., the level of debt there, and what the Federal Reserve did, that's why the market was freaking out when the Fed was continuing to move a quarter point every three months, or every -- because of the level of indebtedness of corporations, the level of indebtedness of the United States and individuals in this country.</p><p>We are a nation that can't handle even three percent short-term rates and that should be frightening to people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you've said that a lot, actually, Sean O'Hara, great to see you.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining.  We didn't even mentioned your INDS, which Kevin Kelly wanted us to, up 14 percent year to date, using money flows into some cooler ETFs.</p><p>O'HARA:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Sean.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Turning to the Mueller report this morning, President Trump says he will leave the decision up to the Department of Justice, according to the Daily Caller exclusive.  Joining us now is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Chris, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  You have an exclusive interview with President Trump, tell us what you learned.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER:  We learned that he's going to keep his hands off of the Department of Justice, for the Mueller report and how to handle that.  He's going to leave the ball in that court.  We learned that he's very concerned about some bigotry in the Democratic Party.</p><p>We talked to him about the new fight yesterday with Governor Northam about abortion.  These are -- and we also learned something very interested to think it's been a little bit under pledge so far, that he's going to put an end to any potential deal that's been reported out on the ninth circuit, on allowing Democratic judges to be re-nominated on the ninth circuit.</p><p>He said he's going to put an end to that deal and try to stack the ninth circuit with judges who are more in line with President Trump's view of how they should be.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think that's an important point you just made, Christopher, because of all the things that the President is doing that even his critics have to appreciate, I'm talking about his Republican critics, is that he is reshaping the judiciary to a constructionist point of view, and if he were to reneged on that, I think it would be disastrous for him and frankly, disastrous for the entire country.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think anyone on the right will certainly agree with that.  He had -- that's one of the major accomplishments he's made, and there's still a lot more that they can do.  There are currently more vacancies in the court than they were when he took office.</p><p>There's a lot more that Mitch McConnell can be doing to pushing this and moving it faster.  But one thing that -- one thing that is certain is, with the control of the Senate, the GOP has really no incentive to give any leeway on this, the ninth circuit has been thorn on the side of the administration over and over and over again --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  -- and to make any deal like the Wall Street Journal reported would not be in the benefit to the President.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Chris, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if you've covered this with the President, but related to these various probes, investigations, did he give any indication that he's thinking or planning to release more documents, declassify more documents, get the full story out about the 2016 election and how our government came to spy on people affiliated with this campaign.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We were pretty careful when we pushed him on the issue.  He said over and over again, that he was going to leave the decisions, for now, to his Department of Justice.  The ball was on their court.  He was hoping that they made the right decisions, but that he was going to allow them to make them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the big -- the big cojones, if you will.  Maybe he's wait to release the declassified documents when another opportunity arises where he needs to offset some investigation there, because there are a lot of investigations that are unwinding right now from the Democrats in Congress.  Did he say anything about that?  What his strategy is, in the face of all of these investigations?</p><p>BEDFORD:  So far, he doesn't need to make any moves right now.  He appeared last night when we were speaking to him to be more hands off on this matter.  But he can make any decision he wants to when it regards to declassification --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: -- or, at least, a report later on.  There's no need for him to cause a tizzy in the Congress.  And we've seen the executive branch has been lawyering up as the Democrats prepare for investigations.  Those are coming either way, but he hasn't -- he didn't show his cards too strongly on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford from the Daily Caller, there.  Coming up, breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, finally addressing the controversial no-call that pushed the Rams into the Super Bowl finals.</p><p>And a rare sun phenomenon appears in the Midwest.

The neighbor's lawyer says, they will appeal.</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaking publicly for the very first time about the blatant non-call in the NFC championship game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODELL:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Goodell says, he spoke with Saints players about that play.  But one player denies that and says, he hasn't heard from Goodell at all.  Well, the Saints coach, Sean Payton, may not be buying what Goodell is saying either.  Twitter pointing out that, at a recent press conference, Sean Payton appeared to be wearing a t-shirt that shows Roger Goodell dressed as a clown.  There you go -- the comparison.  Either way, the Super Bowl, without the Saints, is just three days away and our very own Cheryl Casone will have live coverage from Atlanta starting tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And to the weather outside, the polar vortex bringing a rare weather effect to parts of the Midwest and plains -- and it's pretty beautiful, called the Sundog.  It happens when ice crystals in the atmosphere interact with sunlight in a certain way.  More Sundogs are expected in the Midwest as this deep freeze continues for a little bit longer, but what a pretty picture in the sky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very pretty.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor and I both tell Lauren how to say Sundog -- Sundog.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Sundog.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get it right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, corn dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, winter weather gripping the nation, as you just heard.

Plus, Amazon announces its quarterly numbers after the bell; we have got the preview back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are talking about the deadly polar vortex.  The Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades.  Ray Bogan is in Minneapolis this morning with the very latest where the temperature is negative 25-degrees, Ray.</p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning, it is very cold here.  You know, it was supposed to be about 0-degrees today, forecasted to be at one point.  However, it's not, just a couple of minutes ago, actually, it got even colder.  It is now negative 30-degrees.  I just saw a picture of the thermometer at the National Weather Service here in Minneapolis.  We're at the Minneapolis Airport where all morning planes have been taking off and landing throughout the week.  They've had relatively few cancellations and delays, they've been lucky in that way, but that has not been the case around the Midwest where there have been thousands of cancellations and delays.  The worst of those being at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports.  A few people have gotten stranded as a result of all of -- all of this.</p><p>Now, take a look at some of these record low temperatures.  It's been freezing out in Chicago.  They had negative 23-degrees, that's the lowest since 1985.  In Minneapolis, we had a reading of negative 28 -- that was the lowest since 1996 and in Des Moines, Iowa, they set a new daily record low of negative 20-degrees.  And you could see, it's having a big impact on nature too.  This is Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, a beautiful lake during the summer time where you can go boating, eat at restaurants along the shore but now it is frozen over.  That is definitely not happening, but on Sunday, there's the possibility that here in Minneapolis, it could be 75-degrees warmer than it is right now and people are looking forward to it.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's incredible that we are talking about these temperatures now.  But next week, they go all the way back up.  Ray, thanks very much for braving the cold for us and showing us, really, firsthand what it's like out there.  Ray Bogan is live in Minneapolis.  We felt the cold this morning even in New York, and it's only what -- it was one-degree when you scale it out.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think Governor Bevin would be proud of Ray for doing that report outside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I thought Ray was getting ready to rob a 7Eleven, the way he was dressed.  I wasn't sure.  You know, it's cold.  I flew it from Florida yesterday to come to here.  And I'm thinking why, what was I thinking?  What's wrong with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why.  This is why you're in Virginia?  I mean, in New York?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank God you're not doing this show outdoors today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we wouldn't do that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, when you were in Davos, how cold was it?  It was like five-degrees.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was five or 10-degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You sat outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we did for three --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For three hours, at least, if not longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I had lots of layers on and got my ice breakers on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can confirm, Ray is correct that Lake Geneva is lovely in the summer time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, big day for earnings.

We've heard a lot about how the shutdown was supposed to have a big impact on the economy.  And we're going to start getting some numbers.

We finally have wages growing.  And we're going to hear this tomorrow.  Wages growing north of 3 percent in this country which is not something that we've seen in a decade.  Not during all the years that President Obama was president did wages in this nation grow north of 3 percent.  And that's a really -- that's a very positive sign and people are feeling it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  And I think it's a very, very important sign that employment for minorities, both Hispanics and African Americans, are at record highs.  And that is very significant because there's nothing that is more stimulating to the economy than people having employment and having a job.</p><p>It not only cuts the cost of government where the government has to subsidize people, but it empowers people and gives them something that they can put on the table for their families that otherwise they couldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that in this presidential election as all these Democrats get their -- sharpen their elbows and start basically sticking each other in the neck, that that's going to be -- and the attacks on Howard Schultz by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that he didn't climb the ladder -- I'm paraphrasing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this is what it's going to come down to.  Do you root for the success of individuals in this country and is our policy and our regulation, is it set up to basically encourage that success, to climb out of a housing project in Canarsie, to run and basically create one of the greatest American success stories of the last 50 years which is what Howard Schultz did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the question of socialism is ultimately does it lead to equality or does it lead to mediocrity.  And if you look around the world historically it does not lead to equality.  Equality lifting everybody's boat.  It leads to mediocrity if not disaster.  And Venezuela is a wonderful example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There was a time Venezuela was quite vibrant.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, incredible.  Prosperous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But let me just tell you that the earnings have come out.  Blackstone Group reporting better than expected revenue -- $505 million, versus $381 million estimate.  The revenue was better than expected.</p><p>The UPS numbers are better than expected on the earnings line, $1.94 versus an estimate of $1.91.</p><p>We've got a mixed story.  The Industrial Average has worsened here.  Dow is now down 25 points.  But the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are higher as we do get some mixed stories in terms of fourth quarter earnings this morning.</p><p>All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here.  Former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is here.  As well as the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Popsockets CEO David Barnett is with us along with Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling.</p><p>Don't miss a moment it.  We've got a big show.  And we want to kick it off right here with our top story this hour.  And that is big tech on tap.  A slew of technology giants reporting earnings this week.  We already heard from Facebook last night and the stock is soaring this morning.  It posted a record profit.</p><p>It reported last night.  It comes after a rocky year for the social media company over privacy concerns.  That stock is up 11 and two-thirds percent.</p><p>We are watching Amazon this morning because it is set to report after the close tonight.  We want to know how Amazon did in the fourth quarter certainly, not just because of the Amazon numbers but because it is an indicator of how the economy did for the holiday season.  It's up one and two-thirds percent right now and Amazon, as you see, at $1,697.</p><p>Check Tesla rattling investors yesterday after falling short on earnings and announcing the exit of its chief financial officer.  The company did however post back to back profits for the first time in its 15 year history.  The stock is down 4.5 percent.  CEO Elon Musk announcing his goal for the year is to see profit in every quarter.</p><p>Let's talk more about that, as we talk with ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's most important in your portfolio of companies in terms of an indicator of more than just that company?</p><p>KEENEY:  So, yes.  When we look at the tech industry overall, so first of all, we're focused on disruptive innovation.  So in times I'd say of economic distress, we often find that the fundamentals of our companies are improving even if, you know, there's more volatility in the market.  And we actually like to take advantage of that volatility.</p><p>So particularly when earnings comes around we have sort of a mixed earnings season, you'll see us doing that through our trading.</p><p>So in particular for Tesla, you know, a lot of people are concerned, the CFO is leaving.  You could take that as he now thinks that the company is sort of ready to fly without him.</p><p>You know, it went through a tough period and he's now ready to head out.  So does it change our long-term thesis that Tesla's going to be a leader in autonomous electric vehicles?  No.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When you talk about Tesla and autonomous technology, this is -- I know you see it, a lot of people see it as a huge market.  But what is it that Tesla has that gives them a specific edge in autonomous transportation?</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So actually last night on the call Musk highlighted this.  We think that their advantage is really in data collection.  They're the only automaker that is collecting data from its cars on the road.</p><p>So last night Musk said that he thinks every other player that's collecting autonomous data has 5 percent of what Tesla has.  That's what you use to train your machine learning algorithm and ultimately make the car improve.  So really with that, we think Tesla can speed away from the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>Yes.  Because that's going to inform on insurance.  That's going to have a lot of implications in terms of all that data that you can get from the car.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  There are a lot of off-shooting effects of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from Amazon?  Tell us your reaction to Facebook.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So Amazon, you know, I'd say overall -- you know, we don't necessarily make quarter to quarter predictions but I will say as we're talking about Tesla, Amazon -- I mean, this is a company that's also moving into the autonomous space.  They're really transforming logistics.</p><p>So we expect them to continue to disrupt companies like UPS, like the other carriers.  So we're excited to see what's coming.</p><p>For Facebook, you know, mobile ad revenue surprised.  It grew 36 percent, more than expected.  This shows that their ad products are really best in class, you know, no matter the controversy that we're seeing in the news.</p><p>And actually from my perspective, Facebook is an interesting company because they could see more viewership or more customers in the back seat of autonomous cars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Why is Facebook up?  I don't get that.  Because there's so many things going wrong with them in terms of the invasion of privacy, selling of private data, yet their stocks are up.  So explain that for me.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  You know, again, I'd say that this quarter really shows that their ad products are just best in class.  And they're one of the only ways to reach users on a widespread basis in today's sort of Internet age.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the metrics are telling you so much about the customer, telling the advertisers so much, so you can really target who you want to talk to.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And those users are sticky and they have Instagram which is increasingly popular.</p><p>One really interesting thing that happened yesterday, we talked about it on this program about this Facebook app that they were pushing on young adults and teens to gather information.  They were paying them like $20 a pop to do that.</p><p>And I think we talked about this yesterday.  Apple has banned that app used by Facebook from its -- basically said that you can't -- they revoked Facebook's permission to maintain that research app that targeted teens and young adults.</p><p>This is really important because this is self-regulation.  We keep talking about the regulation of these technology companies and the regulation by Washington of like Facebook and other social media giants.</p><p>This is self-regulation.  Apple's stepping in and saying no more.  And I think that's very telling about what the road ahead might look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When you've been saying they need to self-regulate for a long time.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned Instagram.  I have been so active on Instagram @MariaBartiromo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're blowing it up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check it out.  Today is throwback Thursday and I put a picture there, back from 1985 and I want to he see your throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I posted it.  And it's really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell, @MorningsMaria.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really, really awful but I did it for you.  My photo is absolutely hideous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't give it away.  We're going o talk about it later on in the show.  Hey, do have you a throwback Thursday photo that you want to share?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm working on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was a child in the 1980s.  I don't remember it very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  I'm loving Instagram.  I'm having fun with it.</p><p>Tasha -- good to see you.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Tasha Keeney joining us.</p><p>Make sure you tune in tomorrow.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January jobs report.  It starts at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow right where we identify where the jobs are right now.</p><p>Before we take a break, check out President Trump's tweet this morning.  He just tweeted, \"He said so great to watch and listen to all these people who write books and talk about my presidential campaign and so many other things related to winning and how I should be doing it.  As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around and say gee, I'm in the White House and they're not.\"</p><p>Yes, the President just wrote that a moment ago.</p><p>We're going to take a break.  When we come back, yes, it is deadly cold -- the record-breaking temperatures causing chaos across the country.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Then the big business of sports betting, millions of Americans will be watching the big game on Sunday, hoping to make some money.  We'll take a look at how the gambling industry is changing the sports world, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A deadly polar vortex is sweeping through the Midwest right now.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It is cold and it is dangerous.  At least nine people have died in causes related to this arctic blast.  One 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.</p><p>The wind chill temps fell to minus 50 degrees in Chicago and, get this, near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.  Flight Aware says that since yesterday there have been more than 21,000 flight delays plus more than 6,000 cancellations.</p><p>Seven people, take a look at this video, stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were about minus 4 degrees and on the water, with a wind chill of minus 30.  Coast Guard officials say the seven people were near Surgeon Bay, Wisconsin near Lake Michigan but they couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>General Motors plants in Michigan are halting production due to the extremely cold weather.  And there's shortage of natural gas following a fire out of a compressor station.  A dozen plants in all are affected.  The utility there is asking customers to voluntarily reduce their use of natural gas.</p><p>Take a look at General Motors' stock, down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And this, firefighters battle a massive blaze at a historic factory in below freezing temperatures.  The Markel Paper Plant burning overnight in New Jersey.  The bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries reported.  It's unclear how the fire started.</p><p>The 86-year=old paper factory has survived several fires in the past but this one happening in the cold weather, pretty historic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  that is incredible how fierce this fire is even in these incredible temperatures.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And then it spread because of the strong wind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Of course.  Yes.</p><p>All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  Well, lot of stories over the cold.  Dagen -- your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We see these stories, we report them and it's always a reminder to think about our first responders, the people who put their lives on the line to protect us all and go out and whether it's police officers, whether it's firefighters, particularly in these horrific weather conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Save people's lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break.</p><p>Place your bets, next up.  Sports betting in focus with the Super Bowl this Sunday.  Millions expected to place a wager on the big game.  The business ramifications next.</p><p>And then hitting board games -- luxury hitting board games, Fashion designer Louis Vuitton with a new twist on Jenga.  Plus a robot who taught himself to play the game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting.  He says this, \"Large sections of the wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go.  Renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border.  The wall is getting done one way or another,\" writes the President.</p><p>Well, \"let's just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games, a wall is a wall,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right.  Super Bowl LIII is just three days away now.  The big game of the season for the Rams and the Patriots.  Also the biggest gaming event, gambling event of the year for fans.  The American Gaming Association projecting Americans will bet upwards of $6 billion legally and illegally on the NFL finale.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Matthew -- it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW KING, CEO, FANDUEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How big of a deal is the Super Bowl for FanDuel?</p><p>KING:  Super Bowl is a huge deal.  If you look across all of our product lines, in the fantasy business we run one of our largest fantasy contests of the year on the Super Bowl.</p><p>We also have big game bingo for those people that aren't interested in fantasy or sports betting.  And then for sports betting, since this is the first year we're going through it in New Jersey, nobody knows how big it's going to be.</p><p>What we know is that it's going to be a huge season for people to try the product for the first time.  It's also going to be a place where in time where people will do more (INAUDIBLE) than they've ever done before.  So it's betting on all the different things.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like how many times Trump will tweet during the game.  That's a prop that you can make.  I don't know.  I just wanted to raise that issue like it's become that granular.</p><p>KING: It is.  I'm sure we can set a line on that.  I don't if we can get approval for it.  We'll have over 450 things you can bet on during the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are some of the more popular ones?</p><p>KING:  Everybody loves the coin toss because it's the first thing.  Most of the volume will still be on the big markets, the money line and the spread.  But then we have a lot of just fun things like who's going to catch the first pass, who makes the first touchdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And how many times does Gronk get targeted, et cetera.  Do you have to be in New Jersey to bet through FanDuel.</p><p>KING:  You absolutely have to.  You have to be in New Jersey.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In other words, the software will not let you bet if you're, saying you're from somewhere else.</p><p>KING:  If you're literally on one side of the bridge, it will let you bet.  If you're on the other side of the bridge, it won't let you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's on the wrong side of the New Jersey tunnel bridge.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can get a taxi.</p><p>KING: We can go.  You know, I am happy to escort you to New Jersey after that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who sits down and thinks of the things to bet on?  And then who sits down and decides here's what the line is going to be?</p><p>KING:  So in terms of the things to bet on, we have a global expertise across a number of markets because we're part of the Paddy Power BetFair portfolio of families.  And so we have decades of bookmaking experience and our marquee is how many things can we think of?</p><p>And so we literally have hundreds of people thinking up what all can you bet on.  And then we also frankly listen to users.  And so we'll talk a lot about what do they want to bet on.  And if they come up with a good idea, we'll set a line for it.  So it's the beauty of having a bunch of analysts and kind of modelers who can really set a line on anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has this business changed in the last, I don't know, two years or so?  I mean your business has gotten much bigger.</p><p>KING:  It has gotten a lot bigger.  So as an industry we've continued to grow the fantasy business.  As a company, we merged our business with Paddy Power BetFair's U.S. subsidiary.  We created the largest online real money gaming business in the U.S. by factor of two.  So really kind of span all of the product verticals that are available.  And then with sports betting we've built the largest online sports betting business in the country in a very quick fashion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the Supreme Court --</p><p>KING:  After the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- decision overturning the federal ban on sports betting.</p><p>KING:  Yes.  So it's been quite a run in the last six months.  We opened our retail location at the meadowlands in July.  It's quickly become one of the largest sports books in the world from a standing start.  And then the Web site has just taken off.  You know, orders of magnitude beyond our expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about working with some sports leagues to try and improve their popularity?  I mean I raise the issue of Nascar.  Nascar is in dire need of something to really get people re-engaged with the sport and make them excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even baseball on a smaller level.</p><p>KING:  So baseball, we're going to see -- you know, half a season of baseball.  And baseball was actually a great case study in how betting can help the sport.  If you think about baseball, because you have different innings, it creates a very easy, digestible kind of instance for people to bet on.</p><p>So we actually have people betting on the first five innings.  We have people betting on each inning.  Baseball was really the surprise for us in terms of how much more engagement you could palpably see with people as they went through the sport, just because it makes each game so much more exciting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ask Pete Rose how that worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about Nascar?</p><p>KING:  Nascar, again, every sport has an opportunity to work together.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  First to wreck.  First to wreck -- classic bet.</p><p>KING:  A lot of it comes down to also helping the leagues with their data, right.  So a lot of the leagues have all of this new data that's available and in some cases they're not 100 percent sure what to do with it.  But that's actually our core business, right.</p><p>So if you think about what we've done in fantasy, what we do in sports betting, what we do in horse racing, it's use data and create ways for fans to more deeply engage with the games that they love.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You take a bet up to the person's credit card limit or what is the limit here?  Is there a limit?</p><p>KING:  So we do have limits and we look at it from the perspective of -- the issue kind of revolves around responsible gaming.  And it's an issue we take very, very serious and so we have a standard set of limits.  And then we actually have an entire function that actually thinks about and works with users to make sure that people are playing within their limits because at the end of the day this is a fun product and it should be a fun product.  But we have to be cognizant of responsible gaming issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say -- Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was just going to say when talking about baseball, I said how did that work out for Pete Rose?  It didn't work out real well for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Not so much.</p><p>KING:  But I think you also have to -- I mean there has to be integrity of the sport.  We work very closely with the leagues around how we maintain integrity.  And again, that's a place where we leverage our global expertise.</p><p>I think the other piece is, it highlights the need for regulated gaming, right, because what you see and you can see it in the AGA stats, a majority of what's going to be bet on the Super Bowl is in the illegal markets.  And so part of the reason to push legislation is actually bring that betting activity into the regulated markets where it can be more closely controlled.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gambling and marijuana, we've come a long way in the last 20 years in terms of what's acceptable and what's legal.</p><p>KING:  It is:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Perfectly legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matthew -- thank you so much.</p><p>KING:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  We'll be watching the big game and FanDuel.  Matthew King.</p><p>Remember our own Cheryl Casone will be live in Atlanta tomorrow for the big game.  We'll talk with the legendary Joe Theismann and Shaquille O'Neal with Cheryl tomorrow.  So stay with us for that.</p><p>First -- before we take a break, President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He just said this.  \"Very sadly murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33 percent from 2017 -- to just 33,341.  this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout the country, worse even than Afghanistan, much caused by drugs.  Wall is being built,\" writes the President.</p><p>Quick break and then trade talks in focus, the U.S. and China working on a deal, day two of those talks today.</p><p>Plus security concerns in Europe over Huawei.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>Then big money real estate, Chinese billionaire Xian Jin (ph) who I spoke with in Davos last week at a center of a mega real estate deal.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in high gear now, DowDuPont and General Electric making big moves in the premarket this morning after reporting their fourth quarter.  DowDuPont down 5-3/4 percent right now.  General Electric up 7-1/2 percent, revenue better than estimates, up $0.68 a share at 9.78 on G.E.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning.  Take a look at what we're expecting at the open.  Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning, down 45 points, fractional move but nonetheless had been fractionally lower earlier.  S&amp;P is up just by about a point and the NASDAQ is up 31 points right now, one-half of one percent.</p><p>Celgene hitting the tape, revenue above expectations as earnings on Celgene.  This after the major indices surged yesterday on the Federal Reserve's dovish approach to raising rates for the rest of the year.  Basically the Fed said they're on hold, data-dependent.  Dow Industrials were up better than 500 points at their best at the close.  The Dow closed up 434 points, 1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent, 41 points higher and the NASDAQ up 155 points at the close, 2-a quarter percent higher on NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.  Take a look, mostly higher, FT-100 is up about 30 points, one-half a percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up five points, the DAX Index is lower by 22.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher overnight, as you'll see here with the exception of Korea.</p><p>Parents beware, what you need to know about the expanding ibuprofen recall for infants.  We've got the story.</p><p>And so much for the Chinese pulling out of U.S. real estate, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke within Davos last week, reportedly ready to spend big money for an apartment in New York.  We'll tell you how much.</p><p>And the next step for artificial intelligence, a robot taught itself to play Jenga.  See if you'll stack up later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour, trade tensions, it is now day two of the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C.  President Trump set to meet with China's trade negotiator later today.  Last week, China, a very big topic throughout the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION:  As China right now seems to focus on you know, macro demand management.  The supply side policy has not been stopped and then we continue to push forward for supply-side, well because supply-side structural reform.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  China is at the moment reacting with demand side measures, both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling.  But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in opening the market, that creates a lot of growth potential, that creates productivity enhancement.</p><p>DR. KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb.  So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>WEI SUN CHRISTIANSON, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY CHINA:  I think the China's slowdown is a short-term and it's largely driven by the deleveraging initiative of the government and also the trade tension and weakened sentiment.  But I think if you look at this government reaction to the slowdown is very interesting.  In the past, that they will take it the easy way out and by resorting to this credit-driven stimulus tools and to boost the economy.</p><p>But now, they're more careful because they want to preserve the good result of the deleveraging and the financial sector cleanup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was some comments from Davos last week.  One of the few comments in the -- in the panel related to whether or not China is going to open-up its market, governor, I want to get your take on this.  Because what I found from Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials from China running the financial services industry last week, he showed a real willingness to open up the markets in financial services but is that going to be enough?  That doesn't impact the Trump manufacturing regions of the country.  It doesn't certainly address some of the bigger issues like espionage, like forced transfer of tech and I.P. theft.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But after decades of going the wrong direction, we're taking steps in the right direction.  And I think the pressure that the president has put on China is incredibly positive and people need to give him some air here on this because China is hurting more than the United States is hurting.  They have to play ball.  They're going to have to come to the table and start playing fair.  They haven't done it in decades because nobody made them.  This is a president that's forcing them to have to rethink the way they do trade.  The results is, there's 33,000 new manufacturing jobs.  That's a lot of manufacturing when we were told manufacturing is dead in America.  Well, it isn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the editorial board yesterday had a piece on the separating the Huawei issues from the I.P. theft and the -- and the forced transfer of technology.  James, explain this.  Because I don't understand how you can separate these two.  I mean, if you're talking about stealing trade secrets isn't that what Huawei did?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you separate them in the sense that asking another country to obey the criminal laws of the United States is kind of baseline.  It should be expected of everyone regardless of what the particulars of a trade agreement are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I think -- and I think enforcing our laws is a great step in holding China to account.  But what we're really after is not just don't come here and break our laws, but in your country, give our businesses a fair opportunity, respect our technology and I think part of the sales pitch to China has to be look at the upside for you if you start respecting intellectual property.  It will encourage and energize your entrepreneurs who lately are not that excited about the communist government taking a tighter grip of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just wonder if it's too late.  I mean, I just wonder if at this point China has stolen what it is going to steal, forced enough transfer of technology and now they've invested in patents, they've invested in innovation, they're probably on their way to being number one in all of these industries that the U.S. wanted to be number one in, like robotics and like block chain and the rest.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think you look at the earnings of our great semiconductor companies, you look at Apple, you look at various measures, the answer would be it's not over yet.  The value is still being created in the United States.</p><p>Long-term, obviously we don't know but I don't think it's a -- and this is maybe a reason why this is the moment as the governor said, we are still the world's preeminent economy and preeminent creator of new technology.  Maybe we won't be forever, but this is the time to strike a deal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But we're still innovating and they're still having to steal.  That's the big difference.  And I do believe that entrepreneurship is alive and well in the United States and it needs to continue.  That's the key is making the incentive there and the incentive is still there, at least for now, for American companies to innovate and create something that's disruptive and globe changing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To do that -- to that point, and this is (INAUDIBLE) this morning when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, this is the number one story on the Wall Street Journal website that the United States is changing the visa process for highly skilled workers.  These are the H-1B visas and that starting this April it will basically offer more changes to how the visas are for people who have master's degrees.  Mre than 5,000 more immigrants with master's degrees or higher will get selected for this type of visa.  We need to make sure -- and this is part of the overall immigration issue, make sure that these smart people stay here in the United States.</p><p>And one other thing, Maria, because the Journal also writes about this and you've been talking about this, with all of your guests, particularly at Davos.  That one area where we can push our businesses into China is through services, through banking, through insurance, through consulting.  It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be satisfied with that because he likes to focus on goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the question I asked the governor, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Soybeans, pork.  Because when he talks about the (INAUDIBLE) our trade relationship with Canada, I remembered he say we'll have a trade deficit.  Yes, with goods.  But if you include the services which and we're a service economy, we have a trade surplus with Canada.  So, will a greater export of services into China satisfy President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's not going to satisfy.  The -- what I know is that China wants to open its markets.  It's willing to open its markets in financial services.  Already UBS has gotten the go-ahead.  They own 51 percent of a bank in China.  They're going to be able to own 100 percent of that company within three years.</p><p>Number one, Steven Mnuchin said to me yesterday or two days ago when I was in D.C., well, why are we waiting three years for 100 percent?  They want it sooner, not in three years and financial services doesn't really address President Trump's base, the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, I think China -- we'll see.  I mean, if it's a shell and it's nothing in between, but definitely I think China is willing to do financial services 100 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Foxconn backed off its plans to add manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.  That they're going to focus on research, development and design jobs but they said to make these liquid crystal displays in Wisconsin, that it's too expensive.  So, I don't know how that plays with trade negotiations.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And never forget one important thing, people also want to live in the United States more than they want to live in China for the freedom, for the opportunities.  The most important thing that we in this country that we export to the world --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But will we accept those immigrants?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- is liberty, never forget that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will we accept those immigrants?  That is the core of what is going on in Washington right now.  Do we have open arms and will we raise the number of people we allow to immigrate to this country legally every year?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If China won't embrace the entrepreneurial economy, let's recruit their talent.  And this White House policy, what he's doing is he's reshuffling the existing slots.  What the president ought to say in the State of the Union is we're going to increase the number of PhD engineers that we bring in from China, India and elsewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, parents beware, big story here, infant ibuprofen recalled over potential dangers.  We've got the story and the details next.</p><p>And then a major real estate play, Chinese billionaire  Zhang Xin who I spoke with in Davos last week building her portfolio in the United States, she continues to expand, details on the price tag, next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A nationwide infant ibuprofen recall has been expanded.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Parents listen up, Tris Pharma is expanding avoluntary recall of its infant ibuprofen because the product might contain a higher concentration of ibuprofen than labeled.  The company has added three more lots to the recall list, they were manufactured for CVS and Walmart.  Tris Pharma says there have been no reports of any illness.</p><p>A Chinese billionaire in talks to buy a $60 million apartment in New York City.  The New York post says Zhang Xin is close to acquiring a full floor unit at 432 Park Ave. the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere.  Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of China's largest property developer SOHO China.  And Maria, you talked with Zhang about real estate at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZHANG XIN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SOHO CHINA:  Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buying real estate, and so -- and but now they're worrying on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down.  So then, what does the government do and you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate, buying real estate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The New York Posts says two other units at 432 Park Avenue on the market for $40 million are currently under contract.</p><p>And this, researchers at MIT are showing off their new robot that taught itself to play Jenga.  Using a camera for ayes and two small prongs for fingers.  It can gently remove the pieces.  The robot determines which move is the best one to make by touching the pieces first, testing them out.</p><p>And speaking of Jenga, Louis Vuitton is releasing a $2,400 luxury Jenga set, the 54 L.V. monogrammed pieces are made from plexiglass, not wood.  So, if you ever need an expensive gift, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, making the world better through business, the story of pop sockets and how it's using sales to help charities around the world.  Good story next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pop sockets are taking over cell phones.  They stick to your device to help you get a better grip and make it easier to watch videos.  Today the company is launching the next phase of Poptivism, which it says is aimed at making the world better.</p><p>Here now in an exclusive interview is the CEO and founder of PopSockets, David Barnett.  David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BARNETT, CEO AND FOUNDER, POPSOCKETS:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And PopSockets, what a great idea.  How did you come up with this idea?</p><p>BARNETT:  Well, back in 2010, I was tired of my headset tangling in my pocket.  Each time I took it out, it was tangled.  So, I went down to the nearest fabric store and glued a couple of huge clothing buttons to the backside of my iPhone 3 and wrapped my head set around them, it looked ridiculous.  I got made fun of.  And so, I started tinkering with mechanisms to get the button to expand and collapse, so that it would look a little more respectable and have more functionality, act as a stand, and act as a grip for the phone.  Eventually --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you started off thinking you could just put your headphones around it, but then you realized there were so many other ideas.</p><p>BARNETT:  That was the initial problem which is a lesson for me, that the problem that motivates you start tinkering is not always the problem you end up solving.  So, the current product does solve for that problem.  But that's not what most people use it for.  So, I ended up settling on this accordion mechanism.  And we just finished our fifth year of business.  So, I started out of my garage, in Boulder, Colorado.  And we've sold about a hundred million of these so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A hundred million pop sockets, wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You were a philosophy professor.</p><p>BARNETT:  That is correct.  I'm ready for questions.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When was the moment where you decided iPhone accessories were a better line of work?</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes, all it was -- I would say some -- half of the philosophy professors watching this are laughing at me.  And the other half are probably pretty jealous.</p><p>So, it is -- it can be a lot more fun than being a philosophy professor and sometimes, the problems we're dealing with are a little bit easier, usually.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but an assassin is the mother of invention and you invent something out of necessity.  And I just love entrepreneurial ideas that come from necessity.  You created something.  I'm absolutely in awe of people who do something so simple and when I see it, I say why didn't I think of that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how are you giving back?</p><p>BARNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNETT:  Sure, today, I'd love to share with you.  Today we launched our Poptivism program to the public.  And it encourages anybody sitting here to go to our website, you create your own grip.  So, you upload your own art work, hopefully it work with an artist, unless you're a natural artist.  So, you upload some beautiful graphic and then you can tag any charity you want.  So, any five O's, 503 --</p><p>FREEMAN:  501(c)(3)</p><p>BARNETT:  501(c)(3), thank you, that you would like.  So we have a bunch already lined up for you.  And 50 percent of every sale of that product will go to that charity.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  50 percent of the sale, not the --</p><p>BARNETT:  Not the profit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- income, not the profit, which is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes.  I don't know any other -- any other brand giving this much away and allowing you to design the product.  So it's customized impact.  We have a bunch of different categories of charities including some charities around veteran services, so the Wounded Warrior, Bob Woodruff Foundation, The Mission Continues.  Anyway, long list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  And what are this retail for pop grips?</p><p>BARNETT:  They start at $10.00 for the graphics and they go up to -- there's Swarovski for $50.00.  I have a marble on my -- a genuine marble on my phone today.  And it's -- I believe it's $30.00 for the marble.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you give these to influencers so they use them?  Because I see them all over like reality television.</p><p>BARNETT:  So, the virality of this is partly explained by the fact that celebrities got a hold of them organically.  We don't -- we don't seed the influencers.  We've made some -- we've had some partnerships with influencers but originally this blew up around Los Angeles because celebrities we saw Gigi Hadid and Ryan Seacrest.  And it's just a long list of celebrities using them and that really led to their -- to their growth, quickly.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And that's because it's a great handle for a selfie?</p><p>BARNETT:  Sorry, I should explain it, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Or was it mainly a fashion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  let me see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNETT:  I haven't yet even explained it, you're right.  It collapses and expands and it allows you to move your hand away from the backside of your phone.  I have one of our wallets underneath it.  It allows you to move your hand away.  Once you do that, you can access your whole screen with your thumb.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.</p><p>BARNETT:  Without having to drop your phone.  You can take selfies, photographs much more easily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be doing that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 31, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 013103cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the busiest day for earnings so far, General Electric out last hour.  The stock keeps rising over the last hour.  It is now up better than nine percent on better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>We have an eye on big tech this morning.  Facebook soaring this morning on a record profit reported last night, stock is up 11-3/4 percent even in the face of the privacy scandal.  The stock to watch after the close, Amazon.  Amazon shares right now up two percent.  The company reports earnings after the close tonight.  Markets this morning are looking at a mixed open for the broader averages.</p><p>Take a look.  Dow Industrials right now down 36 points but the S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ, higher by 35 points right now.  This after a sharp rally yesterday fueled by Federal Reserve.  The Dow Industrials up 435 points at the close yesterday.  1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 41, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up 155 points, up 2-1/4 quarter percent.  And the Federal Reserve officially told us they are on hold in terms of data dependency on interest rate hikes.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this.  The European indices right now are most higher.  FT-100 up 35 points, one-half of one percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris up 3-1/2 points, fractional move.  DAX index in Germany down 38 points, one-third of one percent.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, best performer is Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than one percent.</p><p>Back in U.S.  The arctic blast has turned deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their levels in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's like hard to take a breath and it stick to my lungs a little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The winds, the windchill is probably the worst of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a look at when millions of Americans can expect temperatures to fall.  We will tell you.  Plus this, attacking the wealthy again.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz answers critics about his success.  Then Roger Goodell breaks his silence.  What he said about the infamous no call during the NHC championship game later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.  And former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you very much.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  The kind of interesting we've been talking about for the last year really, Facebook, how much do users care about these privacy issues.  And last summer we got those results looked look like maybe users aren't really digging this but this latest numbers, you got to say, it looks like users care less about the privacy issues than those of us in media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then they have other areas other than the Facebook business to monetize.  Like with WhatsApp, Messenger, which they're not actually getting any advertising from so far.  So one thing not monetize those think there's an expectations from a business perspective that there's going to be even more growth</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Instagram is kind of the great juggernaut that they have -- or that they're growing, incredibly rapidly but I point this out that because Apple banned this basically data gathering app where they were getting young people in teens to give them all data this is Facebook, Apple bans it, well -- from this app store.  You know what's interesting?  That self-regulation.</p><p>Again, it's not going to be the government that comes in, it's going to be all of these tech companies maybe regulating each other and realizing it might be in their best business interests to not just help them grow incredibly strong but also limit their growth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm more worried about Facebook censoring content.  I don't mean the censoring the classic sense of the government but deciding what people get to see, that worries me more than the privacy issue.  When you sign up for Facebook, you know you're giving away privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't realize is that Facebook is picking for you what you get to see and with 60 percent of Americans now getting most of their news from Facebook.  That's really disturbing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what the Congress is looking at and that's why got those guys, Facebook, Google executives to testify.  Last year in Capitol Hill to see if in fact they are censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentioned Instagram, check out our Instagram post today, it is throwback Thursday.  And posted a shot of way back in 1985, you posted a shot of yourself in the 80s.  Where is your picture?  Post your picture from throwback Thursday Instagram.  I'm having the best time on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  If I looked like you did in the 80s, I would be posting throwback photos while -- may even look like you now but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You look gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No, no.  Maria looks like Sophia Loren and I look -- well, not so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of good looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some good looks this morning.  So check out our Instagram pages.  Meanwhile, we've got a big hour coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Sean Duffy is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson is with us.  Along with L.A. Dodger pitcher Ross Stripling joining us this morning.</p><p>And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in as always.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We kick it off right here with this.  General Electric shares are soaring this morning on strong earnings.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Stock is up nine percent, Susan.  Good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Good morning to you, Maria.  And congratulations for mastering Instagram.  We'll talk about Facebook in just a bit.  But yes, G.E. shares are higher rallying in the premarket and this is because they got a revenue beat, it's actually pretty good for G.E. as you know, it's been shrinking.  There's been problems with the company.  But aviation was strong for G.E. in the quarter and that offset the slowdown.</p><p>And so as some problems that we're seeing in the capital business and also their power businesses as well.  G.E. also by the way settling that DOJ subprime settlements of just around $1-1/2 billion.  This goes back to the 2008 financial crisis.  And as you know, they have been spinning off several businesses in 2018 to spring off some cash flow and to try to make some profit.</p><p>Let's talk about Facebook because also rallying in the premarket, Faceboook shares and as you mentioned stories doing very well for them on Instagram and also on Facebook as well.  And they grew, daily active users and all geographic locations and this is after a downturn of course in Europe and also plateau in North America.  So that's important to watch. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Susan.  Thank you so much.  Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade, the President tweeting about it this morning saying this, China's top trade negotiators are in the United States meeting with our representatives.  Meeting are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides.  China does not want to -- an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal, they're correct.</p><p>I will be meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in Oval Office, no final deal will be made until my friend, President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the longstanding and more difficult points.  Very comprehensive transaction.  Writes the President.  He goes on to say, Chinese representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table.</p><p>All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully revolved.  Tariffs on China increased to 25 percent on March 1st.  So, all working hard to complete by that date.  My next guest is the cosponsor of a bill that will give President Trump executive power to raise tariffs and joining me right now is Wisconsin Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member, Sean Duffy.  Congressman, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  It's good to be with you, Maria.  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DOBBS:  So in the President's tweet just now, he said everything is on the table, all of these tough issues, does that mean that he is also talking about espionage, the forced transfer of technology and the I.P. theft?</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.  I think he is talking about all these issues.  When you have a relationship with trading partner like China, you can't do business for very long.  We have a country like China stealing our intellectual property or the force transfer of intellectual property.  So, yes.  No, this is all on the table.  Here's what I think is going on now, Maria.  We understand that China lies and they cheat and they steal, right?</p><p>So we want to get a deal before March 1st so we don't have that increase in tariffs.  But I don't know that all the other tariffs currently imposed are going to come off on March 1st if a deal is struck because even if you get a deal with China, are they going to implement the deal?  And that's going to take time.  So, we got to actually -- we don't have this trust but verify like Reagan said with the Russians.</p><p>We have I think a philosophy of don't trust and verify with the Chinese because we -- they can sign a document with us, an agreement with us but that doesn't mean they're going to implement that document.  So, folks, if a deal comes and tariffs are lifted, I don't think that's a strategy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that because they did that on beef, right?  They said that they would buy certain amount of beef and then they didn't.</p><p>DUFFY:  Right.  Yes.  You're absolutely correct.  And, so, you know, again, I -- we believe in free trade and we think, you know, having a great trading partner like China where we can, you know, lower tariffs and respect each other's intellectual property is a great relationship but when you see the rising threat of China militarily and their -- and their substantial growth, we have to take a second look at, you know, what they're doing and what risk that poses to our to American way one of life.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, what's -- you know, what President Trump has done brilliantly is, you know, because of these tariffs but also, you know, the knowledge of the force transfer of technology, you see the whole global supply chain changing away from China.  And you can't do business for that long when you steal a technology to people who come to your country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  And Americans are getting -- China is not a good home for business.  There's other places that we can go outside of China and it's having a real impact even on American earnings as you reported are American companies missing some of their numbers, Apple, Nvidia because of lack of sales that are happening inside of China because of the slowdown that has been led by Donald Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, it's interesting because we actually had Steve Ballmer on a couple of months ago, former CEO of Microsoft and he said that the theft from China costs Microsoft $10 billion in profits because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system only a fraction, one percent actually pay for it.  So, there's all of this theft going on.</p><p>What are the metrics that you want to use to check to verify that in fact if you do do a deal that they will follow through on it?  And do I hear you saying that there is no way that tariffs are going to be gone?  That you can't lift tariffs at all because you can't trust what they say they're going to follow through on?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  I think metric is time, Maria.  I mean, we have to give this time to see with actual implementation.  And so I don't know if that's a year or two years, I think -- I think you have a longer runway here on the tariff front with China but you might mentioned intellectual property I think the Chinese are suing us at the WTO for $50 billion of tariffs that President Trump put on the Chinese for intellectual property theft.</p><p>And our analysis is that they steel $250 to $600 billion a year of American technology and they're -- they have their goal to sue us over the $50 billion in tariffs.  I mean, this is rich stuff with the Chinese and I just -- I think we have a president -- President Trump who's willing to actually fight this out for the American people and try to win for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about Foxconn, a major reversal.  We talked about you in the electronics' giant first announced their new Wisconsin factory that was supposed to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs.  Now the research centers for scientists and engineers.  Congressman, what about the manufacturing jobs, how disappointed are you by this reversal?</p><p>DUFFY:  So they're still -- they're still committed to the R&amp;D side of it but you're right on the manufacturing side.  They haven't necessarily pulled out but they have signaled that they will on the manufacturing side of Foxconn.  And Maria, first of all, so they invested $100 million in the University of Wisconsin system to train our workers.  That's fantastic.  They bought buildings, they have land to build their facilities.</p><p>But what's happening, Wisconsin, why is this decision made?  Scott Walker lost.  The guy that won, Tony Evers in Wisconsin was bashing this deal from the very beginning.  So now you have an unfriendly government in Wisconsin who doesn't want Foxconn there.  This a massive investment.  And if you're going to make it, you better have a governor who goes, yes, you know, come to my state, bring us the jobs, I'm happy to have you.</p><p>And that's hasn't been Tony Evers.  And so, they've been attacking this deal from the very beginning.  I don't think this will happen if Scott Walker had won in Wisconsin but it is now because, you know, business -- Foxconn is under attack in our state because of our new governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So you -- so you blame the new governor as --</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For this, how many jobs will be cut then?</p><p>DUFFY:  Well, so they haven't walked away.  They had a promise of 13 million jobs to $10-billion investment.  They haven't walked away from that number.  And by the way, the incentives that we gave for Foxconn to come were tied to the investment and the jobs.  And so they just missed a $10-million incentive because they didn't hit the job number.  So, again, this is still up in the air for us but if you're Foxconn, you really have to consider the politics of our state and what's changed in the last, you know, two months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Before you go, what are you dealing with, negative 26 degrees right there in Wisconsin, Congressman?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  So, it's 27 below, windchills hit up to 50 below, just have been -- people don't get this in the south but our cars don't start here.  The post office, it never shuts down, the post office is shut down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Our ski hill is shut down.  My Congressional office yesterday was shut down.  People couldn't get to work.  So, you know, it's crazy cold and by the way, kids, we have eight kids, seven of them are at home, you coop up kids for two days in the house because they can't go outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Crazy fights are going and you can only watch so many movies, Maria, and play some of the games monopoly before your house is ready to explode.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the whole Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades, so they're staying home from school, right?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  You can't send these little kids out waiting, you know, for a bus to go to school.  I mean, listen you people get hurt in this kind of weather.  So it breaks today, this afternoon we start to see a breaks.  We go from minus 27, I think we have a high today of minus four.  That's the heat wave that's coming our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DUFFY:  And if I can make one last point, Maria, I just watch through the 80s and 90s, I have pull up Instagram pictures of your throwback Thursday.  Huge fan when you're on other networks, I'm a huge fan of you here.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- I'm looking forward too.  If Dagen is up, so we're going to check out Dagen from back in the 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  You know, she has some big, you know, 80s hair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the throwback Thursday, yes.  Well, that picture that I posted in the Instagram is from 1985.  Post your picture, Congressman.  Thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  I got some really bad ones too.  I got big old -- yes.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you soon.  Sean Duffy joining us there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Midwest is facing the coldest temperatures in decades.  The extreme freeze is turning deadly.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice?</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  Yes.  Unfortunately, we're going to have one more day of this and then the cold air will start to retreat but you can see the windchill is most dangerous part of this cold air.  Is across the northern plains, the great lakes, now into the northeast where it feels like minus 13 in New York, it feels like zero in D.C. but minus 40 Fargo, minus 41 is what it feels like in Chicago.</p><p>Those incredible pictures coming out of Chicago of the rivers just freezing.  Green Bay, air temperature, minus 23, windchill minus 23, air temperature in Chicago by the way is minus 21 but it is the windchill that's potentially deadly.  That's why people are urged to stay indoors.  If you've got kids, if you got pets and you want to check on the elderly.  Today will be the really cold day and things will start to improve Friday.</p><p>But windchill advisories and warnings in place for millions of people where the windchill is anywhere from minus 25 to minus 60 especially across the northern plains in the upper Midwest.  OK.  So here is our polar vortex that is dipped as far south as the Tennessee River Valley, Ohio.  By Saturday it retreats up into Canada but we're not done yet heading into Monday.  We start to see it move southward again across the plain states across the great lakes.</p><p>So we're not done.  Now, this cold air, the really cold air is probably done for the season but we're still going to see below freezing temperatures as we get into next week.  But I will tell you as we head into the weekend, Maria, look at this, so minus one, today is the daytime high for Minneapolis but will be in the 40s by Sunday.  And then, Monday, things will start to come down again.</p><p>Here is Chicago where we are dealing with minus 40 degree windchills, by Saturday and Sunday even Monday, 53 degrees.  I mean, that is a 60-degree temperature difference from today and Monday.  So something we're going to have to watch.  These are weather extremes.  Certainly, we'll watch it.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Thanks so much.  Janice Dean with the latest there.  Coming up.  We are watching markets this morning on last trading day of the month today.  Busiest day for earnings.  Dow Industrials down 51, S&amp;P and NASDAQ up.  Next up, L.A. Dodgers pitcher turns stock broker, Ross Stripling in the house with his take on market action.</p><p>Then breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the path to the Super Bowl.  What he had to say right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets in focus this morning, futures indicating a mixed opening for the markets this morning on this.  The last trading day of the month.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 60 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher fractionally.  This after the major indices rallied yesterday big time after the Federal Reserve indicated it has done raising interest rates for now, it will be data dependent.</p><p>But the Dow Industrials were as high as 500 points, better than 500.  it ended up 434 on the Dow.  154 points higher on the NASDAQ.  Joining us right now is Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and B. Riley Wealth Management stock broker, Ross Stripling.  Ross, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, STOCK BROKER, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we got to talk sports but we want to first talk money.  Tell us what you think about what you heard from the Fed yesterday and how you're telling clients to allocate capital right now.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, that was definitely optimistic, you know, coming out and saying that, you know, our economy is growing, spending is strong, they're going to be patient moving forward with the -- with the rate hikes, you know, October, November, December were certainly ugly for me as a -- as a growth investor, you know, that got out of hand but, you know, I definitely think we got oversold.</p><p>And, you know, so we're kind of telling investors, you know, it's a good time to be patient and a good time to be, you know, long-term mined I think if you think back to January 2016,you know, it definitely got oversold in that month and then all the market did was rally 10,000 points over the next two years.  So, I think it's a good time to be patient, you're getting a good -- so you can get some good names at low valuations and obviously, get some of that money back lost that we lost late last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can we go to baseball questions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go for it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So -- I apologize, I didn't watch this when it happened but Wikipedia says, your very first major league start, you had no hitter into the 7th inning and you got pulled out.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So this is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  Thanks for bringing that back up.  No, I'm just kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Basically, the highs and lows of baseball in your first professional appearance.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I mean, man, if you just think about what goes into the -- to a debut of Major League Baseball, I mean, I was just so nervous that day and then to finally get up to game time and then to -- like you said, to be able to go over seven innings of no-hit baseball and then -- and then you get pulled.  I mean, it happens so fast, you know, and I certainly thought about it more since then that, you know, things that will never get to know how would have finished but I've always said that I understood the decision to pull me out.</p><p>I was coming off for Tommy John surgery, I've already thrown a hundred pitches, that was the most I've thrown in two years.  So, you know, we'll never know how it would have ended like I said but I've have always been open about understanding that decision and, you know, maybe I'll get another shot and no-hitter someday.</p><p>MINERD:  Hey, Ross, this is Mike Huckabee and one of the things that I'm most intrigue by is your use of data to prepare for ballgames.  It sounded like a real-life version of Moneyball in modern times.  So explain how do you collect the data and how do you go about using that to plan your own pitching strategy because I think that's fascinating.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Sure.  You know, I'll try and give you the shortest version of that question as possible.  And, you know, the Dodgers are probably kind of leading the way in all that, you know, analytics and things like that.  So we have a whole division that kind of gets the data for me and I mean, they can give you as much as you want and I -- at first when I got up I wanted it all, just give me all the data possible and I will just get what I want out of it.</p><p>But now, after three years, you know, you got to cut it down to what you want which is usually, you know, what guys slug in certain counts, what they hit the hardest, what's their biggest swing and missed pitch.  You can even look like what the man on second base, you know, do they get more aggressive.  There's just tons of data out there, so you kind of pick and choose what you want and use it when you're on the mound.</p><p>That way you're not just like boggled down with data while you're on the mound, you know, at the end of the day you just got to trust your ability to get major league hitters out but you want to use to it come up with a plan and each guy is different and you go over with your pitching coach and your catcher and all of that and you have a plan against every batter, one through nine for any situation and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  -- you know, that's kind of thought.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is really smart.  Let me ask you before you go, Ross, Super Bowl 53, three days away, who are you betting on?  Your hometown Rams or the Patriots?</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I got to go hometown Rams.  I think McVay have some up his sleeve that Bellatrix never seen and they made a lot of acquisitions in offseason on that defense, maybe they can get a big stop on Brady.  So I'll take the Rams.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Ross, great to have you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow, we'll bring you live coverage of the January jobs' report starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

Blake Burman is live this morning at the White House with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  Just one meeting among that group, 17 Democrats, Republicans trying to hash out a border security package, and already this morning, we are seeing a pretty big amount of frustration being expressed by President Trump.  Just moments ago, he sent out the following tweet about that group saying the following quote, \"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time.  Democrats, despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not goings to give money to build the desperately needed wall.  I've got you covered, wall is already being built, I don't expect much help.\"</p><p>You'll remember over the last few weeks as well as the President was trying to hash out a deal or at least Democrats and Republicans were, about securing wall funding that the President said, Well maybe we can call this steel slats or a physical barrier.  Doesn't need necessarily need to be called a wall.  He's backing off that today as well because he tweeted this this morning, \"Let's just call them wolves from now on, and stop political games, a wall is wall, give you a pretty good idea of where his mindset is after just one meeting from this group up on Capitol Hill.  Meantime, the Pentagon says that several thousand more troops are going to be heading to the Southern Border.  The Undersecretary for policy testifying up on Capitol Hill earlier this week that several caravans are headed north.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN C. ROOD, UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY:  Current information shows a caravan of over 12,000 people.  There's three that we are tracking, the Department of Homeland Security's tracking en route, and one of which is over 12,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Didn't get an exact number from the Pentagon, Maria.  Currently, there are 2,500 give or take active duty service members down at the Southern border.  That is down from a high of nearly 6,000, but the pentagon says several thousand more are headed that way.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the White House this morning.  Let's bring in Former New Mexico Governor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations, and Former Presidential Candidate, Bill Richardson.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much for joining us this day, this mooring.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean this whole idea of -- that they can't get together, on an agreement for the wall or for any kind of barrier, what do you think this means?  I mean is this going to be the next two years where the Congressional Democrats are constantly resisting everything the President wants?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, the first thing you need to do is the President needs to get off this idea that unless he gets his way, there's going to be a government shutdown.  That was very damaging to the country.  And I think to the President, too.  This is early.  Look, the early talks, did not go well yesterday.  But we got until February 15th.  You don't negotiate until the very end to get the best deal for both of you.  But, look, if there are more caravans, we're sending more troops.  I was a border governor, like Mike Huckabee, governors, we got to deal with these things directly.</p><p>What we need is more border detection equipment at the border crossings, Coast Guard needs to have more facilities.  You don't need a wall.  You go under a wall, over a wall, you have tunnels like El Chapo.  That's not going to solve the problem.  Let's have significant border security and agree on increase border patrol agents' budget --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, I want to -- I want to bring in Governor Huckabee in a moment, but you said we don't need a wall.  Are -- isn't it true though that in some border security agree on we need a wall.  For example, there is a wall in Nancy Pelosi state right now, which separates Tijuana and San Diego.  We're at the very dense area.  You've got three million people on one side of the Tijuana wall, and other three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear down that wall, isn't it -- doesn't it -- I mean do you think those people would just assimilate into the United States?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look, I'm not advocating tearing down what is existing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but you said we don't need a wall.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I'm saying that for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That wall worked.  Would you say that that will work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No.  Well, that deal does not -- or no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why not tear it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, it's -- no, it's not working.  It's not working.  It's that they have good border patrol agents, detection equipment, they know what they're doing ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would be OK tearing it down then?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- they have (INAUDIBLE) the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then you would be OK tearing it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Makes no difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think that the three million people on the Tijuana side would assimilate into the three million people in the San Diego (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, I don't.  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Without that wall?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't.  You're using scare tactics.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not scare -- I'm just saying the facts, sir.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Border enforcement -- no, no, no, you're not.  Those are not facts.  Border immigration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- illegal immigration has gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's gone down.  It's gone down.  Totally all across the border.  It's gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All I'm asking you is does that wall work to separate Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't think it makes much of a difference, but I'm saying leave it where it is.  But give them more resource, more border patrol agents detection equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think the President's just saying that as well.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Go in depth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, jump in here because I think that the President does want a wall in certain areas but in other areas said, you said that agrees with the Democrats in terms of technology and drones.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ambassador, you're one of my favorite democrats.  You know I love you, but I remember when Duncan Hunter was the one who put the appropriation in for that wall in San Diego, 95 percent of the drug trafficking stopped.  I'm looking at Israel.  They put up a wall, a security fence.  They were condemned for it, but they went from a thousand suicide bombers.  I agree that walls don't need to go for the entire border because there are certain y natural barriers, some electronics, but I just can't believe that people say that walls in certain places, whether it's a fence, whether it's a steel slat, just would not have an effect, and if that's true then we should tear down the 600 miles that we already have, and I don't know of anybody who realistically thinks that makes good sense.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, Mike, first of all, the tactics that are being used to get that wall, which I think is very dubious to build because I don't think it'll work and it's too expensive is that if the President doesn't get his way, he's going to shut down the government, and he's going to do harm to 800,000 Federal workers, businesses, and then this wall, Mike, I mean it's going to take landowners out of there, it's going to take ranchers, indigenous people, wildlife.  You're right, and most of the border, you can't build the wall because of the hills, because of the terrain, so --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Bill he has been very flexible in saying that it's a combination of all of those things, it's not just a wall.  But you say he's not been willing to give.  I've not seen Nancy Pelosi give one inch, not one inch, and he's offering DACA, he's offering all sorts of concessions, he's making compromise, but where -- tell  me exactly where Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer is offering any kind of concession or compromise.  I can't find it.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, they are offering significant funding increases in Border Enforcement and Detection Equipment, that will work, that will work, Mike.  And then the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's not just to answer President Trump.  That's because --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- says, \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down -- I'm going to shut down the government.  That is unprecedented, that is damaging the country.  Are we going to allow any President, they don't get their way, that the answer's got to be I'm going to down the go of year?  Mike you're a good politician.  You're my favorite Republican Politician.  This border shutdown was not good for the President for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, actually I think that the --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The country blinds him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when you look at the polls, the President really didn't get impacted very much.  Nancy Pelosi's approvals actually went down.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, I don't know what poll you're reading, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- and the President is tweeting -- wait.  Governor, the President just tweeting this morning --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't know what poll you're reading.  It was significant damage to the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning.  Let me tell you what he says.  He says, \"Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime.  Your reaction.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Oh, I mean this -- you know, he's into his campaign mode.  This is like when he says to his intelligence people that we spend over $20 billion in intelligence, CIA, NSA, Department of Defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that -- is that tweet incorrect?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- all of North Korea, they're my -- they're my buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that -- is that tweet inaccurate?  Wait, is that tweet inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally inaccurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate?  What's inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The whole thing.  The whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, late term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's like the President's saying to his intelligence fee --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- higher taxes?  Which one?  Later term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Open borders?  Wait, which one?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know, this is -- this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate, governor?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  This is ridiculous.  No.  Open borders?  That's ridiculous.  All of that is ridiculous.  There should be serious negotiations right now.  And it's not happening.  And the President's not helping with these tweets.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know the thing is?  I mean I know that a lot of your colleagues say that they're for border security, but they didn't vote for Kate's law, they didn't vote to end Sanctuary Cities, they didn't vote for a border wall, so how can you say you're for border security when you actually haven't done so in terms of your voting record?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look at what the Democrats are proposing for this showdown, one, more border patrol agents, two, more Coast Guard assistance, three, more drones, four, all kinds of new technologies that will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they voted for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  A border wall is not going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they vote --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did Nancy Pelosi vote for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That -- perhaps that wall she voted for on her border.  All I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is that not immoral?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- let's make this work.  Let's make this work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  But not threaten border shutdowns, not end the government working, that's what the President is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  All right.  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook reporting a record profit.  The stock is soaring this morning.  Joining me now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, good morning, Maria.  You know, I wasn't looking at that profit report for the profit number or profit margin, I was looking at it to see how many active monthly users they've got.  When I saw that number come over, 2.7 billion, I figured that Facebook was out of the woods.  Think of all the scandal, all the bad publicity, all the privacy questions that have been leveled against Facebook in the last, what, year or six months?  It--- it's not touched their business.  I thought that the scandal may have reduced the number of monthly users, active users on the -- on the base, but it didn't.  They've actually increased.  And that's why I think Facebook is up so much this morning, 11 percent gain for a stock like that is absolutely enormous.  My bottom line is this, all the scandal did not touch its financial business.  The heart of its business was not touched by all the political goings-on around it.  Facebook, 167.  Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible.  You're right, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It really is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis.

We're showing you our best looks from the 80s, that's next stay, with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is throwback Thursdays here on the MORNINGS WITH MARIA set.  Here's me from circa 19857.  I was working in a photo lab, printing pictures.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I told you, Sophia Loren.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Care-free days.  I don't even know that I was thinking about what stock to buy.  I don't even know that I was thinking about me being a journalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at this complexion.  This is even before -- well, it's before the internet really, but the no photo filters, you're glowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see yours, Dagen McDowell.  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I told you I'm really ugly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do they have it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, Governor Huckabee with his daughter.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, there I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's Dagen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I jumped in a swimming pool fully clothed right after that was taken.  And I am not making that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is about 1980 --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  88.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  88.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the summer after my freshman year in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Huckabee with your daughter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.  Aww.  That is too cute.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's about 1984.  She was about two years old at that time.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So great.  That's beautiful shot.  And lastly, the photo James Freeman gave us.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so this is me.  You asked for a throwback --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- Thursday photo of James Freeman.  Apparently, this is the Reverend James Freeman.  Apparently, he was an outstanding preacher.  Governor, you might want to grade his performance, I don't know, but very influential in Boston.  My kids ran across this a few weeks ago while sightseeing, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You couldn't find any shots of yourself as a baby.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I -- well, I did -- if you give me more time, I'll try and find it.  But I told you, I never went with the mullet.  My great regret, so I don't know if we're going to have really fun 80s photos, but I'll do my best.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  Deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday, we'll do another throwback Thursday, how's that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You got to let me know in advance and so we I can dig some photos out of my -- well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So we have a week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- drawer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we didn't even talk about this.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke publicly for the first time about that blatant non-call in the NFC Championship game.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God, you're lucky the game has been great in the last year, Goodell, because you're terrible and people hate you.  No more than --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, people hate him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us how you really feel.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  What do you really think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, let's call some folks down in New Orleans and ask them how they feel.  Anyway.  No, they do, people don't -- excuse me, they don't like him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.  Hey, you've got a neat throwback Thursday shots you want to share, Stu?</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2174418430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-426C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

And good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday, it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Busy morning on earnings this morning.  We will hear from UPS, General Electric, both ahead of the open this morning.  Big technology still in focus, Facebook reporting last night after the close, big quarter for Facebook, Amazon will be the one to watch today after the close tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the arctic blast turns deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their lowest levels in decades.  We will take you to the Minneapolis region this morning, where the negative 24 degrees is having a real impact.  The push to tax the wealthy, J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly saying that the richest Americans can afford to pay higher taxes, but there's a catch.  Then, Roger Goodell breaking his silence, what he said about the infamous no-call during the NFC championship game coming up later this hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets this morning.  Let's check Futures showing a mixed opening this morning after a huge day yesterday.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 15 points at the open.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ up fractionally right now after a solid day of trading that all stock surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell signaled that the Central Bank may pause interest rate hikes for now.  The Fed on pause.</p><p>Technology giant, Facebook, meanwhile also reporting fourth-quarter earnings.  Look at that market yesterday, up 434 points at the close, it was a big day.  And that, by the way, was off of the highs of the day after the Fed meeting.  Facebook earnings beat expectations posting a record profit for what has been a difficult year for the social media company.  Take a look at Facebook shares this morning, up 11-1/3 percent right now, 167 and change.  Earnings season rolling on today with Amazon reporting after the bell tonight.  Take a look at all the names that we're expecting today in what is really the busiest week -- one of the busiest weeks for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Here now, the founder of Disruptive Technology Research Lou Basenese.  Lou, it's good to see you.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on Facebook, your reaction to the quarter last night.</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, I am just shocked and disappointed in this rally.  I mean, I think this is really putting forward that investors and management favor profit growth over ethics.  I mean, look, this week, we had -- I think one of the -- just biggest disappointments in privacy protection with the Facebook research app.  I mean, just total disregard for Apple's wishes, total disregard for teenage users' privacy, and yet, investors are cheering profit growth.  So, look, I can't argue with the fundamental numbers.  I mean, the stock is reasonably valued, you've seen growth come back in the U.S. as the key market, and advertisers just don't have any other outlet, any other alternative to reach 2 billion potential viewers.  So, it's one of those things, it's a toxic investment, to me.  So, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you wouldn't touch it?</p><p>BASENESE:  I wouldn't touch it.  Look, I think there's a lot of risk embedded there.  What's the next privacy scandal that's going to come to light?  Facebook, over the years, has really made more excuses than changes to what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's talk about the Fed -- the Fed essentially on hold yesterday saying it's on hold, indicating that more dovish stance when it comes to interest rate hikes.  What was your reaction to what the Fed said in particular also saying that the balance sheet unwind is also a way that they could pull back and perhaps stop the 50 billion sales a month.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, I don't think I can remember in my lifetime just a more dramatic turn of sentiment at the Fed.  I mean, in October, they were saying that we're a long way from neutral and now, yesterday's statement said that we're within range.  I mean, they went from playing hardball with the President to playing patty cake, and you know, investors love that.  So, you know, more easy monetary policy coming.  I think they gave themselves some flexibility on unwinding the balance sheet.  Not that they didn't say that they were going to be data dependent before, but now they just made that much more of a point to communicate to the markets that there's not going to be a fast and hard unwind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we were sort of expecting this in the last couple of months, that's for sure.  But would this be a signal for you to put new money to work in stocks?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think absolutely.  Look, the Fed has been supportive of stock prices.  I mean, there's a lot of people that would argue this bull market would not be around without the Fed.  So, with the Fed being very accommodative, I think it's time to come back into the market, we're going to see that.  You've seen a dramatic reversal even in the more speculative areas of the market.  And I think I pointed out before in another appearance that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tremendous bounce off the lows, up almost 20 percent, and about to breakthrough to the 200-day moving average.  So, yes, it's risk on again.  At least to the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Two more things on stocks, we've got earnings, obviously, the middle in -- we're in the middle of a very busy period.  DowDupont just reported they beat on earnings per share at $0.88 a share but they missed on revenue at 20.1 billion versus an estimate of 20.9 billion, how would you characterize the earnings season so far, and what does that telling you about the backdrop?</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, it's a mixed bag.  We haven't really seen a huge beat rate on the earnings on the bottomline.  I think the top like is being less impressive.  So, on DuPont's report, it's epitomizing it, right?  We're seeing some earnings growth but the demand on the top line is not there.  So, look, I think we're in more of a stock picker's market.  It points more towards active management and really trying to find those companies that are overcoming the China hangover that are finding strength despite some pockets of weakness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a focus is economic data for you?  We've got the January job's report out Friday morning, tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting 165,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9 percent.  We had the ADP numbers earlier this week, they were strong.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes.  No, they're very strong.  Look, I'm a tech guy first, but I'd love to see tailwinds and the job's market supporting that.  I think many people thought we might have a slowdown just because of the government shutdown, and just that extreme volatility in December that might have put some businesses a little uneasy about hiring.  But the ADP Report like you mentioned this week, pointing to just continued strength, so another positive for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you're thinking we're going to get a pretty good year, 2019.</p><p>BASENESE:  As of now -- look, a lot can change, I mean, look what happened in December.  So, I don't want to go on the record and say it's a -- it's a foregone conclusion 2019 is going to be great, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you've got put money to work either way, so what do you do?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think -- I put money to work.  Look, I like the semiconductor industry particularly companies like NXP, really undervalued at about 11 times earnings.  And the chipmakers are going to make this world go, from here into the future.  About a trillion semiconductors shipped last year.  They go into every big growth trend that you can think of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess.  I mean, even more so with 5G on the way.  Lou, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lou Basanese joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow morning.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January job's report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We've got our \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" special where we identify where the jobs are right now.  Meanwhile, Amazon earnings after the bell, the company poking fun in its own Alexa devices for going haywire in this year's Super Bowl ad.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Your take on that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I love Super Bowl ads, and Amazon is advertising during the big game for the fourth straight year, two spots including part of this one, we're going to show you a 90-second spot with some popular names.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But trust me, there are a lot of fails.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Alexa, play my podcast.</p><p>ALEXA:  When you heard that, did that surprise (INAUDIBLE) that seems exciting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need an Alexa dog collar.  Four dogs.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering dog food, ordering dog food.</p><p>HARRISON FORD, ACTOR:  You can bark all you want, I'm not paying for any more dog food.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering gravy.  Ordering sausages.</p><p>FORD:  Hey, you better cancel that order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa hot tub sucked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa, play music.  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, that's just a little bit of a snippet of that ad, Maria.  Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker among the well-known celebrities in that ad.  Just that 90-second spot will set Amazon back more than $15 million, $5 million per 30-second spot for Super Bowl ads.  This is a little ironic because Amazon has really ramped up spending on national television advertising, you know, a real innovator in terms of online advertising, streaming video, but Amazon spends every year now on national T.V. advertising, $680 million a year, that's about doubled from 2015.  It spends more than Toyota and even McDonalds every year on T.V. ads.  Why the Super Bowl?  Do we even need to tell you, more than 100 million people are going to watch this, and it has a very diverse viewing base, about 47 percent of the viewers last year ladies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we watch for the commercials or do we watch for the game?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The game.  The game always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both, I'm both.  That commercial really resonated though with the dog ordering everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who doesn't love Harrison Ford.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you.  We will keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deadly polar vortex sweeping through the Midwest.  Lauren Simonetti with the details on that.  Lauren, it is cold there.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is cold.  And speaking of Amazon, they're not delivering in some Midwest cities because it is so cold, but at least -- this is deadly, at least nine people have died in causes related to the historic -- this historic arctic blast when 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.  Windchill temperatures falling to minus 50 degrees in Chicago.  And near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.</p><p>According to FlightAware, since yesterday, there have been more than 21,000 flight delays and more than 6,000 cancellations.  Seven people stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were around minus four degrees with windchill of minus 30.  Coastguard officials say the seven people were near Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, but couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>Some General Motors plants in Michigan halting production due to the extremely cold weather and also a shortage of natural gas following a fire at a compressor station.  A dozen plants affected and all the utility there.  Also, asking customers to please reduce their use of natural gas, but there is such demand at this time of year.  Let's take a look at shares of G.M. down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And then, there's this, firefighters battling a massive blaze at an historic factory in New Jersey below freezing temperatures.  The Marcal Paper plant burning overnight, the bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out, as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries fortunately reported here.  It is unclear how this fire started.  The paper factory is 86 years old.  It survived several fires in the past.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, even in the face of that cold weather, fire burning wildly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren, thanks.  Coming up, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon now saying he has no problem with the wealthiest Americans paying even more taxes.  There is a catch, though, we're going to bring you what he said.  Then, breaking his silence, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no-call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.  But the Saints player and a coach weigh in on Goodell and the controversy.  All ahead right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining us, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Member, Sean Duffy, is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N. and former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson, is with us.  FanDuel CEO Matthew King join us ahead of the Super Bowl.  And PopSockets Founder, CEO David Barnett joining us as well.  The Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and stockbroker Ross Stripling is with us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>We kick it off here with this, paying your fair share, the push from the far left getting reaction from corporate America now.  J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, reportedly saying that he is willing to pay higher taxes that the wealthiest Americans can afford to pay more.  He also said that those dollars, though, need to be spent wisely by the government.  Here's what he told me earlier this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on what we're hearing now from, for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  She says she think that the top-end of earners should pay as high as 70, 80 percent tax rates?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  Yes.  Look, I -- you know, I always separate the corporate side, the business side, which I think we need it to be competitive with the individual side.  And so, you know, people have all different theories, but individual side would maximize returns and stuff like that.  So, I'm not -- I don't get involved in that debate because I'll leave that to politicians.  That is actually less important for economic growth than the business side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The top 10 percent already pay 80 percent of all the tax.</p><p>DIMON:  They do.  But in America, you have to look at tax (INAUDIBLE) I mean, a lot of payroll tax are aggressive, sales tax are aggressive, real estate tax are aggressive.  So, you look at the big picture, anyone would say, we should relook at this and make it better and more efficient and fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, is here along with former Arkansas Governor, Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee, great to see you, guys.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Wonderful to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  Your reaction to Jamie Dimon.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He can pay all the taxes he wants.  There's not a thing in the federal code that prohibits him from writing a check to the federal government.  If he's feeling guilty that he's not paying enough, do it.  When I was governor, I did a fund called the \"tax me more fund\" because a bunch of legislators kept saying we need to raise taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So I had envelopes printed and everywhere I went to make a speech, I pass them out, and said, you don't think you're paying enough, send it in, as much as you want until you feel better.  In two years, we raised $1168, a thousand, which was given by one Democrat legislator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is good.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because nobody wants to pay more taxes.  They say they do but they don't.  That's just a lie.  And so, this nonsense that I'd like to pay more taxes, do it, go ahead, be the first, write the check then prove it to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's -- there's just such a range of the ultra-rich, somebody like Jamie Dimon with $1 billion, somebody like a Warren Buffett with, what, $45 billion to other rich people as well with, what, $250,000 or $1 million, right?  So, the range is so huge.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, he's close to -- at his age, he's close to retirement so he doesn't really need to worry about income taxes that much.  Ask him about the Elizabeth Warren wealth tax, where she's going to come and confiscate his money.  How does he feel about that?  Because by the way, if he's talking about income taxes, half of this country doesn't pay any income taxes, and any net income taxes.  So, our Defense Department isn't funded by half this country.  Education at the federal level not funded by half this country.  Somebody has got to pay.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Top one percent as you alluded to in the interview, currently paying more than the bottom 90 percent combined in terms of federal income taxes.  But this is really about how you distribute wealth.  Let's think about growth, let's think about how to get everyone making more instead of how to take it from some people, but I think he does raise a good question, which is -- isn't really better for our society if we take more from Jamie Dimon and give it to the government, and the question of who's going to invest it better, random government agency or Jamie Dimon, who probably perhaps puts it in to public companies, maybe he invests in financial technology start-ups.  I think the track record would say Jamie Dimon is probably going to invest that money better than a Washington bureaucracy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You got to be kidding, James, you mean to tell me --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Controversial statement, I know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- that you think Washington would squander money after we send it to them?  Well, I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  Such --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, and I think the shutdown --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- stewards of our tax money.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the shutdown really raises questions about whether the federal bureaucracy is currently overstaffed as we -- as we think about spending.  It took a long time for most people to notice an impact and it was basically when the essential workers started furloughing themselves at TSA gates.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the air traffic controllers, really, that caused the problems over the -- over the weekend.  I just want to point that out.  But again, it's appalling to make people work and not pay them, I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's get to now the 2020 line-up because Howard Schultz and other wealthy business guys, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Fox News yesterday, telling Dana Perino that President Trump should not be taking credit for the strength of the economy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the reduction in the corporate tax rate of 21 percent was wrong and irrational.  He missed a massive opportunity for comprehensive tax reform.  But if you look at the facts, the facts are 40 percent of the American people do not have $400 in the bank.  5 million young people in America, mostly Black and Latino are not in school and not in work.  One out of six Americans are food insecure.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Yes.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  So, no, I don't give him, the President credit for any of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHULTZ:  And I do not give him credit for saying for two years that the stock market is proxy for the economy.  He is going to fall on his sword for that because that economy is not going to last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, your reaction.  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know how you argue that the higher growth in the Trump presidency during the Trump era is unrelated to his policies of cutting taxes and regulation.  I understand Mr. Schultz is a Democrat now thinking of running as Independent.  He's sort of charting a middle course, he's saying Trump doesn't get credit for the company, while also saying Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax is a bad idea.  But I think on this count he's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, it's crazy to actually look at what has happened in 2018 with the growth numbers and not tie it to not just the tax cuts but also the deregulation, the policies of the Trump administration did move the needle on growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can take the other side of that.  I think it's pretty clear that what the Federal Reserve has been doing is really what has propped up the stock market in a major way, and you saw the rally yesterday now that interest rates are on hold.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the last couple of months.  But I'm talking about 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we are in a position where we're not going to keep growing at three percent right now for myriad reasons, whether it's the global economic slowdown, or problems here at home.  But according to the Wall Street Journal survey of economists conducted this week, we're now below two percent growth in the first quarter and at 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter.  So, right now, we don't look like we can sustain that three percent growth number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's a guess.  That's an estimate, we should point out.  We'll get the hard data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I don't think there is a reason we can't continue to grow at three percent.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but the big mistake Schultz made was that he dried to say I won't go after the Republican voters.  And then he insulted Republicans by saying that tax cuts and deregulation really don't matter.  Ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We got to talk about the Federal Reserve coming up and what did the Fed say yesterday.  Then, justice for Senator Rand Paul, he's awarded damages after being attacked by his neighbor in 2017.  We will tell you how much money is coming to him.  Then, sky high entertainment, we'll tell you how competition is heating up between airlines over who's keeping their passengers entertained better.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Lexington Herald-Leader calling out the Kentucky Governor for saying, \"America is weak for closing schools during the polar vortex.\"  Governor Matt Bevin also said, \"We're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in a fetal position somewhere in a warm place.\"  He did add that he was being a little facetious.  The Star Tribune in Minnesota writing this morning about how veterans are suing saying 3M combat earplugs caused hearing injuries.  At least 11 lawsuits by that have filed -- have been filed this month against the company, accusing of knowingly selling defective earplugs for use in combat.  This is after 3M had already paid $9.1 million to settle government allegations.</p><p>The L.A. Times taking a look at the in-flight entertainment arms race in a tight competition for flyers, airlines stepping up their free offerings.  The article details how airlines are trying to one-up each other from United's free T.V. on some of its planes through American Airlines free T.V. and Apple music.  I haven't seen any of this, what about you, James?  Dagen?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, at what point in the -- at what temperature should kids not have to walk to school?  I don't know.  I'm not sure the governor -- you don't -- you don't necessarily need to swing at every pitch.  I think Mr. Huckabee could tell us about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I've swung at a few I wished I hadn't, absolutely.  Matt Bevin is a great governor.  I'm going to be with him Saturday night in Elizabethtown, in fact, so I'll pass along your sentiments.  But I think it's one of those things that he said in not so much specifically about the vortex, just that as a whole, we are as a country, raising softer kids, and I think that's probably an assessment.  In the context of how cold it was yesterday, maybe the timing, you know, is not perfect, but I think I understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, right, left, or middle of the road, as a nation, we've lost the ability to shut up and say nothing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're like virtue signaling about everything and looking for validation based on a retweet, whether it's by the President himself or Alyssa Milano.  That's how we get out -- that's how we derive our self-worth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We have 250 channels on television plus satellite and internet, 168 hours a week and something has got to fill up that space.  So, that's where we are as a culture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And gone is the lowly book.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe the kids should go out in that weather but get medals for it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  For participating in --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pat on the back for that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the Russia probe, President Trump is reportedly leaving the Mueller report decision in the hands of the Department of Justice.  We'll tell you about what went down yesterday.  And then a big day for earnings, G.E. set to hit the tape in just a few minutes.  We will have the numbers for you, and take a look at how it's impacting markets.  The stock is up two percent ahead of the report.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>General Electric just coming out, and the earnings are below expectations.  The stock right now is higher in the premarket.  Company's reporting $0.17 cents a share, versus an estimate of $0.22 cents a share, as you can see.  Stock at $9.21 a share, we'll keep watching this as we dig through these numbers.</p><p>More big names reporting today, UPS, ConocoPhillips, MasterCard, out later this morning, we'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Revenue on G.E. is better-than-expected at $33.28 billion versus an estimate of $32.6 billion.</p><p>So, maybe that's what's really moving the stock this morning, revenue, better-than-expected on General Electric.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning, take a look at markets, we are expecting a flat opening right now, after a monster rally yesterday, Dow Industrials unchanged, S&amp;P 500 up 3 points, and the NASDAQ up 28.  The major indices tacked on big gains yesterday after the fed said that it was on hold, in terms of raising interest rates for the foreseeable Future.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 435 points at the close, one and three quarters of a percent, and that was off of the highs of the day.  The S&amp;P 500 finished up 41, that was 1-1/2 percent higher, the NASDAQ was up 154 points, the Fed signaling that maybe, maybe, two rate hikes come this year, but it was all dependent on the data.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices look like this, as you see, higher across the board, FT 100 up 43 points, two-thirds of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index up nine points, fractional move, in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, mostly higher, as you see there, best performer, Hong Kong and Japan, up better than one percent a piece.</p><p>Back in the U.S., Arctic conditions have left at least nine people dead, nearly 15,000 flights have been cancelled or delayed due to the weather, and the polar vortex bringing a phenomenon to the skies.  We've got the details, coming up.</p><p>Then, justice for Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator has been awarded damages after he was attacked by his neighbor, we'll tell you how much.</p><p>Plus, breaking his silence, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Whenever officiating is part of any kind of discussion, post gate, is never a good outcome for us.  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.</p><p>We are getting a first look at General Electric earnings this morning, it is a mixed report, $0.17 cents a share is weaker than the estimated $0.22 cents a share, but the revenue is much higher than estimated, $33.28 billion on revenue for the fourth quarter, on General Electric.</p><p>Joining us right now is Pacer ETFs Distributors President, Sean O'Hara, and it is good to see you, Sean.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETF'S DISTRIBUTORS:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll go in to some of the flows and what you're seeing in terms of ETFs, how would you characterize the earning season, give us your take on the backdrop, so far?</p><p>O'HARA:  I think the backdrop is sort of like what we talked about last time I was here, which is you're starting to see a little bit of a slowing in terms of the earnings.  So, we got a little bit spoiled, perhaps, in 2018, we're such, you know, meteoric, if you will, earnings growth, 20, 25, 26, 28 percent.</p><p>And now, we're getting into a phase in the market where, you know -- it's just not sustainable to continue to do that.  So, I think we're adjusting to what's going on with regard to earnings more than anything.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, maybe if expectations have been set too low, we've been, sort of, discussing whether the U.S. can hit three percent growth again, this year, I mean, what does it -- what does it mean if we are growing at three percent?  Are these -- are these stocks cheap at this point?</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't know that stocks are necessarily cheap.  If we get to 3 or 3-1/2 or 4 percent, then I think they're cheap.  And I think that's the big wild card.  Are we going to get that kind of economic growth, particularly since we don't really know yet what the effect on the economy is going to be to shut down?</p><p>I mean, this was not a normal shutdown.  This was not like three or four days until they argue, and then somebody gave in, this was over a month.  And so, there's going to be some effect.  I just don't think we know exactly what it is yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of the Federal Reserve, yesterday, on hold at this point, even talking, as we expected, Dagen, about the balance sheet, possibly pulling back on the -- on the unwind as well.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes, I mean, there was -- there's generally been three, like, headwinds, if you will, for the market, one was what's the fed going to do, one was trade in China, and then the third is the slowing earnings thing that we talked about.</p><p>What I saw yesterday and what I think I heard yesterday, everybody sort of hears their own interpretation of what's going on.  But what I heard is, is that the Fed is going to be more accommodative than they have been, as far as their posture is going forward.</p><p>I don't know if that's reaction to the stock market, I don't know if that's a reaction to something they see with regard to earnings or the economy.  But I think one of those headwinds was essentially removed yesterday from what people's expectations are, going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will raise this issue.  Clearly, investors love what they heard from the Federal Reserve.  But it was a complete about-face from what they've said six weeks ago.  And at some point, do investors start wringing their hands about the economy, about economic growth around the globe, and even here at home.</p><p>We've seen weak growth in France and Germany, that's the story in the Wall Street Journal today.  Will you have a different reaction in the days ahead, when people really digest whoa, what is Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve see, in the months, in the year to come, in the U.S. economy?</p><p>O'HARA:  I mean, of the three things we've talked about, the Fed, trade in China and earnings, clearly to me, the earnings piece of it is the most important part.  That's what drives stock prices from a fundamental perspective is what are they making in terms of earnings, from free cash flow.</p><p>So, I think that's the big one, but I think if you're a little bit of a skeptic and you wanted -- you want to be a little bit more intellectually curious, if you will, I think what you would do is you would do what you're doing, Dagen, and say I wonder what they know that they're not telling us yet, because they really have made a pretty remarkable change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I would say in the last couple of weeks, I think it became clear that we were seeing real issues in Europe and China -- I mean, you know, whether it'd be France, the budget issues in Italy, Brexit and the uncertainty in the U.K.</p><p>So, we knew, going into the Fed meeting that Europe was slowing and China growth has slowed.  And in fact, I think it was becoming more and more well-known that the Federal Reserve had pivoted.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, you said you were stunned in the commercial break.  I wasn't stunned by yesterday's -- I mean, I wasn't stunned, at all, actually.  I was expecting the Federal Reserve to tell us they were on hold.</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't think they said they were -- what I said I was stunned by was, how aggressive I feel like Powell was, in his position, saying that we will use anything we have, including the balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>O'HARA:  That was the new one.  It's always been about ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what Dagen --</p><p>O'HARA:  -- the balance sheet came in to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What Dagen is saying is, the backdrop, what the Fed is recognizing, is what we -- what we are starting to understand better.  And that is we're talking about a slowdown.  We're looking at a slowdown and that is -- we don't live in a vacuum.  Of course, the U.S. is going to be impacted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why you weren't surprised, because of your interview with Ray Dalio and your ongoing interviews with Ray Dalio and what he said.  What did he say last week?  That the Federal Reserve is not going to raise this year and could cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- or do something with balance sheet to be more accommodated.  That's what they said.  But I don't think that the rest of the market has quite digested that.  They need to go back and watch your Ray Dalio interview.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and all interviews in Davos last week.  It was pretty much unanimous that we're facing a U.S. slowdown.  What wasn't unanimous was how steep it might be.  Look, G.E. and debt, the company's debt is now over $100 billion.  The Journal is reporting if G.E. were to sell its jet leasing business, it could eliminate up to $40 billion in corporate debt.</p><p>G.E. capital owns and leases thousands of planes and helicopters to carriers around the world.  The stock is up two and a quarter percent, I don't know.  The earnings, amiss, but I guess people like the fact that the revenue is better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and this is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And low expectations for this company --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That too.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- and stocks, generally.  By the way, I'm not sure the Fed has changed all that much.  What we are seeing is this is the Jay Powell strategy of we're not going to let locked into a long-term plan, we're going to watch the data, as you said, the market signals lately, have been bad, inflation lately, signals that it's mild.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But at the end of the fourth quarter, they were on auto pilot.  They were like, $50 billion a month, three rate hikes, right?  So that is where the pivot is that I'm referring to.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  But I don't think it means we're not getting rate hikes this year.  If the economy grows faster than the consensus, and I happen to think it probably will, then you could see some rate hikes.  But they're saying we're watching the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They might not hike at all, like Ray Dalio said, they might end up cutting, because from the last hike to the first cut, it's as usually a six-month period, granted they need to slow down the balance sheet reduction before they do that.</p><p>One thing I want to note, to connect the G.E., the level of debt there, and what the Federal Reserve did, that's why the market was freaking out when the Fed was continuing to move a quarter point every three months, or every -- because of the level of indebtedness of corporations, the level of indebtedness of the United States and individuals in this country.</p><p>We are a nation that can't handle even three percent short-term rates and that should be frightening to people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you've said that a lot, actually, Sean O'Hara, great to see you.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining.  We didn't even mentioned your INDS, which Kevin Kelly wanted us to, up 14 percent year to date, using money flows into some cooler ETFs.</p><p>O'HARA:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Sean.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Turning to the Mueller report this morning, President Trump says he will leave the decision up to the Department of Justice, according to the Daily Caller exclusive.  Joining us now is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Chris, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  You have an exclusive interview with President Trump, tell us what you learned.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER:  We learned that he's going to keep his hands off of the Department of Justice, for the Mueller report and how to handle that.  He's going to leave the ball in that court.  We learned that he's very concerned about some bigotry in the Democratic Party.</p><p>We talked to him about the new fight yesterday with Governor Northam about abortion.  These are -- and we also learned something very interested to think it's been a little bit under pledge so far, that he's going to put an end to any potential deal that's been reported out on the ninth circuit, on allowing Democratic judges to be re-nominated on the ninth circuit.</p><p>He said he's going to put an end to that deal and try to stack the ninth circuit with judges who are more in line with President Trump's view of how they should be.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think that's an important point you just made, Christopher, because of all the things that the President is doing that even his critics have to appreciate, I'm talking about his Republican critics, is that he is reshaping the judiciary to a constructionist point of view, and if he were to reneged on that, I think it would be disastrous for him and frankly, disastrous for the entire country.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think anyone on the right will certainly agree with that.  He had -- that's one of the major accomplishments he's made, and there's still a lot more that they can do.  There are currently more vacancies in the court than they were when he took office.</p><p>There's a lot more that Mitch McConnell can be doing to pushing this and moving it faster.  But one thing that -- one thing that is certain is, with the control of the Senate, the GOP has really no incentive to give any leeway on this, the ninth circuit has been thorn on the side of the administration over and over and over again --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  -- and to make any deal like the Wall Street Journal reported would not be in the benefit to the President.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Chris, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if you've covered this with the President, but related to these various probes, investigations, did he give any indication that he's thinking or planning to release more documents, declassify more documents, get the full story out about the 2016 election and how our government came to spy on people affiliated with this campaign.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We were pretty careful when we pushed him on the issue.  He said over and over again, that he was going to leave the decisions, for now, to his Department of Justice.  The ball was on their court.  He was hoping that they made the right decisions, but that he was going to allow them to make them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the big -- the big cojones, if you will.  Maybe he's wait to release the declassified documents when another opportunity arises where he needs to offset some investigation there, because there are a lot of investigations that are unwinding right now from the Democrats in Congress.  Did he say anything about that?  What his strategy is, in the face of all of these investigations?</p><p>BEDFORD:  So far, he doesn't need to make any moves right now.  He appeared last night when we were speaking to him to be more hands off on this matter.  But he can make any decision he wants to when it regards to declassification --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: -- or, at least, a report later on.  There's no need for him to cause a tizzy in the Congress.  And we've seen the executive branch has been lawyering up as the Democrats prepare for investigations.  Those are coming either way, but he hasn't -- he didn't show his cards too strongly on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford from the Daily Caller, there.  Coming up, breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, finally addressing the controversial no-call that pushed the Rams into the Super Bowl finals.</p><p>And a rare sun phenomenon appears in the Midwest.  Check this out, after one of the coldest weather snaps in decades, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Justice for Senator Rand Paul after a brutal attack.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A Kentucky jury, Maria, awarding Senator Paul more than $580,000 in damages in his lawsuit against his neighbor who attacked him in 2017.  Earlier this month, the Republican senator sat down with you, Maria, talking about his injuries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I had six broken ribs, three of them broken and then separated so they were round upon each other for months until they healed.  I had pneumonia twice, I had fluid around my lung and now I have hernia (INAUDIBLE) repaired from this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The senator says, the verdict sends a clear message that violence is not the answer.  The neighbor's lawyer says, they will appeal.</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaking publicly for the very first time about the blatant non-call in the NFC championship game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODELL:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Goodell says, he spoke with Saints players about that play.  But one player denies that and says, he hasn't heard from Goodell at all.  Well, the Saints coach, Sean Payton, may not be buying what Goodell is saying either.  Twitter pointing out that, at a recent press conference, Sean Payton appeared to be wearing a t-shirt that shows Roger Goodell dressed as a clown.  There you go -- the comparison.  Either way, the Super Bowl, without the Saints, is just three days away and our very own Cheryl Casone will have live coverage from Atlanta starting tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And to the weather outside, the polar vortex bringing a rare weather effect to parts of the Midwest and plains -- and it's pretty beautiful, called the Sundog.  It happens when ice crystals in the atmosphere interact with sunlight in a certain way.  More Sundogs are expected in the Midwest as this deep freeze continues for a little bit longer, but what a pretty picture in the sky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very pretty.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor and I both tell Lauren how to say Sundog -- Sundog.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Sundog.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get it right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, corn dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, winter weather gripping the nation, as you just heard.  We will take you live to Minneapolis next.  And then, an eye on earnings this morning, big day for energy companies.  Plus, Amazon announces its quarterly numbers after the bell; we have got the preview back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are talking about the deadly polar vortex.  The Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades.  Ray Bogan is in Minneapolis this morning with the very latest where the temperature is negative 25-degrees, Ray.</p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning, it is very cold here.  You know, it was supposed to be about 0-degrees today, forecasted to be at one point.  However, it's not, just a couple of minutes ago, actually, it got even colder.  It is now negative 30-degrees.  I just saw a picture of the thermometer at the National Weather Service here in Minneapolis.  We're at the Minneapolis Airport where all morning planes have been taking off and landing throughout the week.  They've had relatively few cancellations and delays, they've been lucky in that way, but that has not been the case around the Midwest where there have been thousands of cancellations and delays.  The worst of those being at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports.  A few people have gotten stranded as a result of all of -- all of this.</p><p>Now, take a look at some of these record low temperatures.  It's been freezing out in Chicago.  They had negative 23-degrees, that's the lowest since 1985.  In Minneapolis, we had a reading of negative 28 -- that was the lowest since 1996 and in Des Moines, Iowa, they set a new daily record low of negative 20-degrees.  And you could see, it's having a big impact on nature too.  This is Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, a beautiful lake during the summer time where you can go boating, eat at restaurants along the shore but now it is frozen over.  That is definitely not happening, but on Sunday, there's the possibility that here in Minneapolis, it could be 75-degrees warmer than it is right now and people are looking forward to it.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's incredible that we are talking about these temperatures now.  But next week, they go all the way back up.  Ray, thanks very much for braving the cold for us and showing us, really, firsthand what it's like out there.  Ray Bogan is live in Minneapolis.  We felt the cold this morning even in New York, and it's only what -- it was one-degree when you scale it out.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think Governor Bevin would be proud of Ray for doing that report outside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I thought Ray was getting ready to rob a 7Eleven, the way he was dressed.  I wasn't sure.  You know, it's cold.  I flew it from Florida yesterday to come to here.  And I'm thinking why, what was I thinking?  What's wrong with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why.  This is why you're in Virginia?  I mean, in New York?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank God you're not doing this show outdoors today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we wouldn't do that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, when you were in Davos, how cold was it?  It was like five-degrees.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was five or 10-degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You sat outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we did for three --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For three hours, at least, if not longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I had lots of layers on and got my ice breakers on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can confirm, Ray is correct that Lake Geneva is lovely in the summer time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, big day for earnings.  We're hearing names like Blackstone Group, UPS, ConocoPhillips at the top of the hour, at 7:00 a.m.  All the numbers, what they're doing for markets, when we come back.

We finally have wages growing.  And we're going to hear this tomorrow.  Wages growing north of 3 percent in this country which is not something that we've seen in a decade.  Not during all the years that President Obama was president did wages in this nation grow north of 3 percent.  And that's a really -- that's a very positive sign and people are feeling it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  And I think it's a very, very important sign that employment for minorities, both Hispanics and African Americans, are at record highs.  And that is very significant because there's nothing that is more stimulating to the economy than people having employment and having a job.</p><p>It not only cuts the cost of government where the government has to subsidize people, but it empowers people and gives them something that they can put on the table for their families that otherwise they couldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that in this presidential election as all these Democrats get their -- sharpen their elbows and start basically sticking each other in the neck, that that's going to be -- and the attacks on Howard Schultz by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that he didn't climb the ladder -- I'm paraphrasing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this is what it's going to come down to.  Do you root for the success of individuals in this country and is our policy and our regulation, is it set up to basically encourage that success, to climb out of a housing project in Canarsie, to run and basically create one of the greatest American success stories of the last 50 years which is what Howard Schultz did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the question of socialism is ultimately does it lead to equality or does it lead to mediocrity.  And if you look around the world historically it does not lead to equality.  Equality lifting everybody's boat.  It leads to mediocrity if not disaster.  And Venezuela is a wonderful example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There was a time Venezuela was quite vibrant.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, incredible.  Prosperous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But let me just tell you that the earnings have come out.  Blackstone Group reporting better than expected revenue -- $505 million, versus $381 million estimate.  The revenue was better than expected.</p><p>The UPS numbers are better than expected on the earnings line, $1.94 versus an estimate of $1.91.</p><p>We've got a mixed story.  The Industrial Average has worsened here.  Dow is now down 25 points.  But the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are higher as we do get some mixed stories in terms of fourth quarter earnings this morning.</p><p>All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here.  Former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is here.  As well as the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Popsockets CEO David Barnett is with us along with Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling.</p><p>Don't miss a moment it.  We've got a big show.  And we want to kick it off right here with our top story this hour.  And that is big tech on tap.  A slew of technology giants reporting earnings this week.  We already heard from Facebook last night and the stock is soaring this morning.  It posted a record profit.</p><p>It reported last night.  It comes after a rocky year for the social media company over privacy concerns.  That stock is up 11 and two-thirds percent.</p><p>We are watching Amazon this morning because it is set to report after the close tonight.  We want to know how Amazon did in the fourth quarter certainly, not just because of the Amazon numbers but because it is an indicator of how the economy did for the holiday season.  It's up one and two-thirds percent right now and Amazon, as you see, at $1,697.</p><p>Check Tesla rattling investors yesterday after falling short on earnings and announcing the exit of its chief financial officer.  The company did however post back to back profits for the first time in its 15 year history.  The stock is down 4.5 percent.  CEO Elon Musk announcing his goal for the year is to see profit in every quarter.</p><p>Let's talk more about that, as we talk with ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's most important in your portfolio of companies in terms of an indicator of more than just that company?</p><p>KEENEY:  So, yes.  When we look at the tech industry overall, so first of all, we're focused on disruptive innovation.  So in times I'd say of economic distress, we often find that the fundamentals of our companies are improving even if, you know, there's more volatility in the market.  And we actually like to take advantage of that volatility.</p><p>So particularly when earnings comes around we have sort of a mixed earnings season, you'll see us doing that through our trading.</p><p>So in particular for Tesla, you know, a lot of people are concerned, the CFO is leaving.  You could take that as he now thinks that the company is sort of ready to fly without him.</p><p>You know, it went through a tough period and he's now ready to head out.  So does it change our long-term thesis that Tesla's going to be a leader in autonomous electric vehicles?  No.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When you talk about Tesla and autonomous technology, this is -- I know you see it, a lot of people see it as a huge market.  But what is it that Tesla has that gives them a specific edge in autonomous transportation?</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So actually last night on the call Musk highlighted this.  We think that their advantage is really in data collection.  They're the only automaker that is collecting data from its cars on the road.</p><p>So last night Musk said that he thinks every other player that's collecting autonomous data has 5 percent of what Tesla has.  That's what you use to train your machine learning algorithm and ultimately make the car improve.  So really with that, we think Tesla can speed away from the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>Yes.  Because that's going to inform on insurance.  That's going to have a lot of implications in terms of all that data that you can get from the car.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  There are a lot of off-shooting effects of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from Amazon?  Tell us your reaction to Facebook.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So Amazon, you know, I'd say overall -- you know, we don't necessarily make quarter to quarter predictions but I will say as we're talking about Tesla, Amazon -- I mean, this is a company that's also moving into the autonomous space.  They're really transforming logistics.</p><p>So we expect them to continue to disrupt companies like UPS, like the other carriers.  So we're excited to see what's coming.</p><p>For Facebook, you know, mobile ad revenue surprised.  It grew 36 percent, more than expected.  This shows that their ad products are really best in class, you know, no matter the controversy that we're seeing in the news.</p><p>And actually from my perspective, Facebook is an interesting company because they could see more viewership or more customers in the back seat of autonomous cars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Why is Facebook up?  I don't get that.  Because there's so many things going wrong with them in terms of the invasion of privacy, selling of private data, yet their stocks are up.  So explain that for me.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  You know, again, I'd say that this quarter really shows that their ad products are just best in class.  And they're one of the only ways to reach users on a widespread basis in today's sort of Internet age.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the metrics are telling you so much about the customer, telling the advertisers so much, so you can really target who you want to talk to.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And those users are sticky and they have Instagram which is increasingly popular.</p><p>One really interesting thing that happened yesterday, we talked about it on this program about this Facebook app that they were pushing on young adults and teens to gather information.  They were paying them like $20 a pop to do that.</p><p>And I think we talked about this yesterday.  Apple has banned that app used by Facebook from its -- basically said that you can't -- they revoked Facebook's permission to maintain that research app that targeted teens and young adults.</p><p>This is really important because this is self-regulation.  We keep talking about the regulation of these technology companies and the regulation by Washington of like Facebook and other social media giants.</p><p>This is self-regulation.  Apple's stepping in and saying no more.  And I think that's very telling about what the road ahead might look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When you've been saying they need to self-regulate for a long time.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned Instagram.  I have been so active on Instagram @MariaBartiromo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're blowing it up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check it out.  Today is throwback Thursday and I put a picture there, back from 1985 and I want to he see your throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I posted it.  And it's really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell, @MorningsMaria.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really, really awful but I did it for you.  My photo is absolutely hideous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't give it away.  We're going o talk about it later on in the show.  Hey, do have you a throwback Thursday photo that you want to share?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm working on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was a child in the 1980s.  I don't remember it very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  I'm loving Instagram.  I'm having fun with it.</p><p>Tasha -- good to see you.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Tasha Keeney joining us.</p><p>Make sure you tune in tomorrow.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January jobs report.  It starts at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow right where we identify where the jobs are right now.</p><p>Before we take a break, check out President Trump's tweet this morning.  He just tweeted, \"He said so great to watch and listen to all these people who write books and talk about my presidential campaign and so many other things related to winning and how I should be doing it.  As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around and say gee, I'm in the White House and they're not.\"</p><p>Yes, the President just wrote that a moment ago.</p><p>We're going to take a break.  When we come back, yes, it is deadly cold -- the record-breaking temperatures causing chaos across the country.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Then the big business of sports betting, millions of Americans will be watching the big game on Sunday, hoping to make some money.  We'll take a look at how the gambling industry is changing the sports world, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A deadly polar vortex is sweeping through the Midwest right now.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It is cold and it is dangerous.  At least nine people have died in causes related to this arctic blast.  One 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.</p><p>The wind chill temps fell to minus 50 degrees in Chicago and, get this, near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.  Flight Aware says that since yesterday there have been more than 21,000 flight delays plus more than 6,000 cancellations.</p><p>Seven people, take a look at this video, stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were about minus 4 degrees and on the water, with a wind chill of minus 30.  Coast Guard officials say the seven people were near Surgeon Bay, Wisconsin near Lake Michigan but they couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>General Motors plants in Michigan are halting production due to the extremely cold weather.  And there's shortage of natural gas following a fire out of a compressor station.  A dozen plants in all are affected.  The utility there is asking customers to voluntarily reduce their use of natural gas.</p><p>Take a look at General Motors' stock, down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And this, firefighters battle a massive blaze at a historic factory in below freezing temperatures.  The Markel Paper Plant burning overnight in New Jersey.  The bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries reported.  It's unclear how the fire started.</p><p>The 86-year=old paper factory has survived several fires in the past but this one happening in the cold weather, pretty historic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  that is incredible how fierce this fire is even in these incredible temperatures.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And then it spread because of the strong wind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Of course.  Yes.</p><p>All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  Well, lot of stories over the cold.  Dagen -- your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We see these stories, we report them and it's always a reminder to think about our first responders, the people who put their lives on the line to protect us all and go out and whether it's police officers, whether it's firefighters, particularly in these horrific weather conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Save people's lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break.</p><p>Place your bets, next up.  Sports betting in focus with the Super Bowl this Sunday.  Millions expected to place a wager on the big game.  The business ramifications next.</p><p>And then hitting board games -- luxury hitting board games, Fashion designer Louis Vuitton with a new twist on Jenga.  Plus a robot who taught himself to play the game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting.  He says this, \"Large sections of the wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go.  Renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border.  The wall is getting done one way or another,\" writes the President.</p><p>Well, \"let's just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games, a wall is a wall,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right.  Super Bowl LIII is just three days away now.  The big game of the season for the Rams and the Patriots.  Also the biggest gaming event, gambling event of the year for fans.  The American Gaming Association projecting Americans will bet upwards of $6 billion legally and illegally on the NFL finale.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Matthew -- it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW KING, CEO, FANDUEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How big of a deal is the Super Bowl for FanDuel?</p><p>KING:  Super Bowl is a huge deal.  If you look across all of our product lines, in the fantasy business we run one of our largest fantasy contests of the year on the Super Bowl.</p><p>We also have big game bingo for those people that aren't interested in fantasy or sports betting.  And then for sports betting, since this is the first year we're going through it in New Jersey, nobody knows how big it's going to be.</p><p>What we know is that it's going to be a huge season for people to try the product for the first time.  It's also going to be a place where in time where people will do more (INAUDIBLE) than they've ever done before.  So it's betting on all the different things.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like how many times Trump will tweet during the game.  That's a prop that you can make.  I don't know.  I just wanted to raise that issue like it's become that granular.</p><p>KING: It is.  I'm sure we can set a line on that.  I don't if we can get approval for it.  We'll have over 450 things you can bet on during the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are some of the more popular ones?</p><p>KING:  Everybody loves the coin toss because it's the first thing.  Most of the volume will still be on the big markets, the money line and the spread.  But then we have a lot of just fun things like who's going to catch the first pass, who makes the first touchdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And how many times does Gronk get targeted, et cetera.  Do you have to be in New Jersey to bet through FanDuel.</p><p>KING:  You absolutely have to.  You have to be in New Jersey.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In other words, the software will not let you bet if you're, saying you're from somewhere else.</p><p>KING:  If you're literally on one side of the bridge, it will let you bet.  If you're on the other side of the bridge, it won't let you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's on the wrong side of the New Jersey tunnel bridge.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can get a taxi.</p><p>KING: We can go.  You know, I am happy to escort you to New Jersey after that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who sits down and thinks of the things to bet on?  And then who sits down and decides here's what the line is going to be?</p><p>KING:  So in terms of the things to bet on, we have a global expertise across a number of markets because we're part of the Paddy Power BetFair portfolio of families.  And so we have decades of bookmaking experience and our marquee is how many things can we think of?</p><p>And so we literally have hundreds of people thinking up what all can you bet on.  And then we also frankly listen to users.  And so we'll talk a lot about what do they want to bet on.  And if they come up with a good idea, we'll set a line for it.  So it's the beauty of having a bunch of analysts and kind of modelers who can really set a line on anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has this business changed in the last, I don't know, two years or so?  I mean your business has gotten much bigger.</p><p>KING:  It has gotten a lot bigger.  So as an industry we've continued to grow the fantasy business.  As a company, we merged our business with Paddy Power BetFair's U.S. subsidiary.  We created the largest online real money gaming business in the U.S. by factor of two.  So really kind of span all of the product verticals that are available.  And then with sports betting we've built the largest online sports betting business in the country in a very quick fashion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the Supreme Court --</p><p>KING:  After the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- decision overturning the federal ban on sports betting.</p><p>KING:  Yes.  So it's been quite a run in the last six months.  We opened our retail location at the meadowlands in July.  It's quickly become one of the largest sports books in the world from a standing start.  And then the Web site has just taken off.  You know, orders of magnitude beyond our expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about working with some sports leagues to try and improve their popularity?  I mean I raise the issue of Nascar.  Nascar is in dire need of something to really get people re-engaged with the sport and make them excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even baseball on a smaller level.</p><p>KING:  So baseball, we're going to see -- you know, half a season of baseball.  And baseball was actually a great case study in how betting can help the sport.  If you think about baseball, because you have different innings, it creates a very easy, digestible kind of instance for people to bet on.</p><p>So we actually have people betting on the first five innings.  We have people betting on each inning.  Baseball was really the surprise for us in terms of how much more engagement you could palpably see with people as they went through the sport, just because it makes each game so much more exciting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ask Pete Rose how that worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about Nascar?</p><p>KING:  Nascar, again, every sport has an opportunity to work together.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  First to wreck.  First to wreck -- classic bet.</p><p>KING:  A lot of it comes down to also helping the leagues with their data, right.  So a lot of the leagues have all of this new data that's available and in some cases they're not 100 percent sure what to do with it.  But that's actually our core business, right.</p><p>So if you think about what we've done in fantasy, what we do in sports betting, what we do in horse racing, it's use data and create ways for fans to more deeply engage with the games that they love.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You take a bet up to the person's credit card limit or what is the limit here?  Is there a limit?</p><p>KING:  So we do have limits and we look at it from the perspective of -- the issue kind of revolves around responsible gaming.  And it's an issue we take very, very serious and so we have a standard set of limits.  And then we actually have an entire function that actually thinks about and works with users to make sure that people are playing within their limits because at the end of the day this is a fun product and it should be a fun product.  But we have to be cognizant of responsible gaming issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say -- Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was just going to say when talking about baseball, I said how did that work out for Pete Rose?  It didn't work out real well for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Not so much.</p><p>KING:  But I think you also have to -- I mean there has to be integrity of the sport.  We work very closely with the leagues around how we maintain integrity.  And again, that's a place where we leverage our global expertise.</p><p>I think the other piece is, it highlights the need for regulated gaming, right, because what you see and you can see it in the AGA stats, a majority of what's going to be bet on the Super Bowl is in the illegal markets.  And so part of the reason to push legislation is actually bring that betting activity into the regulated markets where it can be more closely controlled.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gambling and marijuana, we've come a long way in the last 20 years in terms of what's acceptable and what's legal.</p><p>KING:  It is:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Perfectly legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matthew -- thank you so much.</p><p>KING:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  We'll be watching the big game and FanDuel.  Matthew King.</p><p>Remember our own Cheryl Casone will be live in Atlanta tomorrow for the big game.  We'll talk with the legendary Joe Theismann and Shaquille O'Neal with Cheryl tomorrow.  So stay with us for that.</p><p>First -- before we take a break, President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He just said this.  \"Very sadly murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33 percent from 2017 -- to just 33,341.  this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout the country, worse even than Afghanistan, much caused by drugs.  Wall is being built,\" writes the President.</p><p>Quick break and then trade talks in focus, the U.S. and China working on a deal, day two of those talks today.</p><p>Plus security concerns in Europe over Huawei.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>Then big money real estate, Chinese billionaire Xian Jin (ph) who I spoke with in Davos last week at a center of a mega real estate deal.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in high gear now, DowDuPont and General Electric making big moves in the premarket this morning after reporting their fourth quarter.  DowDuPont down 5-3/4 percent right now.  General Electric up 7-1/2 percent, revenue better than estimates, up $0.68 a share at 9.78 on G.E.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning.  Take a look at what we're expecting at the open.  Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning, down 45 points, fractional move but nonetheless had been fractionally lower earlier.  S&amp;P is up just by about a point and the NASDAQ is up 31 points right now, one-half of one percent.</p><p>Celgene hitting the tape, revenue above expectations as earnings on Celgene.  This after the major indices surged yesterday on the Federal Reserve's dovish approach to raising rates for the rest of the year.  Basically the Fed said they're on hold, data-dependent.  Dow Industrials were up better than 500 points at their best at the close.  The Dow closed up 434 points, 1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent, 41 points higher and the NASDAQ up 155 points at the close, 2-a quarter percent higher on NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.  Take a look, mostly higher, FT-100 is up about 30 points, one-half a percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up five points, the DAX Index is lower by 22.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher overnight, as you'll see here with the exception of Korea.</p><p>Parents beware, what you need to know about the expanding ibuprofen recall for infants.  We've got the story.</p><p>And so much for the Chinese pulling out of U.S. real estate, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke within Davos last week, reportedly ready to spend big money for an apartment in New York.  We'll tell you how much.</p><p>And the next step for artificial intelligence, a robot taught itself to play Jenga.  See if you'll stack up later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour, trade tensions, it is now day two of the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C.  President Trump set to meet with China's trade negotiator later today.  Last week, China, a very big topic throughout the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION:  As China right now seems to focus on you know, macro demand management.  The supply side policy has not been stopped and then we continue to push forward for supply-side, well because supply-side structural reform.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  China is at the moment reacting with demand side measures, both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling.  But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in opening the market, that creates a lot of growth potential, that creates productivity enhancement.</p><p>DR. KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb.  So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>WEI SUN CHRISTIANSON, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY CHINA:  I think the China's slowdown is a short-term and it's largely driven by the deleveraging initiative of the government and also the trade tension and weakened sentiment.  But I think if you look at this government reaction to the slowdown is very interesting.  In the past, that they will take it the easy way out and by resorting to this credit-driven stimulus tools and to boost the economy.</p><p>But now, they're more careful because they want to preserve the good result of the deleveraging and the financial sector cleanup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was some comments from Davos last week.  One of the few comments in the -- in the panel related to whether or not China is going to open-up its market, governor, I want to get your take on this.  Because what I found from Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials from China running the financial services industry last week, he showed a real willingness to open up the markets in financial services but is that going to be enough?  That doesn't impact the Trump manufacturing regions of the country.  It doesn't certainly address some of the bigger issues like espionage, like forced transfer of tech and I.P. theft.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But after decades of going the wrong direction, we're taking steps in the right direction.  And I think the pressure that the president has put on China is incredibly positive and people need to give him some air here on this because China is hurting more than the United States is hurting.  They have to play ball.  They're going to have to come to the table and start playing fair.  They haven't done it in decades because nobody made them.  This is a president that's forcing them to have to rethink the way they do trade.  The results is, there's 33,000 new manufacturing jobs.  That's a lot of manufacturing when we were told manufacturing is dead in America.  Well, it isn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the editorial board yesterday had a piece on the separating the Huawei issues from the I.P. theft and the -- and the forced transfer of technology.  James, explain this.  Because I don't understand how you can separate these two.  I mean, if you're talking about stealing trade secrets isn't that what Huawei did?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you separate them in the sense that asking another country to obey the criminal laws of the United States is kind of baseline.  It should be expected of everyone regardless of what the particulars of a trade agreement are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I think -- and I think enforcing our laws is a great step in holding China to account.  But what we're really after is not just don't come here and break our laws, but in your country, give our businesses a fair opportunity, respect our technology and I think part of the sales pitch to China has to be look at the upside for you if you start respecting intellectual property.  It will encourage and energize your entrepreneurs who lately are not that excited about the communist government taking a tighter grip of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just wonder if it's too late.  I mean, I just wonder if at this point China has stolen what it is going to steal, forced enough transfer of technology and now they've invested in patents, they've invested in innovation, they're probably on their way to being number one in all of these industries that the U.S. wanted to be number one in, like robotics and like block chain and the rest.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think you look at the earnings of our great semiconductor companies, you look at Apple, you look at various measures, the answer would be it's not over yet.  The value is still being created in the United States.</p><p>Long-term, obviously we don't know but I don't think it's a -- and this is maybe a reason why this is the moment as the governor said, we are still the world's preeminent economy and preeminent creator of new technology.  Maybe we won't be forever, but this is the time to strike a deal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But we're still innovating and they're still having to steal.  That's the big difference.  And I do believe that entrepreneurship is alive and well in the United States and it needs to continue.  That's the key is making the incentive there and the incentive is still there, at least for now, for American companies to innovate and create something that's disruptive and globe changing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To do that -- to that point, and this is (INAUDIBLE) this morning when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, this is the number one story on the Wall Street Journal website that the United States is changing the visa process for highly skilled workers.  These are the H-1B visas and that starting this April it will basically offer more changes to how the visas are for people who have master's degrees.  Mre than 5,000 more immigrants with master's degrees or higher will get selected for this type of visa.  We need to make sure -- and this is part of the overall immigration issue, make sure that these smart people stay here in the United States.</p><p>And one other thing, Maria, because the Journal also writes about this and you've been talking about this, with all of your guests, particularly at Davos.  That one area where we can push our businesses into China is through services, through banking, through insurance, through consulting.  It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be satisfied with that because he likes to focus on goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the question I asked the governor, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Soybeans, pork.  Because when he talks about the (INAUDIBLE) our trade relationship with Canada, I remembered he say we'll have a trade deficit.  Yes, with goods.  But if you include the services which and we're a service economy, we have a trade surplus with Canada.  So, will a greater export of services into China satisfy President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's not going to satisfy.  The -- what I know is that China wants to open its markets.  It's willing to open its markets in financial services.  Already UBS has gotten the go-ahead.  They own 51 percent of a bank in China.  They're going to be able to own 100 percent of that company within three years.</p><p>Number one, Steven Mnuchin said to me yesterday or two days ago when I was in D.C., well, why are we waiting three years for 100 percent?  They want it sooner, not in three years and financial services doesn't really address President Trump's base, the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, I think China -- we'll see.  I mean, if it's a shell and it's nothing in between, but definitely I think China is willing to do financial services 100 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Foxconn backed off its plans to add manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.  That they're going to focus on research, development and design jobs but they said to make these liquid crystal displays in Wisconsin, that it's too expensive.  So, I don't know how that plays with trade negotiations.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And never forget one important thing, people also want to live in the United States more than they want to live in China for the freedom, for the opportunities.  The most important thing that we in this country that we export to the world --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But will we accept those immigrants?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- is liberty, never forget that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will we accept those immigrants?  That is the core of what is going on in Washington right now.  Do we have open arms and will we raise the number of people we allow to immigrate to this country legally every year?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If China won't embrace the entrepreneurial economy, let's recruit their talent.  And this White House policy, what he's doing is he's reshuffling the existing slots.  What the president ought to say in the State of the Union is we're going to increase the number of PhD engineers that we bring in from China, India and elsewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, parents beware, big story here, infant ibuprofen recalled over potential dangers.  We've got the story and the details next.</p><p>And then a major real estate play, Chinese billionaire  Zhang Xin who I spoke with in Davos last week building her portfolio in the United States, she continues to expand, details on the price tag, next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A nationwide infant ibuprofen recall has been expanded.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Parents listen up, Tris Pharma is expanding avoluntary recall of its infant ibuprofen because the product might contain a higher concentration of ibuprofen than labeled.  The company has added three more lots to the recall list, they were manufactured for CVS and Walmart.  Tris Pharma says there have been no reports of any illness.</p><p>A Chinese billionaire in talks to buy a $60 million apartment in New York City.  The New York post says Zhang Xin is close to acquiring a full floor unit at 432 Park Ave. the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere.  Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of China's largest property developer SOHO China.  And Maria, you talked with Zhang about real estate at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZHANG XIN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SOHO CHINA:  Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buying real estate, and so -- and but now they're worrying on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down.  So then, what does the government do and you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate, buying real estate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The New York Posts says two other units at 432 Park Avenue on the market for $40 million are currently under contract.</p><p>And this, researchers at MIT are showing off their new robot that taught itself to play Jenga.  Using a camera for ayes and two small prongs for fingers.  It can gently remove the pieces.  The robot determines which move is the best one to make by touching the pieces first, testing them out.</p><p>And speaking of Jenga, Louis Vuitton is releasing a $2,400 luxury Jenga set, the 54 L.V. monogrammed pieces are made from plexiglass, not wood.  So, if you ever need an expensive gift, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, making the world better through business, the story of pop sockets and how it's using sales to help charities around the world.  Good story next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pop sockets are taking over cell phones.  They stick to your device to help you get a better grip and make it easier to watch videos.  Today the company is launching the next phase of Poptivism, which it says is aimed at making the world better.</p><p>Here now in an exclusive interview is the CEO and founder of PopSockets, David Barnett.  David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BARNETT, CEO AND FOUNDER, POPSOCKETS:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And PopSockets, what a great idea.  How did you come up with this idea?</p><p>BARNETT:  Well, back in 2010, I was tired of my headset tangling in my pocket.  Each time I took it out, it was tangled.  So, I went down to the nearest fabric store and glued a couple of huge clothing buttons to the backside of my iPhone 3 and wrapped my head set around them, it looked ridiculous.  I got made fun of.  And so, I started tinkering with mechanisms to get the button to expand and collapse, so that it would look a little more respectable and have more functionality, act as a stand, and act as a grip for the phone.  Eventually --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you started off thinking you could just put your headphones around it, but then you realized there were so many other ideas.</p><p>BARNETT:  That was the initial problem which is a lesson for me, that the problem that motivates you start tinkering is not always the problem you end up solving.  So, the current product does solve for that problem.  But that's not what most people use it for.  So, I ended up settling on this accordion mechanism.  And we just finished our fifth year of business.  So, I started out of my garage, in Boulder, Colorado.  And we've sold about a hundred million of these so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A hundred million pop sockets, wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You were a philosophy professor.</p><p>BARNETT:  That is correct.  I'm ready for questions.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When was the moment where you decided iPhone accessories were a better line of work?</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes, all it was -- I would say some -- half of the philosophy professors watching this are laughing at me.  And the other half are probably pretty jealous.</p><p>So, it is -- it can be a lot more fun than being a philosophy professor and sometimes, the problems we're dealing with are a little bit easier, usually.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but an assassin is the mother of invention and you invent something out of necessity.  And I just love entrepreneurial ideas that come from necessity.  You created something.  I'm absolutely in awe of people who do something so simple and when I see it, I say why didn't I think of that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how are you giving back?</p><p>BARNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNETT:  Sure, today, I'd love to share with you.  Today we launched our Poptivism program to the public.  And it encourages anybody sitting here to go to our website, you create your own grip.  So, you upload your own art work, hopefully it work with an artist, unless you're a natural artist.  So, you upload some beautiful graphic and then you can tag any charity you want.  So, any five O's, 503 --</p><p>FREEMAN:  501(c)(3)</p><p>BARNETT:  501(c)(3), thank you, that you would like.  So we have a bunch already lined up for you.  And 50 percent of every sale of that product will go to that charity.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  50 percent of the sale, not the --</p><p>BARNETT:  Not the profit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- income, not the profit, which is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes.  I don't know any other -- any other brand giving this much away and allowing you to design the product.  So it's customized impact.  We have a bunch of different categories of charities including some charities around veteran services, so the Wounded Warrior, Bob Woodruff Foundation, The Mission Continues.  Anyway, long list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  And what are this retail for pop grips?</p><p>BARNETT:  They start at $10.00 for the graphics and they go up to -- there's Swarovski for $50.00.  I have a marble on my -- a genuine marble on my phone today.  And it's -- I believe it's $30.00 for the marble.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you give these to influencers so they use them?  Because I see them all over like reality television.</p><p>BARNETT:  So, the virality of this is partly explained by the fact that celebrities got a hold of them organically.  We don't -- we don't seed the influencers.  We've made some -- we've had some partnerships with influencers but originally this blew up around Los Angeles because celebrities we saw Gigi Hadid and Ryan Seacrest.  And it's just a long list of celebrities using them and that really led to their -- to their growth, quickly.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And that's because it's a great handle for a selfie?</p><p>BARNETT:  Sorry, I should explain it, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Or was it mainly a fashion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  let me see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNETT:  I haven't yet even explained it, you're right.  It collapses and expands and it allows you to move your hand away from the backside of your phone.  I have one of our wallets underneath it.  It allows you to move your hand away.  Once you do that, you can access your whole screen with your thumb.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.</p><p>BARNETT:  Without having to drop your phone.  You can take selfies, photographs much more easily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be doing that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 31, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 013103cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the busiest day for earnings so far, General Electric out last hour.  The stock keeps rising over the last hour.  It is now up better than nine percent on better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>We have an eye on big tech this morning.  Facebook soaring this morning on a record profit reported last night, stock is up 11-3/4 percent even in the face of the privacy scandal.  The stock to watch after the close, Amazon.  Amazon shares right now up two percent.  The company reports earnings after the close tonight.  Markets this morning are looking at a mixed open for the broader averages.</p><p>Take a look.  Dow Industrials right now down 36 points but the S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ, higher by 35 points right now.  This after a sharp rally yesterday fueled by Federal Reserve.  The Dow Industrials up 435 points at the close yesterday.  1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 41, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up 155 points, up 2-1/4 quarter percent.  And the Federal Reserve officially told us they are on hold in terms of data dependency on interest rate hikes.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this.  The European indices right now are most higher.  FT-100 up 35 points, one-half of one percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris up 3-1/2 points, fractional move.  DAX index in Germany down 38 points, one-third of one percent.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, best performer is Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than one percent.</p><p>Back in U.S.  The arctic blast has turned deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their levels in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's like hard to take a breath and it stick to my lungs a little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The winds, the windchill is probably the worst of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a look at when millions of Americans can expect temperatures to fall.  We will tell you.  Plus this, attacking the wealthy again.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz answers critics about his success.  Then Roger Goodell breaks his silence.  What he said about the infamous no call during the NHC championship game later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.  And former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you very much.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  The kind of interesting we've been talking about for the last year really, Facebook, how much do users care about these privacy issues.  And last summer we got those results looked look like maybe users aren't really digging this but this latest numbers, you got to say, it looks like users care less about the privacy issues than those of us in media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then they have other areas other than the Facebook business to monetize.  Like with WhatsApp, Messenger, which they're not actually getting any advertising from so far.  So one thing not monetize those think there's an expectations from a business perspective that there's going to be even more growth</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Instagram is kind of the great juggernaut that they have -- or that they're growing, incredibly rapidly but I point this out that because Apple banned this basically data gathering app where they were getting young people in teens to give them all data this is Facebook, Apple bans it, well -- from this app store.  You know what's interesting?  That self-regulation.</p><p>Again, it's not going to be the government that comes in, it's going to be all of these tech companies maybe regulating each other and realizing it might be in their best business interests to not just help them grow incredibly strong but also limit their growth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm more worried about Facebook censoring content.  I don't mean the censoring the classic sense of the government but deciding what people get to see, that worries me more than the privacy issue.  When you sign up for Facebook, you know you're giving away privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't realize is that Facebook is picking for you what you get to see and with 60 percent of Americans now getting most of their news from Facebook.  That's really disturbing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what the Congress is looking at and that's why got those guys, Facebook, Google executives to testify.  Last year in Capitol Hill to see if in fact they are censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentioned Instagram, check out our Instagram post today, it is throwback Thursday.  And posted a shot of way back in 1985, you posted a shot of yourself in the 80s.  Where is your picture?  Post your picture from throwback Thursday Instagram.  I'm having the best time on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  If I looked like you did in the 80s, I would be posting throwback photos while -- may even look like you now but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You look gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No, no.  Maria looks like Sophia Loren and I look -- well, not so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of good looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some good looks this morning.  So check out our Instagram pages.  Meanwhile, we've got a big hour coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Sean Duffy is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson is with us.  Along with L.A. Dodger pitcher Ross Stripling joining us this morning.</p><p>And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in as always.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We kick it off right here with this.  General Electric shares are soaring this morning on strong earnings.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Stock is up nine percent, Susan.  Good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Good morning to you, Maria.  And congratulations for mastering Instagram.  We'll talk about Facebook in just a bit.  But yes, G.E. shares are higher rallying in the premarket and this is because they got a revenue beat, it's actually pretty good for G.E. as you know, it's been shrinking.  There's been problems with the company.  But aviation was strong for G.E. in the quarter and that offset the slowdown.</p><p>And so as some problems that we're seeing in the capital business and also their power businesses as well.  G.E. also by the way settling that DOJ subprime settlements of just around $1-1/2 billion.  This goes back to the 2008 financial crisis.  And as you know, they have been spinning off several businesses in 2018 to spring off some cash flow and to try to make some profit.</p><p>Let's talk about Facebook because also rallying in the premarket, Faceboook shares and as you mentioned stories doing very well for them on Instagram and also on Facebook as well.  And they grew, daily active users and all geographic locations and this is after a downturn of course in Europe and also plateau in North America.  So that's important to watch. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Susan.  Thank you so much.  Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade, the President tweeting about it this morning saying this, China's top trade negotiators are in the United States meeting with our representatives.  Meeting are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides.  China does not want to -- an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal, they're correct.</p><p>I will be meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in Oval Office, no final deal will be made until my friend, President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the longstanding and more difficult points.  Very comprehensive transaction.  Writes the President.  He goes on to say, Chinese representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table.</p><p>All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully revolved.  Tariffs on China increased to 25 percent on March 1st.  So, all working hard to complete by that date.  My next guest is the cosponsor of a bill that will give President Trump executive power to raise tariffs and joining me right now is Wisconsin Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member, Sean Duffy.  Congressman, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  It's good to be with you, Maria.  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DOBBS:  So in the President's tweet just now, he said everything is on the table, all of these tough issues, does that mean that he is also talking about espionage, the forced transfer of technology and the I.P. theft?</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.  I think he is talking about all these issues.  When you have a relationship with trading partner like China, you can't do business for very long.  We have a country like China stealing our intellectual property or the force transfer of intellectual property.  So, yes.  No, this is all on the table.  Here's what I think is going on now, Maria.  We understand that China lies and they cheat and they steal, right?</p><p>So we want to get a deal before March 1st so we don't have that increase in tariffs.  But I don't know that all the other tariffs currently imposed are going to come off on March 1st if a deal is struck because even if you get a deal with China, are they going to implement the deal?  And that's going to take time.  So, we got to actually -- we don't have this trust but verify like Reagan said with the Russians.</p><p>We have I think a philosophy of don't trust and verify with the Chinese because we -- they can sign a document with us, an agreement with us but that doesn't mean they're going to implement that document.  So, folks, if a deal comes and tariffs are lifted, I don't think that's a strategy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that because they did that on beef, right?  They said that they would buy certain amount of beef and then they didn't.</p><p>DUFFY:  Right.  Yes.  You're absolutely correct.  And, so, you know, again, I -- we believe in free trade and we think, you know, having a great trading partner like China where we can, you know, lower tariffs and respect each other's intellectual property is a great relationship but when you see the rising threat of China militarily and their -- and their substantial growth, we have to take a second look at, you know, what they're doing and what risk that poses to our to American way one of life.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, what's -- you know, what President Trump has done brilliantly is, you know, because of these tariffs but also, you know, the knowledge of the force transfer of technology, you see the whole global supply chain changing away from China.  And you can't do business for that long when you steal a technology to people who come to your country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  And Americans are getting -- China is not a good home for business.  There's other places that we can go outside of China and it's having a real impact even on American earnings as you reported are American companies missing some of their numbers, Apple, Nvidia because of lack of sales that are happening inside of China because of the slowdown that has been led by Donald Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, it's interesting because we actually had Steve Ballmer on a couple of months ago, former CEO of Microsoft and he said that the theft from China costs Microsoft $10 billion in profits because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system only a fraction, one percent actually pay for it.  So, there's all of this theft going on.</p><p>What are the metrics that you want to use to check to verify that in fact if you do do a deal that they will follow through on it?  And do I hear you saying that there is no way that tariffs are going to be gone?  That you can't lift tariffs at all because you can't trust what they say they're going to follow through on?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  I think metric is time, Maria.  I mean, we have to give this time to see with actual implementation.  And so I don't know if that's a year or two years, I think -- I think you have a longer runway here on the tariff front with China but you might mentioned intellectual property I think the Chinese are suing us at the WTO for $50 billion of tariffs that President Trump put on the Chinese for intellectual property theft.</p><p>And our analysis is that they steel $250 to $600 billion a year of American technology and they're -- they have their goal to sue us over the $50 billion in tariffs.  I mean, this is rich stuff with the Chinese and I just -- I think we have a president -- President Trump who's willing to actually fight this out for the American people and try to win for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about Foxconn, a major reversal.  We talked about you in the electronics' giant first announced their new Wisconsin factory that was supposed to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs.  Now the research centers for scientists and engineers.  Congressman, what about the manufacturing jobs, how disappointed are you by this reversal?</p><p>DUFFY:  So they're still -- they're still committed to the R&amp;D side of it but you're right on the manufacturing side.  They haven't necessarily pulled out but they have signaled that they will on the manufacturing side of Foxconn.  And Maria, first of all, so they invested $100 million in the University of Wisconsin system to train our workers.  That's fantastic.  They bought buildings, they have land to build their facilities.</p><p>But what's happening, Wisconsin, why is this decision made?  Scott Walker lost.  The guy that won, Tony Evers in Wisconsin was bashing this deal from the very beginning.  So now you have an unfriendly government in Wisconsin who doesn't want Foxconn there.  This a massive investment.  And if you're going to make it, you better have a governor who goes, yes, you know, come to my state, bring us the jobs, I'm happy to have you.</p><p>And that's hasn't been Tony Evers.  And so, they've been attacking this deal from the very beginning.  I don't think this will happen if Scott Walker had won in Wisconsin but it is now because, you know, business -- Foxconn is under attack in our state because of our new governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So you -- so you blame the new governor as --</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For this, how many jobs will be cut then?</p><p>DUFFY:  Well, so they haven't walked away.  They had a promise of 13 million jobs to $10-billion investment.  They haven't walked away from that number.  And by the way, the incentives that we gave for Foxconn to come were tied to the investment and the jobs.  And so they just missed a $10-million incentive because they didn't hit the job number.  So, again, this is still up in the air for us but if you're Foxconn, you really have to consider the politics of our state and what's changed in the last, you know, two months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Before you go, what are you dealing with, negative 26 degrees right there in Wisconsin, Congressman?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  So, it's 27 below, windchills hit up to 50 below, just have been -- people don't get this in the south but our cars don't start here.  The post office, it never shuts down, the post office is shut down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Our ski hill is shut down.  My Congressional office yesterday was shut down.  People couldn't get to work.  So, you know, it's crazy cold and by the way, kids, we have eight kids, seven of them are at home, you coop up kids for two days in the house because they can't go outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Crazy fights are going and you can only watch so many movies, Maria, and play some of the games monopoly before your house is ready to explode.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the whole Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades, so they're staying home from school, right?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  You can't send these little kids out waiting, you know, for a bus to go to school.  I mean, listen you people get hurt in this kind of weather.  So it breaks today, this afternoon we start to see a breaks.  We go from minus 27, I think we have a high today of minus four.  That's the heat wave that's coming our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DUFFY:  And if I can make one last point, Maria, I just watch through the 80s and 90s, I have pull up Instagram pictures of your throwback Thursday.  Huge fan when you're on other networks, I'm a huge fan of you here.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- I'm looking forward too.  If Dagen is up, so we're going to check out Dagen from back in the 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  You know, she has some big, you know, 80s hair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the throwback Thursday, yes.  Well, that picture that I posted in the Instagram is from 1985.  Post your picture, Congressman.  Thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  I got some really bad ones too.  I got big old -- yes.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you soon.  Sean Duffy joining us there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Midwest is facing the coldest temperatures in decades.  The extreme freeze is turning deadly.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice?</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  Yes.  Unfortunately, we're going to have one more day of this and then the cold air will start to retreat but you can see the windchill is most dangerous part of this cold air.  Is across the northern plains, the great lakes, now into the northeast where it feels like minus 13 in New York, it feels like zero in D.C. but minus 40 Fargo, minus 41 is what it feels like in Chicago.</p><p>Those incredible pictures coming out of Chicago of the rivers just freezing.  Green Bay, air temperature, minus 23, windchill minus 23, air temperature in Chicago by the way is minus 21 but it is the windchill that's potentially deadly.  That's why people are urged to stay indoors.  If you've got kids, if you got pets and you want to check on the elderly.  Today will be the really cold day and things will start to improve Friday.</p><p>But windchill advisories and warnings in place for millions of people where the windchill is anywhere from minus 25 to minus 60 especially across the northern plains in the upper Midwest.  OK.  So here is our polar vortex that is dipped as far south as the Tennessee River Valley, Ohio.  By Saturday it retreats up into Canada but we're not done yet heading into Monday.  We start to see it move southward again across the plain states across the great lakes.</p><p>So we're not done.  Now, this cold air, the really cold air is probably done for the season but we're still going to see below freezing temperatures as we get into next week.  But I will tell you as we head into the weekend, Maria, look at this, so minus one, today is the daytime high for Minneapolis but will be in the 40s by Sunday.  And then, Monday, things will start to come down again.</p><p>Here is Chicago where we are dealing with minus 40 degree windchills, by Saturday and Sunday even Monday, 53 degrees.  I mean, that is a 60-degree temperature difference from today and Monday.  So something we're going to have to watch.  These are weather extremes.  Certainly, we'll watch it.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Thanks so much.  Janice Dean with the latest there.  Coming up.  We are watching markets this morning on last trading day of the month today.  Busiest day for earnings.  Dow Industrials down 51, S&amp;P and NASDAQ up.  Next up, L.A. Dodgers pitcher turns stock broker, Ross Stripling in the house with his take on market action.</p><p>Then breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the path to the Super Bowl.  What he had to say right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets in focus this morning, futures indicating a mixed opening for the markets this morning on this.  The last trading day of the month.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 60 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher fractionally.  This after the major indices rallied yesterday big time after the Federal Reserve indicated it has done raising interest rates for now, it will be data dependent.</p><p>But the Dow Industrials were as high as 500 points, better than 500.  it ended up 434 on the Dow.  154 points higher on the NASDAQ.  Joining us right now is Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and B. Riley Wealth Management stock broker, Ross Stripling.  Ross, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, STOCK BROKER, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we got to talk sports but we want to first talk money.  Tell us what you think about what you heard from the Fed yesterday and how you're telling clients to allocate capital right now.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, that was definitely optimistic, you know, coming out and saying that, you know, our economy is growing, spending is strong, they're going to be patient moving forward with the -- with the rate hikes, you know, October, November, December were certainly ugly for me as a -- as a growth investor, you know, that got out of hand but, you know, I definitely think we got oversold.</p><p>And, you know, so we're kind of telling investors, you know, it's a good time to be patient and a good time to be, you know, long-term mined I think if you think back to January 2016,you know, it definitely got oversold in that month and then all the market did was rally 10,000 points over the next two years.  So, I think it's a good time to be patient, you're getting a good -- so you can get some good names at low valuations and obviously, get some of that money back lost that we lost late last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can we go to baseball questions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go for it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So -- I apologize, I didn't watch this when it happened but Wikipedia says, your very first major league start, you had no hitter into the 7th inning and you got pulled out.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So this is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  Thanks for bringing that back up.  No, I'm just kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Basically, the highs and lows of baseball in your first professional appearance.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I mean, man, if you just think about what goes into the -- to a debut of Major League Baseball, I mean, I was just so nervous that day and then to finally get up to game time and then to -- like you said, to be able to go over seven innings of no-hit baseball and then -- and then you get pulled.  I mean, it happens so fast, you know, and I certainly thought about it more since then that, you know, things that will never get to know how would have finished but I've always said that I understood the decision to pull me out.</p><p>I was coming off for Tommy John surgery, I've already thrown a hundred pitches, that was the most I've thrown in two years.  So, you know, we'll never know how it would have ended like I said but I've have always been open about understanding that decision and, you know, maybe I'll get another shot and no-hitter someday.</p><p>MINERD:  Hey, Ross, this is Mike Huckabee and one of the things that I'm most intrigue by is your use of data to prepare for ballgames.  It sounded like a real-life version of Moneyball in modern times.  So explain how do you collect the data and how do you go about using that to plan your own pitching strategy because I think that's fascinating.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Sure.  You know, I'll try and give you the shortest version of that question as possible.  And, you know, the Dodgers are probably kind of leading the way in all that, you know, analytics and things like that.  So we have a whole division that kind of gets the data for me and I mean, they can give you as much as you want and I -- at first when I got up I wanted it all, just give me all the data possible and I will just get what I want out of it.</p><p>But now, after three years, you know, you got to cut it down to what you want which is usually, you know, what guys slug in certain counts, what they hit the hardest, what's their biggest swing and missed pitch.  You can even look like what the man on second base, you know, do they get more aggressive.  There's just tons of data out there, so you kind of pick and choose what you want and use it when you're on the mound.</p><p>That way you're not just like boggled down with data while you're on the mound, you know, at the end of the day you just got to trust your ability to get major league hitters out but you want to use to it come up with a plan and each guy is different and you go over with your pitching coach and your catcher and all of that and you have a plan against every batter, one through nine for any situation and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  -- you know, that's kind of thought.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is really smart.  Let me ask you before you go, Ross, Super Bowl 53, three days away, who are you betting on?  Your hometown Rams or the Patriots?</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I got to go hometown Rams.  I think McVay have some up his sleeve that Bellatrix never seen and they made a lot of acquisitions in offseason on that defense, maybe they can get a big stop on Brady.  So I'll take the Rams.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Ross, great to have you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow, we'll bring you live coverage of the January jobs' report starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

Blake Burman is live this morning at the White House with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  Just one meeting among that group, 17 Democrats, Republicans trying to hash out a border security package, and already this morning, we are seeing a pretty big amount of frustration being expressed by President Trump.  Just moments ago, he sent out the following tweet about that group saying the following quote, \"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time.  Democrats, despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not goings to give money to build the desperately needed wall.  I've got you covered, wall is already being built, I don't expect much help.\"</p><p>You'll remember over the last few weeks as well as the President was trying to hash out a deal or at least Democrats and Republicans were, about securing wall funding that the President said, Well maybe we can call this steel slats or a physical barrier.  Doesn't need necessarily need to be called a wall.  He's backing off that today as well because he tweeted this this morning, \"Let's just call them wolves from now on, and stop political games, a wall is wall, give you a pretty good idea of where his mindset is after just one meeting from this group up on Capitol Hill.  Meantime, the Pentagon says that several thousand more troops are going to be heading to the Southern Border.  The Undersecretary for policy testifying up on Capitol Hill earlier this week that several caravans are headed north.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN C. ROOD, UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY:  Current information shows a caravan of over 12,000 people.  There's three that we are tracking, the Department of Homeland Security's tracking en route, and one of which is over 12,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Didn't get an exact number from the Pentagon, Maria.  Currently, there are 2,500 give or take active duty service members down at the Southern border.  That is down from a high of nearly 6,000, but the pentagon says several thousand more are headed that way.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the White House this morning.  Let's bring in Former New Mexico Governor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations, and Former Presidential Candidate, Bill Richardson.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much for joining us this day, this mooring.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean this whole idea of -- that they can't get together, on an agreement for the wall or for any kind of barrier, what do you think this means?  I mean is this going to be the next two years where the Congressional Democrats are constantly resisting everything the President wants?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, the first thing you need to do is the President needs to get off this idea that unless he gets his way, there's going to be a government shutdown.  That was very damaging to the country.  And I think to the President, too.  This is early.  Look, the early talks, did not go well yesterday.  But we got until February 15th.  You don't negotiate until the very end to get the best deal for both of you.  But, look, if there are more caravans, we're sending more troops.  I was a border governor, like Mike Huckabee, governors, we got to deal with these things directly.</p><p>What we need is more border detection equipment at the border crossings, Coast Guard needs to have more facilities.  You don't need a wall.  You go under a wall, over a wall, you have tunnels like El Chapo.  That's not going to solve the problem.  Let's have significant border security and agree on increase border patrol agents' budget --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, I want to -- I want to bring in Governor Huckabee in a moment, but you said we don't need a wall.  Are -- isn't it true though that in some border security agree on we need a wall.  For example, there is a wall in Nancy Pelosi state right now, which separates Tijuana and San Diego.  We're at the very dense area.  You've got three million people on one side of the Tijuana wall, and other three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear down that wall, isn't it -- doesn't it -- I mean do you think those people would just assimilate into the United States?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look, I'm not advocating tearing down what is existing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but you said we don't need a wall.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I'm saying that for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That wall worked.  Would you say that that will work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No.  Well, that deal does not -- or no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why not tear it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, it's -- no, it's not working.  It's not working.  It's that they have good border patrol agents, detection equipment, they know what they're doing ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would be OK tearing it down then?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- they have (INAUDIBLE) the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then you would be OK tearing it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Makes no difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think that the three million people on the Tijuana side would assimilate into the three million people in the San Diego (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, I don't.  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Without that wall?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't.  You're using scare tactics.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not scare -- I'm just saying the facts, sir.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Border enforcement -- no, no, no, you're not.  Those are not facts.  Border immigration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- illegal immigration has gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's gone down.  It's gone down.  Totally all across the border.  It's gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All I'm asking you is does that wall work to separate Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't think it makes much of a difference, but I'm saying leave it where it is.  But give them more resource, more border patrol agents detection equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think the President's just saying that as well.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Go in depth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, jump in here because I think that the President does want a wall in certain areas but in other areas said, you said that agrees with the Democrats in terms of technology and drones.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ambassador, you're one of my favorite democrats.  You know I love you, but I remember when Duncan Hunter was the one who put the appropriation in for that wall in San Diego, 95 percent of the drug trafficking stopped.  I'm looking at Israel.  They put up a wall, a security fence.  They were condemned for it, but they went from a thousand suicide bombers.  I agree that walls don't need to go for the entire border because there are certain y natural barriers, some electronics, but I just can't believe that people say that walls in certain places, whether it's a fence, whether it's a steel slat, just would not have an effect, and if that's true then we should tear down the 600 miles that we already have, and I don't know of anybody who realistically thinks that makes good sense.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, Mike, first of all, the tactics that are being used to get that wall, which I think is very dubious to build because I don't think it'll work and it's too expensive is that if the President doesn't get his way, he's going to shut down the government, and he's going to do harm to 800,000 Federal workers, businesses, and then this wall, Mike, I mean it's going to take landowners out of there, it's going to take ranchers, indigenous people, wildlife.  You're right, and most of the border, you can't build the wall because of the hills, because of the terrain, so --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Bill he has been very flexible in saying that it's a combination of all of those things, it's not just a wall.  But you say he's not been willing to give.  I've not seen Nancy Pelosi give one inch, not one inch, and he's offering DACA, he's offering all sorts of concessions, he's making compromise, but where -- tell  me exactly where Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer is offering any kind of concession or compromise.  I can't find it.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, they are offering significant funding increases in Border Enforcement and Detection Equipment, that will work, that will work, Mike.  And then the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's not just to answer President Trump.  That's because --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- says, \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down -- I'm going to shut down the government.  That is unprecedented, that is damaging the country.  Are we going to allow any President, they don't get their way, that the answer's got to be I'm going to down the go of year?  Mike you're a good politician.  You're my favorite Republican Politician.  This border shutdown was not good for the President for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, actually I think that the --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The country blinds him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when you look at the polls, the President really didn't get impacted very much.  Nancy Pelosi's approvals actually went down.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, I don't know what poll you're reading, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- and the President is tweeting -- wait.  Governor, the President just tweeting this morning --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't know what poll you're reading.  It was significant damage to the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning.  Let me tell you what he says.  He says, \"Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime.  Your reaction.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Oh, I mean this -- you know, he's into his campaign mode.  This is like when he says to his intelligence people that we spend over $20 billion in intelligence, CIA, NSA, Department of Defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that -- is that tweet incorrect?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- all of North Korea, they're my -- they're my buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that -- is that tweet inaccurate?  Wait, is that tweet inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally inaccurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate?  What's inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The whole thing.  The whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, late term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's like the President's saying to his intelligence fee --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- higher taxes?  Which one?  Later term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Open borders?  Wait, which one?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know, this is -- this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate, governor?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  This is ridiculous.  No.  Open borders?  That's ridiculous.  All of that is ridiculous.  There should be serious negotiations right now.  And it's not happening.  And the President's not helping with these tweets.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know the thing is?  I mean I know that a lot of your colleagues say that they're for border security, but they didn't vote for Kate's law, they didn't vote to end Sanctuary Cities, they didn't vote for a border wall, so how can you say you're for border security when you actually haven't done so in terms of your voting record?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look at what the Democrats are proposing for this showdown, one, more border patrol agents, two, more Coast Guard assistance, three, more drones, four, all kinds of new technologies that will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they voted for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  A border wall is not going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they vote --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did Nancy Pelosi vote for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That -- perhaps that wall she voted for on her border.  All I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is that not immoral?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- let's make this work.  Let's make this work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  But not threaten border shutdowns, not end the government working, that's what the President is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  All right.  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook reporting a record profit.  The stock is soaring this morning.  Joining me now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, good morning, Maria.  You know, I wasn't looking at that profit report for the profit number or profit margin, I was looking at it to see how many active monthly users they've got.  When I saw that number come over, 2.7 billion, I figured that Facebook was out of the woods.  Think of all the scandal, all the bad publicity, all the privacy questions that have been leveled against Facebook in the last, what, year or six months?  It--- it's not touched their business.  I thought that the scandal may have reduced the number of monthly users, active users on the -- on the base, but it didn't.  They've actually increased.  And that's why I think Facebook is up so much this morning, 11 percent gain for a stock like that is absolutely enormous.  My bottom line is this, all the scandal did not touch its financial business.  The heart of its business was not touched by all the political goings-on around it.  Facebook, 167.  Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible.  You're right, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It really is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis.

I grew up literally in public housing in the projects.  And I have succeeded in America I always thought that was something to be celebrated, that my success should not be something that is punitive.  My success is living proof of the promise of the country.  I can't find the answers why people are all of a sudden chastising me for being successful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Many Democrats are caffeinated against him, criticizing Schultz over his potential presidential run saying he will only help to reelect President Trump.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Listen, I'm looking at this.  We are celebrating throwback Thursday this morning.  We're showing you our best looks from the 80s, that's next stay, with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is throwback Thursdays here on the MORNINGS WITH MARIA set.  Here's me from circa 19857.  I was working in a photo lab, printing pictures.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I told you, Sophia Loren.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Care-free days.  I don't even know that I was thinking about what stock to buy.  I don't even know that I was thinking about me being a journalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at this complexion.  This is even before -- well, it's before the internet really, but the no photo filters, you're glowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see yours, Dagen McDowell.  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I told you I'm really ugly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do they have it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, Governor Huckabee with his daughter.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, there I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's Dagen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I jumped in a swimming pool fully clothed right after that was taken.  And I am not making that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is about 1980 --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  88.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  88.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the summer after my freshman year in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Huckabee with your daughter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.  Aww.  That is too cute.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's about 1984.  She was about two years old at that time.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So great.  That's beautiful shot.  And lastly, the photo James Freeman gave us.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so this is me.  You asked for a throwback --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- Thursday photo of James Freeman.  Apparently, this is the Reverend James Freeman.  Apparently, he was an outstanding preacher.  Governor, you might want to grade his performance, I don't know, but very influential in Boston.  My kids ran across this a few weeks ago while sightseeing, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You couldn't find any shots of yourself as a baby.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I -- well, I did -- if you give me more time, I'll try and find it.  But I told you, I never went with the mullet.  My great regret, so I don't know if we're going to have really fun 80s photos, but I'll do my best.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  Deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday, we'll do another throwback Thursday, how's that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You got to let me know in advance and so we I can dig some photos out of my -- well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So we have a week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- drawer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we didn't even talk about this.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke publicly for the first time about that blatant non-call in the NFC Championship game.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God, you're lucky the game has been great in the last year, Goodell, because you're terrible and people hate you.  No more than --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, people hate him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us how you really feel.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  What do you really think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, let's call some folks down in New Orleans and ask them how they feel.  Anyway.  No, they do, people don't -- excuse me, they don't like him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.

And good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday, it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Busy morning on earnings this morning.  We will hear from UPS, General Electric, both ahead of the open this morning.  Big technology still in focus, Facebook reporting last night after the close, big quarter for Facebook, Amazon will be the one to watch today after the close tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the arctic blast turns deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their lowest levels in decades.  We will take you to the Minneapolis region this morning, where the negative 24 degrees is having a real impact.  The push to tax the wealthy, J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly saying that the richest Americans can afford to pay higher taxes, but there's a catch.  Then, Roger Goodell breaking his silence, what he said about the infamous no-call during the NFC championship game coming up later this hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets this morning.  Let's check Futures showing a mixed opening this morning after a huge day yesterday.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 15 points at the open.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ up fractionally right now after a solid day of trading that all stock surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell signaled that the Central Bank may pause interest rate hikes for now.  The Fed on pause.</p><p>Technology giant, Facebook, meanwhile also reporting fourth-quarter earnings.  Look at that market yesterday, up 434 points at the close, it was a big day.  And that, by the way, was off of the highs of the day after the Fed meeting.  Facebook earnings beat expectations posting a record profit for what has been a difficult year for the social media company.  Take a look at Facebook shares this morning, up 11-1/3 percent right now, 167 and change.  Earnings season rolling on today with Amazon reporting after the bell tonight.  Take a look at all the names that we're expecting today in what is really the busiest week -- one of the busiest weeks for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Here now, the founder of Disruptive Technology Research Lou Basenese.  Lou, it's good to see you.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on Facebook, your reaction to the quarter last night.</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, I am just shocked and disappointed in this rally.  I mean, I think this is really putting forward that investors and management favor profit growth over ethics.  I mean, look, this week, we had -- I think one of the -- just biggest disappointments in privacy protection with the Facebook research app.  I mean, just total disregard for Apple's wishes, total disregard for teenage users' privacy, and yet, investors are cheering profit growth.  So, look, I can't argue with the fundamental numbers.  I mean, the stock is reasonably valued, you've seen growth come back in the U.S. as the key market, and advertisers just don't have any other outlet, any other alternative to reach 2 billion potential viewers.  So, it's one of those things, it's a toxic investment, to me.  So, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you wouldn't touch it?</p><p>BASENESE:  I wouldn't touch it.  Look, I think there's a lot of risk embedded there.  What's the next privacy scandal that's going to come to light?  Facebook, over the years, has really made more excuses than changes to what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's talk about the Fed -- the Fed essentially on hold yesterday saying it's on hold, indicating that more dovish stance when it comes to interest rate hikes.  What was your reaction to what the Fed said in particular also saying that the balance sheet unwind is also a way that they could pull back and perhaps stop the 50 billion sales a month.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, I don't think I can remember in my lifetime just a more dramatic turn of sentiment at the Fed.  I mean, in October, they were saying that we're a long way from neutral and now, yesterday's statement said that we're within range.  I mean, they went from playing hardball with the President to playing patty cake, and you know, investors love that.  So, you know, more easy monetary policy coming.  I think they gave themselves some flexibility on unwinding the balance sheet.  Not that they didn't say that they were going to be data dependent before, but now they just made that much more of a point to communicate to the markets that there's not going to be a fast and hard unwind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we were sort of expecting this in the last couple of months, that's for sure.  But would this be a signal for you to put new money to work in stocks?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think absolutely.  Look, the Fed has been supportive of stock prices.  I mean, there's a lot of people that would argue this bull market would not be around without the Fed.  So, with the Fed being very accommodative, I think it's time to come back into the market, we're going to see that.  You've seen a dramatic reversal even in the more speculative areas of the market.  And I think I pointed out before in another appearance that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tremendous bounce off the lows, up almost 20 percent, and about to breakthrough to the 200-day moving average.  So, yes, it's risk on again.  At least to the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Two more things on stocks, we've got earnings, obviously, the middle in -- we're in the middle of a very busy period.  DowDupont just reported they beat on earnings per share at $0.88 a share but they missed on revenue at 20.1 billion versus an estimate of 20.9 billion, how would you characterize the earnings season so far, and what does that telling you about the backdrop?</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, it's a mixed bag.  We haven't really seen a huge beat rate on the earnings on the bottomline.  I think the top like is being less impressive.  So, on DuPont's report, it's epitomizing it, right?  We're seeing some earnings growth but the demand on the top line is not there.  So, look, I think we're in more of a stock picker's market.  It points more towards active management and really trying to find those companies that are overcoming the China hangover that are finding strength despite some pockets of weakness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a focus is economic data for you?  We've got the January job's report out Friday morning, tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting 165,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9 percent.  We had the ADP numbers earlier this week, they were strong.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes.  No, they're very strong.  Look, I'm a tech guy first, but I'd love to see tailwinds and the job's market supporting that.  I think many people thought we might have a slowdown just because of the government shutdown, and just that extreme volatility in December that might have put some businesses a little uneasy about hiring.  But the ADP Report like you mentioned this week, pointing to just continued strength, so another positive for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you're thinking we're going to get a pretty good year, 2019.</p><p>BASENESE:  As of now -- look, a lot can change, I mean, look what happened in December.  So, I don't want to go on the record and say it's a -- it's a foregone conclusion 2019 is going to be great, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you've got put money to work either way, so what do you do?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think -- I put money to work.  Look, I like the semiconductor industry particularly companies like NXP, really undervalued at about 11 times earnings.  And the chipmakers are going to make this world go, from here into the future.  About a trillion semiconductors shipped last year.  They go into every big growth trend that you can think of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess.  I mean, even more so with 5G on the way.  Lou, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lou Basanese joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow morning.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January job's report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We've got our \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" special where we identify where the jobs are right now.  Meanwhile, Amazon earnings after the bell, the company poking fun in its own Alexa devices for going haywire in this year's Super Bowl ad.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Your take on that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I love Super Bowl ads, and Amazon is advertising during the big game for the fourth straight year, two spots including part of this one, we're going to show you a 90-second spot with some popular names.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But trust me, there are a lot of fails.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Alexa, play my podcast.</p><p>ALEXA:  When you heard that, did that surprise (INAUDIBLE) that seems exciting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need an Alexa dog collar.  Four dogs.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering dog food, ordering dog food.</p><p>HARRISON FORD, ACTOR:  You can bark all you want, I'm not paying for any more dog food.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering gravy.  Ordering sausages.</p><p>FORD:  Hey, you better cancel that order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa hot tub sucked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa, play music.  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, that's just a little bit of a snippet of that ad, Maria.  Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker among the well-known celebrities in that ad.  Just that 90-second spot will set Amazon back more than $15 million, $5 million per 30-second spot for Super Bowl ads.  This is a little ironic because Amazon has really ramped up spending on national television advertising, you know, a real innovator in terms of online advertising, streaming video, but Amazon spends every year now on national T.V. advertising, $680 million a year, that's about doubled from 2015.  It spends more than Toyota and even McDonalds every year on T.V. ads.  Why the Super Bowl?  Do we even need to tell you, more than 100 million people are going to watch this, and it has a very diverse viewing base, about 47 percent of the viewers last year ladies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we watch for the commercials or do we watch for the game?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The game.  The game always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both, I'm both.  That commercial really resonated though with the dog ordering everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who doesn't love Harrison Ford.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you.  We will keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deadly polar vortex sweeping through the Midwest.  Lauren Simonetti with the details on that.  Lauren, it is cold there.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is cold.  And speaking of Amazon, they're not delivering in some Midwest cities because it is so cold, but at least -- this is deadly, at least nine people have died in causes related to the historic -- this historic arctic blast when 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.  Windchill temperatures falling to minus 50 degrees in Chicago.  And near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.</p><p>According to FlightAware, since yesterday, there have been more than 21,000 flight delays and more than 6,000 cancellations.  Seven people stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were around minus four degrees with windchill of minus 30.  Coastguard officials say the seven people were near Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, but couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>Some General Motors plants in Michigan halting production due to the extremely cold weather and also a shortage of natural gas following a fire at a compressor station.  A dozen plants affected and all the utility there.  Also, asking customers to please reduce their use of natural gas, but there is such demand at this time of year.  Let's take a look at shares of G.M. down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And then, there's this, firefighters battling a massive blaze at an historic factory in New Jersey below freezing temperatures.  The Marcal Paper plant burning overnight, the bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out, as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries fortunately reported here.  It is unclear how this fire started.  The paper factory is 86 years old.  It survived several fires in the past.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, even in the face of that cold weather, fire burning wildly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren, thanks.  Coming up, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon now saying he has no problem with the wealthiest Americans paying even more taxes.  There is a catch, though, we're going to bring you what he said.  Then, breaking his silence, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no-call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.  But the Saints player and a coach weigh in on Goodell and the controversy.  All ahead right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining us, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Member, Sean Duffy, is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N. and former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson, is with us.  FanDuel CEO Matthew King join us ahead of the Super Bowl.  And PopSockets Founder, CEO David Barnett joining us as well.  The Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and stockbroker Ross Stripling is with us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>We kick it off here with this, paying your fair share, the push from the far left getting reaction from corporate America now.  J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, reportedly saying that he is willing to pay higher taxes that the wealthiest Americans can afford to pay more.  He also said that those dollars, though, need to be spent wisely by the government.  Here's what he told me earlier this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on what we're hearing now from, for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  She says she think that the top-end of earners should pay as high as 70, 80 percent tax rates?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  Yes.  Look, I -- you know, I always separate the corporate side, the business side, which I think we need it to be competitive with the individual side.  And so, you know, people have all different theories, but individual side would maximize returns and stuff like that.  So, I'm not -- I don't get involved in that debate because I'll leave that to politicians.  That is actually less important for economic growth than the business side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The top 10 percent already pay 80 percent of all the tax.</p><p>DIMON:  They do.  But in America, you have to look at tax (INAUDIBLE) I mean, a lot of payroll tax are aggressive, sales tax are aggressive, real estate tax are aggressive.  So, you look at the big picture, anyone would say, we should relook at this and make it better and more efficient and fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, is here along with former Arkansas Governor, Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee, great to see you, guys.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Wonderful to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  Your reaction to Jamie Dimon.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He can pay all the taxes he wants.  There's not a thing in the federal code that prohibits him from writing a check to the federal government.  If he's feeling guilty that he's not paying enough, do it.  When I was governor, I did a fund called the \"tax me more fund\" because a bunch of legislators kept saying we need to raise taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So I had envelopes printed and everywhere I went to make a speech, I pass them out, and said, you don't think you're paying enough, send it in, as much as you want until you feel better.  In two years, we raised $1168, a thousand, which was given by one Democrat legislator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is good.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because nobody wants to pay more taxes.  They say they do but they don't.  That's just a lie.  And so, this nonsense that I'd like to pay more taxes, do it, go ahead, be the first, write the check then prove it to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's -- there's just such a range of the ultra-rich, somebody like Jamie Dimon with $1 billion, somebody like a Warren Buffett with, what, $45 billion to other rich people as well with, what, $250,000 or $1 million, right?  So, the range is so huge.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, he's close to -- at his age, he's close to retirement so he doesn't really need to worry about income taxes that much.  Ask him about the Elizabeth Warren wealth tax, where she's going to come and confiscate his money.  How does he feel about that?  Because by the way, if he's talking about income taxes, half of this country doesn't pay any income taxes, and any net income taxes.  So, our Defense Department isn't funded by half this country.  Education at the federal level not funded by half this country.  Somebody has got to pay.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Top one percent as you alluded to in the interview, currently paying more than the bottom 90 percent combined in terms of federal income taxes.  But this is really about how you distribute wealth.  Let's think about growth, let's think about how to get everyone making more instead of how to take it from some people, but I think he does raise a good question, which is -- isn't really better for our society if we take more from Jamie Dimon and give it to the government, and the question of who's going to invest it better, random government agency or Jamie Dimon, who probably perhaps puts it in to public companies, maybe he invests in financial technology start-ups.  I think the track record would say Jamie Dimon is probably going to invest that money better than a Washington bureaucracy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You got to be kidding, James, you mean to tell me --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Controversial statement, I know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- that you think Washington would squander money after we send it to them?  Well, I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  Such --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, and I think the shutdown --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- stewards of our tax money.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the shutdown really raises questions about whether the federal bureaucracy is currently overstaffed as we -- as we think about spending.  It took a long time for most people to notice an impact and it was basically when the essential workers started furloughing themselves at TSA gates.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the air traffic controllers, really, that caused the problems over the -- over the weekend.  I just want to point that out.  But again, it's appalling to make people work and not pay them, I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's get to now the 2020 line-up because Howard Schultz and other wealthy business guys, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Fox News yesterday, telling Dana Perino that President Trump should not be taking credit for the strength of the economy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the reduction in the corporate tax rate of 21 percent was wrong and irrational.  He missed a massive opportunity for comprehensive tax reform.  But if you look at the facts, the facts are 40 percent of the American people do not have $400 in the bank.  5 million young people in America, mostly Black and Latino are not in school and not in work.  One out of six Americans are food insecure.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Yes.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  So, no, I don't give him, the President credit for any of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHULTZ:  And I do not give him credit for saying for two years that the stock market is proxy for the economy.  He is going to fall on his sword for that because that economy is not going to last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, your reaction.  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know how you argue that the higher growth in the Trump presidency during the Trump era is unrelated to his policies of cutting taxes and regulation.  I understand Mr. Schultz is a Democrat now thinking of running as Independent.  He's sort of charting a middle course, he's saying Trump doesn't get credit for the company, while also saying Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax is a bad idea.  But I think on this count he's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, it's crazy to actually look at what has happened in 2018 with the growth numbers and not tie it to not just the tax cuts but also the deregulation, the policies of the Trump administration did move the needle on growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can take the other side of that.  I think it's pretty clear that what the Federal Reserve has been doing is really what has propped up the stock market in a major way, and you saw the rally yesterday now that interest rates are on hold.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the last couple of months.  But I'm talking about 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we are in a position where we're not going to keep growing at three percent right now for myriad reasons, whether it's the global economic slowdown, or problems here at home.  But according to the Wall Street Journal survey of economists conducted this week, we're now below two percent growth in the first quarter and at 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter.  So, right now, we don't look like we can sustain that three percent growth number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's a guess.  That's an estimate, we should point out.  We'll get the hard data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I don't think there is a reason we can't continue to grow at three percent.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but the big mistake Schultz made was that he dried to say I won't go after the Republican voters.  And then he insulted Republicans by saying that tax cuts and deregulation really don't matter.  Ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We got to talk about the Federal Reserve coming up and what did the Fed say yesterday.  Then, justice for Senator Rand Paul, he's awarded damages after being attacked by his neighbor in 2017.  We will tell you how much money is coming to him.  Then, sky high entertainment, we'll tell you how competition is heating up between airlines over who's keeping their passengers entertained better.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Lexington Herald-Leader calling out the Kentucky Governor for saying, \"America is weak for closing schools during the polar vortex.\"  Governor Matt Bevin also said, \"We're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in a fetal position somewhere in a warm place.\"  He did add that he was being a little facetious.  The Star Tribune in Minnesota writing this morning about how veterans are suing saying 3M combat earplugs caused hearing injuries.  At least 11 lawsuits by that have filed -- have been filed this month against the company, accusing of knowingly selling defective earplugs for use in combat.  This is after 3M had already paid $9.1 million to settle government allegations.</p><p>The L.A. Times taking a look at the in-flight entertainment arms race in a tight competition for flyers, airlines stepping up their free offerings.  The article details how airlines are trying to one-up each other from United's free T.V. on some of its planes through American Airlines free T.V. and Apple music.  I haven't seen any of this, what about you, James?  Dagen?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, at what point in the -- at what temperature should kids not have to walk to school?  I don't know.  I'm not sure the governor -- you don't -- you don't necessarily need to swing at every pitch.  I think Mr. Huckabee could tell us about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I've swung at a few I wished I hadn't, absolutely.  Matt Bevin is a great governor.  I'm going to be with him Saturday night in Elizabethtown, in fact, so I'll pass along your sentiments.  But I think it's one of those things that he said in not so much specifically about the vortex, just that as a whole, we are as a country, raising softer kids, and I think that's probably an assessment.  In the context of how cold it was yesterday, maybe the timing, you know, is not perfect, but I think I understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, right, left, or middle of the road, as a nation, we've lost the ability to shut up and say nothing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're like virtue signaling about everything and looking for validation based on a retweet, whether it's by the President himself or Alyssa Milano.  That's how we get out -- that's how we derive our self-worth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We have 250 channels on television plus satellite and internet, 168 hours a week and something has got to fill up that space.  So, that's where we are as a culture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And gone is the lowly book.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe the kids should go out in that weather but get medals for it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  For participating in --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pat on the back for that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the Russia probe, President Trump is reportedly leaving the Mueller report decision in the hands of the Department of Justice.  We'll tell you about what went down yesterday.  And then a big day for earnings, G.E. set to hit the tape in just a few minutes.  We will have the numbers for you, and take a look at how it's impacting markets.  The stock is up two percent ahead of the report.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>General Electric just coming out, and the earnings are below expectations.  The stock right now is higher in the premarket.  Company's reporting $0.17 cents a share, versus an estimate of $0.22 cents a share, as you can see.  Stock at $9.21 a share, we'll keep watching this as we dig through these numbers.</p><p>More big names reporting today, UPS, ConocoPhillips, MasterCard, out later this morning, we'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Revenue on G.E. is better-than-expected at $33.28 billion versus an estimate of $32.6 billion.</p><p>So, maybe that's what's really moving the stock this morning, revenue, better-than-expected on General Electric.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning, take a look at markets, we are expecting a flat opening right now, after a monster rally yesterday, Dow Industrials unchanged, S&amp;P 500 up 3 points, and the NASDAQ up 28.  The major indices tacked on big gains yesterday after the fed said that it was on hold, in terms of raising interest rates for the foreseeable Future.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 435 points at the close, one and three quarters of a percent, and that was off of the highs of the day.  The S&amp;P 500 finished up 41, that was 1-1/2 percent higher, the NASDAQ was up 154 points, the Fed signaling that maybe, maybe, two rate hikes come this year, but it was all dependent on the data.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices look like this, as you see, higher across the board, FT 100 up 43 points, two-thirds of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index up nine points, fractional move, in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, mostly higher, as you see there, best performer, Hong Kong and Japan, up better than one percent a piece.</p><p>Back in the U.S., Arctic conditions have left at least nine people dead, nearly 15,000 flights have been cancelled or delayed due to the weather, and the polar vortex bringing a phenomenon to the skies.  We've got the details, coming up.</p><p>Then, justice for Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator has been awarded damages after he was attacked by his neighbor, we'll tell you how much.</p><p>Plus, breaking his silence, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Whenever officiating is part of any kind of discussion, post gate, is never a good outcome for us.  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.</p><p>We are getting a first look at General Electric earnings this morning, it is a mixed report, $0.17 cents a share is weaker than the estimated $0.22 cents a share, but the revenue is much higher than estimated, $33.28 billion on revenue for the fourth quarter, on General Electric.</p><p>Joining us right now is Pacer ETFs Distributors President, Sean O'Hara, and it is good to see you, Sean.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETF'S DISTRIBUTORS:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll go in to some of the flows and what you're seeing in terms of ETFs, how would you characterize the earning season, give us your take on the backdrop, so far?</p><p>O'HARA:  I think the backdrop is sort of like what we talked about last time I was here, which is you're starting to see a little bit of a slowing in terms of the earnings.  So, we got a little bit spoiled, perhaps, in 2018, we're such, you know, meteoric, if you will, earnings growth, 20, 25, 26, 28 percent.</p><p>And now, we're getting into a phase in the market where, you know -- it's just not sustainable to continue to do that.  So, I think we're adjusting to what's going on with regard to earnings more than anything.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, maybe if expectations have been set too low, we've been, sort of, discussing whether the U.S. can hit three percent growth again, this year, I mean, what does it -- what does it mean if we are growing at three percent?  Are these -- are these stocks cheap at this point?</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't know that stocks are necessarily cheap.  If we get to 3 or 3-1/2 or 4 percent, then I think they're cheap.  And I think that's the big wild card.  Are we going to get that kind of economic growth, particularly since we don't really know yet what the effect on the economy is going to be to shut down?</p><p>I mean, this was not a normal shutdown.  This was not like three or four days until they argue, and then somebody gave in, this was over a month.  And so, there's going to be some effect.  I just don't think we know exactly what it is yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of the Federal Reserve, yesterday, on hold at this point, even talking, as we expected, Dagen, about the balance sheet, possibly pulling back on the -- on the unwind as well.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes, I mean, there was -- there's generally been three, like, headwinds, if you will, for the market, one was what's the fed going to do, one was trade in China, and then the third is the slowing earnings thing that we talked about.</p><p>What I saw yesterday and what I think I heard yesterday, everybody sort of hears their own interpretation of what's going on.  But what I heard is, is that the Fed is going to be more accommodative than they have been, as far as their posture is going forward.</p><p>I don't know if that's reaction to the stock market, I don't know if that's a reaction to something they see with regard to earnings or the economy.  But I think one of those headwinds was essentially removed yesterday from what people's expectations are, going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will raise this issue.  Clearly, investors love what they heard from the Federal Reserve.  But it was a complete about-face from what they've said six weeks ago.  And at some point, do investors start wringing their hands about the economy, about economic growth around the globe, and even here at home.</p><p>We've seen weak growth in France and Germany, that's the story in the Wall Street Journal today.  Will you have a different reaction in the days ahead, when people really digest whoa, what is Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve see, in the months, in the year to come, in the U.S. economy?</p><p>O'HARA:  I mean, of the three things we've talked about, the Fed, trade in China and earnings, clearly to me, the earnings piece of it is the most important part.  That's what drives stock prices from a fundamental perspective is what are they making in terms of earnings, from free cash flow.</p><p>So, I think that's the big one, but I think if you're a little bit of a skeptic and you wanted -- you want to be a little bit more intellectually curious, if you will, I think what you would do is you would do what you're doing, Dagen, and say I wonder what they know that they're not telling us yet, because they really have made a pretty remarkable change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I would say in the last couple of weeks, I think it became clear that we were seeing real issues in Europe and China -- I mean, you know, whether it'd be France, the budget issues in Italy, Brexit and the uncertainty in the U.K.</p><p>So, we knew, going into the Fed meeting that Europe was slowing and China growth has slowed.  And in fact, I think it was becoming more and more well-known that the Federal Reserve had pivoted.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, you said you were stunned in the commercial break.  I wasn't stunned by yesterday's -- I mean, I wasn't stunned, at all, actually.  I was expecting the Federal Reserve to tell us they were on hold.</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't think they said they were -- what I said I was stunned by was, how aggressive I feel like Powell was, in his position, saying that we will use anything we have, including the balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>O'HARA:  That was the new one.  It's always been about ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what Dagen --</p><p>O'HARA:  -- the balance sheet came in to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What Dagen is saying is, the backdrop, what the Fed is recognizing, is what we -- what we are starting to understand better.  And that is we're talking about a slowdown.  We're looking at a slowdown and that is -- we don't live in a vacuum.  Of course, the U.S. is going to be impacted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why you weren't surprised, because of your interview with Ray Dalio and your ongoing interviews with Ray Dalio and what he said.  What did he say last week?  That the Federal Reserve is not going to raise this year and could cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- or do something with balance sheet to be more accommodated.  That's what they said.  But I don't think that the rest of the market has quite digested that.  They need to go back and watch your Ray Dalio interview.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and all interviews in Davos last week.  It was pretty much unanimous that we're facing a U.S. slowdown.  What wasn't unanimous was how steep it might be.  Look, G.E. and debt, the company's debt is now over $100 billion.  The Journal is reporting if G.E. were to sell its jet leasing business, it could eliminate up to $40 billion in corporate debt.</p><p>G.E. capital owns and leases thousands of planes and helicopters to carriers around the world.  The stock is up two and a quarter percent, I don't know.  The earnings, amiss, but I guess people like the fact that the revenue is better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and this is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And low expectations for this company --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That too.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- and stocks, generally.  By the way, I'm not sure the Fed has changed all that much.  What we are seeing is this is the Jay Powell strategy of we're not going to let locked into a long-term plan, we're going to watch the data, as you said, the market signals lately, have been bad, inflation lately, signals that it's mild.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But at the end of the fourth quarter, they were on auto pilot.  They were like, $50 billion a month, three rate hikes, right?  So that is where the pivot is that I'm referring to.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  But I don't think it means we're not getting rate hikes this year.  If the economy grows faster than the consensus, and I happen to think it probably will, then you could see some rate hikes.  But they're saying we're watching the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They might not hike at all, like Ray Dalio said, they might end up cutting, because from the last hike to the first cut, it's as usually a six-month period, granted they need to slow down the balance sheet reduction before they do that.</p><p>One thing I want to note, to connect the G.E., the level of debt there, and what the Federal Reserve did, that's why the market was freaking out when the Fed was continuing to move a quarter point every three months, or every -- because of the level of indebtedness of corporations, the level of indebtedness of the United States and individuals in this country.</p><p>We are a nation that can't handle even three percent short-term rates and that should be frightening to people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you've said that a lot, actually, Sean O'Hara, great to see you.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining.  We didn't even mentioned your INDS, which Kevin Kelly wanted us to, up 14 percent year to date, using money flows into some cooler ETFs.</p><p>O'HARA:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Sean.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Turning to the Mueller report this morning, President Trump says he will leave the decision up to the Department of Justice, according to the Daily Caller exclusive.  Joining us now is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Chris, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  You have an exclusive interview with President Trump, tell us what you learned.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER:  We learned that he's going to keep his hands off of the Department of Justice, for the Mueller report and how to handle that.  He's going to leave the ball in that court.  We learned that he's very concerned about some bigotry in the Democratic Party.</p><p>We talked to him about the new fight yesterday with Governor Northam about abortion.  These are -- and we also learned something very interested to think it's been a little bit under pledge so far, that he's going to put an end to any potential deal that's been reported out on the ninth circuit, on allowing Democratic judges to be re-nominated on the ninth circuit.</p><p>He said he's going to put an end to that deal and try to stack the ninth circuit with judges who are more in line with President Trump's view of how they should be.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think that's an important point you just made, Christopher, because of all the things that the President is doing that even his critics have to appreciate, I'm talking about his Republican critics, is that he is reshaping the judiciary to a constructionist point of view, and if he were to reneged on that, I think it would be disastrous for him and frankly, disastrous for the entire country.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think anyone on the right will certainly agree with that.  He had -- that's one of the major accomplishments he's made, and there's still a lot more that they can do.  There are currently more vacancies in the court than they were when he took office.</p><p>There's a lot more that Mitch McConnell can be doing to pushing this and moving it faster.  But one thing that -- one thing that is certain is, with the control of the Senate, the GOP has really no incentive to give any leeway on this, the ninth circuit has been thorn on the side of the administration over and over and over again --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  -- and to make any deal like the Wall Street Journal reported would not be in the benefit to the President.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Chris, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if you've covered this with the President, but related to these various probes, investigations, did he give any indication that he's thinking or planning to release more documents, declassify more documents, get the full story out about the 2016 election and how our government came to spy on people affiliated with this campaign.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We were pretty careful when we pushed him on the issue.  He said over and over again, that he was going to leave the decisions, for now, to his Department of Justice.  The ball was on their court.  He was hoping that they made the right decisions, but that he was going to allow them to make them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the big -- the big cojones, if you will.  Maybe he's wait to release the declassified documents when another opportunity arises where he needs to offset some investigation there, because there are a lot of investigations that are unwinding right now from the Democrats in Congress.  Did he say anything about that?  What his strategy is, in the face of all of these investigations?</p><p>BEDFORD:  So far, he doesn't need to make any moves right now.  He appeared last night when we were speaking to him to be more hands off on this matter.  But he can make any decision he wants to when it regards to declassification --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: -- or, at least, a report later on.  There's no need for him to cause a tizzy in the Congress.  And we've seen the executive branch has been lawyering up as the Democrats prepare for investigations.  Those are coming either way, but he hasn't -- he didn't show his cards too strongly on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford from the Daily Caller, there.  Coming up, breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, finally addressing the controversial no-call that pushed the Rams into the Super Bowl finals.</p><p>And a rare sun phenomenon appears in the Midwest.  Check this out, after one of the coldest weather snaps in decades, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Justice for Senator Rand Paul after a brutal attack.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A Kentucky jury, Maria, awarding Senator Paul more than $580,000 in damages in his lawsuit against his neighbor who attacked him in 2017.  Earlier this month, the Republican senator sat down with you, Maria, talking about his injuries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I had six broken ribs, three of them broken and then separated so they were round upon each other for months until they healed.  I had pneumonia twice, I had fluid around my lung and now I have hernia (INAUDIBLE) repaired from this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The senator says, the verdict sends a clear message that violence is not the answer.  The neighbor's lawyer says, they will appeal.</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaking publicly for the very first time about the blatant non-call in the NFC championship game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODELL:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Goodell says, he spoke with Saints players about that play.  But one player denies that and says, he hasn't heard from Goodell at all.  Well, the Saints coach, Sean Payton, may not be buying what Goodell is saying either.  Twitter pointing out that, at a recent press conference, Sean Payton appeared to be wearing a t-shirt that shows Roger Goodell dressed as a clown.  There you go -- the comparison.  Either way, the Super Bowl, without the Saints, is just three days away and our very own Cheryl Casone will have live coverage from Atlanta starting tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And to the weather outside, the polar vortex bringing a rare weather effect to parts of the Midwest and plains -- and it's pretty beautiful, called the Sundog.  It happens when ice crystals in the atmosphere interact with sunlight in a certain way.  More Sundogs are expected in the Midwest as this deep freeze continues for a little bit longer, but what a pretty picture in the sky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very pretty.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor and I both tell Lauren how to say Sundog -- Sundog.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Sundog.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get it right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, corn dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, winter weather gripping the nation, as you just heard.  We will take you live to Minneapolis next.  And then, an eye on earnings this morning, big day for energy companies.  Plus, Amazon announces its quarterly numbers after the bell; we have got the preview back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are talking about the deadly polar vortex.  The Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades.  Ray Bogan is in Minneapolis this morning with the very latest where the temperature is negative 25-degrees, Ray.</p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning, it is very cold here.  You know, it was supposed to be about 0-degrees today, forecasted to be at one point.  However, it's not, just a couple of minutes ago, actually, it got even colder.  It is now negative 30-degrees.  I just saw a picture of the thermometer at the National Weather Service here in Minneapolis.  We're at the Minneapolis Airport where all morning planes have been taking off and landing throughout the week.  They've had relatively few cancellations and delays, they've been lucky in that way, but that has not been the case around the Midwest where there have been thousands of cancellations and delays.  The worst of those being at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports.  A few people have gotten stranded as a result of all of -- all of this.</p><p>Now, take a look at some of these record low temperatures.  It's been freezing out in Chicago.  They had negative 23-degrees, that's the lowest since 1985.  In Minneapolis, we had a reading of negative 28 -- that was the lowest since 1996 and in Des Moines, Iowa, they set a new daily record low of negative 20-degrees.  And you could see, it's having a big impact on nature too.  This is Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, a beautiful lake during the summer time where you can go boating, eat at restaurants along the shore but now it is frozen over.  That is definitely not happening, but on Sunday, there's the possibility that here in Minneapolis, it could be 75-degrees warmer than it is right now and people are looking forward to it.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's incredible that we are talking about these temperatures now.  But next week, they go all the way back up.  Ray, thanks very much for braving the cold for us and showing us, really, firsthand what it's like out there.  Ray Bogan is live in Minneapolis.  We felt the cold this morning even in New York, and it's only what -- it was one-degree when you scale it out.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think Governor Bevin would be proud of Ray for doing that report outside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I thought Ray was getting ready to rob a 7Eleven, the way he was dressed.  I wasn't sure.  You know, it's cold.  I flew it from Florida yesterday to come to here.  And I'm thinking why, what was I thinking?  What's wrong with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why.  This is why you're in Virginia?  I mean, in New York?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank God you're not doing this show outdoors today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we wouldn't do that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, when you were in Davos, how cold was it?  It was like five-degrees.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was five or 10-degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You sat outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we did for three --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For three hours, at least, if not longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I had lots of layers on and got my ice breakers on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can confirm, Ray is correct that Lake Geneva is lovely in the summer time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, big day for earnings.  We're hearing names like Blackstone Group, UPS, ConocoPhillips at the top of the hour, at 7:00 a.m.  All the numbers, what they're doing for markets, when we come back.

Thank you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Going to be interesting.  We've heard a lot about how the shutdown was supposed to have a big impact on the economy.  And we're going to start getting some numbers.  Got the ADP report number yesterday, maybe not so big.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The ADP numbers were very strong.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Better than expected.  Job creation in the private sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see if the jobs numbers tomorrow, actually, meet what we saw yesterday from the ADP numbers.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.

We finally have wages growing.  And we're going to hear this tomorrow.  Wages growing north of 3 percent in this country which is not something that we've seen in a decade.  Not during all the years that President Obama was president did wages in this nation grow north of 3 percent.  And that's a really -- that's a very positive sign and people are feeling it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  And I think it's a very, very important sign that employment for minorities, both Hispanics and African Americans, are at record highs.  And that is very significant because there's nothing that is more stimulating to the economy than people having employment and having a job.</p><p>It not only cuts the cost of government where the government has to subsidize people, but it empowers people and gives them something that they can put on the table for their families that otherwise they couldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that in this presidential election as all these Democrats get their -- sharpen their elbows and start basically sticking each other in the neck, that that's going to be -- and the attacks on Howard Schultz by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that he didn't climb the ladder -- I'm paraphrasing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this is what it's going to come down to.  Do you root for the success of individuals in this country and is our policy and our regulation, is it set up to basically encourage that success, to climb out of a housing project in Canarsie, to run and basically create one of the greatest American success stories of the last 50 years which is what Howard Schultz did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the question of socialism is ultimately does it lead to equality or does it lead to mediocrity.  And if you look around the world historically it does not lead to equality.  Equality lifting everybody's boat.  It leads to mediocrity if not disaster.  And Venezuela is a wonderful example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There was a time Venezuela was quite vibrant.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, incredible.  Prosperous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But let me just tell you that the earnings have come out.  Blackstone Group reporting better than expected revenue -- $505 million, versus $381 million estimate.  The revenue was better than expected.</p><p>The UPS numbers are better than expected on the earnings line, $1.94 versus an estimate of $1.91.</p><p>We've got a mixed story.  The Industrial Average has worsened here.  Dow is now down 25 points.  But the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are higher as we do get some mixed stories in terms of fourth quarter earnings this morning.</p><p>All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here.  Former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is here.  As well as the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Popsockets CEO David Barnett is with us along with Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling.</p><p>Don't miss a moment it.  We've got a big show.  And we want to kick it off right here with our top story this hour.  And that is big tech on tap.  A slew of technology giants reporting earnings this week.  We already heard from Facebook last night and the stock is soaring this morning.  It posted a record profit.</p><p>It reported last night.  It comes after a rocky year for the social media company over privacy concerns.  That stock is up 11 and two-thirds percent.</p><p>We are watching Amazon this morning because it is set to report after the close tonight.  We want to know how Amazon did in the fourth quarter certainly, not just because of the Amazon numbers but because it is an indicator of how the economy did for the holiday season.  It's up one and two-thirds percent right now and Amazon, as you see, at $1,697.</p><p>Check Tesla rattling investors yesterday after falling short on earnings and announcing the exit of its chief financial officer.  The company did however post back to back profits for the first time in its 15 year history.  The stock is down 4.5 percent.  CEO Elon Musk announcing his goal for the year is to see profit in every quarter.</p><p>Let's talk more about that, as we talk with ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's most important in your portfolio of companies in terms of an indicator of more than just that company?</p><p>KEENEY:  So, yes.  When we look at the tech industry overall, so first of all, we're focused on disruptive innovation.  So in times I'd say of economic distress, we often find that the fundamentals of our companies are improving even if, you know, there's more volatility in the market.  And we actually like to take advantage of that volatility.</p><p>So particularly when earnings comes around we have sort of a mixed earnings season, you'll see us doing that through our trading.</p><p>So in particular for Tesla, you know, a lot of people are concerned, the CFO is leaving.  You could take that as he now thinks that the company is sort of ready to fly without him.</p><p>You know, it went through a tough period and he's now ready to head out.  So does it change our long-term thesis that Tesla's going to be a leader in autonomous electric vehicles?  No.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When you talk about Tesla and autonomous technology, this is -- I know you see it, a lot of people see it as a huge market.  But what is it that Tesla has that gives them a specific edge in autonomous transportation?</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So actually last night on the call Musk highlighted this.  We think that their advantage is really in data collection.  They're the only automaker that is collecting data from its cars on the road.</p><p>So last night Musk said that he thinks every other player that's collecting autonomous data has 5 percent of what Tesla has.  That's what you use to train your machine learning algorithm and ultimately make the car improve.  So really with that, we think Tesla can speed away from the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>Yes.  Because that's going to inform on insurance.  That's going to have a lot of implications in terms of all that data that you can get from the car.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  There are a lot of off-shooting effects of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from Amazon?  Tell us your reaction to Facebook.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So Amazon, you know, I'd say overall -- you know, we don't necessarily make quarter to quarter predictions but I will say as we're talking about Tesla, Amazon -- I mean, this is a company that's also moving into the autonomous space.  They're really transforming logistics.</p><p>So we expect them to continue to disrupt companies like UPS, like the other carriers.  So we're excited to see what's coming.</p><p>For Facebook, you know, mobile ad revenue surprised.  It grew 36 percent, more than expected.  This shows that their ad products are really best in class, you know, no matter the controversy that we're seeing in the news.</p><p>And actually from my perspective, Facebook is an interesting company because they could see more viewership or more customers in the back seat of autonomous cars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Why is Facebook up?  I don't get that.  Because there's so many things going wrong with them in terms of the invasion of privacy, selling of private data, yet their stocks are up.  So explain that for me.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  You know, again, I'd say that this quarter really shows that their ad products are just best in class.  And they're one of the only ways to reach users on a widespread basis in today's sort of Internet age.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the metrics are telling you so much about the customer, telling the advertisers so much, so you can really target who you want to talk to.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And those users are sticky and they have Instagram which is increasingly popular.</p><p>One really interesting thing that happened yesterday, we talked about it on this program about this Facebook app that they were pushing on young adults and teens to gather information.  They were paying them like $20 a pop to do that.</p><p>And I think we talked about this yesterday.  Apple has banned that app used by Facebook from its -- basically said that you can't -- they revoked Facebook's permission to maintain that research app that targeted teens and young adults.</p><p>This is really important because this is self-regulation.  We keep talking about the regulation of these technology companies and the regulation by Washington of like Facebook and other social media giants.</p><p>This is self-regulation.  Apple's stepping in and saying no more.  And I think that's very telling about what the road ahead might look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When you've been saying they need to self-regulate for a long time.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned Instagram.  I have been so active on Instagram @MariaBartiromo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're blowing it up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check it out.  Today is throwback Thursday and I put a picture there, back from 1985 and I want to he see your throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I posted it.  And it's really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell, @MorningsMaria.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really, really awful but I did it for you.  My photo is absolutely hideous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't give it away.  We're going o talk about it later on in the show.  Hey, do have you a throwback Thursday photo that you want to share?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm working on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was a child in the 1980s.  I don't remember it very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  I'm loving Instagram.  I'm having fun with it.</p><p>Tasha -- good to see you.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Tasha Keeney joining us.</p><p>Make sure you tune in tomorrow.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January jobs report.  It starts at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow right where we identify where the jobs are right now.</p><p>Before we take a break, check out President Trump's tweet this morning.  He just tweeted, \"He said so great to watch and listen to all these people who write books and talk about my presidential campaign and so many other things related to winning and how I should be doing it.  As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around and say gee, I'm in the White House and they're not.\"</p><p>Yes, the President just wrote that a moment ago.</p><p>We're going to take a break.  When we come back, yes, it is deadly cold -- the record-breaking temperatures causing chaos across the country.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Then the big business of sports betting, millions of Americans will be watching the big game on Sunday, hoping to make some money.  We'll take a look at how the gambling industry is changing the sports world, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A deadly polar vortex is sweeping through the Midwest right now.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It is cold and it is dangerous.  At least nine people have died in causes related to this arctic blast.  One 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.</p><p>The wind chill temps fell to minus 50 degrees in Chicago and, get this, near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.  Flight Aware says that since yesterday there have been more than 21,000 flight delays plus more than 6,000 cancellations.</p><p>Seven people, take a look at this video, stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were about minus 4 degrees and on the water, with a wind chill of minus 30.  Coast Guard officials say the seven people were near Surgeon Bay, Wisconsin near Lake Michigan but they couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>General Motors plants in Michigan are halting production due to the extremely cold weather.  And there's shortage of natural gas following a fire out of a compressor station.  A dozen plants in all are affected.  The utility there is asking customers to voluntarily reduce their use of natural gas.</p><p>Take a look at General Motors' stock, down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And this, firefighters battle a massive blaze at a historic factory in below freezing temperatures.  The Markel Paper Plant burning overnight in New Jersey.  The bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries reported.  It's unclear how the fire started.</p><p>The 86-year=old paper factory has survived several fires in the past but this one happening in the cold weather, pretty historic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  that is incredible how fierce this fire is even in these incredible temperatures.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And then it spread because of the strong wind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Of course.  Yes.</p><p>All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  Well, lot of stories over the cold.  Dagen -- your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We see these stories, we report them and it's always a reminder to think about our first responders, the people who put their lives on the line to protect us all and go out and whether it's police officers, whether it's firefighters, particularly in these horrific weather conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Save people's lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break.</p><p>Place your bets, next up.  Sports betting in focus with the Super Bowl this Sunday.  Millions expected to place a wager on the big game.  The business ramifications next.</p><p>And then hitting board games -- luxury hitting board games, Fashion designer Louis Vuitton with a new twist on Jenga.  Plus a robot who taught himself to play the game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting.  He says this, \"Large sections of the wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go.  Renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border.  The wall is getting done one way or another,\" writes the President.</p><p>Well, \"let's just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games, a wall is a wall,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right.  Super Bowl LIII is just three days away now.  The big game of the season for the Rams and the Patriots.  Also the biggest gaming event, gambling event of the year for fans.  The American Gaming Association projecting Americans will bet upwards of $6 billion legally and illegally on the NFL finale.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Matthew -- it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW KING, CEO, FANDUEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How big of a deal is the Super Bowl for FanDuel?</p><p>KING:  Super Bowl is a huge deal.  If you look across all of our product lines, in the fantasy business we run one of our largest fantasy contests of the year on the Super Bowl.</p><p>We also have big game bingo for those people that aren't interested in fantasy or sports betting.  And then for sports betting, since this is the first year we're going through it in New Jersey, nobody knows how big it's going to be.</p><p>What we know is that it's going to be a huge season for people to try the product for the first time.  It's also going to be a place where in time where people will do more (INAUDIBLE) than they've ever done before.  So it's betting on all the different things.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like how many times Trump will tweet during the game.  That's a prop that you can make.  I don't know.  I just wanted to raise that issue like it's become that granular.</p><p>KING: It is.  I'm sure we can set a line on that.  I don't if we can get approval for it.  We'll have over 450 things you can bet on during the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are some of the more popular ones?</p><p>KING:  Everybody loves the coin toss because it's the first thing.  Most of the volume will still be on the big markets, the money line and the spread.  But then we have a lot of just fun things like who's going to catch the first pass, who makes the first touchdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And how many times does Gronk get targeted, et cetera.  Do you have to be in New Jersey to bet through FanDuel.</p><p>KING:  You absolutely have to.  You have to be in New Jersey.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In other words, the software will not let you bet if you're, saying you're from somewhere else.</p><p>KING:  If you're literally on one side of the bridge, it will let you bet.  If you're on the other side of the bridge, it won't let you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's on the wrong side of the New Jersey tunnel bridge.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can get a taxi.</p><p>KING: We can go.  You know, I am happy to escort you to New Jersey after that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who sits down and thinks of the things to bet on?  And then who sits down and decides here's what the line is going to be?</p><p>KING:  So in terms of the things to bet on, we have a global expertise across a number of markets because we're part of the Paddy Power BetFair portfolio of families.  And so we have decades of bookmaking experience and our marquee is how many things can we think of?</p><p>And so we literally have hundreds of people thinking up what all can you bet on.  And then we also frankly listen to users.  And so we'll talk a lot about what do they want to bet on.  And if they come up with a good idea, we'll set a line for it.  So it's the beauty of having a bunch of analysts and kind of modelers who can really set a line on anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has this business changed in the last, I don't know, two years or so?  I mean your business has gotten much bigger.</p><p>KING:  It has gotten a lot bigger.  So as an industry we've continued to grow the fantasy business.  As a company, we merged our business with Paddy Power BetFair's U.S. subsidiary.  We created the largest online real money gaming business in the U.S. by factor of two.  So really kind of span all of the product verticals that are available.  And then with sports betting we've built the largest online sports betting business in the country in a very quick fashion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the Supreme Court --</p><p>KING:  After the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- decision overturning the federal ban on sports betting.</p><p>KING:  Yes.  So it's been quite a run in the last six months.  We opened our retail location at the meadowlands in July.  It's quickly become one of the largest sports books in the world from a standing start.  And then the Web site has just taken off.  You know, orders of magnitude beyond our expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about working with some sports leagues to try and improve their popularity?  I mean I raise the issue of Nascar.  Nascar is in dire need of something to really get people re-engaged with the sport and make them excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even baseball on a smaller level.</p><p>KING:  So baseball, we're going to see -- you know, half a season of baseball.  And baseball was actually a great case study in how betting can help the sport.  If you think about baseball, because you have different innings, it creates a very easy, digestible kind of instance for people to bet on.</p><p>So we actually have people betting on the first five innings.  We have people betting on each inning.  Baseball was really the surprise for us in terms of how much more engagement you could palpably see with people as they went through the sport, just because it makes each game so much more exciting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ask Pete Rose how that worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about Nascar?</p><p>KING:  Nascar, again, every sport has an opportunity to work together.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  First to wreck.  First to wreck -- classic bet.</p><p>KING:  A lot of it comes down to also helping the leagues with their data, right.  So a lot of the leagues have all of this new data that's available and in some cases they're not 100 percent sure what to do with it.  But that's actually our core business, right.</p><p>So if you think about what we've done in fantasy, what we do in sports betting, what we do in horse racing, it's use data and create ways for fans to more deeply engage with the games that they love.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You take a bet up to the person's credit card limit or what is the limit here?  Is there a limit?</p><p>KING:  So we do have limits and we look at it from the perspective of -- the issue kind of revolves around responsible gaming.  And it's an issue we take very, very serious and so we have a standard set of limits.  And then we actually have an entire function that actually thinks about and works with users to make sure that people are playing within their limits because at the end of the day this is a fun product and it should be a fun product.  But we have to be cognizant of responsible gaming issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say -- Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was just going to say when talking about baseball, I said how did that work out for Pete Rose?  It didn't work out real well for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Not so much.</p><p>KING:  But I think you also have to -- I mean there has to be integrity of the sport.  We work very closely with the leagues around how we maintain integrity.  And again, that's a place where we leverage our global expertise.</p><p>I think the other piece is, it highlights the need for regulated gaming, right, because what you see and you can see it in the AGA stats, a majority of what's going to be bet on the Super Bowl is in the illegal markets.  And so part of the reason to push legislation is actually bring that betting activity into the regulated markets where it can be more closely controlled.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gambling and marijuana, we've come a long way in the last 20 years in terms of what's acceptable and what's legal.</p><p>KING:  It is:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Perfectly legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matthew -- thank you so much.</p><p>KING:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  We'll be watching the big game and FanDuel.  Matthew King.</p><p>Remember our own Cheryl Casone will be live in Atlanta tomorrow for the big game.  We'll talk with the legendary Joe Theismann and Shaquille O'Neal with Cheryl tomorrow.  So stay with us for that.</p><p>First -- before we take a break, President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He just said this.  \"Very sadly murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33 percent from 2017 -- to just 33,341.  this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout the country, worse even than Afghanistan, much caused by drugs.  Wall is being built,\" writes the President.</p><p>Quick break and then trade talks in focus, the U.S. and China working on a deal, day two of those talks today.</p><p>Plus security concerns in Europe over Huawei.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>Then big money real estate, Chinese billionaire Xian Jin (ph) who I spoke with in Davos last week at a center of a mega real estate deal.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in high gear now, DowDuPont and General Electric making big moves in the premarket this morning after reporting their fourth quarter.  DowDuPont down 5-3/4 percent right now.  General Electric up 7-1/2 percent, revenue better than estimates, up $0.68 a share at 9.78 on G.E.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning.  Take a look at what we're expecting at the open.  Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning, down 45 points, fractional move but nonetheless had been fractionally lower earlier.  S&amp;P is up just by about a point and the NASDAQ is up 31 points right now, one-half of one percent.</p><p>Celgene hitting the tape, revenue above expectations as earnings on Celgene.  This after the major indices surged yesterday on the Federal Reserve's dovish approach to raising rates for the rest of the year.  Basically the Fed said they're on hold, data-dependent.  Dow Industrials were up better than 500 points at their best at the close.  The Dow closed up 434 points, 1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent, 41 points higher and the NASDAQ up 155 points at the close, 2-a quarter percent higher on NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.  Take a look, mostly higher, FT-100 is up about 30 points, one-half a percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up five points, the DAX Index is lower by 22.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher overnight, as you'll see here with the exception of Korea.</p><p>Parents beware, what you need to know about the expanding ibuprofen recall for infants.  We've got the story.</p><p>And so much for the Chinese pulling out of U.S. real estate, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke within Davos last week, reportedly ready to spend big money for an apartment in New York.  We'll tell you how much.</p><p>And the next step for artificial intelligence, a robot taught itself to play Jenga.  See if you'll stack up later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour, trade tensions, it is now day two of the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C.  President Trump set to meet with China's trade negotiator later today.  Last week, China, a very big topic throughout the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION:  As China right now seems to focus on you know, macro demand management.  The supply side policy has not been stopped and then we continue to push forward for supply-side, well because supply-side structural reform.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  China is at the moment reacting with demand side measures, both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling.  But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in opening the market, that creates a lot of growth potential, that creates productivity enhancement.</p><p>DR. KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb.  So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>WEI SUN CHRISTIANSON, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY CHINA:  I think the China's slowdown is a short-term and it's largely driven by the deleveraging initiative of the government and also the trade tension and weakened sentiment.  But I think if you look at this government reaction to the slowdown is very interesting.  In the past, that they will take it the easy way out and by resorting to this credit-driven stimulus tools and to boost the economy.</p><p>But now, they're more careful because they want to preserve the good result of the deleveraging and the financial sector cleanup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was some comments from Davos last week.  One of the few comments in the -- in the panel related to whether or not China is going to open-up its market, governor, I want to get your take on this.  Because what I found from Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials from China running the financial services industry last week, he showed a real willingness to open up the markets in financial services but is that going to be enough?  That doesn't impact the Trump manufacturing regions of the country.  It doesn't certainly address some of the bigger issues like espionage, like forced transfer of tech and I.P. theft.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But after decades of going the wrong direction, we're taking steps in the right direction.  And I think the pressure that the president has put on China is incredibly positive and people need to give him some air here on this because China is hurting more than the United States is hurting.  They have to play ball.  They're going to have to come to the table and start playing fair.  They haven't done it in decades because nobody made them.  This is a president that's forcing them to have to rethink the way they do trade.  The results is, there's 33,000 new manufacturing jobs.  That's a lot of manufacturing when we were told manufacturing is dead in America.  Well, it isn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the editorial board yesterday had a piece on the separating the Huawei issues from the I.P. theft and the -- and the forced transfer of technology.  James, explain this.  Because I don't understand how you can separate these two.  I mean, if you're talking about stealing trade secrets isn't that what Huawei did?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you separate them in the sense that asking another country to obey the criminal laws of the United States is kind of baseline.  It should be expected of everyone regardless of what the particulars of a trade agreement are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I think -- and I think enforcing our laws is a great step in holding China to account.  But what we're really after is not just don't come here and break our laws, but in your country, give our businesses a fair opportunity, respect our technology and I think part of the sales pitch to China has to be look at the upside for you if you start respecting intellectual property.  It will encourage and energize your entrepreneurs who lately are not that excited about the communist government taking a tighter grip of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just wonder if it's too late.  I mean, I just wonder if at this point China has stolen what it is going to steal, forced enough transfer of technology and now they've invested in patents, they've invested in innovation, they're probably on their way to being number one in all of these industries that the U.S. wanted to be number one in, like robotics and like block chain and the rest.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think you look at the earnings of our great semiconductor companies, you look at Apple, you look at various measures, the answer would be it's not over yet.  The value is still being created in the United States.</p><p>Long-term, obviously we don't know but I don't think it's a -- and this is maybe a reason why this is the moment as the governor said, we are still the world's preeminent economy and preeminent creator of new technology.  Maybe we won't be forever, but this is the time to strike a deal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But we're still innovating and they're still having to steal.  That's the big difference.  And I do believe that entrepreneurship is alive and well in the United States and it needs to continue.  That's the key is making the incentive there and the incentive is still there, at least for now, for American companies to innovate and create something that's disruptive and globe changing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To do that -- to that point, and this is (INAUDIBLE) this morning when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, this is the number one story on the Wall Street Journal website that the United States is changing the visa process for highly skilled workers.  These are the H-1B visas and that starting this April it will basically offer more changes to how the visas are for people who have master's degrees.  Mre than 5,000 more immigrants with master's degrees or higher will get selected for this type of visa.  We need to make sure -- and this is part of the overall immigration issue, make sure that these smart people stay here in the United States.</p><p>And one other thing, Maria, because the Journal also writes about this and you've been talking about this, with all of your guests, particularly at Davos.  That one area where we can push our businesses into China is through services, through banking, through insurance, through consulting.  It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be satisfied with that because he likes to focus on goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the question I asked the governor, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Soybeans, pork.  Because when he talks about the (INAUDIBLE) our trade relationship with Canada, I remembered he say we'll have a trade deficit.  Yes, with goods.  But if you include the services which and we're a service economy, we have a trade surplus with Canada.  So, will a greater export of services into China satisfy President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's not going to satisfy.  The -- what I know is that China wants to open its markets.  It's willing to open its markets in financial services.  Already UBS has gotten the go-ahead.  They own 51 percent of a bank in China.  They're going to be able to own 100 percent of that company within three years.</p><p>Number one, Steven Mnuchin said to me yesterday or two days ago when I was in D.C., well, why are we waiting three years for 100 percent?  They want it sooner, not in three years and financial services doesn't really address President Trump's base, the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, I think China -- we'll see.  I mean, if it's a shell and it's nothing in between, but definitely I think China is willing to do financial services 100 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Foxconn backed off its plans to add manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.  That they're going to focus on research, development and design jobs but they said to make these liquid crystal displays in Wisconsin, that it's too expensive.  So, I don't know how that plays with trade negotiations.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And never forget one important thing, people also want to live in the United States more than they want to live in China for the freedom, for the opportunities.  The most important thing that we in this country that we export to the world --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But will we accept those immigrants?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- is liberty, never forget that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will we accept those immigrants?  That is the core of what is going on in Washington right now.  Do we have open arms and will we raise the number of people we allow to immigrate to this country legally every year?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If China won't embrace the entrepreneurial economy, let's recruit their talent.  And this White House policy, what he's doing is he's reshuffling the existing slots.  What the president ought to say in the State of the Union is we're going to increase the number of PhD engineers that we bring in from China, India and elsewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, parents beware, big story here, infant ibuprofen recalled over potential dangers.  We've got the story and the details next.</p><p>And then a major real estate play, Chinese billionaire  Zhang Xin who I spoke with in Davos last week building her portfolio in the United States, she continues to expand, details on the price tag, next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A nationwide infant ibuprofen recall has been expanded.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Parents listen up, Tris Pharma is expanding avoluntary recall of its infant ibuprofen because the product might contain a higher concentration of ibuprofen than labeled.  The company has added three more lots to the recall list, they were manufactured for CVS and Walmart.  Tris Pharma says there have been no reports of any illness.</p><p>A Chinese billionaire in talks to buy a $60 million apartment in New York City.  The New York post says Zhang Xin is close to acquiring a full floor unit at 432 Park Ave. the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere.  Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of China's largest property developer SOHO China.  And Maria, you talked with Zhang about real estate at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZHANG XIN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SOHO CHINA:  Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buying real estate, and so -- and but now they're worrying on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down.  So then, what does the government do and you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate, buying real estate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The New York Posts says two other units at 432 Park Avenue on the market for $40 million are currently under contract.</p><p>And this, researchers at MIT are showing off their new robot that taught itself to play Jenga.  Using a camera for ayes and two small prongs for fingers.  It can gently remove the pieces.  The robot determines which move is the best one to make by touching the pieces first, testing them out.</p><p>And speaking of Jenga, Louis Vuitton is releasing a $2,400 luxury Jenga set, the 54 L.V. monogrammed pieces are made from plexiglass, not wood.  So, if you ever need an expensive gift, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, making the world better through business, the story of pop sockets and how it's using sales to help charities around the world.  Good story next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pop sockets are taking over cell phones.  They stick to your device to help you get a better grip and make it easier to watch videos.  Today the company is launching the next phase of Poptivism, which it says is aimed at making the world better.</p><p>Here now in an exclusive interview is the CEO and founder of PopSockets, David Barnett.  David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BARNETT, CEO AND FOUNDER, POPSOCKETS:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And PopSockets, what a great idea.  How did you come up with this idea?</p><p>BARNETT:  Well, back in 2010, I was tired of my headset tangling in my pocket.  Each time I took it out, it was tangled.  So, I went down to the nearest fabric store and glued a couple of huge clothing buttons to the backside of my iPhone 3 and wrapped my head set around them, it looked ridiculous.  I got made fun of.  And so, I started tinkering with mechanisms to get the button to expand and collapse, so that it would look a little more respectable and have more functionality, act as a stand, and act as a grip for the phone.  Eventually --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you started off thinking you could just put your headphones around it, but then you realized there were so many other ideas.</p><p>BARNETT:  That was the initial problem which is a lesson for me, that the problem that motivates you start tinkering is not always the problem you end up solving.  So, the current product does solve for that problem.  But that's not what most people use it for.  So, I ended up settling on this accordion mechanism.  And we just finished our fifth year of business.  So, I started out of my garage, in Boulder, Colorado.  And we've sold about a hundred million of these so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A hundred million pop sockets, wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You were a philosophy professor.</p><p>BARNETT:  That is correct.  I'm ready for questions.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When was the moment where you decided iPhone accessories were a better line of work?</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes, all it was -- I would say some -- half of the philosophy professors watching this are laughing at me.  And the other half are probably pretty jealous.</p><p>So, it is -- it can be a lot more fun than being a philosophy professor and sometimes, the problems we're dealing with are a little bit easier, usually.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but an assassin is the mother of invention and you invent something out of necessity.  And I just love entrepreneurial ideas that come from necessity.  You created something.  I'm absolutely in awe of people who do something so simple and when I see it, I say why didn't I think of that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how are you giving back?</p><p>BARNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNETT:  Sure, today, I'd love to share with you.  Today we launched our Poptivism program to the public.  And it encourages anybody sitting here to go to our website, you create your own grip.  So, you upload your own art work, hopefully it work with an artist, unless you're a natural artist.  So, you upload some beautiful graphic and then you can tag any charity you want.  So, any five O's, 503 --</p><p>FREEMAN:  501(c)(3)</p><p>BARNETT:  501(c)(3), thank you, that you would like.  So we have a bunch already lined up for you.  And 50 percent of every sale of that product will go to that charity.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  50 percent of the sale, not the --</p><p>BARNETT:  Not the profit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- income, not the profit, which is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes.  I don't know any other -- any other brand giving this much away and allowing you to design the product.  So it's customized impact.  We have a bunch of different categories of charities including some charities around veteran services, so the Wounded Warrior, Bob Woodruff Foundation, The Mission Continues.  Anyway, long list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  And what are this retail for pop grips?</p><p>BARNETT:  They start at $10.00 for the graphics and they go up to -- there's Swarovski for $50.00.  I have a marble on my -- a genuine marble on my phone today.  And it's -- I believe it's $30.00 for the marble.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you give these to influencers so they use them?  Because I see them all over like reality television.</p><p>BARNETT:  So, the virality of this is partly explained by the fact that celebrities got a hold of them organically.  We don't -- we don't seed the influencers.  We've made some -- we've had some partnerships with influencers but originally this blew up around Los Angeles because celebrities we saw Gigi Hadid and Ryan Seacrest.  And it's just a long list of celebrities using them and that really led to their -- to their growth, quickly.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And that's because it's a great handle for a selfie?</p><p>BARNETT:  Sorry, I should explain it, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Or was it mainly a fashion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  let me see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNETT:  I haven't yet even explained it, you're right.  It collapses and expands and it allows you to move your hand away from the backside of your phone.  I have one of our wallets underneath it.  It allows you to move your hand away.  Once you do that, you can access your whole screen with your thumb.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.</p><p>BARNETT:  Without having to drop your phone.  You can take selfies, photographs much more easily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be doing that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 31, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 013103cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the busiest day for earnings so far, General Electric out last hour.  The stock keeps rising over the last hour.  It is now up better than nine percent on better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>We have an eye on big tech this morning.  Facebook soaring this morning on a record profit reported last night, stock is up 11-3/4 percent even in the face of the privacy scandal.  The stock to watch after the close, Amazon.  Amazon shares right now up two percent.  The company reports earnings after the close tonight.  Markets this morning are looking at a mixed open for the broader averages.</p><p>Take a look.  Dow Industrials right now down 36 points but the S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ, higher by 35 points right now.  This after a sharp rally yesterday fueled by Federal Reserve.  The Dow Industrials up 435 points at the close yesterday.  1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 41, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up 155 points, up 2-1/4 quarter percent.  And the Federal Reserve officially told us they are on hold in terms of data dependency on interest rate hikes.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this.  The European indices right now are most higher.  FT-100 up 35 points, one-half of one percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris up 3-1/2 points, fractional move.  DAX index in Germany down 38 points, one-third of one percent.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, best performer is Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than one percent.</p><p>Back in U.S.  The arctic blast has turned deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their levels in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's like hard to take a breath and it stick to my lungs a little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The winds, the windchill is probably the worst of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a look at when millions of Americans can expect temperatures to fall.  We will tell you.  Plus this, attacking the wealthy again.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz answers critics about his success.  Then Roger Goodell breaks his silence.  What he said about the infamous no call during the NHC championship game later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.  And former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you very much.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  The kind of interesting we've been talking about for the last year really, Facebook, how much do users care about these privacy issues.  And last summer we got those results looked look like maybe users aren't really digging this but this latest numbers, you got to say, it looks like users care less about the privacy issues than those of us in media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then they have other areas other than the Facebook business to monetize.  Like with WhatsApp, Messenger, which they're not actually getting any advertising from so far.  So one thing not monetize those think there's an expectations from a business perspective that there's going to be even more growth</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Instagram is kind of the great juggernaut that they have -- or that they're growing, incredibly rapidly but I point this out that because Apple banned this basically data gathering app where they were getting young people in teens to give them all data this is Facebook, Apple bans it, well -- from this app store.  You know what's interesting?  That self-regulation.</p><p>Again, it's not going to be the government that comes in, it's going to be all of these tech companies maybe regulating each other and realizing it might be in their best business interests to not just help them grow incredibly strong but also limit their growth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm more worried about Facebook censoring content.  I don't mean the censoring the classic sense of the government but deciding what people get to see, that worries me more than the privacy issue.  When you sign up for Facebook, you know you're giving away privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't realize is that Facebook is picking for you what you get to see and with 60 percent of Americans now getting most of their news from Facebook.  That's really disturbing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what the Congress is looking at and that's why got those guys, Facebook, Google executives to testify.  Last year in Capitol Hill to see if in fact they are censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentioned Instagram, check out our Instagram post today, it is throwback Thursday.  And posted a shot of way back in 1985, you posted a shot of yourself in the 80s.  Where is your picture?  Post your picture from throwback Thursday Instagram.  I'm having the best time on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  If I looked like you did in the 80s, I would be posting throwback photos while -- may even look like you now but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You look gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No, no.  Maria looks like Sophia Loren and I look -- well, not so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of good looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some good looks this morning.  So check out our Instagram pages.  Meanwhile, we've got a big hour coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Sean Duffy is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson is with us.  Along with L.A. Dodger pitcher Ross Stripling joining us this morning.</p><p>And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in as always.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We kick it off right here with this.  General Electric shares are soaring this morning on strong earnings.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Stock is up nine percent, Susan.  Good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Good morning to you, Maria.  And congratulations for mastering Instagram.  We'll talk about Facebook in just a bit.  But yes, G.E. shares are higher rallying in the premarket and this is because they got a revenue beat, it's actually pretty good for G.E. as you know, it's been shrinking.  There's been problems with the company.  But aviation was strong for G.E. in the quarter and that offset the slowdown.</p><p>And so as some problems that we're seeing in the capital business and also their power businesses as well.  G.E. also by the way settling that DOJ subprime settlements of just around $1-1/2 billion.  This goes back to the 2008 financial crisis.  And as you know, they have been spinning off several businesses in 2018 to spring off some cash flow and to try to make some profit.</p><p>Let's talk about Facebook because also rallying in the premarket, Faceboook shares and as you mentioned stories doing very well for them on Instagram and also on Facebook as well.  And they grew, daily active users and all geographic locations and this is after a downturn of course in Europe and also plateau in North America.  So that's important to watch. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Susan.  Thank you so much.  Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade, the President tweeting about it this morning saying this, China's top trade negotiators are in the United States meeting with our representatives.  Meeting are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides.  China does not want to -- an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal, they're correct.</p><p>I will be meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in Oval Office, no final deal will be made until my friend, President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the longstanding and more difficult points.  Very comprehensive transaction.  Writes the President.  He goes on to say, Chinese representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table.</p><p>All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully revolved.  Tariffs on China increased to 25 percent on March 1st.  So, all working hard to complete by that date.  My next guest is the cosponsor of a bill that will give President Trump executive power to raise tariffs and joining me right now is Wisconsin Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member, Sean Duffy.  Congressman, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  It's good to be with you, Maria.  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DOBBS:  So in the President's tweet just now, he said everything is on the table, all of these tough issues, does that mean that he is also talking about espionage, the forced transfer of technology and the I.P. theft?</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.  I think he is talking about all these issues.  When you have a relationship with trading partner like China, you can't do business for very long.  We have a country like China stealing our intellectual property or the force transfer of intellectual property.  So, yes.  No, this is all on the table.  Here's what I think is going on now, Maria.  We understand that China lies and they cheat and they steal, right?</p><p>So we want to get a deal before March 1st so we don't have that increase in tariffs.  But I don't know that all the other tariffs currently imposed are going to come off on March 1st if a deal is struck because even if you get a deal with China, are they going to implement the deal?  And that's going to take time.  So, we got to actually -- we don't have this trust but verify like Reagan said with the Russians.</p><p>We have I think a philosophy of don't trust and verify with the Chinese because we -- they can sign a document with us, an agreement with us but that doesn't mean they're going to implement that document.  So, folks, if a deal comes and tariffs are lifted, I don't think that's a strategy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that because they did that on beef, right?  They said that they would buy certain amount of beef and then they didn't.</p><p>DUFFY:  Right.  Yes.  You're absolutely correct.  And, so, you know, again, I -- we believe in free trade and we think, you know, having a great trading partner like China where we can, you know, lower tariffs and respect each other's intellectual property is a great relationship but when you see the rising threat of China militarily and their -- and their substantial growth, we have to take a second look at, you know, what they're doing and what risk that poses to our to American way one of life.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, what's -- you know, what President Trump has done brilliantly is, you know, because of these tariffs but also, you know, the knowledge of the force transfer of technology, you see the whole global supply chain changing away from China.  And you can't do business for that long when you steal a technology to people who come to your country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  And Americans are getting -- China is not a good home for business.  There's other places that we can go outside of China and it's having a real impact even on American earnings as you reported are American companies missing some of their numbers, Apple, Nvidia because of lack of sales that are happening inside of China because of the slowdown that has been led by Donald Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, it's interesting because we actually had Steve Ballmer on a couple of months ago, former CEO of Microsoft and he said that the theft from China costs Microsoft $10 billion in profits because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system only a fraction, one percent actually pay for it.  So, there's all of this theft going on.</p><p>What are the metrics that you want to use to check to verify that in fact if you do do a deal that they will follow through on it?  And do I hear you saying that there is no way that tariffs are going to be gone?  That you can't lift tariffs at all because you can't trust what they say they're going to follow through on?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  I think metric is time, Maria.  I mean, we have to give this time to see with actual implementation.  And so I don't know if that's a year or two years, I think -- I think you have a longer runway here on the tariff front with China but you might mentioned intellectual property I think the Chinese are suing us at the WTO for $50 billion of tariffs that President Trump put on the Chinese for intellectual property theft.</p><p>And our analysis is that they steel $250 to $600 billion a year of American technology and they're -- they have their goal to sue us over the $50 billion in tariffs.  I mean, this is rich stuff with the Chinese and I just -- I think we have a president -- President Trump who's willing to actually fight this out for the American people and try to win for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about Foxconn, a major reversal.  We talked about you in the electronics' giant first announced their new Wisconsin factory that was supposed to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs.  Now the research centers for scientists and engineers.  Congressman, what about the manufacturing jobs, how disappointed are you by this reversal?</p><p>DUFFY:  So they're still -- they're still committed to the R&amp;D side of it but you're right on the manufacturing side.  They haven't necessarily pulled out but they have signaled that they will on the manufacturing side of Foxconn.  And Maria, first of all, so they invested $100 million in the University of Wisconsin system to train our workers.  That's fantastic.  They bought buildings, they have land to build their facilities.</p><p>But what's happening, Wisconsin, why is this decision made?  Scott Walker lost.  The guy that won, Tony Evers in Wisconsin was bashing this deal from the very beginning.  So now you have an unfriendly government in Wisconsin who doesn't want Foxconn there.  This a massive investment.  And if you're going to make it, you better have a governor who goes, yes, you know, come to my state, bring us the jobs, I'm happy to have you.</p><p>And that's hasn't been Tony Evers.  And so, they've been attacking this deal from the very beginning.  I don't think this will happen if Scott Walker had won in Wisconsin but it is now because, you know, business -- Foxconn is under attack in our state because of our new governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So you -- so you blame the new governor as --</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For this, how many jobs will be cut then?</p><p>DUFFY:  Well, so they haven't walked away.  They had a promise of 13 million jobs to $10-billion investment.  They haven't walked away from that number.  And by the way, the incentives that we gave for Foxconn to come were tied to the investment and the jobs.  And so they just missed a $10-million incentive because they didn't hit the job number.  So, again, this is still up in the air for us but if you're Foxconn, you really have to consider the politics of our state and what's changed in the last, you know, two months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Before you go, what are you dealing with, negative 26 degrees right there in Wisconsin, Congressman?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  So, it's 27 below, windchills hit up to 50 below, just have been -- people don't get this in the south but our cars don't start here.  The post office, it never shuts down, the post office is shut down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Our ski hill is shut down.  My Congressional office yesterday was shut down.  People couldn't get to work.  So, you know, it's crazy cold and by the way, kids, we have eight kids, seven of them are at home, you coop up kids for two days in the house because they can't go outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Crazy fights are going and you can only watch so many movies, Maria, and play some of the games monopoly before your house is ready to explode.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the whole Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades, so they're staying home from school, right?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  You can't send these little kids out waiting, you know, for a bus to go to school.  I mean, listen you people get hurt in this kind of weather.  So it breaks today, this afternoon we start to see a breaks.  We go from minus 27, I think we have a high today of minus four.  That's the heat wave that's coming our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DUFFY:  And if I can make one last point, Maria, I just watch through the 80s and 90s, I have pull up Instagram pictures of your throwback Thursday.  Huge fan when you're on other networks, I'm a huge fan of you here.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- I'm looking forward too.  If Dagen is up, so we're going to check out Dagen from back in the 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  You know, she has some big, you know, 80s hair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the throwback Thursday, yes.  Well, that picture that I posted in the Instagram is from 1985.  Post your picture, Congressman.  Thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  I got some really bad ones too.  I got big old -- yes.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you soon.  Sean Duffy joining us there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Midwest is facing the coldest temperatures in decades.  The extreme freeze is turning deadly.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice?</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  Yes.  Unfortunately, we're going to have one more day of this and then the cold air will start to retreat but you can see the windchill is most dangerous part of this cold air.  Is across the northern plains, the great lakes, now into the northeast where it feels like minus 13 in New York, it feels like zero in D.C. but minus 40 Fargo, minus 41 is what it feels like in Chicago.</p><p>Those incredible pictures coming out of Chicago of the rivers just freezing.  Green Bay, air temperature, minus 23, windchill minus 23, air temperature in Chicago by the way is minus 21 but it is the windchill that's potentially deadly.  That's why people are urged to stay indoors.  If you've got kids, if you got pets and you want to check on the elderly.  Today will be the really cold day and things will start to improve Friday.</p><p>But windchill advisories and warnings in place for millions of people where the windchill is anywhere from minus 25 to minus 60 especially across the northern plains in the upper Midwest.  OK.  So here is our polar vortex that is dipped as far south as the Tennessee River Valley, Ohio.  By Saturday it retreats up into Canada but we're not done yet heading into Monday.  We start to see it move southward again across the plain states across the great lakes.</p><p>So we're not done.  Now, this cold air, the really cold air is probably done for the season but we're still going to see below freezing temperatures as we get into next week.  But I will tell you as we head into the weekend, Maria, look at this, so minus one, today is the daytime high for Minneapolis but will be in the 40s by Sunday.  And then, Monday, things will start to come down again.</p><p>Here is Chicago where we are dealing with minus 40 degree windchills, by Saturday and Sunday even Monday, 53 degrees.  I mean, that is a 60-degree temperature difference from today and Monday.  So something we're going to have to watch.  These are weather extremes.  Certainly, we'll watch it.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Thanks so much.  Janice Dean with the latest there.  Coming up.  We are watching markets this morning on last trading day of the month today.  Busiest day for earnings.  Dow Industrials down 51, S&amp;P and NASDAQ up.  Next up, L.A. Dodgers pitcher turns stock broker, Ross Stripling in the house with his take on market action.</p><p>Then breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the path to the Super Bowl.  What he had to say right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets in focus this morning, futures indicating a mixed opening for the markets this morning on this.  The last trading day of the month.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 60 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher fractionally.  This after the major indices rallied yesterday big time after the Federal Reserve indicated it has done raising interest rates for now, it will be data dependent.</p><p>But the Dow Industrials were as high as 500 points, better than 500.  it ended up 434 on the Dow.  154 points higher on the NASDAQ.  Joining us right now is Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and B. Riley Wealth Management stock broker, Ross Stripling.  Ross, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, STOCK BROKER, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we got to talk sports but we want to first talk money.  Tell us what you think about what you heard from the Fed yesterday and how you're telling clients to allocate capital right now.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, that was definitely optimistic, you know, coming out and saying that, you know, our economy is growing, spending is strong, they're going to be patient moving forward with the -- with the rate hikes, you know, October, November, December were certainly ugly for me as a -- as a growth investor, you know, that got out of hand but, you know, I definitely think we got oversold.</p><p>And, you know, so we're kind of telling investors, you know, it's a good time to be patient and a good time to be, you know, long-term mined I think if you think back to January 2016,you know, it definitely got oversold in that month and then all the market did was rally 10,000 points over the next two years.  So, I think it's a good time to be patient, you're getting a good -- so you can get some good names at low valuations and obviously, get some of that money back lost that we lost late last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can we go to baseball questions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go for it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So -- I apologize, I didn't watch this when it happened but Wikipedia says, your very first major league start, you had no hitter into the 7th inning and you got pulled out.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So this is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  Thanks for bringing that back up.  No, I'm just kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Basically, the highs and lows of baseball in your first professional appearance.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I mean, man, if you just think about what goes into the -- to a debut of Major League Baseball, I mean, I was just so nervous that day and then to finally get up to game time and then to -- like you said, to be able to go over seven innings of no-hit baseball and then -- and then you get pulled.  I mean, it happens so fast, you know, and I certainly thought about it more since then that, you know, things that will never get to know how would have finished but I've always said that I understood the decision to pull me out.</p><p>I was coming off for Tommy John surgery, I've already thrown a hundred pitches, that was the most I've thrown in two years.  So, you know, we'll never know how it would have ended like I said but I've have always been open about understanding that decision and, you know, maybe I'll get another shot and no-hitter someday.</p><p>MINERD:  Hey, Ross, this is Mike Huckabee and one of the things that I'm most intrigue by is your use of data to prepare for ballgames.  It sounded like a real-life version of Moneyball in modern times.  So explain how do you collect the data and how do you go about using that to plan your own pitching strategy because I think that's fascinating.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Sure.  You know, I'll try and give you the shortest version of that question as possible.  And, you know, the Dodgers are probably kind of leading the way in all that, you know, analytics and things like that.  So we have a whole division that kind of gets the data for me and I mean, they can give you as much as you want and I -- at first when I got up I wanted it all, just give me all the data possible and I will just get what I want out of it.</p><p>But now, after three years, you know, you got to cut it down to what you want which is usually, you know, what guys slug in certain counts, what they hit the hardest, what's their biggest swing and missed pitch.  You can even look like what the man on second base, you know, do they get more aggressive.  There's just tons of data out there, so you kind of pick and choose what you want and use it when you're on the mound.</p><p>That way you're not just like boggled down with data while you're on the mound, you know, at the end of the day you just got to trust your ability to get major league hitters out but you want to use to it come up with a plan and each guy is different and you go over with your pitching coach and your catcher and all of that and you have a plan against every batter, one through nine for any situation and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  -- you know, that's kind of thought.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is really smart.  Let me ask you before you go, Ross, Super Bowl 53, three days away, who are you betting on?  Your hometown Rams or the Patriots?</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I got to go hometown Rams.  I think McVay have some up his sleeve that Bellatrix never seen and they made a lot of acquisitions in offseason on that defense, maybe they can get a big stop on Brady.  So I'll take the Rams.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Ross, great to have you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow, we'll bring you live coverage of the January jobs' report starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

Blake Burman is live this morning at the White House with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  Just one meeting among that group, 17 Democrats, Republicans trying to hash out a border security package, and already this morning, we are seeing a pretty big amount of frustration being expressed by President Trump.  Just moments ago, he sent out the following tweet about that group saying the following quote, \"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time.  Democrats, despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not goings to give money to build the desperately needed wall.  I've got you covered, wall is already being built, I don't expect much help.\"</p><p>You'll remember over the last few weeks as well as the President was trying to hash out a deal or at least Democrats and Republicans were, about securing wall funding that the President said, Well maybe we can call this steel slats or a physical barrier.  Doesn't need necessarily need to be called a wall.  He's backing off that today as well because he tweeted this this morning, \"Let's just call them wolves from now on, and stop political games, a wall is wall, give you a pretty good idea of where his mindset is after just one meeting from this group up on Capitol Hill.  Meantime, the Pentagon says that several thousand more troops are going to be heading to the Southern Border.  The Undersecretary for policy testifying up on Capitol Hill earlier this week that several caravans are headed north.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN C. ROOD, UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY:  Current information shows a caravan of over 12,000 people.  There's three that we are tracking, the Department of Homeland Security's tracking en route, and one of which is over 12,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Didn't get an exact number from the Pentagon, Maria.  Currently, there are 2,500 give or take active duty service members down at the Southern border.  That is down from a high of nearly 6,000, but the pentagon says several thousand more are headed that way.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the White House this morning.  Let's bring in Former New Mexico Governor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations, and Former Presidential Candidate, Bill Richardson.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much for joining us this day, this mooring.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean this whole idea of -- that they can't get together, on an agreement for the wall or for any kind of barrier, what do you think this means?  I mean is this going to be the next two years where the Congressional Democrats are constantly resisting everything the President wants?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, the first thing you need to do is the President needs to get off this idea that unless he gets his way, there's going to be a government shutdown.  That was very damaging to the country.  And I think to the President, too.  This is early.  Look, the early talks, did not go well yesterday.  But we got until February 15th.  You don't negotiate until the very end to get the best deal for both of you.  But, look, if there are more caravans, we're sending more troops.  I was a border governor, like Mike Huckabee, governors, we got to deal with these things directly.</p><p>What we need is more border detection equipment at the border crossings, Coast Guard needs to have more facilities.  You don't need a wall.  You go under a wall, over a wall, you have tunnels like El Chapo.  That's not going to solve the problem.  Let's have significant border security and agree on increase border patrol agents' budget --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, I want to -- I want to bring in Governor Huckabee in a moment, but you said we don't need a wall.  Are -- isn't it true though that in some border security agree on we need a wall.  For example, there is a wall in Nancy Pelosi state right now, which separates Tijuana and San Diego.  We're at the very dense area.  You've got three million people on one side of the Tijuana wall, and other three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear down that wall, isn't it -- doesn't it -- I mean do you think those people would just assimilate into the United States?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look, I'm not advocating tearing down what is existing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but you said we don't need a wall.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I'm saying that for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That wall worked.  Would you say that that will work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No.  Well, that deal does not -- or no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why not tear it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, it's -- no, it's not working.  It's not working.  It's that they have good border patrol agents, detection equipment, they know what they're doing ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would be OK tearing it down then?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- they have (INAUDIBLE) the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then you would be OK tearing it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Makes no difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think that the three million people on the Tijuana side would assimilate into the three million people in the San Diego (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, I don't.  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Without that wall?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't.  You're using scare tactics.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not scare -- I'm just saying the facts, sir.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Border enforcement -- no, no, no, you're not.  Those are not facts.  Border immigration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- illegal immigration has gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's gone down.  It's gone down.  Totally all across the border.  It's gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All I'm asking you is does that wall work to separate Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't think it makes much of a difference, but I'm saying leave it where it is.  But give them more resource, more border patrol agents detection equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think the President's just saying that as well.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Go in depth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, jump in here because I think that the President does want a wall in certain areas but in other areas said, you said that agrees with the Democrats in terms of technology and drones.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ambassador, you're one of my favorite democrats.  You know I love you, but I remember when Duncan Hunter was the one who put the appropriation in for that wall in San Diego, 95 percent of the drug trafficking stopped.  I'm looking at Israel.  They put up a wall, a security fence.  They were condemned for it, but they went from a thousand suicide bombers.  I agree that walls don't need to go for the entire border because there are certain y natural barriers, some electronics, but I just can't believe that people say that walls in certain places, whether it's a fence, whether it's a steel slat, just would not have an effect, and if that's true then we should tear down the 600 miles that we already have, and I don't know of anybody who realistically thinks that makes good sense.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, Mike, first of all, the tactics that are being used to get that wall, which I think is very dubious to build because I don't think it'll work and it's too expensive is that if the President doesn't get his way, he's going to shut down the government, and he's going to do harm to 800,000 Federal workers, businesses, and then this wall, Mike, I mean it's going to take landowners out of there, it's going to take ranchers, indigenous people, wildlife.  You're right, and most of the border, you can't build the wall because of the hills, because of the terrain, so --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Bill he has been very flexible in saying that it's a combination of all of those things, it's not just a wall.  But you say he's not been willing to give.  I've not seen Nancy Pelosi give one inch, not one inch, and he's offering DACA, he's offering all sorts of concessions, he's making compromise, but where -- tell  me exactly where Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer is offering any kind of concession or compromise.  I can't find it.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, they are offering significant funding increases in Border Enforcement and Detection Equipment, that will work, that will work, Mike.  And then the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's not just to answer President Trump.  That's because --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- says, \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down -- I'm going to shut down the government.  That is unprecedented, that is damaging the country.  Are we going to allow any President, they don't get their way, that the answer's got to be I'm going to down the go of year?  Mike you're a good politician.  You're my favorite Republican Politician.  This border shutdown was not good for the President for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, actually I think that the --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The country blinds him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when you look at the polls, the President really didn't get impacted very much.  Nancy Pelosi's approvals actually went down.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, I don't know what poll you're reading, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- and the President is tweeting -- wait.  Governor, the President just tweeting this morning --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't know what poll you're reading.  It was significant damage to the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning.  Let me tell you what he says.  He says, \"Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime.  Your reaction.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Oh, I mean this -- you know, he's into his campaign mode.  This is like when he says to his intelligence people that we spend over $20 billion in intelligence, CIA, NSA, Department of Defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that -- is that tweet incorrect?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- all of North Korea, they're my -- they're my buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that -- is that tweet inaccurate?  Wait, is that tweet inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally inaccurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate?  What's inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The whole thing.  The whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, late term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's like the President's saying to his intelligence fee --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- higher taxes?  Which one?  Later term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Open borders?  Wait, which one?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know, this is -- this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate, governor?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  This is ridiculous.  No.  Open borders?  That's ridiculous.  All of that is ridiculous.  There should be serious negotiations right now.  And it's not happening.  And the President's not helping with these tweets.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know the thing is?  I mean I know that a lot of your colleagues say that they're for border security, but they didn't vote for Kate's law, they didn't vote to end Sanctuary Cities, they didn't vote for a border wall, so how can you say you're for border security when you actually haven't done so in terms of your voting record?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look at what the Democrats are proposing for this showdown, one, more border patrol agents, two, more Coast Guard assistance, three, more drones, four, all kinds of new technologies that will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they voted for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  A border wall is not going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they vote --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did Nancy Pelosi vote for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That -- perhaps that wall she voted for on her border.  All I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is that not immoral?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- let's make this work.  Let's make this work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  But not threaten border shutdowns, not end the government working, that's what the President is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  All right.  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook reporting a record profit.  The stock is soaring this morning.  Joining me now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, good morning, Maria.  You know, I wasn't looking at that profit report for the profit number or profit margin, I was looking at it to see how many active monthly users they've got.  When I saw that number come over, 2.7 billion, I figured that Facebook was out of the woods.  Think of all the scandal, all the bad publicity, all the privacy questions that have been leveled against Facebook in the last, what, year or six months?  It--- it's not touched their business.  I thought that the scandal may have reduced the number of monthly users, active users on the -- on the base, but it didn't.  They've actually increased.  And that's why I think Facebook is up so much this morning, 11 percent gain for a stock like that is absolutely enormous.  My bottom line is this, all the scandal did not touch its financial business.  The heart of its business was not touched by all the political goings-on around it.  Facebook, 167.  Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible.  You're right, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It really is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis.

I grew up literally in public housing in the projects.  And I have succeeded in America I always thought that was something to be celebrated, that my success should not be something that is punitive.  My success is living proof of the promise of the country.  I can't find the answers why people are all of a sudden chastising me for being successful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Many Democrats are caffeinated against him, criticizing Schultz over his potential presidential run saying he will only help to reelect President Trump.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Listen, I'm looking at this.  We are celebrating throwback Thursday this morning.  We're showing you our best looks from the 80s, that's next stay, with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is throwback Thursdays here on the MORNINGS WITH MARIA set.  Here's me from circa 19857.  I was working in a photo lab, printing pictures.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I told you, Sophia Loren.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Care-free days.  I don't even know that I was thinking about what stock to buy.  I don't even know that I was thinking about me being a journalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at this complexion.  This is even before -- well, it's before the internet really, but the no photo filters, you're glowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see yours, Dagen McDowell.  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I told you I'm really ugly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do they have it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, Governor Huckabee with his daughter.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, there I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's Dagen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I jumped in a swimming pool fully clothed right after that was taken.  And I am not making that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is about 1980 --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  88.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  88.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the summer after my freshman year in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Huckabee with your daughter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.  Aww.  That is too cute.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's about 1984.  She was about two years old at that time.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So great.  That's beautiful shot.  And lastly, the photo James Freeman gave us.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so this is me.  You asked for a throwback --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- Thursday photo of James Freeman.  Apparently, this is the Reverend James Freeman.  Apparently, he was an outstanding preacher.  Governor, you might want to grade his performance, I don't know, but very influential in Boston.  My kids ran across this a few weeks ago while sightseeing, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You couldn't find any shots of yourself as a baby.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I -- well, I did -- if you give me more time, I'll try and find it.  But I told you, I never went with the mullet.  My great regret, so I don't know if we're going to have really fun 80s photos, but I'll do my best.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  Deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday, we'll do another throwback Thursday, how's that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You got to let me know in advance and so we I can dig some photos out of my -- well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So we have a week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- drawer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we didn't even talk about this.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke publicly for the first time about that blatant non-call in the NFC Championship game.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God, you're lucky the game has been great in the last year, Goodell, because you're terrible and people hate you.  No more than --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, people hate him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us how you really feel.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  What do you really think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, let's call some folks down in New Orleans and ask them how they feel.  Anyway.  No, they do, people don't -- excuse me, they don't like him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.  Hey, you've got a neat throwback Thursday shots you want to share, Stu?</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2174418430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMR-VNR1-JBHT-D4KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

And good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Thursday, it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Busy morning on earnings this morning.  We will hear from UPS, General Electric, both ahead of the open this morning.  Big technology still in focus, Facebook reporting last night after the close, big quarter for Facebook, Amazon will be the one to watch today after the close tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the arctic blast turns deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their lowest levels in decades.  We will take you to the Minneapolis region this morning, where the negative 24 degrees is having a real impact.  The push to tax the wealthy, J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly saying that the richest Americans can afford to pay higher taxes, but there's a catch.  Then, Roger Goodell breaking his silence, what he said about the infamous no-call during the NFC championship game coming up later this hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we kick it off with markets this morning.  Let's check Futures showing a mixed opening this morning after a huge day yesterday.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 15 points at the open.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ up fractionally right now after a solid day of trading that all stock surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell signaled that the Central Bank may pause interest rate hikes for now.  The Fed on pause.</p><p>Technology giant, Facebook, meanwhile also reporting fourth-quarter earnings.  Look at that market yesterday, up 434 points at the close, it was a big day.  And that, by the way, was off of the highs of the day after the Fed meeting.  Facebook earnings beat expectations posting a record profit for what has been a difficult year for the social media company.  Take a look at Facebook shares this morning, up 11-1/3 percent right now, 167 and change.  Earnings season rolling on today with Amazon reporting after the bell tonight.  Take a look at all the names that we're expecting today in what is really the busiest week -- one of the busiest weeks for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Here now, the founder of Disruptive Technology Research Lou Basenese.  Lou, it's good to see you.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on Facebook, your reaction to the quarter last night.</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, I am just shocked and disappointed in this rally.  I mean, I think this is really putting forward that investors and management favor profit growth over ethics.  I mean, look, this week, we had -- I think one of the -- just biggest disappointments in privacy protection with the Facebook research app.  I mean, just total disregard for Apple's wishes, total disregard for teenage users' privacy, and yet, investors are cheering profit growth.  So, look, I can't argue with the fundamental numbers.  I mean, the stock is reasonably valued, you've seen growth come back in the U.S. as the key market, and advertisers just don't have any other outlet, any other alternative to reach 2 billion potential viewers.  So, it's one of those things, it's a toxic investment, to me.  So, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you wouldn't touch it?</p><p>BASENESE:  I wouldn't touch it.  Look, I think there's a lot of risk embedded there.  What's the next privacy scandal that's going to come to light?  Facebook, over the years, has really made more excuses than changes to what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let's talk about the Fed -- the Fed essentially on hold yesterday saying it's on hold, indicating that more dovish stance when it comes to interest rate hikes.  What was your reaction to what the Fed said in particular also saying that the balance sheet unwind is also a way that they could pull back and perhaps stop the 50 billion sales a month.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, I don't think I can remember in my lifetime just a more dramatic turn of sentiment at the Fed.  I mean, in October, they were saying that we're a long way from neutral and now, yesterday's statement said that we're within range.  I mean, they went from playing hardball with the President to playing patty cake, and you know, investors love that.  So, you know, more easy monetary policy coming.  I think they gave themselves some flexibility on unwinding the balance sheet.  Not that they didn't say that they were going to be data dependent before, but now they just made that much more of a point to communicate to the markets that there's not going to be a fast and hard unwind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we were sort of expecting this in the last couple of months, that's for sure.  But would this be a signal for you to put new money to work in stocks?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think absolutely.  Look, the Fed has been supportive of stock prices.  I mean, there's a lot of people that would argue this bull market would not be around without the Fed.  So, with the Fed being very accommodative, I think it's time to come back into the market, we're going to see that.  You've seen a dramatic reversal even in the more speculative areas of the market.  And I think I pointed out before in another appearance that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tremendous bounce off the lows, up almost 20 percent, and about to breakthrough to the 200-day moving average.  So, yes, it's risk on again.  At least to the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Two more things on stocks, we've got earnings, obviously, the middle in -- we're in the middle of a very busy period.  DowDupont just reported they beat on earnings per share at $0.88 a share but they missed on revenue at 20.1 billion versus an estimate of 20.9 billion, how would you characterize the earnings season so far, and what does that telling you about the backdrop?</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, it's a mixed bag.  We haven't really seen a huge beat rate on the earnings on the bottomline.  I think the top like is being less impressive.  So, on DuPont's report, it's epitomizing it, right?  We're seeing some earnings growth but the demand on the top line is not there.  So, look, I think we're in more of a stock picker's market.  It points more towards active management and really trying to find those companies that are overcoming the China hangover that are finding strength despite some pockets of weakness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a focus is economic data for you?  We've got the January job's report out Friday morning, tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We are expecting 165,000 jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9 percent.  We had the ADP numbers earlier this week, they were strong.</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes.  No, they're very strong.  Look, I'm a tech guy first, but I'd love to see tailwinds and the job's market supporting that.  I think many people thought we might have a slowdown just because of the government shutdown, and just that extreme volatility in December that might have put some businesses a little uneasy about hiring.  But the ADP Report like you mentioned this week, pointing to just continued strength, so another positive for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you're thinking we're going to get a pretty good year, 2019.</p><p>BASENESE:  As of now -- look, a lot can change, I mean, look what happened in December.  So, I don't want to go on the record and say it's a -- it's a foregone conclusion 2019 is going to be great, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you've got put money to work either way, so what do you do?</p><p>BASENESE:  I think -- I put money to work.  Look, I like the semiconductor industry particularly companies like NXP, really undervalued at about 11 times earnings.  And the chipmakers are going to make this world go, from here into the future.  About a trillion semiconductors shipped last year.  They go into every big growth trend that you can think of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess.  I mean, even more so with 5G on the way.  Lou, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lou Basanese joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow morning.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January job's report beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  We've got our \"JOBS IN AMERICA\" special where we identify where the jobs are right now.  Meanwhile, Amazon earnings after the bell, the company poking fun in its own Alexa devices for going haywire in this year's Super Bowl ad.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Your take on that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I love Super Bowl ads, and Amazon is advertising during the big game for the fourth straight year, two spots including part of this one, we're going to show you a 90-second spot with some popular names.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But trust me, there are a lot of fails.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Like what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Like --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Alexa, play my podcast.</p><p>ALEXA:  When you heard that, did that surprise (INAUDIBLE) that seems exciting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need an Alexa dog collar.  Four dogs.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering dog food, ordering dog food.</p><p>HARRISON FORD, ACTOR:  You can bark all you want, I'm not paying for any more dog food.</p><p>ALEXA:  Ordering gravy.  Ordering sausages.</p><p>FORD:  Hey, you better cancel that order.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa hot tub sucked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Alexa, play music.  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, that's just a little bit of a snippet of that ad, Maria.  Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker among the well-known celebrities in that ad.  Just that 90-second spot will set Amazon back more than $15 million, $5 million per 30-second spot for Super Bowl ads.  This is a little ironic because Amazon has really ramped up spending on national television advertising, you know, a real innovator in terms of online advertising, streaming video, but Amazon spends every year now on national T.V. advertising, $680 million a year, that's about doubled from 2015.  It spends more than Toyota and even McDonalds every year on T.V. ads.  Why the Super Bowl?  Do we even need to tell you, more than 100 million people are going to watch this, and it has a very diverse viewing base, about 47 percent of the viewers last year ladies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we watch for the commercials or do we watch for the game?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The game.  The game always.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both, I'm both.  That commercial really resonated though with the dog ordering everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who doesn't love Harrison Ford.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you.  We will keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deadly polar vortex sweeping through the Midwest.  Lauren Simonetti with the details on that.  Lauren, it is cold there.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It is cold.  And speaking of Amazon, they're not delivering in some Midwest cities because it is so cold, but at least -- this is deadly, at least nine people have died in causes related to the historic -- this historic arctic blast when 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.  Windchill temperatures falling to minus 50 degrees in Chicago.  And near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.</p><p>According to FlightAware, since yesterday, there have been more than 21,000 flight delays and more than 6,000 cancellations.  Seven people stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were around minus four degrees with windchill of minus 30.  Coastguard officials say the seven people were near Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, but couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>Some General Motors plants in Michigan halting production due to the extremely cold weather and also a shortage of natural gas following a fire at a compressor station.  A dozen plants affected and all the utility there.  Also, asking customers to please reduce their use of natural gas, but there is such demand at this time of year.  Let's take a look at shares of G.M. down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And then, there's this, firefighters battling a massive blaze at an historic factory in New Jersey below freezing temperatures.  The Marcal Paper plant burning overnight, the bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out, as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries fortunately reported here.  It is unclear how this fire started.  The paper factory is 86 years old.  It survived several fires in the past.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, even in the face of that cold weather, fire burning wildly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lauren, thanks.  Coming up, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon now saying he has no problem with the wealthiest Americans paying even more taxes.  There is a catch, though, we're going to bring you what he said.  Then, breaking his silence, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no-call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.  But the Saints player and a coach weigh in on Goodell and the controversy.  All ahead right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining us, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Member, Sean Duffy, is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N. and former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson, is with us.  FanDuel CEO Matthew King join us ahead of the Super Bowl.  And PopSockets Founder, CEO David Barnett joining us as well.  The Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and stockbroker Ross Stripling is with us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>We kick it off here with this, paying your fair share, the push from the far left getting reaction from corporate America now.  J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, reportedly saying that he is willing to pay higher taxes that the wealthiest Americans can afford to pay more.  He also said that those dollars, though, need to be spent wisely by the government.  Here's what he told me earlier this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on what we're hearing now from, for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  She says she think that the top-end of earners should pay as high as 70, 80 percent tax rates?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE:  Yes.  Look, I -- you know, I always separate the corporate side, the business side, which I think we need it to be competitive with the individual side.  And so, you know, people have all different theories, but individual side would maximize returns and stuff like that.  So, I'm not -- I don't get involved in that debate because I'll leave that to politicians.  That is actually less important for economic growth than the business side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The top 10 percent already pay 80 percent of all the tax.</p><p>DIMON:  They do.  But in America, you have to look at tax (INAUDIBLE) I mean, a lot of payroll tax are aggressive, sales tax are aggressive, real estate tax are aggressive.  So, you look at the big picture, anyone would say, we should relook at this and make it better and more efficient and fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us this morning, Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, is here along with former Arkansas Governor, Republican Presidential Candidate, Mike Huckabee, great to see you, guys.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Wonderful to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  Your reaction to Jamie Dimon.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He can pay all the taxes he wants.  There's not a thing in the federal code that prohibits him from writing a check to the federal government.  If he's feeling guilty that he's not paying enough, do it.  When I was governor, I did a fund called the \"tax me more fund\" because a bunch of legislators kept saying we need to raise taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So I had envelopes printed and everywhere I went to make a speech, I pass them out, and said, you don't think you're paying enough, send it in, as much as you want until you feel better.  In two years, we raised $1168, a thousand, which was given by one Democrat legislator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is good.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Because nobody wants to pay more taxes.  They say they do but they don't.  That's just a lie.  And so, this nonsense that I'd like to pay more taxes, do it, go ahead, be the first, write the check then prove it to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's -- there's just such a range of the ultra-rich, somebody like Jamie Dimon with $1 billion, somebody like a Warren Buffett with, what, $45 billion to other rich people as well with, what, $250,000 or $1 million, right?  So, the range is so huge.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, he's close to -- at his age, he's close to retirement so he doesn't really need to worry about income taxes that much.  Ask him about the Elizabeth Warren wealth tax, where she's going to come and confiscate his money.  How does he feel about that?  Because by the way, if he's talking about income taxes, half of this country doesn't pay any income taxes, and any net income taxes.  So, our Defense Department isn't funded by half this country.  Education at the federal level not funded by half this country.  Somebody has got to pay.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Top one percent as you alluded to in the interview, currently paying more than the bottom 90 percent combined in terms of federal income taxes.  But this is really about how you distribute wealth.  Let's think about growth, let's think about how to get everyone making more instead of how to take it from some people, but I think he does raise a good question, which is -- isn't really better for our society if we take more from Jamie Dimon and give it to the government, and the question of who's going to invest it better, random government agency or Jamie Dimon, who probably perhaps puts it in to public companies, maybe he invests in financial technology start-ups.  I think the track record would say Jamie Dimon is probably going to invest that money better than a Washington bureaucracy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You got to be kidding, James, you mean to tell me --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Controversial statement, I know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- that you think Washington would squander money after we send it to them?  Well, I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  Such --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, and I think the shutdown --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- stewards of our tax money.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think the shutdown really raises questions about whether the federal bureaucracy is currently overstaffed as we -- as we think about spending.  It took a long time for most people to notice an impact and it was basically when the essential workers started furloughing themselves at TSA gates.  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the air traffic controllers, really, that caused the problems over the -- over the weekend.  I just want to point that out.  But again, it's appalling to make people work and not pay them, I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's get to now the 2020 line-up because Howard Schultz and other wealthy business guys, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Fox News yesterday, telling Dana Perino that President Trump should not be taking credit for the strength of the economy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the reduction in the corporate tax rate of 21 percent was wrong and irrational.  He missed a massive opportunity for comprehensive tax reform.  But if you look at the facts, the facts are 40 percent of the American people do not have $400 in the bank.  5 million young people in America, mostly Black and Latino are not in school and not in work.  One out of six Americans are food insecure.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Yes.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  So, no, I don't give him, the President credit for any of that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHULTZ:  And I do not give him credit for saying for two years that the stock market is proxy for the economy.  He is going to fall on his sword for that because that economy is not going to last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, your reaction.  Wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know how you argue that the higher growth in the Trump presidency during the Trump era is unrelated to his policies of cutting taxes and regulation.  I understand Mr. Schultz is a Democrat now thinking of running as Independent.  He's sort of charting a middle course, he's saying Trump doesn't get credit for the company, while also saying Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax is a bad idea.  But I think on this count he's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, it's crazy to actually look at what has happened in 2018 with the growth numbers and not tie it to not just the tax cuts but also the deregulation, the policies of the Trump administration did move the needle on growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can take the other side of that.  I think it's pretty clear that what the Federal Reserve has been doing is really what has propped up the stock market in a major way, and you saw the rally yesterday now that interest rates are on hold.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the last couple of months.  But I'm talking about 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we are in a position where we're not going to keep growing at three percent right now for myriad reasons, whether it's the global economic slowdown, or problems here at home.  But according to the Wall Street Journal survey of economists conducted this week, we're now below two percent growth in the first quarter and at 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter.  So, right now, we don't look like we can sustain that three percent growth number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's a guess.  That's an estimate, we should point out.  We'll get the hard data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I don't think there is a reason we can't continue to grow at three percent.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but the big mistake Schultz made was that he dried to say I won't go after the Republican voters.  And then he insulted Republicans by saying that tax cuts and deregulation really don't matter.  Ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We got to talk about the Federal Reserve coming up and what did the Fed say yesterday.  Then, justice for Senator Rand Paul, he's awarded damages after being attacked by his neighbor in 2017.  We will tell you how much money is coming to him.  Then, sky high entertainment, we'll tell you how competition is heating up between airlines over who's keeping their passengers entertained better.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America this morning.  The Lexington Herald-Leader calling out the Kentucky Governor for saying, \"America is weak for closing schools during the polar vortex.\"  Governor Matt Bevin also said, \"We're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in a fetal position somewhere in a warm place.\"  He did add that he was being a little facetious.  The Star Tribune in Minnesota writing this morning about how veterans are suing saying 3M combat earplugs caused hearing injuries.  At least 11 lawsuits by that have filed -- have been filed this month against the company, accusing of knowingly selling defective earplugs for use in combat.  This is after 3M had already paid $9.1 million to settle government allegations.</p><p>The L.A. Times taking a look at the in-flight entertainment arms race in a tight competition for flyers, airlines stepping up their free offerings.  The article details how airlines are trying to one-up each other from United's free T.V. on some of its planes through American Airlines free T.V. and Apple music.  I haven't seen any of this, what about you, James?  Dagen?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, at what point in the -- at what temperature should kids not have to walk to school?  I don't know.  I'm not sure the governor -- you don't -- you don't necessarily need to swing at every pitch.  I think Mr. Huckabee could tell us about this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I've swung at a few I wished I hadn't, absolutely.  Matt Bevin is a great governor.  I'm going to be with him Saturday night in Elizabethtown, in fact, so I'll pass along your sentiments.  But I think it's one of those things that he said in not so much specifically about the vortex, just that as a whole, we are as a country, raising softer kids, and I think that's probably an assessment.  In the context of how cold it was yesterday, maybe the timing, you know, is not perfect, but I think I understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, right, left, or middle of the road, as a nation, we've lost the ability to shut up and say nothing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're like virtue signaling about everything and looking for validation based on a retweet, whether it's by the President himself or Alyssa Milano.  That's how we get out -- that's how we derive our self-worth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  We have 250 channels on television plus satellite and internet, 168 hours a week and something has got to fill up that space.  So, that's where we are as a culture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And gone is the lowly book.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe the kids should go out in that weather but get medals for it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  For participating in --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pat on the back for that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Everybody gets a trophy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the Russia probe, President Trump is reportedly leaving the Mueller report decision in the hands of the Department of Justice.  We'll tell you about what went down yesterday.  And then a big day for earnings, G.E. set to hit the tape in just a few minutes.  We will have the numbers for you, and take a look at how it's impacting markets.  The stock is up two percent ahead of the report.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>General Electric just coming out, and the earnings are below expectations.  The stock right now is higher in the premarket.  Company's reporting $0.17 cents a share, versus an estimate of $0.22 cents a share, as you can see.  Stock at $9.21 a share, we'll keep watching this as we dig through these numbers.</p><p>More big names reporting today, UPS, ConocoPhillips, MasterCard, out later this morning, we'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Revenue on G.E. is better-than-expected at $33.28 billion versus an estimate of $32.6 billion.</p><p>So, maybe that's what's really moving the stock this morning, revenue, better-than-expected on General Electric.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning, take a look at markets, we are expecting a flat opening right now, after a monster rally yesterday, Dow Industrials unchanged, S&amp;P 500 up 3 points, and the NASDAQ up 28.  The major indices tacked on big gains yesterday after the fed said that it was on hold, in terms of raising interest rates for the foreseeable Future.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 435 points at the close, one and three quarters of a percent, and that was off of the highs of the day.  The S&amp;P 500 finished up 41, that was 1-1/2 percent higher, the NASDAQ was up 154 points, the Fed signaling that maybe, maybe, two rate hikes come this year, but it was all dependent on the data.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices look like this, as you see, higher across the board, FT 100 up 43 points, two-thirds of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 13, a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index up nine points, fractional move, in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, mostly higher, as you see there, best performer, Hong Kong and Japan, up better than one percent a piece.</p><p>Back in the U.S., Arctic conditions have left at least nine people dead, nearly 15,000 flights have been cancelled or delayed due to the weather, and the polar vortex bringing a phenomenon to the skies.  We've got the details, coming up.</p><p>Then, justice for Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator has been awarded damages after he was attacked by his neighbor, we'll tell you how much.</p><p>Plus, breaking his silence, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Whenever officiating is part of any kind of discussion, post gate, is never a good outcome for us.  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the road to the Super Bowl.</p><p>We are getting a first look at General Electric earnings this morning, it is a mixed report, $0.17 cents a share is weaker than the estimated $0.22 cents a share, but the revenue is much higher than estimated, $33.28 billion on revenue for the fourth quarter, on General Electric.</p><p>Joining us right now is Pacer ETFs Distributors President, Sean O'Hara, and it is good to see you, Sean.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETF'S DISTRIBUTORS:  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll go in to some of the flows and what you're seeing in terms of ETFs, how would you characterize the earning season, give us your take on the backdrop, so far?</p><p>O'HARA:  I think the backdrop is sort of like what we talked about last time I was here, which is you're starting to see a little bit of a slowing in terms of the earnings.  So, we got a little bit spoiled, perhaps, in 2018, we're such, you know, meteoric, if you will, earnings growth, 20, 25, 26, 28 percent.</p><p>And now, we're getting into a phase in the market where, you know -- it's just not sustainable to continue to do that.  So, I think we're adjusting to what's going on with regard to earnings more than anything.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, maybe if expectations have been set too low, we've been, sort of, discussing whether the U.S. can hit three percent growth again, this year, I mean, what does it -- what does it mean if we are growing at three percent?  Are these -- are these stocks cheap at this point?</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't know that stocks are necessarily cheap.  If we get to 3 or 3-1/2 or 4 percent, then I think they're cheap.  And I think that's the big wild card.  Are we going to get that kind of economic growth, particularly since we don't really know yet what the effect on the economy is going to be to shut down?</p><p>I mean, this was not a normal shutdown.  This was not like three or four days until they argue, and then somebody gave in, this was over a month.  And so, there's going to be some effect.  I just don't think we know exactly what it is yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of the Federal Reserve, yesterday, on hold at this point, even talking, as we expected, Dagen, about the balance sheet, possibly pulling back on the -- on the unwind as well.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes, I mean, there was -- there's generally been three, like, headwinds, if you will, for the market, one was what's the fed going to do, one was trade in China, and then the third is the slowing earnings thing that we talked about.</p><p>What I saw yesterday and what I think I heard yesterday, everybody sort of hears their own interpretation of what's going on.  But what I heard is, is that the Fed is going to be more accommodative than they have been, as far as their posture is going forward.</p><p>I don't know if that's reaction to the stock market, I don't know if that's a reaction to something they see with regard to earnings or the economy.  But I think one of those headwinds was essentially removed yesterday from what people's expectations are, going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will raise this issue.  Clearly, investors love what they heard from the Federal Reserve.  But it was a complete about-face from what they've said six weeks ago.  And at some point, do investors start wringing their hands about the economy, about economic growth around the globe, and even here at home.</p><p>We've seen weak growth in France and Germany, that's the story in the Wall Street Journal today.  Will you have a different reaction in the days ahead, when people really digest whoa, what is Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve see, in the months, in the year to come, in the U.S. economy?</p><p>O'HARA:  I mean, of the three things we've talked about, the Fed, trade in China and earnings, clearly to me, the earnings piece of it is the most important part.  That's what drives stock prices from a fundamental perspective is what are they making in terms of earnings, from free cash flow.</p><p>So, I think that's the big one, but I think if you're a little bit of a skeptic and you wanted -- you want to be a little bit more intellectually curious, if you will, I think what you would do is you would do what you're doing, Dagen, and say I wonder what they know that they're not telling us yet, because they really have made a pretty remarkable change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I would say in the last couple of weeks, I think it became clear that we were seeing real issues in Europe and China -- I mean, you know, whether it'd be France, the budget issues in Italy, Brexit and the uncertainty in the U.K.</p><p>So, we knew, going into the Fed meeting that Europe was slowing and China growth has slowed.  And in fact, I think it was becoming more and more well-known that the Federal Reserve had pivoted.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, you said you were stunned in the commercial break.  I wasn't stunned by yesterday's -- I mean, I wasn't stunned, at all, actually.  I was expecting the Federal Reserve to tell us they were on hold.</p><p>O'HARA:  Well, I don't think they said they were -- what I said I was stunned by was, how aggressive I feel like Powell was, in his position, saying that we will use anything we have, including the balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>O'HARA:  That was the new one.  It's always been about ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think what Dagen --</p><p>O'HARA:  -- the balance sheet came in to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What Dagen is saying is, the backdrop, what the Fed is recognizing, is what we -- what we are starting to understand better.  And that is we're talking about a slowdown.  We're looking at a slowdown and that is -- we don't live in a vacuum.  Of course, the U.S. is going to be impacted.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why you weren't surprised, because of your interview with Ray Dalio and your ongoing interviews with Ray Dalio and what he said.  What did he say last week?  That the Federal Reserve is not going to raise this year and could cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- or do something with balance sheet to be more accommodated.  That's what they said.  But I don't think that the rest of the market has quite digested that.  They need to go back and watch your Ray Dalio interview.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and all interviews in Davos last week.  It was pretty much unanimous that we're facing a U.S. slowdown.  What wasn't unanimous was how steep it might be.  Look, G.E. and debt, the company's debt is now over $100 billion.  The Journal is reporting if G.E. were to sell its jet leasing business, it could eliminate up to $40 billion in corporate debt.</p><p>G.E. capital owns and leases thousands of planes and helicopters to carriers around the world.  The stock is up two and a quarter percent, I don't know.  The earnings, amiss, but I guess people like the fact that the revenue is better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and this is --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And low expectations for this company --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That too.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- and stocks, generally.  By the way, I'm not sure the Fed has changed all that much.  What we are seeing is this is the Jay Powell strategy of we're not going to let locked into a long-term plan, we're going to watch the data, as you said, the market signals lately, have been bad, inflation lately, signals that it's mild.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm not sure we --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But at the end of the fourth quarter, they were on auto pilot.  They were like, $50 billion a month, three rate hikes, right?  So that is where the pivot is that I'm referring to.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  But I don't think it means we're not getting rate hikes this year.  If the economy grows faster than the consensus, and I happen to think it probably will, then you could see some rate hikes.  But they're saying we're watching the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They might not hike at all, like Ray Dalio said, they might end up cutting, because from the last hike to the first cut, it's as usually a six-month period, granted they need to slow down the balance sheet reduction before they do that.</p><p>One thing I want to note, to connect the G.E., the level of debt there, and what the Federal Reserve did, that's why the market was freaking out when the Fed was continuing to move a quarter point every three months, or every -- because of the level of indebtedness of corporations, the level of indebtedness of the United States and individuals in this country.</p><p>We are a nation that can't handle even three percent short-term rates and that should be frightening to people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you've said that a lot, actually, Sean O'Hara, great to see you.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining.  We didn't even mentioned your INDS, which Kevin Kelly wanted us to, up 14 percent year to date, using money flows into some cooler ETFs.</p><p>O'HARA:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Sean.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Turning to the Mueller report this morning, President Trump says he will leave the decision up to the Department of Justice, according to the Daily Caller exclusive.  Joining us now is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Chris, good to see you this morning.  Thanks for joining us.  You have an exclusive interview with President Trump, tell us what you learned.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER:  We learned that he's going to keep his hands off of the Department of Justice, for the Mueller report and how to handle that.  He's going to leave the ball in that court.  We learned that he's very concerned about some bigotry in the Democratic Party.</p><p>We talked to him about the new fight yesterday with Governor Northam about abortion.  These are -- and we also learned something very interested to think it's been a little bit under pledge so far, that he's going to put an end to any potential deal that's been reported out on the ninth circuit, on allowing Democratic judges to be re-nominated on the ninth circuit.</p><p>He said he's going to put an end to that deal and try to stack the ninth circuit with judges who are more in line with President Trump's view of how they should be.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think that's an important point you just made, Christopher, because of all the things that the President is doing that even his critics have to appreciate, I'm talking about his Republican critics, is that he is reshaping the judiciary to a constructionist point of view, and if he were to reneged on that, I think it would be disastrous for him and frankly, disastrous for the entire country.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think anyone on the right will certainly agree with that.  He had -- that's one of the major accomplishments he's made, and there's still a lot more that they can do.  There are currently more vacancies in the court than they were when he took office.</p><p>There's a lot more that Mitch McConnell can be doing to pushing this and moving it faster.  But one thing that -- one thing that is certain is, with the control of the Senate, the GOP has really no incentive to give any leeway on this, the ninth circuit has been thorn on the side of the administration over and over and over again --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  -- and to make any deal like the Wall Street Journal reported would not be in the benefit to the President.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Chris, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal, I don't know if you've covered this with the President, but related to these various probes, investigations, did he give any indication that he's thinking or planning to release more documents, declassify more documents, get the full story out about the 2016 election and how our government came to spy on people affiliated with this campaign.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We were pretty careful when we pushed him on the issue.  He said over and over again, that he was going to leave the decisions, for now, to his Department of Justice.  The ball was on their court.  He was hoping that they made the right decisions, but that he was going to allow them to make them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sort of the big -- the big cojones, if you will.  Maybe he's wait to release the declassified documents when another opportunity arises where he needs to offset some investigation there, because there are a lot of investigations that are unwinding right now from the Democrats in Congress.  Did he say anything about that?  What his strategy is, in the face of all of these investigations?</p><p>BEDFORD:  So far, he doesn't need to make any moves right now.  He appeared last night when we were speaking to him to be more hands off on this matter.  But he can make any decision he wants to when it regards to declassification --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: -- or, at least, a report later on.  There's no need for him to cause a tizzy in the Congress.  And we've seen the executive branch has been lawyering up as the Democrats prepare for investigations.  Those are coming either way, but he hasn't -- he didn't show his cards too strongly on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford from the Daily Caller, there.  Coming up, breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, finally addressing the controversial no-call that pushed the Rams into the Super Bowl finals.</p><p>And a rare sun phenomenon appears in the Midwest.  Check this out, after one of the coldest weather snaps in decades, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Justice for Senator Rand Paul after a brutal attack.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A Kentucky jury, Maria, awarding Senator Paul more than $580,000 in damages in his lawsuit against his neighbor who attacked him in 2017.  Earlier this month, the Republican senator sat down with you, Maria, talking about his injuries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I had six broken ribs, three of them broken and then separated so they were round upon each other for months until they healed.  I had pneumonia twice, I had fluid around my lung and now I have hernia (INAUDIBLE) repaired from this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The senator says, the verdict sends a clear message that violence is not the answer.  The neighbor's lawyer says, they will appeal.</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaking publicly for the very first time about the blatant non-call in the NFC championship game.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODELL:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Goodell says, he spoke with Saints players about that play.  But one player denies that and says, he hasn't heard from Goodell at all.  Well, the Saints coach, Sean Payton, may not be buying what Goodell is saying either.  Twitter pointing out that, at a recent press conference, Sean Payton appeared to be wearing a t-shirt that shows Roger Goodell dressed as a clown.  There you go -- the comparison.  Either way, the Super Bowl, without the Saints, is just three days away and our very own Cheryl Casone will have live coverage from Atlanta starting tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And to the weather outside, the polar vortex bringing a rare weather effect to parts of the Midwest and plains -- and it's pretty beautiful, called the Sundog.  It happens when ice crystals in the atmosphere interact with sunlight in a certain way.  More Sundogs are expected in the Midwest as this deep freeze continues for a little bit longer, but what a pretty picture in the sky.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's very pretty.  Thank you, Lauren.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor and I both tell Lauren how to say Sundog -- Sundog.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Sundog.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Get it right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, corn dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, winter weather gripping the nation, as you just heard.  We will take you live to Minneapolis next.  And then, an eye on earnings this morning, big day for energy companies.  Plus, Amazon announces its quarterly numbers after the bell; we have got the preview back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are talking about the deadly polar vortex.  The Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades.  Ray Bogan is in Minneapolis this morning with the very latest where the temperature is negative 25-degrees, Ray.</p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning, it is very cold here.  You know, it was supposed to be about 0-degrees today, forecasted to be at one point.  However, it's not, just a couple of minutes ago, actually, it got even colder.  It is now negative 30-degrees.  I just saw a picture of the thermometer at the National Weather Service here in Minneapolis.  We're at the Minneapolis Airport where all morning planes have been taking off and landing throughout the week.  They've had relatively few cancellations and delays, they've been lucky in that way, but that has not been the case around the Midwest where there have been thousands of cancellations and delays.  The worst of those being at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports.  A few people have gotten stranded as a result of all of -- all of this.</p><p>Now, take a look at some of these record low temperatures.  It's been freezing out in Chicago.  They had negative 23-degrees, that's the lowest since 1985.  In Minneapolis, we had a reading of negative 28 -- that was the lowest since 1996 and in Des Moines, Iowa, they set a new daily record low of negative 20-degrees.  And you could see, it's having a big impact on nature too.  This is Lake Geneva in Wisconsin, a beautiful lake during the summer time where you can go boating, eat at restaurants along the shore but now it is frozen over.  That is definitely not happening, but on Sunday, there's the possibility that here in Minneapolis, it could be 75-degrees warmer than it is right now and people are looking forward to it.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's incredible that we are talking about these temperatures now.  But next week, they go all the way back up.  Ray, thanks very much for braving the cold for us and showing us, really, firsthand what it's like out there.  Ray Bogan is live in Minneapolis.  We felt the cold this morning even in New York, and it's only what -- it was one-degree when you scale it out.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think Governor Bevin would be proud of Ray for doing that report outside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I thought Ray was getting ready to rob a 7Eleven, the way he was dressed.  I wasn't sure.  You know, it's cold.  I flew it from Florida yesterday to come to here.  And I'm thinking why, what was I thinking?  What's wrong with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why.  This is why you're in Virginia?  I mean, in New York?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank God you're not doing this show outdoors today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we wouldn't do that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, when you were in Davos, how cold was it?  It was like five-degrees.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was five or 10-degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You sat outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we did for three --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For three hours, at least, if not longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I had lots of layers on and got my ice breakers on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can confirm, Ray is correct that Lake Geneva is lovely in the summer time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still ahead, big day for earnings.  We're hearing names like Blackstone Group, UPS, ConocoPhillips at the top of the hour, at 7:00 a.m.  All the numbers, what they're doing for markets, when we come back.

We've heard a lot about how the shutdown was supposed to have a big impact on the economy.  And we're going to start getting some numbers.  Got the ADP report number yesterday, maybe not so big.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The ADP numbers were very strong.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Better than expected.  Job creation in the private sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see if the jobs numbers tomorrow, actually, meet what we saw yesterday from the ADP numbers.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  And we'll get the NFIB small business numbers on our \"Journal\" Web site later this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We had a discussion about Howard Schultz's comments about the economy, what the tax cuts did for the economy, President Trump's policies.</p><p>But I'll say this.  We finally have wages growing.  And we're going to hear this tomorrow.  Wages growing north of 3 percent in this country which is not something that we've seen in a decade.  Not during all the years that President Obama was president did wages in this nation grow north of 3 percent.  And that's a really -- that's a very positive sign and people are feeling it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  And I think it's a very, very important sign that employment for minorities, both Hispanics and African Americans, are at record highs.  And that is very significant because there's nothing that is more stimulating to the economy than people having employment and having a job.</p><p>It not only cuts the cost of government where the government has to subsidize people, but it empowers people and gives them something that they can put on the table for their families that otherwise they couldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that in this presidential election as all these Democrats get their -- sharpen their elbows and start basically sticking each other in the neck, that that's going to be -- and the attacks on Howard Schultz by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that he didn't climb the ladder -- I'm paraphrasing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this is what it's going to come down to.  Do you root for the success of individuals in this country and is our policy and our regulation, is it set up to basically encourage that success, to climb out of a housing project in Canarsie, to run and basically create one of the greatest American success stories of the last 50 years which is what Howard Schultz did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the question of socialism is ultimately does it lead to equality or does it lead to mediocrity.  And if you look around the world historically it does not lead to equality.  Equality lifting everybody's boat.  It leads to mediocrity if not disaster.  And Venezuela is a wonderful example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There was a time Venezuela was quite vibrant.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, incredible.  Prosperous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But let me just tell you that the earnings have come out.  Blackstone Group reporting better than expected revenue -- $505 million, versus $381 million estimate.  The revenue was better than expected.</p><p>The UPS numbers are better than expected on the earnings line, $1.94 versus an estimate of $1.91.</p><p>We've got a mixed story.  The Industrial Average has worsened here.  Dow is now down 25 points.  But the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are higher as we do get some mixed stories in terms of fourth quarter earnings this morning.</p><p>All right.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here.  Former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is here.  As well as the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Popsockets CEO David Barnett is with us along with Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling.</p><p>Don't miss a moment it.  We've got a big show.  And we want to kick it off right here with our top story this hour.  And that is big tech on tap.  A slew of technology giants reporting earnings this week.  We already heard from Facebook last night and the stock is soaring this morning.  It posted a record profit.</p><p>It reported last night.  It comes after a rocky year for the social media company over privacy concerns.  That stock is up 11 and two-thirds percent.</p><p>We are watching Amazon this morning because it is set to report after the close tonight.  We want to know how Amazon did in the fourth quarter certainly, not just because of the Amazon numbers but because it is an indicator of how the economy did for the holiday season.  It's up one and two-thirds percent right now and Amazon, as you see, at $1,697.</p><p>Check Tesla rattling investors yesterday after falling short on earnings and announcing the exit of its chief financial officer.  The company did however post back to back profits for the first time in its 15 year history.  The stock is down 4.5 percent.  CEO Elon Musk announcing his goal for the year is to see profit in every quarter.</p><p>Let's talk more about that, as we talk with ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney.  Tasha -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's most important in your portfolio of companies in terms of an indicator of more than just that company?</p><p>KEENEY:  So, yes.  When we look at the tech industry overall, so first of all, we're focused on disruptive innovation.  So in times I'd say of economic distress, we often find that the fundamentals of our companies are improving even if, you know, there's more volatility in the market.  And we actually like to take advantage of that volatility.</p><p>So particularly when earnings comes around we have sort of a mixed earnings season, you'll see us doing that through our trading.</p><p>So in particular for Tesla, you know, a lot of people are concerned, the CFO is leaving.  You could take that as he now thinks that the company is sort of ready to fly without him.</p><p>You know, it went through a tough period and he's now ready to head out.  So does it change our long-term thesis that Tesla's going to be a leader in autonomous electric vehicles?  No.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When you talk about Tesla and autonomous technology, this is -- I know you see it, a lot of people see it as a huge market.  But what is it that Tesla has that gives them a specific edge in autonomous transportation?</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So actually last night on the call Musk highlighted this.  We think that their advantage is really in data collection.  They're the only automaker that is collecting data from its cars on the road.</p><p>So last night Musk said that he thinks every other player that's collecting autonomous data has 5 percent of what Tesla has.  That's what you use to train your machine learning algorithm and ultimately make the car improve.  So really with that, we think Tesla can speed away from the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>Yes.  Because that's going to inform on insurance.  That's going to have a lot of implications in terms of all that data that you can get from the car.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.  There are a lot of off-shooting effects of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from Amazon?  Tell us your reaction to Facebook.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  So Amazon, you know, I'd say overall -- you know, we don't necessarily make quarter to quarter predictions but I will say as we're talking about Tesla, Amazon -- I mean, this is a company that's also moving into the autonomous space.  They're really transforming logistics.</p><p>So we expect them to continue to disrupt companies like UPS, like the other carriers.  So we're excited to see what's coming.</p><p>For Facebook, you know, mobile ad revenue surprised.  It grew 36 percent, more than expected.  This shows that their ad products are really best in class, you know, no matter the controversy that we're seeing in the news.</p><p>And actually from my perspective, Facebook is an interesting company because they could see more viewership or more customers in the back seat of autonomous cars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Why is Facebook up?  I don't get that.  Because there's so many things going wrong with them in terms of the invasion of privacy, selling of private data, yet their stocks are up.  So explain that for me.</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  You know, again, I'd say that this quarter really shows that their ad products are just best in class.  And they're one of the only ways to reach users on a widespread basis in today's sort of Internet age.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the metrics are telling you so much about the customer, telling the advertisers so much, so you can really target who you want to talk to.</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And those users are sticky and they have Instagram which is increasingly popular.</p><p>One really interesting thing that happened yesterday, we talked about it on this program about this Facebook app that they were pushing on young adults and teens to gather information.  They were paying them like $20 a pop to do that.</p><p>And I think we talked about this yesterday.  Apple has banned that app used by Facebook from its -- basically said that you can't -- they revoked Facebook's permission to maintain that research app that targeted teens and young adults.</p><p>This is really important because this is self-regulation.  We keep talking about the regulation of these technology companies and the regulation by Washington of like Facebook and other social media giants.</p><p>This is self-regulation.  Apple's stepping in and saying no more.  And I think that's very telling about what the road ahead might look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When you've been saying they need to self-regulate for a long time.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned Instagram.  I have been so active on Instagram @MariaBartiromo.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're blowing it up.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check it out.  Today is throwback Thursday and I put a picture there, back from 1985 and I want to he see your throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I posted it.  And it's really --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell, @MorningsMaria.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's really, really awful but I did it for you.  My photo is absolutely hideous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't give it away.  We're going o talk about it later on in the show.  Hey, do have you a throwback Thursday photo that you want to share?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm working on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was a child in the 1980s.  I don't remember it very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  I'm loving Instagram.  I'm having fun with it.</p><p>Tasha -- good to see you.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Tasha Keeney joining us.</p><p>Make sure you tune in tomorrow.  We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January jobs report.  It starts at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow right where we identify where the jobs are right now.</p><p>Before we take a break, check out President Trump's tweet this morning.  He just tweeted, \"He said so great to watch and listen to all these people who write books and talk about my presidential campaign and so many other things related to winning and how I should be doing it.  As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around and say gee, I'm in the White House and they're not.\"</p><p>Yes, the President just wrote that a moment ago.</p><p>We're going to take a break.  When we come back, yes, it is deadly cold -- the record-breaking temperatures causing chaos across the country.  We have the very latest.</p><p>Then the big business of sports betting, millions of Americans will be watching the big game on Sunday, hoping to make some money.  We'll take a look at how the gambling industry is changing the sports world, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A deadly polar vortex is sweeping through the Midwest right now.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It is cold and it is dangerous.  At least nine people have died in causes related to this arctic blast.  One 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.</p><p>The wind chill temps fell to minus 50 degrees in Chicago and, get this, near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest.  Flight Aware says that since yesterday there have been more than 21,000 flight delays plus more than 6,000 cancellations.</p><p>Seven people, take a look at this video, stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin.  Temperatures in the area were about minus 4 degrees and on the water, with a wind chill of minus 30.  Coast Guard officials say the seven people were near Surgeon Bay, Wisconsin near Lake Michigan but they couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>General Motors plants in Michigan are halting production due to the extremely cold weather.  And there's shortage of natural gas following a fire out of a compressor station.  A dozen plants in all are affected.  The utility there is asking customers to voluntarily reduce their use of natural gas.</p><p>Take a look at General Motors' stock, down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And this, firefighters battle a massive blaze at a historic factory in below freezing temperatures.  The Markel Paper Plant burning overnight in New Jersey.  The bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes.  No injuries reported.  It's unclear how the fire started.</p><p>The 86-year=old paper factory has survived several fires in the past but this one happening in the cold weather, pretty historic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  that is incredible how fierce this fire is even in these incredible temperatures.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And then it spread because of the strong wind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Of course.  Yes.</p><p>All right.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  Well, lot of stories over the cold.  Dagen -- your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We see these stories, we report them and it's always a reminder to think about our first responders, the people who put their lives on the line to protect us all and go out and whether it's police officers, whether it's firefighters, particularly in these horrific weather conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Save people's lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break.</p><p>Place your bets, next up.  Sports betting in focus with the Super Bowl this Sunday.  Millions expected to place a wager on the big game.  The business ramifications next.</p><p>And then hitting board games -- luxury hitting board games, Fashion designer Louis Vuitton with a new twist on Jenga.  Plus a robot who taught himself to play the game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting.  He says this, \"Large sections of the wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go.  Renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border.  The wall is getting done one way or another,\" writes the President.</p><p>Well, \"let's just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games, a wall is a wall,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right.  Super Bowl LIII is just three days away now.  The big game of the season for the Rams and the Patriots.  Also the biggest gaming event, gambling event of the year for fans.  The American Gaming Association projecting Americans will bet upwards of $6 billion legally and illegally on the NFL finale.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King.  Matthew -- it's great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW KING, CEO, FANDUEL:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How big of a deal is the Super Bowl for FanDuel?</p><p>KING:  Super Bowl is a huge deal.  If you look across all of our product lines, in the fantasy business we run one of our largest fantasy contests of the year on the Super Bowl.</p><p>We also have big game bingo for those people that aren't interested in fantasy or sports betting.  And then for sports betting, since this is the first year we're going through it in New Jersey, nobody knows how big it's going to be.</p><p>What we know is that it's going to be a huge season for people to try the product for the first time.  It's also going to be a place where in time where people will do more (INAUDIBLE) than they've ever done before.  So it's betting on all the different things.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like how many times Trump will tweet during the game.  That's a prop that you can make.  I don't know.  I just wanted to raise that issue like it's become that granular.</p><p>KING: It is.  I'm sure we can set a line on that.  I don't if we can get approval for it.  We'll have over 450 things you can bet on during the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are some of the more popular ones?</p><p>KING:  Everybody loves the coin toss because it's the first thing.  Most of the volume will still be on the big markets, the money line and the spread.  But then we have a lot of just fun things like who's going to catch the first pass, who makes the first touchdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And how many times does Gronk get targeted, et cetera.  Do you have to be in New Jersey to bet through FanDuel.</p><p>KING:  You absolutely have to.  You have to be in New Jersey.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In other words, the software will not let you bet if you're, saying you're from somewhere else.</p><p>KING:  If you're literally on one side of the bridge, it will let you bet.  If you're on the other side of the bridge, it won't let you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's on the wrong side of the New Jersey tunnel bridge.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I can get a taxi.</p><p>KING: We can go.  You know, I am happy to escort you to New Jersey after that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Who sits down and thinks of the things to bet on?  And then who sits down and decides here's what the line is going to be?</p><p>KING:  So in terms of the things to bet on, we have a global expertise across a number of markets because we're part of the Paddy Power BetFair portfolio of families.  And so we have decades of bookmaking experience and our marquee is how many things can we think of?</p><p>And so we literally have hundreds of people thinking up what all can you bet on.  And then we also frankly listen to users.  And so we'll talk a lot about what do they want to bet on.  And if they come up with a good idea, we'll set a line for it.  So it's the beauty of having a bunch of analysts and kind of modelers who can really set a line on anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has this business changed in the last, I don't know, two years or so?  I mean your business has gotten much bigger.</p><p>KING:  It has gotten a lot bigger.  So as an industry we've continued to grow the fantasy business.  As a company, we merged our business with Paddy Power BetFair's U.S. subsidiary.  We created the largest online real money gaming business in the U.S. by factor of two.  So really kind of span all of the product verticals that are available.  And then with sports betting we've built the largest online sports betting business in the country in a very quick fashion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  After the Supreme Court --</p><p>KING:  After the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- decision overturning the federal ban on sports betting.</p><p>KING:  Yes.  So it's been quite a run in the last six months.  We opened our retail location at the meadowlands in July.  It's quickly become one of the largest sports books in the world from a standing start.  And then the Web site has just taken off.  You know, orders of magnitude beyond our expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about working with some sports leagues to try and improve their popularity?  I mean I raise the issue of Nascar.  Nascar is in dire need of something to really get people re-engaged with the sport and make them excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even baseball on a smaller level.</p><p>KING:  So baseball, we're going to see -- you know, half a season of baseball.  And baseball was actually a great case study in how betting can help the sport.  If you think about baseball, because you have different innings, it creates a very easy, digestible kind of instance for people to bet on.</p><p>So we actually have people betting on the first five innings.  We have people betting on each inning.  Baseball was really the surprise for us in terms of how much more engagement you could palpably see with people as they went through the sport, just because it makes each game so much more exciting.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ask Pete Rose how that worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about Nascar?</p><p>KING:  Nascar, again, every sport has an opportunity to work together.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  First to wreck.  First to wreck -- classic bet.</p><p>KING:  A lot of it comes down to also helping the leagues with their data, right.  So a lot of the leagues have all of this new data that's available and in some cases they're not 100 percent sure what to do with it.  But that's actually our core business, right.</p><p>So if you think about what we've done in fantasy, what we do in sports betting, what we do in horse racing, it's use data and create ways for fans to more deeply engage with the games that they love.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You take a bet up to the person's credit card limit or what is the limit here?  Is there a limit?</p><p>KING:  So we do have limits and we look at it from the perspective of -- the issue kind of revolves around responsible gaming.  And it's an issue we take very, very serious and so we have a standard set of limits.  And then we actually have an entire function that actually thinks about and works with users to make sure that people are playing within their limits because at the end of the day this is a fun product and it should be a fun product.  But we have to be cognizant of responsible gaming issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say -- Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I was just going to say when talking about baseball, I said how did that work out for Pete Rose?  It didn't work out real well for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Not so much.</p><p>KING:  But I think you also have to -- I mean there has to be integrity of the sport.  We work very closely with the leagues around how we maintain integrity.  And again, that's a place where we leverage our global expertise.</p><p>I think the other piece is, it highlights the need for regulated gaming, right, because what you see and you can see it in the AGA stats, a majority of what's going to be bet on the Super Bowl is in the illegal markets.  And so part of the reason to push legislation is actually bring that betting activity into the regulated markets where it can be more closely controlled.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gambling and marijuana, we've come a long way in the last 20 years in terms of what's acceptable and what's legal.</p><p>KING:  It is:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Perfectly legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Matthew -- thank you so much.</p><p>KING:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  We'll be watching the big game and FanDuel.  Matthew King.</p><p>Remember our own Cheryl Casone will be live in Atlanta tomorrow for the big game.  We'll talk with the legendary Joe Theismann and Shaquille O'Neal with Cheryl tomorrow.  So stay with us for that.</p><p>First -- before we take a break, President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He just said this.  \"Very sadly murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33 percent from 2017 -- to just 33,341.  this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout the country, worse even than Afghanistan, much caused by drugs.  Wall is being built,\" writes the President.</p><p>Quick break and then trade talks in focus, the U.S. and China working on a deal, day two of those talks today.</p><p>Plus security concerns in Europe over Huawei.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>Then big money real estate, Chinese billionaire Xian Jin (ph) who I spoke with in Davos last week at a center of a mega real estate deal.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in high gear now, DowDuPont and General Electric making big moves in the premarket this morning after reporting their fourth quarter.  DowDuPont down 5-3/4 percent right now.  General Electric up 7-1/2 percent, revenue better than estimates, up $0.68 a share at 9.78 on G.E.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning.  Take a look at what we're expecting at the open.  Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning, down 45 points, fractional move but nonetheless had been fractionally lower earlier.  S&amp;P is up just by about a point and the NASDAQ is up 31 points right now, one-half of one percent.</p><p>Celgene hitting the tape, revenue above expectations as earnings on Celgene.  This after the major indices surged yesterday on the Federal Reserve's dovish approach to raising rates for the rest of the year.  Basically the Fed said they're on hold, data-dependent.  Dow Industrials were up better than 500 points at their best at the close.  The Dow closed up 434 points, 1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent, 41 points higher and the NASDAQ up 155 points at the close, 2-a quarter percent higher on NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there.  Take a look, mostly higher, FT-100 is up about 30 points, one-half a percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up five points, the DAX Index is lower by 22.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher overnight, as you'll see here with the exception of Korea.</p><p>Parents beware, what you need to know about the expanding ibuprofen recall for infants.  We've got the story.</p><p>And so much for the Chinese pulling out of U.S. real estate, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke within Davos last week, reportedly ready to spend big money for an apartment in New York.  We'll tell you how much.</p><p>And the next step for artificial intelligence, a robot taught itself to play Jenga.  See if you'll stack up later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour, trade tensions, it is now day two of the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C.  President Trump set to meet with China's trade negotiator later today.  Last week, China, a very big topic throughout the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION:  As China right now seems to focus on you know, macro demand management.  The supply side policy has not been stopped and then we continue to push forward for supply-side, well because supply-side structural reform.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  China is at the moment reacting with demand side measures, both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling.  But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in opening the market, that creates a lot of growth potential, that creates productivity enhancement.</p><p>DR. KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb.  So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>WEI SUN CHRISTIANSON, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY CHINA:  I think the China's slowdown is a short-term and it's largely driven by the deleveraging initiative of the government and also the trade tension and weakened sentiment.  But I think if you look at this government reaction to the slowdown is very interesting.  In the past, that they will take it the easy way out and by resorting to this credit-driven stimulus tools and to boost the economy.</p><p>But now, they're more careful because they want to preserve the good result of the deleveraging and the financial sector cleanup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was some comments from Davos last week.  One of the few comments in the -- in the panel related to whether or not China is going to open-up its market, governor, I want to get your take on this.  Because what I found from Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials from China running the financial services industry last week, he showed a real willingness to open up the markets in financial services but is that going to be enough?  That doesn't impact the Trump manufacturing regions of the country.  It doesn't certainly address some of the bigger issues like espionage, like forced transfer of tech and I.P. theft.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But after decades of going the wrong direction, we're taking steps in the right direction.  And I think the pressure that the president has put on China is incredibly positive and people need to give him some air here on this because China is hurting more than the United States is hurting.  They have to play ball.  They're going to have to come to the table and start playing fair.  They haven't done it in decades because nobody made them.  This is a president that's forcing them to have to rethink the way they do trade.  The results is, there's 33,000 new manufacturing jobs.  That's a lot of manufacturing when we were told manufacturing is dead in America.  Well, it isn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the editorial board yesterday had a piece on the separating the Huawei issues from the I.P. theft and the -- and the forced transfer of technology.  James, explain this.  Because I don't understand how you can separate these two.  I mean, if you're talking about stealing trade secrets isn't that what Huawei did?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you separate them in the sense that asking another country to obey the criminal laws of the United States is kind of baseline.  It should be expected of everyone regardless of what the particulars of a trade agreement are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, I think -- and I think enforcing our laws is a great step in holding China to account.  But what we're really after is not just don't come here and break our laws, but in your country, give our businesses a fair opportunity, respect our technology and I think part of the sales pitch to China has to be look at the upside for you if you start respecting intellectual property.  It will encourage and energize your entrepreneurs who lately are not that excited about the communist government taking a tighter grip of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just wonder if it's too late.  I mean, I just wonder if at this point China has stolen what it is going to steal, forced enough transfer of technology and now they've invested in patents, they've invested in innovation, they're probably on their way to being number one in all of these industries that the U.S. wanted to be number one in, like robotics and like block chain and the rest.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think you look at the earnings of our great semiconductor companies, you look at Apple, you look at various measures, the answer would be it's not over yet.  The value is still being created in the United States.</p><p>Long-term, obviously we don't know but I don't think it's a -- and this is maybe a reason why this is the moment as the governor said, we are still the world's preeminent economy and preeminent creator of new technology.  Maybe we won't be forever, but this is the time to strike a deal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But we're still innovating and they're still having to steal.  That's the big difference.  And I do believe that entrepreneurship is alive and well in the United States and it needs to continue.  That's the key is making the incentive there and the incentive is still there, at least for now, for American companies to innovate and create something that's disruptive and globe changing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To do that -- to that point, and this is (INAUDIBLE) this morning when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, this is the number one story on the Wall Street Journal website that the United States is changing the visa process for highly skilled workers.  These are the H-1B visas and that starting this April it will basically offer more changes to how the visas are for people who have master's degrees.  Mre than 5,000 more immigrants with master's degrees or higher will get selected for this type of visa.  We need to make sure -- and this is part of the overall immigration issue, make sure that these smart people stay here in the United States.</p><p>And one other thing, Maria, because the Journal also writes about this and you've been talking about this, with all of your guests, particularly at Davos.  That one area where we can push our businesses into China is through services, through banking, through insurance, through consulting.  It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be satisfied with that because he likes to focus on goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the question I asked the governor, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Soybeans, pork.  Because when he talks about the (INAUDIBLE) our trade relationship with Canada, I remembered he say we'll have a trade deficit.  Yes, with goods.  But if you include the services which and we're a service economy, we have a trade surplus with Canada.  So, will a greater export of services into China satisfy President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's not going to satisfy.  The -- what I know is that China wants to open its markets.  It's willing to open its markets in financial services.  Already UBS has gotten the go-ahead.  They own 51 percent of a bank in China.  They're going to be able to own 100 percent of that company within three years.</p><p>Number one, Steven Mnuchin said to me yesterday or two days ago when I was in D.C., well, why are we waiting three years for 100 percent?  They want it sooner, not in three years and financial services doesn't really address President Trump's base, the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, I think China -- we'll see.  I mean, if it's a shell and it's nothing in between, but definitely I think China is willing to do financial services 100 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, Foxconn backed off its plans to add manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.  That they're going to focus on research, development and design jobs but they said to make these liquid crystal displays in Wisconsin, that it's too expensive.  So, I don't know how that plays with trade negotiations.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And never forget one important thing, people also want to live in the United States more than they want to live in China for the freedom, for the opportunities.  The most important thing that we in this country that we export to the world --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But will we accept those immigrants?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- is liberty, never forget that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will we accept those immigrants?  That is the core of what is going on in Washington right now.  Do we have open arms and will we raise the number of people we allow to immigrate to this country legally every year?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p><p>FREEMAN:  If China won't embrace the entrepreneurial economy, let's recruit their talent.  And this White House policy, what he's doing is he's reshuffling the existing slots.  What the president ought to say in the State of the Union is we're going to increase the number of PhD engineers that we bring in from China, India and elsewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, parents beware, big story here, infant ibuprofen recalled over potential dangers.  We've got the story and the details next.</p><p>And then a major real estate play, Chinese billionaire  Zhang Xin who I spoke with in Davos last week building her portfolio in the United States, she continues to expand, details on the price tag, next up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A nationwide infant ibuprofen recall has been expanded.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Parents listen up, Tris Pharma is expanding avoluntary recall of its infant ibuprofen because the product might contain a higher concentration of ibuprofen than labeled.  The company has added three more lots to the recall list, they were manufactured for CVS and Walmart.  Tris Pharma says there have been no reports of any illness.</p><p>A Chinese billionaire in talks to buy a $60 million apartment in New York City.  The New York post says Zhang Xin is close to acquiring a full floor unit at 432 Park Ave. the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere.  Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of China's largest property developer SOHO China.  And Maria, you talked with Zhang about real estate at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZHANG XIN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SOHO CHINA:  Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buying real estate, and so -- and but now they're worrying on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down.  So then, what does the government do and you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate, buying real estate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The New York Posts says two other units at 432 Park Avenue on the market for $40 million are currently under contract.</p><p>And this, researchers at MIT are showing off their new robot that taught itself to play Jenga.  Using a camera for ayes and two small prongs for fingers.  It can gently remove the pieces.  The robot determines which move is the best one to make by touching the pieces first, testing them out.</p><p>And speaking of Jenga, Louis Vuitton is releasing a $2,400 luxury Jenga set, the 54 L.V. monogrammed pieces are made from plexiglass, not wood.  So, if you ever need an expensive gift, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Thank you, Lauren.  Coming up, making the world better through business, the story of pop sockets and how it's using sales to help charities around the world.  Good story next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Pop sockets are taking over cell phones.  They stick to your device to help you get a better grip and make it easier to watch videos.  Today the company is launching the next phase of Poptivism, which it says is aimed at making the world better.</p><p>Here now in an exclusive interview is the CEO and founder of PopSockets, David Barnett.  David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BARNETT, CEO AND FOUNDER, POPSOCKETS:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And PopSockets, what a great idea.  How did you come up with this idea?</p><p>BARNETT:  Well, back in 2010, I was tired of my headset tangling in my pocket.  Each time I took it out, it was tangled.  So, I went down to the nearest fabric store and glued a couple of huge clothing buttons to the backside of my iPhone 3 and wrapped my head set around them, it looked ridiculous.  I got made fun of.  And so, I started tinkering with mechanisms to get the button to expand and collapse, so that it would look a little more respectable and have more functionality, act as a stand, and act as a grip for the phone.  Eventually --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you started off thinking you could just put your headphones around it, but then you realized there were so many other ideas.</p><p>BARNETT:  That was the initial problem which is a lesson for me, that the problem that motivates you start tinkering is not always the problem you end up solving.  So, the current product does solve for that problem.  But that's not what most people use it for.  So, I ended up settling on this accordion mechanism.  And we just finished our fifth year of business.  So, I started out of my garage, in Boulder, Colorado.  And we've sold about a hundred million of these so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A hundred million pop sockets, wow.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You were a philosophy professor.</p><p>BARNETT:  That is correct.  I'm ready for questions.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When was the moment where you decided iPhone accessories were a better line of work?</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes, all it was -- I would say some -- half of the philosophy professors watching this are laughing at me.  And the other half are probably pretty jealous.</p><p>So, it is -- it can be a lot more fun than being a philosophy professor and sometimes, the problems we're dealing with are a little bit easier, usually.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, but an assassin is the mother of invention and you invent something out of necessity.  And I just love entrepreneurial ideas that come from necessity.  You created something.  I'm absolutely in awe of people who do something so simple and when I see it, I say why didn't I think of that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how are you giving back?</p><p>BARNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNETT:  Sure, today, I'd love to share with you.  Today we launched our Poptivism program to the public.  And it encourages anybody sitting here to go to our website, you create your own grip.  So, you upload your own art work, hopefully it work with an artist, unless you're a natural artist.  So, you upload some beautiful graphic and then you can tag any charity you want.  So, any five O's, 503 --</p><p>FREEMAN:  501(c)(3)</p><p>BARNETT:  501(c)(3), thank you, that you would like.  So we have a bunch already lined up for you.  And 50 percent of every sale of that product will go to that charity.  So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  50 percent of the sale, not the --</p><p>BARNETT:  Not the profit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- income, not the profit, which is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARNETT:  Yes.  I don't know any other -- any other brand giving this much away and allowing you to design the product.  So it's customized impact.  We have a bunch of different categories of charities including some charities around veteran services, so the Wounded Warrior, Bob Woodruff Foundation, The Mission Continues.  Anyway, long list.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  And what are this retail for pop grips?</p><p>BARNETT:  They start at $10.00 for the graphics and they go up to -- there's Swarovski for $50.00.  I have a marble on my -- a genuine marble on my phone today.  And it's -- I believe it's $30.00 for the marble.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you give these to influencers so they use them?  Because I see them all over like reality television.</p><p>BARNETT:  So, the virality of this is partly explained by the fact that celebrities got a hold of them organically.  We don't -- we don't seed the influencers.  We've made some -- we've had some partnerships with influencers but originally this blew up around Los Angeles because celebrities we saw Gigi Hadid and Ryan Seacrest.  And it's just a long list of celebrities using them and that really led to their -- to their growth, quickly.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And that's because it's a great handle for a selfie?</p><p>BARNETT:  Sorry, I should explain it, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Or was it mainly a fashion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  let me see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNETT:  I haven't yet even explained it, you're right.  It collapses and expands and it allows you to move your hand away from the backside of your phone.  I have one of our wallets underneath it.  It allows you to move your hand away.  Once you do that, you can access your whole screen with your thumb.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.</p><p>BARNETT:  Without having to drop your phone.  You can take selfies, photographs much more easily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to be doing that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 31, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 013103cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview With Rep.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it Thursday, January 31st.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is the busiest day for earnings so far, General Electric out last hour.  The stock keeps rising over the last hour.  It is now up better than nine percent on better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p>We have an eye on big tech this morning.  Facebook soaring this morning on a record profit reported last night, stock is up 11-3/4 percent even in the face of the privacy scandal.  The stock to watch after the close, Amazon.  Amazon shares right now up two percent.  The company reports earnings after the close tonight.  Markets this morning are looking at a mixed open for the broader averages.</p><p>Take a look.  Dow Industrials right now down 36 points but the S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ, higher by 35 points right now.  This after a sharp rally yesterday fueled by Federal Reserve.  The Dow Industrials up 435 points at the close yesterday.  1-3/4 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 41, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up 155 points, up 2-1/4 quarter percent.  And the Federal Reserve officially told us they are on hold in terms of data dependency on interest rate hikes.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this.  The European indices right now are most higher.  FT-100 up 35 points, one-half of one percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris up 3-1/2 points, fractional move.  DAX index in Germany down 38 points, one-third of one percent.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, best performer is Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than one percent.</p><p>Back in U.S.  The arctic blast has turned deadly.  Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their levels in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's like hard to take a breath and it stick to my lungs a little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The winds, the windchill is probably the worst of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a look at when millions of Americans can expect temperatures to fall.  We will tell you.  Plus this, attacking the wealthy again.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz answers critics about his success.  Then Roger Goodell breaks his silence.  What he said about the infamous no call during the NHC championship game later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.  And former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you very much.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  The kind of interesting we've been talking about for the last year really, Facebook, how much do users care about these privacy issues.  And last summer we got those results looked look like maybe users aren't really digging this but this latest numbers, you got to say, it looks like users care less about the privacy issues than those of us in media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then they have other areas other than the Facebook business to monetize.  Like with WhatsApp, Messenger, which they're not actually getting any advertising from so far.  So one thing not monetize those think there's an expectations from a business perspective that there's going to be even more growth</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Instagram is kind of the great juggernaut that they have -- or that they're growing, incredibly rapidly but I point this out that because Apple banned this basically data gathering app where they were getting young people in teens to give them all data this is Facebook, Apple bans it, well -- from this app store.  You know what's interesting?  That self-regulation.</p><p>Again, it's not going to be the government that comes in, it's going to be all of these tech companies maybe regulating each other and realizing it might be in their best business interests to not just help them grow incredibly strong but also limit their growth.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I'm more worried about Facebook censoring content.  I don't mean the censoring the classic sense of the government but deciding what people get to see, that worries me more than the privacy issue.  When you sign up for Facebook, you know you're giving away privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But you don't realize is that Facebook is picking for you what you get to see and with 60 percent of Americans now getting most of their news from Facebook.  That's really disturbing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what the Congress is looking at and that's why got those guys, Facebook, Google executives to testify.  Last year in Capitol Hill to see if in fact they are censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentioned Instagram, check out our Instagram post today, it is throwback Thursday.  And posted a shot of way back in 1985, you posted a shot of yourself in the 80s.  Where is your picture?  Post your picture from throwback Thursday Instagram.  I'm having the best time on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  If I looked like you did in the 80s, I would be posting throwback photos while -- may even look like you now but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You look gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  No, no.  Maria looks like Sophia Loren and I look -- well, not so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on.  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of good looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got some good looks this morning.  So check out our Instagram pages.  Meanwhile, we've got a big hour coming up.  Joining the conversation this morning, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Sean Duffy is here.  Former Ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson is with us.  Along with L.A. Dodger pitcher Ross Stripling joining us this morning.</p><p>And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in as always.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We kick it off right here with this.  General Electric shares are soaring this morning on strong earnings.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Stock is up nine percent, Susan.  Good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Good morning to you, Maria.  And congratulations for mastering Instagram.  We'll talk about Facebook in just a bit.  But yes, G.E. shares are higher rallying in the premarket and this is because they got a revenue beat, it's actually pretty good for G.E. as you know, it's been shrinking.  There's been problems with the company.  But aviation was strong for G.E. in the quarter and that offset the slowdown.</p><p>And so as some problems that we're seeing in the capital business and also their power businesses as well.  G.E. also by the way settling that DOJ subprime settlements of just around $1-1/2 billion.  This goes back to the 2008 financial crisis.  And as you know, they have been spinning off several businesses in 2018 to spring off some cash flow and to try to make some profit.</p><p>Let's talk about Facebook because also rallying in the premarket, Faceboook shares and as you mentioned stories doing very well for them on Instagram and also on Facebook as well.  And they grew, daily active users and all geographic locations and this is after a downturn of course in Europe and also plateau in North America.  So that's important to watch. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Susan.  Thank you so much.  Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade, the President tweeting about it this morning saying this, China's top trade negotiators are in the United States meeting with our representatives.  Meeting are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides.  China does not want to -- an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal, they're correct.</p><p>I will be meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in Oval Office, no final deal will be made until my friend, President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the longstanding and more difficult points.  Very comprehensive transaction.  Writes the President.  He goes on to say, Chinese representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table.</p><p>All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully revolved.  Tariffs on China increased to 25 percent on March 1st.  So, all working hard to complete by that date.  My next guest is the cosponsor of a bill that will give President Trump executive power to raise tariffs and joining me right now is Wisconsin Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member, Sean Duffy.  Congressman, it's good to see this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  It's good to be with you, Maria.  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DOBBS:  So in the President's tweet just now, he said everything is on the table, all of these tough issues, does that mean that he is also talking about espionage, the forced transfer of technology and the I.P. theft?</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.  I think he is talking about all these issues.  When you have a relationship with trading partner like China, you can't do business for very long.  We have a country like China stealing our intellectual property or the force transfer of intellectual property.  So, yes.  No, this is all on the table.  Here's what I think is going on now, Maria.  We understand that China lies and they cheat and they steal, right?</p><p>So we want to get a deal before March 1st so we don't have that increase in tariffs.  But I don't know that all the other tariffs currently imposed are going to come off on March 1st if a deal is struck because even if you get a deal with China, are they going to implement the deal?  And that's going to take time.  So, we got to actually -- we don't have this trust but verify like Reagan said with the Russians.</p><p>We have I think a philosophy of don't trust and verify with the Chinese because we -- they can sign a document with us, an agreement with us but that doesn't mean they're going to implement that document.  So, folks, if a deal comes and tariffs are lifted, I don't think that's a strategy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that because they did that on beef, right?  They said that they would buy certain amount of beef and then they didn't.</p><p>DUFFY:  Right.  Yes.  You're absolutely correct.  And, so, you know, again, I -- we believe in free trade and we think, you know, having a great trading partner like China where we can, you know, lower tariffs and respect each other's intellectual property is a great relationship but when you see the rising threat of China militarily and their -- and their substantial growth, we have to take a second look at, you know, what they're doing and what risk that poses to our to American way one of life.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, what's -- you know, what President Trump has done brilliantly is, you know, because of these tariffs but also, you know, the knowledge of the force transfer of technology, you see the whole global supply chain changing away from China.  And you can't do business for that long when you steal a technology to people who come to your country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  And Americans are getting -- China is not a good home for business.  There's other places that we can go outside of China and it's having a real impact even on American earnings as you reported are American companies missing some of their numbers, Apple, Nvidia because of lack of sales that are happening inside of China because of the slowdown that has been led by Donald Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, it's interesting because we actually had Steve Ballmer on a couple of months ago, former CEO of Microsoft and he said that the theft from China costs Microsoft $10 billion in profits because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system only a fraction, one percent actually pay for it.  So, there's all of this theft going on.</p><p>What are the metrics that you want to use to check to verify that in fact if you do do a deal that they will follow through on it?  And do I hear you saying that there is no way that tariffs are going to be gone?  That you can't lift tariffs at all because you can't trust what they say they're going to follow through on?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  I think metric is time, Maria.  I mean, we have to give this time to see with actual implementation.  And so I don't know if that's a year or two years, I think -- I think you have a longer runway here on the tariff front with China but you might mentioned intellectual property I think the Chinese are suing us at the WTO for $50 billion of tariffs that President Trump put on the Chinese for intellectual property theft.</p><p>And our analysis is that they steel $250 to $600 billion a year of American technology and they're -- they have their goal to sue us over the $50 billion in tariffs.  I mean, this is rich stuff with the Chinese and I just -- I think we have a president -- President Trump who's willing to actually fight this out for the American people and try to win for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about Foxconn, a major reversal.  We talked about you in the electronics' giant first announced their new Wisconsin factory that was supposed to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs.  Now the research centers for scientists and engineers.  Congressman, what about the manufacturing jobs, how disappointed are you by this reversal?</p><p>DUFFY:  So they're still -- they're still committed to the R&amp;D side of it but you're right on the manufacturing side.  They haven't necessarily pulled out but they have signaled that they will on the manufacturing side of Foxconn.  And Maria, first of all, so they invested $100 million in the University of Wisconsin system to train our workers.  That's fantastic.  They bought buildings, they have land to build their facilities.</p><p>But what's happening, Wisconsin, why is this decision made?  Scott Walker lost.  The guy that won, Tony Evers in Wisconsin was bashing this deal from the very beginning.  So now you have an unfriendly government in Wisconsin who doesn't want Foxconn there.  This a massive investment.  And if you're going to make it, you better have a governor who goes, yes, you know, come to my state, bring us the jobs, I'm happy to have you.</p><p>And that's hasn't been Tony Evers.  And so, they've been attacking this deal from the very beginning.  I don't think this will happen if Scott Walker had won in Wisconsin but it is now because, you know, business -- Foxconn is under attack in our state because of our new governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So you -- so you blame the new governor as --</p><p>DUFFY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For this, how many jobs will be cut then?</p><p>DUFFY:  Well, so they haven't walked away.  They had a promise of 13 million jobs to $10-billion investment.  They haven't walked away from that number.  And by the way, the incentives that we gave for Foxconn to come were tied to the investment and the jobs.  And so they just missed a $10-million incentive because they didn't hit the job number.  So, again, this is still up in the air for us but if you're Foxconn, you really have to consider the politics of our state and what's changed in the last, you know, two months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Before you go, what are you dealing with, negative 26 degrees right there in Wisconsin, Congressman?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  So, it's 27 below, windchills hit up to 50 below, just have been -- people don't get this in the south but our cars don't start here.  The post office, it never shuts down, the post office is shut down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Our ski hill is shut down.  My Congressional office yesterday was shut down.  People couldn't get to work.  So, you know, it's crazy cold and by the way, kids, we have eight kids, seven of them are at home, you coop up kids for two days in the house because they can't go outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY:  Crazy fights are going and you can only watch so many movies, Maria, and play some of the games monopoly before your house is ready to explode.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the whole Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades, so they're staying home from school, right?</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  You can't send these little kids out waiting, you know, for a bus to go to school.  I mean, listen you people get hurt in this kind of weather.  So it breaks today, this afternoon we start to see a breaks.  We go from minus 27, I think we have a high today of minus four.  That's the heat wave that's coming our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DUFFY:  And if I can make one last point, Maria, I just watch through the 80s and 90s, I have pull up Instagram pictures of your throwback Thursday.  Huge fan when you're on other networks, I'm a huge fan of you here.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- I'm looking forward too.  If Dagen is up, so we're going to check out Dagen from back in the 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  You know, she has some big, you know, 80s hair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the throwback Thursday, yes.  Well, that picture that I posted in the Instagram is from 1985.  Post your picture, Congressman.  Thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY:  I got some really bad ones too.  I got big old -- yes.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you soon.  Sean Duffy joining us there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Midwest is facing the coldest temperatures in decades.  The extreme freeze is turning deadly.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice?</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  Yes.  Unfortunately, we're going to have one more day of this and then the cold air will start to retreat but you can see the windchill is most dangerous part of this cold air.  Is across the northern plains, the great lakes, now into the northeast where it feels like minus 13 in New York, it feels like zero in D.C. but minus 40 Fargo, minus 41 is what it feels like in Chicago.</p><p>Those incredible pictures coming out of Chicago of the rivers just freezing.  Green Bay, air temperature, minus 23, windchill minus 23, air temperature in Chicago by the way is minus 21 but it is the windchill that's potentially deadly.  That's why people are urged to stay indoors.  If you've got kids, if you got pets and you want to check on the elderly.  Today will be the really cold day and things will start to improve Friday.</p><p>But windchill advisories and warnings in place for millions of people where the windchill is anywhere from minus 25 to minus 60 especially across the northern plains in the upper Midwest.  OK.  So here is our polar vortex that is dipped as far south as the Tennessee River Valley, Ohio.  By Saturday it retreats up into Canada but we're not done yet heading into Monday.  We start to see it move southward again across the plain states across the great lakes.</p><p>So we're not done.  Now, this cold air, the really cold air is probably done for the season but we're still going to see below freezing temperatures as we get into next week.  But I will tell you as we head into the weekend, Maria, look at this, so minus one, today is the daytime high for Minneapolis but will be in the 40s by Sunday.  And then, Monday, things will start to come down again.</p><p>Here is Chicago where we are dealing with minus 40 degree windchills, by Saturday and Sunday even Monday, 53 degrees.  I mean, that is a 60-degree temperature difference from today and Monday.  So something we're going to have to watch.  These are weather extremes.  Certainly, we'll watch it.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Thanks so much.  Janice Dean with the latest there.  Coming up.  We are watching markets this morning on last trading day of the month today.  Busiest day for earnings.  Dow Industrials down 51, S&amp;P and NASDAQ up.  Next up, L.A. Dodgers pitcher turns stock broker, Ross Stripling in the house with his take on market action.</p><p>Then breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the path to the Super Bowl.  What he had to say right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets in focus this morning, futures indicating a mixed opening for the markets this morning on this.  The last trading day of the month.  Dow Industrials expected to be down 60 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher fractionally.  This after the major indices rallied yesterday big time after the Federal Reserve indicated it has done raising interest rates for now, it will be data dependent.</p><p>But the Dow Industrials were as high as 500 points, better than 500.  it ended up 434 on the Dow.  154 points higher on the NASDAQ.  Joining us right now is Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and B. Riley Wealth Management stock broker, Ross Stripling.  Ross, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, STOCK BROKER, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we got to talk sports but we want to first talk money.  Tell us what you think about what you heard from the Fed yesterday and how you're telling clients to allocate capital right now.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  You know, that was definitely optimistic, you know, coming out and saying that, you know, our economy is growing, spending is strong, they're going to be patient moving forward with the -- with the rate hikes, you know, October, November, December were certainly ugly for me as a -- as a growth investor, you know, that got out of hand but, you know, I definitely think we got oversold.</p><p>And, you know, so we're kind of telling investors, you know, it's a good time to be patient and a good time to be, you know, long-term mined I think if you think back to January 2016,you know, it definitely got oversold in that month and then all the market did was rally 10,000 points over the next two years.  So, I think it's a good time to be patient, you're getting a good -- so you can get some good names at low valuations and obviously, get some of that money back lost that we lost late last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can we go to baseball questions?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go for it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So -- I apologize, I didn't watch this when it happened but Wikipedia says, your very first major league start, you had no hitter into the 7th inning and you got pulled out.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So this is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  Thanks for bringing that back up.  No, I'm just kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Basically, the highs and lows of baseball in your first professional appearance.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I mean, man, if you just think about what goes into the -- to a debut of Major League Baseball, I mean, I was just so nervous that day and then to finally get up to game time and then to -- like you said, to be able to go over seven innings of no-hit baseball and then -- and then you get pulled.  I mean, it happens so fast, you know, and I certainly thought about it more since then that, you know, things that will never get to know how would have finished but I've always said that I understood the decision to pull me out.</p><p>I was coming off for Tommy John surgery, I've already thrown a hundred pitches, that was the most I've thrown in two years.  So, you know, we'll never know how it would have ended like I said but I've have always been open about understanding that decision and, you know, maybe I'll get another shot and no-hitter someday.</p><p>MINERD:  Hey, Ross, this is Mike Huckabee and one of the things that I'm most intrigue by is your use of data to prepare for ballgames.  It sounded like a real-life version of Moneyball in modern times.  So explain how do you collect the data and how do you go about using that to plan your own pitching strategy because I think that's fascinating.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Sure.  You know, I'll try and give you the shortest version of that question as possible.  And, you know, the Dodgers are probably kind of leading the way in all that, you know, analytics and things like that.  So we have a whole division that kind of gets the data for me and I mean, they can give you as much as you want and I -- at first when I got up I wanted it all, just give me all the data possible and I will just get what I want out of it.</p><p>But now, after three years, you know, you got to cut it down to what you want which is usually, you know, what guys slug in certain counts, what they hit the hardest, what's their biggest swing and missed pitch.  You can even look like what the man on second base, you know, do they get more aggressive.  There's just tons of data out there, so you kind of pick and choose what you want and use it when you're on the mound.</p><p>That way you're not just like boggled down with data while you're on the mound, you know, at the end of the day you just got to trust your ability to get major league hitters out but you want to use to it come up with a plan and each guy is different and you go over with your pitching coach and your catcher and all of that and you have a plan against every batter, one through nine for any situation and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is --</p><p>STRIPLING:  -- you know, that's kind of thought.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is really smart.  Let me ask you before you go, Ross, Super Bowl 53, three days away, who are you betting on?  Your hometown Rams or the Patriots?</p><p>STRIPLING:  Yes.  I got to go hometown Rams.  I think McVay have some up his sleeve that Bellatrix never seen and they made a lot of acquisitions in offseason on that defense, maybe they can get a big stop on Brady.  So I'll take the Rams.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Ross, great to have you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>STRIPLING:  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ross Stripling joining us.  Make sure you tune in tomorrow, we'll bring you live coverage of the January jobs' report starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

Blake Burman is live this morning at the White House with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  Just one meeting among that group, 17 Democrats, Republicans trying to hash out a border security package, and already this morning, we are seeing a pretty big amount of frustration being expressed by President Trump.  Just moments ago, he sent out the following tweet about that group saying the following quote, \"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time.  Democrats, despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not goings to give money to build the desperately needed wall.  I've got you covered, wall is already being built, I don't expect much help.\"</p><p>You'll remember over the last few weeks as well as the President was trying to hash out a deal or at least Democrats and Republicans were, about securing wall funding that the President said, Well maybe we can call this steel slats or a physical barrier.  Doesn't need necessarily need to be called a wall.  He's backing off that today as well because he tweeted this this morning, \"Let's just call them wolves from now on, and stop political games, a wall is wall, give you a pretty good idea of where his mindset is after just one meeting from this group up on Capitol Hill.  Meantime, the Pentagon says that several thousand more troops are going to be heading to the Southern Border.  The Undersecretary for policy testifying up on Capitol Hill earlier this week that several caravans are headed north.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN C. ROOD, UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY:  Current information shows a caravan of over 12,000 people.  There's three that we are tracking, the Department of Homeland Security's tracking en route, and one of which is over 12,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Didn't get an exact number from the Pentagon, Maria.  Currently, there are 2,500 give or take active duty service members down at the Southern border.  That is down from a high of nearly 6,000, but the pentagon says several thousand more are headed that way.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman at the White House this morning.  Let's bring in Former New Mexico Governor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations, and Former Presidential Candidate, Bill Richardson.  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much for joining us this day, this mooring.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean this whole idea of -- that they can't get together, on an agreement for the wall or for any kind of barrier, what do you think this means?  I mean is this going to be the next two years where the Congressional Democrats are constantly resisting everything the President wants?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, the first thing you need to do is the President needs to get off this idea that unless he gets his way, there's going to be a government shutdown.  That was very damaging to the country.  And I think to the President, too.  This is early.  Look, the early talks, did not go well yesterday.  But we got until February 15th.  You don't negotiate until the very end to get the best deal for both of you.  But, look, if there are more caravans, we're sending more troops.  I was a border governor, like Mike Huckabee, governors, we got to deal with these things directly.</p><p>What we need is more border detection equipment at the border crossings, Coast Guard needs to have more facilities.  You don't need a wall.  You go under a wall, over a wall, you have tunnels like El Chapo.  That's not going to solve the problem.  Let's have significant border security and agree on increase border patrol agents' budget --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That's the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, I want to -- I want to bring in Governor Huckabee in a moment, but you said we don't need a wall.  Are -- isn't it true though that in some border security agree on we need a wall.  For example, there is a wall in Nancy Pelosi state right now, which separates Tijuana and San Diego.  We're at the very dense area.  You've got three million people on one side of the Tijuana wall, and other three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear down that wall, isn't it -- doesn't it -- I mean do you think those people would just assimilate into the United States?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look, I'm not advocating tearing down what is existing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but you said we don't need a wall.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I'm saying that for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That wall worked.  Would you say that that will work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No.  Well, that deal does not -- or no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't work?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why not tear it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, it's -- no, it's not working.  It's not working.  It's that they have good border patrol agents, detection equipment, they know what they're doing ---</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you would be OK tearing it down then?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- they have (INAUDIBLE) the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then you would be OK tearing it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Makes no difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think that the three million people on the Tijuana side would assimilate into the three million people in the San Diego (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RICHARDSON:  No, I don't.  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Without that wall?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't.  You're using scare tactics.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not scare -- I'm just saying the facts, sir.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Border enforcement -- no, no, no, you're not.  Those are not facts.  Border immigration --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- illegal immigration has gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's gone down.  It's gone down.  Totally all across the border.  It's gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All I'm asking you is does that wall work to separate Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't think it makes much of a difference, but I'm saying leave it where it is.  But give them more resource, more border patrol agents detection equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think the President's just saying that as well.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Go in depth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee, jump in here because I think that the President does want a wall in certain areas but in other areas said, you said that agrees with the Democrats in terms of technology and drones.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ambassador, you're one of my favorite democrats.  You know I love you, but I remember when Duncan Hunter was the one who put the appropriation in for that wall in San Diego, 95 percent of the drug trafficking stopped.  I'm looking at Israel.  They put up a wall, a security fence.  They were condemned for it, but they went from a thousand suicide bombers.  I agree that walls don't need to go for the entire border because there are certain y natural barriers, some electronics, but I just can't believe that people say that walls in certain places, whether it's a fence, whether it's a steel slat, just would not have an effect, and if that's true then we should tear down the 600 miles that we already have, and I don't know of anybody who realistically thinks that makes good sense.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, Mike, first of all, the tactics that are being used to get that wall, which I think is very dubious to build because I don't think it'll work and it's too expensive is that if the President doesn't get his way, he's going to shut down the government, and he's going to do harm to 800,000 Federal workers, businesses, and then this wall, Mike, I mean it's going to take landowners out of there, it's going to take ranchers, indigenous people, wildlife.  You're right, and most of the border, you can't build the wall because of the hills, because of the terrain, so --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Bill he has been very flexible in saying that it's a combination of all of those things, it's not just a wall.  But you say he's not been willing to give.  I've not seen Nancy Pelosi give one inch, not one inch, and he's offering DACA, he's offering all sorts of concessions, he's making compromise, but where -- tell  me exactly where Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer is offering any kind of concession or compromise.  I can't find it.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, they are offering significant funding increases in Border Enforcement and Detection Equipment, that will work, that will work, Mike.  And then the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's not just to answer President Trump.  That's because --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- says, \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down -- I'm going to shut down the government.  That is unprecedented, that is damaging the country.  Are we going to allow any President, they don't get their way, that the answer's got to be I'm going to down the go of year?  Mike you're a good politician.  You're my favorite Republican Politician.  This border shutdown was not good for the President for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, actually I think that the --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The country blinds him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, when you look at the polls, the President really didn't get impacted very much.  Nancy Pelosi's approvals actually went down.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, I don't know what poll you're reading, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- and the President is tweeting -- wait.  Governor, the President just tweeting this morning --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  I don't know what poll you're reading.  It was significant damage to the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning.  Let me tell you what he says.  He says, \"Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime.  Your reaction.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Oh, I mean this -- you know, he's into his campaign mode.  This is like when he says to his intelligence people that we spend over $20 billion in intelligence, CIA, NSA, Department of Defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that -- is that tweet incorrect?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- all of North Korea, they're my -- they're my buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that -- is that tweet inaccurate?  Wait, is that tweet inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally inaccurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate?  What's inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  The whole thing.  The whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, late term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It's like the President's saying to his intelligence fee --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- higher taxes?  Which one?  Later term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Totally inaccurate.  Totally -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Open borders?  Wait, which one?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know, this is -- this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's inaccurate, governor?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  This is ridiculous.  No.  Open borders?  That's ridiculous.  All of that is ridiculous.  There should be serious negotiations right now.  And it's not happening.  And the President's not helping with these tweets.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  You know the thing is?  I mean I know that a lot of your colleagues say that they're for border security, but they didn't vote for Kate's law, they didn't vote to end Sanctuary Cities, they didn't vote for a border wall, so how can you say you're for border security when you actually haven't done so in terms of your voting record?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  Well, look at what the Democrats are proposing for this showdown, one, more border patrol agents, two, more Coast Guard assistance, three, more drones, four, all kinds of new technologies that will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they voted for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  A border wall is not going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think they vote --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  It doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did Nancy Pelosi vote for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  That -- perhaps that wall she voted for on her border.  All I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why is that not immoral?</p><p>RICHARDSON:  -- let's make this work.  Let's make this work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  But not threaten border shutdowns, not end the government working, that's what the President is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson --</p><p>RICHARDSON:  \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON:  All right.  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bill Richardson joining us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook reporting a record profit.  The stock is soaring this morning.  Joining me now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hi, good morning, Maria.  You know, I wasn't looking at that profit report for the profit number or profit margin, I was looking at it to see how many active monthly users they've got.  When I saw that number come over, 2.7 billion, I figured that Facebook was out of the woods.  Think of all the scandal, all the bad publicity, all the privacy questions that have been leveled against Facebook in the last, what, year or six months?  It--- it's not touched their business.  I thought that the scandal may have reduced the number of monthly users, active users on the -- on the base, but it didn't.  They've actually increased.  And that's why I think Facebook is up so much this morning, 11 percent gain for a stock like that is absolutely enormous.  My bottom line is this, all the scandal did not touch its financial business.  The heart of its business was not touched by all the political goings-on around it.  Facebook, 167.  Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible.  You're right, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  It really is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis.

I grew up literally in public housing in the projects.  And I have succeeded in America I always thought that was something to be celebrated, that my success should not be something that is punitive.  My success is living proof of the promise of the country.  I can't find the answers why people are all of a sudden chastising me for being successful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Many Democrats are caffeinated against him, criticizing Schultz over his potential presidential run saying he will only help to reelect President Trump.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Listen, I'm looking at this.  We are celebrating throwback Thursday this morning.  We're showing you our best looks from the 80s, that's next stay, with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is throwback Thursdays here on the MORNINGS WITH MARIA set.  Here's me from circa 19857.  I was working in a photo lab, printing pictures.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I told you, Sophia Loren.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Care-free days.  I don't even know that I was thinking about what stock to buy.  I don't even know that I was thinking about me being a journalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at this complexion.  This is even before -- well, it's before the internet really, but the no photo filters, you're glowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see yours, Dagen McDowell.  Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I told you I'm really ugly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do they have it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, Governor Huckabee with his daughter.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, there I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's Dagen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I jumped in a swimming pool fully clothed right after that was taken.  And I am not making that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is about 1980 --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  88.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  88.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was the summer after my freshman year in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor Huckabee with your daughter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.  Aww.  That is too cute.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's about 1984.  She was about two years old at that time.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So great.  That's beautiful shot.  And lastly, the photo James Freeman gave us.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so this is me.  You asked for a throwback --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- Thursday photo of James Freeman.  Apparently, this is the Reverend James Freeman.  Apparently, he was an outstanding preacher.  Governor, you might want to grade his performance, I don't know, but very influential in Boston.  My kids ran across this a few weeks ago while sightseeing, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You couldn't find any shots of yourself as a baby.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I -- well, I did -- if you give me more time, I'll try and find it.  But I told you, I never went with the mullet.  My great regret, so I don't know if we're going to have really fun 80s photos, but I'll do my best.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  Deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next Thursday, we'll do another throwback Thursday, how's that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You got to let me know in advance and so we I can dig some photos out of my -- well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So we have a week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- drawer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we didn't even talk about this.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke publicly for the first time about that blatant non-call in the NFC Championship game.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Technology is not going to solve all those issues.  The game is not officiated by robots.  It's not going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God, you're lucky the game has been great in the last year, Goodell, because you're terrible and people hate you.  No more than --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, people hate him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us how you really feel.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  What do you really think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, let's call some folks down in New Orleans and ask them how they feel.  Anyway.  No, they do, people don't -- excuse me, they don't like him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.  Hey, you've got a neat throwback Thursday shots you want to share, Stu?</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2174418430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB8-TVN1-JBHT-D47N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks keep swinging between gains and losses on Wall Street Friday, as a tumultuous week of abrupt stops and starts comes to a close. </p><p> The S&amp;#38;P 500 was down 0.1% in afternoon trading, after a roller-coaster day where it careened from a gain of 0.9% to an equivalent loss. Momentum has been lightning-quick to shift on Wall Street recently, and a similar morning gain for the S&amp;#38;P 500 on Thursday gave way to a 1.8% loss for its fourth drop in five days. The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market's recent selling, was down 0.7% after flip-flopping earlier between gains and losses. It has swung at least 1.3% in each of the last five days, with four of those down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 105 points, or 0.4%, at 27,639, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time.  Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties, for now at least, is what to do with Big Tech stocks. Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that's benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were simply too high.  Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 13 out of 14 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.  That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;#38;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks and the market broadly recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.

On Friday, tech stocks again swung from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecast for profits in the current quarter that topped Wall Street's expectations. After leaping as much as 7.9% in the morning, its stock was virtually flat. Big Tech and the high-growth area of the stock market \"just got ahead of itself,' said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. 'It doesn't matter how it got there, it matters that it got there and now we're kind of deflating that overvaluation a little bit.' The S&amp;#38;P 500 is on track for a loss of 2.6% this week. That would be its second weekly loss in a row, something that hasn't happened for nearly four months.  After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. Apple is on pace for a loss of 7.4% this week, which would be its worst since March, when the market was still plummeting on worries about the recession caused by the pandemic. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;#38;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index's entire value.  One big factor that remains in the stock market's favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then. A report on Friday showed that inflation remains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.  Following the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury gave up an earlier gain. It was at 0.66%, down from 0.68% late Thursday.  Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.  But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday shot down a scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.  Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.  European stock markets made modest moves. The German DAX was close to flat, and the French CAC rose 0.2%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5% after data showed the British economy recouped further lost ground during July after a swath of coronavirus restrictions on businesses were lifted.  Asian markets were stronger. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.7%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.8% and stocks in Shanghai added 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea was close to flat.  ___ AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed. 8 Pharmaceutical Companies Working on a Coronavirus Cure[1]We are living through interesting times. Not an hour goes by when Americans don't receive some reminder of the impact the coronavirus has on our lives. The race is on for an effective, FDA-approved treatment for the virus. Despite, vaccines being available for human trial in record time, we are many months away from having a viable vaccine. However, we may be somewhat closer in finding some antiviral treatments. And if you've watched the market closely this week, any news on that front tends to move the market in a positive direction. That brings up another truth of investing. There are some stocks that thrive from other stocks misery. And that's why we've put together this special report. If you're an investor who is looking to jump into this bear market, the pharmaceutical sector is a logical choice.

Stocks are pushing further into record heights on Wall Street Thursday, after the Federal Reserve made a major overhaul to its strategy, one that could keep interest rates lower for longer. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks are ticking further into record heights in afternoon trading on Wall Street Thursday after the Federal Reserve made a major overhaul to its strategy, one that could keep interest rates lower for longer. </p><p> The S&amp;#38;P 500 was 0.2% higher, after veering through jumbled trading earlier. Prices for stocks, bonds and gold made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech, where he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then. The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets because the central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 198 points, or 0.7%, at 28,539, as of 1:30 p.m. Eastern time. It earlier had been up as many as 301 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, was down 0.4% after paring an earlier loss of 1%. The benchmark S&amp;#38;P 500 is coming off a five-day winning streak and has returned to a record level after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its free-fall earlier this year and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.  'The era of easy money is here,' said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.  Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.73%, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.49% from 1.41%. Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, with the two-year yield ticking up to 0.15% from 0.14%, and the widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors. (Ad) Discover Why This Gold Stock Could Be The Biggest Trade of 2020 Gold was down 1.1% at $1,931.40 per ounce after initially spiking as high as $1,987.00 after Powell began talking. It mirrored the movements of the 10-year Treasury yield. Lower yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.  Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of layoffs sweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.  In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrank at an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it's not as bad as the Commerce Department's earlier estimate of 32.9%. Abbott Laboratories jumped 9.4% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;#38;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.  Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to 'normal' life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.3%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.3% and Alaska Air Group rallied 5.2%. Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;#38;P 500, up 2%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.4%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.5%. Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.3%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%. In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.  Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 0.9% to $43.00 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 0.8% to $45.80 per barrel.

The S&amp;P 500 was 0.2% higher, after veering through jumbled trading earlier. Prices for stocks, bonds and gold made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech, where he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.    The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets because the central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 198 points, or 0.7%, at 28,539, as of 1:30 p.m. Eastern time. It earlier had been up as many as 301 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, was down 0.4% after paring an earlier loss of 1%.    The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is coming off a five-day winning streak and has returned to a record level after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its free-fall earlier this year and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.    \u201cThe era of easy money is here,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.    Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.73%, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.49% from 1.41%.    Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, with the two-year yield ticking up to 0.15% from 0.14%, and the widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.    Gold was down 1.1% at $1,931.40 per ounce after initially spiking as high as $1,987.00 after Powell began talking. It mirrored the movements of the 10-year Treasury yield. Lower yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.    Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of layoffssweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.    In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrankat an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it\u2019s not as bad as the Commerce Department\u2019s earlier estimate of 32.9%.    Abbott Laboratories jumped 9.4% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.    Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.3%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.3% and Alaska Air Group rallied 5.2%.    Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 2%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.4%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.5%.    Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.3%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%.    In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%.    In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.    Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 0.9% to $43.00 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 0.8% to $45.80 per barrel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The S&amp;P 500 was 0.2% higher, after veering through jumbled trading earlier. Prices for stocks, bonds and gold made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech, where he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2%, as long as it had been weak before then.    The change in the Fed's strategy is a huge deal for markets because the central bank has been the superhero repeatedly rescuing them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The momentous announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 198 points, or 0.7%, at 28,539, as of 1:30 p.m. Eastern time. It earlier had been up as many as 301 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, was down 0.4% after paring an earlier loss of 1%.    The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is coming off a five-day winning streak and has returned to a record level after the immense support of the Fed helped halt its free-fall earlier this year and erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.    \u201cThe era of easy money is here,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial.    Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.73%, up from 0.68% late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.49% from 1.41%.    Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, with the two-year yield ticking up to 0.15% from 0.14%, and the widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.    Gold was down 1.1% at $1,931.40 per ounce after initially spiking as high as $1,987.00 after Powell began talking. It mirrored the movements of the 10-year Treasury yield. Lower yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.    Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of layoffssweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a dip from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.    In another report, the government also said that the economy looks like it shrankat an annual rate of 31.7% in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it\u2019s not as bad as the Commerce Department\u2019s earlier estimate of 32.9%.    Abbott Laboratories jumped 9.4% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after federal regulators gave emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.    Stocks of companies that sorely need people feeling comfortable enough with the pandemic to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.3%, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.3% and Alaska Air Group rallied 5.2%.    Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 2%. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.4%, and Wells Fargo rose 2.5%.    Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.3%. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3% to 14.7%.    In European stock markets, the German DAX lost 0.7%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.6%. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.8%.    In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 1%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.8%, and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.    Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 0.9% to $43.00 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 0.8% to $45.80 per barrel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The broader S&amp;P 500 index lost 0.6 percent. The Nasdaq composite lost around 1 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks had rebounded in the morning, following Tuesday's big slump, after DuPont lifted its earnings outlook for 2007 and 2008. But the gains were flimsy, with broader concerns about the economy countering the corporate news.</p><p>By the afternoon, stocks had turned lower again, due in part to the problems in the financial sector.</p><p>As of Tuesday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has lost about 5.3 percent year-to-date, while the Dow industrials has fallen 5.1 percent and the Nasdaq composite has fallen 8 percent.</p><p>\"It's been a bad start to the year,\" said Greg Church, president at Church Capital.</p><p>\"I think we're getting to the point where we're way oversold and you could see a bounce,\" Church said. \"But not when the financials continue to be this weak, because the market is taking its cue from the financial sector.\"</p><p>Church said that the Federal Reserve is going to need to step in and take some action, perhaps even sooner than the next policy meeting at the end of the month, a move others on Wall Street are calling for. (Full story).</p><p>The financial sector led the downturn Wednesday.</p><p>MBIA said it will cut its dividend and raise $1 billion from the sale of notes, as a means of raising money and avoiding a ratings downgrade. The bond insurer also said that regulators have probed how thoroughly it disclosed risks, and that regulators are now looking at the $1 billion investment it received in December from Warburg Pincus. Shares fell 13 percent.</p><p>Countrywide Financial slumped for a second session after the mortgage lender said that the delinquency and foreclosure rate of home loans in its portfolio jumped in December. Shares slumped 11 percent and dragged on Washington Mutual.</p><p>A variety of big bank stocks fell, including JP Morgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.</p><p>One of the few financial sector gainers was E*Trade Financial, which gained 2 percent. The company said it sold $3 billion in mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds and that it is getting out of its institutional trading business as it attempts to accelerate its turnaround effort.</p><p>On the upside, chemical maker DuPont said that it will post stronger-than-expected earnings in the fourth-quarter 2007 and full-year 2007, as well as full-year 2008, despite the slowing economy. That sent shares of the Dow component up almost 6 percent.</p><p>But DuPont was one of few bright spots, as investors continued to worry about the outlook for the economy.</p><p>Alcoa shares slid ahead of its quarterly earnings report, due out after the close.</p><p>Meanwhile, a variety of big tech stocks fell, including Yahoo!, eBay and Advanced Micro Devices.</p><p>Market breadth was negative. On the New York Stock Exchange, losers topped winners 2 to 1 on volume of 1.15 billion shares. On the Nasdaq, decliners topped advancers three to one on volume of 1.73 billion shares.</p><p>Investment bank Goldman Sachs added to the growing talk of a pronounced slowdown, saying that recent data suggest the economy is falling into a recession.</p><p>Goldman Sachs said that as a result of this slowdown, the Federal Reserve is likely to cut the fed funds rate, a key short-term lending rate, to 2.5 percent by late 2008. The fed funds rate currently stands at 4.25 percent after the Fed cut it three times in a row.</p><p>St. Louis Fed President William Poole said that fundamentals remain strong and that it is too early to tell if the problems in the housing market will push the economy into recession, Briefing.com reported. Poole was a voting member of the Fed's policy committee in 2007.</p><p>Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is due to speak Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C., on the economic outlook and monetary policy.</p><p>Stocks tumbled Tuesday, extending the abysmal start to the new year, on speculation that Countrywide Financial could file for bankruptcy and a warning from AT&amp;T that it's consumer business is suffering. The corporate news played into growing worries that the economy could be headed for a recession amid the credit and housing market fallout.</p><p>Overall, the three major gauges have now fallen at least 10 percent off the recent highs hit in October on a closing level - the technical definition of a market correction. That can spark a big rally, as in November, with people using the selloff as an opportunity to jump back in at lower levels. Or a correction can lead to more selling and eventually a bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent off the highs.</p><p>Treasury prices slumped, raising the corresponding yields on the 10-year note to 3.81 percent from 3.77 percent late Tuesday.

Stocks erased all their gains after a huge bout of exuberance Wednesday, when the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 the broadest measure of Wall Street \u2014 and the Nasdaq hit yet another record high. The Nasdaq had also climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday. In the early afternoon, all three major indexes remained sharply in the red. The Dow was down 2.4%, or nearly 700 points, and the S&amp;P fell 3.2%. So, what's happening? For one, the the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow (INDU) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) \u2014 for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit. Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 30% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. \"Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments. But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs. \"The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. Stocks in cyclical sectors are also expected to perform better as the economy is recovering. The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether. \"It's a bit of a wake-up call, which isn't the worst thing in the world. Markets go up and down,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNN Business. Given the summer rally, it's \"perfectly normal,\" to see tech stocks readjusting a bit, Detrick said. And even investors who are still faithful to their safe tech holdings have reason to be a little concerned: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, told CNN Thursday that a Covid-19 vaccine by October remained \"unlikely,\" though it was possible. Making matters worse, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said late Wednesday that \"the cooperative spirit we had in March and April\" on Capitol Hill has \"dissipated as we move closer and closer to the election.\" This doesn't bode well for Congress agreeing on another stimulus bill, which the market has been hoping for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42992267472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RW-YMG1-F07F-82RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000858D</classCode><className>LPL FINANCIAL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009ANY</classCode><className>TD AMERITRADE HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

KEY FACTS     The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4%, around 100 points, on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7%.      Although stocks moved higher for most of the day\u2014with the Dow at one point rising over 350 points, all three major indexes turned negative in the final hour of trading.      Investors continued to rotate out of Big Tech stocks, dragging the market lower: Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix all fell between 1% and 2%.       Stocks initially rose following Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s overnight announcement that his country was the first to grant regulatory approval for a coronavirus vaccine, after less than two months of human testing.      While Russia\u2019s rapid approval of the vaccine has met with skepticism and raised concern among medical experts, the news did spark optimism among investors that a vaccine could be available in the U.S. sooner than expected.      Shares of companies that would benefit from a vaccine and a reopening of the economy\u2014including airlines, cruise stocks and retailers\u2014jumped on the news Tuesday.     Crucial quote   \u201cAlthough the timing is uncertain, the stock market is expressing confidence that the pandemic will end eventually with a vaccine\u2014or multiple vaccines\u2014and with help from better treatments in the interim,\u201d says Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist for LPL Financial.   What to watch for   Ongoing coronavirus stimulus talks, which ended in a stalemate last week. President Trump on Saturday issued several executive orders to extend economic relief programs, such as expanding federal unemployment benefits\u2014at a reduced rate of $400 per week, deferring student loan payments through 2020, extending a federal moratorium on evictions and providing a payroll tax holiday. But Trump\u2019s executive action was met with criticism from both parties and is likely to face legal challenges, since continuing the programs would require federal funding from Congress. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that the White House is open to resuming coronavirus relief talks with Democrats and is willing to provide more relief money in order to make a compromise.   Tangent   After nine straight weeks of gains, the price of Silver plunged 14% on Tuesday, its biggest one-day loss since 2008. Gold also fell 5.5%, hitting its lowest level since last month.   SURPRISING FACT   So far, 448 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported second-quarter earnings, with nearly 82% beating Wall Street expectations\u2014the highest rate on record dating back to 1994, according to Refinitiv data. Just over 16% of companies so far have failed to meet expectations.

Thank you so  much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, we got stocks at all-time highs on strong  earnings reports plus a gangbuster GDP report, that's the measurement of  our overall economy showing that we grew a lot in 30 percent despite  suffering two major hurricanes last month.  This is some good news.  I'm  Trish Regan.  Welcome everyone to \"The Intelligence Report\" on this Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the Nasdaq on pace for its biggest gain of the year during the strong  tech earnings, and of course that much better than expected, economic  growth, three percent.  So just imagine what kind of growth we might  actually get if Republicans manage to pass tax reform this year.  We're on  it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, three Obama era scandals in the spotlight today, the Russian's  dossier, the Russian uranium deal, and now the IRS.  Not a good week for  President Obama and Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal's\" Kimberly Strassel is here and she is going to  tell us about more bombshells that are on the way.  She joins us straight  ahead.</p><p>Plus, the National Archives refusing to publish some 300 records about the  JFK assassination.  What are they hiding?  Presidential Historian Doug Wead  has a theory.  He has the Intel for you coming up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story here, third quarter GDP, three percent,  how about it.  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment  Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Our own Nicole Petallides down at floor in  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And Keith, it's pretty good, I mean, especially considering we had a couple  hurricanes in there.</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  This is  knock the leather off the ball time, you know, the thing that's surprising  to me is that Wall Street is claiming they were surprised.  Big tech has  been the story, not just a story, the story, for a long time.  And it will  continue to change the world we live in.</p><p>REGAN:  I love it.  Nicole, down on the floor, are they surprised?  I mean,  I didn't get expectations have been tempered somewhat knowing that we  clearly had gone through a lot in the past quarter with all the hurricanes  and yet, a pretty stellar report.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  It really is.  For the GDP,  obviously, we saw that three percent gain.  That was more than expected.   You noted Hurricane Harvey and Irma.  And we thought that could cut into  it.  But it didn't.  And the big picture here is that earnings and  employment have continued to boost optimism going forward and now with  these tech earnings today, blowout.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  Hey, it's looking pretty good, as we said Nasdaq on pace to  hit a record.</p><p>Joining me right now, Kingsview Asset Management as well CIO, Scott Martin.   Scott, how much of this is attributable to just the sort of secular shift  if you would, or cyclical shift rather in the economy?  How much is  attributable to the president?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  I think a lot of it Trish,  I mean, you guys were talking about the GDP numbers.  You know a lot of  pick up in GDP this quarter -- past quarter rather in this report was  businesses, right?  Because the consumers got hit with the hurricanes, but  businesses picked up the slack, because Trish, as I like to say, gone is  the -- you didn't build that message that was just delivered to the  business community over and over again by President Obama.</p><p>And now it is, how can we help you, Mr. And Mrs. Businessman and woman,  from D.C.?  So that's why businesses are going out there confident,  spending, and hiring workers, which is going to drive the S&amp;P prices  higher, because of the fact that businesses are back in this country.</p><p>REGAN:  That's good stuff.  I like the sound of that, Keith.  It's -- you  can't underestimate, Keith, how much psychology and sentiment plays?  What  kind of role it plays, when you're out there repealing regulations one  after another.  When you're out there promising lower taxes for business  owners, for corporations and for individuals, what does that do to overall  confidence levels?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  It brings into play the most important word in the investment  vocabulary, certainty, because CEOs want and need certainty to spend and  gain customers.  Customers need certainty because they know the companies  that they're going to buy from are dependable, and the markets need  certainty because it means there is stability.</p><p>So to me, this a win, win, win, all the way across the board.  It's  important political nonsense aside, because the CEOs are the ones who have  to navigate this on behalf of their shareholders.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, so Scott, assuming the tax reform happens, we're looking  at a market that's 23,434 on the Dow right now.  Where do we go?</p><p>MARTIN:  Easy, Dow 25,000, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>MARTIN:  And it's probably relatively soon, you know, we'll get this,  probably not.  And maybe by the end of the year, maybe in 2018 which is OK,  because that's about going forward that the market really wants to see.   And so, I think you are easily going to see the Dow pop here as we're going  in end of the year, especially given as you guys talked about.  It's really  amazingly strong earnings report that we're just seeing today from say,  some of the Google and the Amazons of the world.  Plus we got Facebook and  Apple next week.  So don't forget -- </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: -- we got another lift coming I think in matter of days too.</p><p>REGAN:  Is that what you're hearing Nicole?</p><p>PETALLIDES:  In Washington I mean, what you're seeing in Washington, you  still see the ball rolling.  I know we've been talking a lot about tax  reform, budgets and that really still, well, on its way.  Everybody bet on  that.  And you couple that with the great earnings this season that we've  seen.  And fundamentals, things have improved.  I know it feels crazy in  the run-up that we've seen, all-time highs, one record after another.  And  sure, everybody is always cautious and watching, but the feeling is still  optimistic big picture, for the longer term.  And what a day today with  this tech earnings blowout numbers.</p><p>REGAN:  Indeed.  Well, thank you so much.  Good to see you all, Keith,  Scott, and Nicole.</p><p>The DOJ lifting a gag order everyone, on an FBI informant who could  potentially blow the lid off this entire Uranium One scandal.  He's going  to be speaking to at least three Congressional committees who only now want  to get to the bottom of why this deal was ever allowed in the first place.</p><p>Let's go to Blake Burman.  He's live at the White House with the latest on  this.  Blake, there could be some pretty interesting stuff in his  testimony.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and Trish, here is what we  could tell you.  That President Trump here at White House, last week,  rather during a meeting made it clear that he thought it was appropriate  for the Department of Justice to go forward to lift this gag order on this  confidential informant.  This informant was speaking with the FBI when it  was looking several years back into possible bribery and extortion by  Russian energy officials.</p><p>Now, that informant is going to be able to talk to Congressional  investigators.  That informant's attorney saying earlier today claiming  that her client might be able to draw a link between the Clintons and the  Uranium One deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY:  We have the Clinton Foundation getting tens  of millions of dollars from the same people involved in the deal.  So you  got it, right there, the quid pro quo.  Now my client can put some meat on  those bones and tell you what the Russians were saying during that time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, now it is -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The White House, though, is now forced to defend the president's  involvement in this high-level decision.  Here is Kellyanne Conway earlier  today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  There are some reports that  the president interfered, the president weighed in.  Not unusual for a  president to weigh in on any other topics, but remember, Chairman Grassley  got that party started last week when he asked the Department of Justice to  allow the FBI informant to speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Trish, one of the bottom line here is after months of this Russian  investigation being put on President Trump and those within his orbit, the  president and White House very clearly feel that they are now able to turn  this headline around on to the other side.  For example, the president  tweeted out earlier today, and I quote here he said, \"It is now commonly  agreed after many months of costly looking that there was no collusion  between Russia and Trump.  Was collusion with H.C.\"  Of course that being  Hillary Clinton.  Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, we want to talk about this a little more.  Blake  Burman, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now with his take former Deputy Secretary for Policy at  the Department of Homeland Security, Paul Rosenzweig.  Good, you here,  Paul.</p><p>Given your background, given your background there at Homeland Security,  are you surprised that a deal like this went through?</p><p>PAUL ROSENZWEIG, FMR DEPUTY SECY FOR POLICY, DHS:  Not really.  It was  approved or rather it was not blocked by a committee -- the Committee of  Foreign Investment in the United States, which actually has nine cabinet  agencies sitting in it, as well as director of National Intelligence.</p><p>And in this case, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look to the deal as  well and approved it.  As far as one can tell from looking at the  historical record, there was really no dispute about it.  And that's pretty  unsurprising given that, yes, in many ways -- </p><p>REGAN:  Yes, OK, so but I heard and understand what you're saying here,  sir, because you're saying, it's a little surprising that there is no  dispute.  And by the way, there was some dispute, not from members of  CFIUS, the nine people that were sitting on CFIUS, including State  Department and treasury, et cetera.</p><p>But there was concern, I mean, Chuck Grassley sending a note to Loretta  Lynch at the time.  We do know that there was an FBI investigation going  into or delving into whether or not, Vladimir Putin was trying to gain  undue (ph) influence in our atomic energy sector.</p><p>So by the way, when you got the Russian state energy company trying to  purchase Uranium One in the United States of America, I would just think  that that would send off some red flags.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Well, apparently not.  The Nuclear Regulatory -- well, let's  start with that.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved this because  the ore that they purchased doesn't get exported.  Uranium One didn't have  an export license.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  And also amounted to no more than two percent -- </p><p>REGAN:  But it was exported?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No, it wasn't ma'am, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  approved the deal on the grounds that Uranium One did not have a -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK, so they approved it under assumption that it wouldn't actually  be exported?  But, Paul, let me share with you -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- they are the ones who issues the licenses.</p><p>REGAN:  It could get exported.  For \"The New York Times\" -- </p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right?</p><p>REGAN:  Here's a quote \"New York Times\", 2015, April, where they were  talking about how there was one particular individual there who was saying  that -- </p><p>ROSENWEIG:  -- that he saw some of the yellowcake in this property going  on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right, he didn't say anything to that whether or not it was  part -- it was owned by Uranium One and whether or not it was returned  after processing right?</p><p>REGAN:  If you would let me finish I will tell you exactly what \"The New  York Times\" reported, \"Asked about the commission, it confirmed that  Uranium one has in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada.\"</p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  OK, so there you go.  The commission confirmed that Uranium One  has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada, even though it does not have an  export license.  So if you try and tell me, none of their stuff left the  country, well, that's just wrong.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Now, here's a good question for you.  How much uranium does  the United States consume every year?</p><p>REGAN:  I don't know.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Fifty million-pound, roughly.  How much do we make  domestically?</p><p>REGAN:  I don't know.  Tell me.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  About 10 percent of that, about 5 million.  What's the uranium  production from Uranium One?</p><p>REGAN:  Twenty percent of the U.S. supply.  Listen, I don't care.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG:  Right.  So 20 percent of -- </p><p>REGAN:  What you're trying to say is somehow this was OK that this deal  happened.  Because there are some just basic things -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN: -- in the world.  And that is that you do not allow the supply of  uranium to go to the Russians.  I mean, why would you allow that?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No.  Not to go to the Russians.  Not to go to the Russians.   To be -- the mining contracts went -- were owned by the Russian Rosatom.   But you don't know -- you've not told me anything about where the -- </p><p>REGAN:  Well, we just talked how the uranium went to Canada, Paul.  We just  talked about that and Uranium One confirming that.  OK?  So, you know, once  it goes to Canada, I don't know where it goes from there.</p><p>But the point is that uranium is strategic resource, so why is it nobody at  CFIUS, including Hillary Clinton, by the way, who is running State  Department at that time even care.</p><p>Let me also ask you this Paul, why is it that that, by the way, during the  Bush administration we were concerned about Russia.  We really were, I  mean, I cited a foreign affairs article the other day from the CFR where  (INAUDIBLE) was talking about the threat of Vladimir Putin.  It was the  cover article back in 2007.  I remember the lobster summit in  Kennebunkport, which I covered in Maine.</p><p>A lot of concerns about Putin back then.  And then suddenly Hillary Clinton  becomes Secretary of State.  And President Obama is there and suddenly  we're approving deals like this while simultaneously $146 million is going  to the Clinton Foundation?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Well, I don't know anything about the deals with the Clinton  Foundation, except that most of the money went about two years before this  deal was, went down.</p><p>So, you know, that -- I really don't have any information about that.  What  I do know is that CFIUS committee is charged with examining whether or not  there is a -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- national security concern and they determined that there was  not.  And the reason there's not is because two percent of the U.S.'s  uranium production is not a material concern to the United -- </p><p>REGAN:  That tells me that they're either incompetent or something else is  going on, because uranium is -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No, I think they're exercising their best judgment, that  you're second-guessing.</p><p>REGAN: -- should be giving that to a Russian state-controlled company.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Look, I think Hillary is liar in most instances.  I spent most  of my life trying to prosecute her, right, with the Whitewater  investigation.  So I'm not one to give her any credit at all.  But when a  committee of United States that is mostly run by career bureaucrats says  that there's no problem, you know, to try and hang that on her without the  least bit of evidence that she had any knowledge of it is kind of  frivolous.</p><p>REGAN: -- because you know, it wasn't just Hillary Clinton.  These were all  Clintonites, actually, if you look at this list.  You got Eric Holder  there, you got Janet Napolitano.  You got a whole bunch of people, Steven  Chu, Tim Geithner that were close to Clinton, close to Obama.  And I would  only point out when you talk about the money that's changing hands.  You  said this money came in two years before this deal.</p><p>Well, $500,000 went to Bill Clinton in the weeks after over the first  speaking event in Russia.  And I get, I would just once again ask like,  there's nobody think that's inappropriate?  Does nobody think that's  bizarre?  A $146 million to the Clinton Foundation while she is Secretary  of State from Russia and $500K for a gig speaking there from the Russians  to Bill Clinton?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Nobody says that the Clinton Foundation should have been  taking this money.  They probably should not have been taking money from  any foreign source as long as the past of -- she was Secretary of State.   But to suggest the Uranium One deal is outside the bounds of normal  procedure is really just to be indulging in with respect to conspiracy  theories.</p><p>REGAN:  No.  No.  You're wrong on that.  I mean, we had a lot of concerns  about Russia.  We still have a lot of concerns about Russia.  And I really  question -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  I agree with you.  I have lots of concerns about Russia.  I  worry about the president's decision to try and lift sanctions.</p><p>REGAN:  To the Russians.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG:  That's the type of concern I have.</p><p>REGAN:  So it tells me it's either incompetence on the part of our  government or there's something else at play.  Paul, thank you very much  for joining us, thanks very much.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Thanks for having me.  It's a great pleasure.</p><p>REGAN:  Congress taking a major step forward in passing tax reform, but a  battle is growing between Republicans from high-taxed states and those from  low-taxed states.  Are we heading for a showdown?</p><p>Plus, the IRS finally admitting it targeted conservative and Tea Party  groups and the DOJ is paying out big time.  Stay with me.  I'm back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Here we are just days away from seeing the first text of the  Republican tax form bill.  Are you excited?  The big question is going to  be, is it going to get rid of state and local tax deductions?  And look, I  said this many times on this show, I like getting a state and local tax  deduction.  Heck, I live in New York City, right?</p><p>But the reality is those deductions that I'm allowed to take they aren't  really entirely fair.  Because while they benefit New York or California or  New Jersey, they don't do much good for Texas or New Hampshire or Florida,  because you don't have any state income tax there that you can deduct.  So  you see what's happening.  Essentially, part of the country is helping to  subsidize spending in these blue states.  And the president is calling that  out.</p><p>But Republican lawmakers from those blue states, because there are a few  Republicans in the blue states, they say, they're not going to pass a bill  that gets rids of these deductions.  So is this turning into a massive  showdown?  We're going to Connell McShane for the latest.  Hey Connell!</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE. FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Trish.  Yes, well,  they might need the votes from those Republican lawmakers that you allude  to.  So they are working on a compromise for that, for the deduction issue.   There's also a lot of interesting talk here in Washington today about  401(k) contributions.  OK, so I'll get to that in a second.  But since you  brought up the deductions, so let's start with that.</p><p>We had 20 no votes on the budget yesterday in the House.  And 11 of the 20  were New York and New Jersey representatives on the Republican side.  So  that really tells you how important this issue is.  And leadership is  talking to those members but he's trying to kind of work something out that  maybe softens the blow.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX), 8TH DISTRICT WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We  know as we're working with these lawmakers, that if you couple lower taxes,  a bigger child tax credit and we work with, to find a compromise on state  and local, we can help Americans in every bracket keep more of what they  earn.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you know, the other possibility is you have the deductions  going away for some people but not for others.  Maybe there's some sort of  an upper income limit put on it, but again, a lot being talked about there.</p><p>Now on the 401(k) issue, you remember the president brought that up in a  tweet.  But that got very interesting earlier today as well.  You just  heard from Chairman Brady.  I was speaking to him about this a little bit  earlier the day and he has made a suggestion, in fact, he's told us that he  talked to the president about this, where the limit on contributions to  your 401(k) plan, they might actually increase of its 18,000 now, up to  20,000 plus.  But there's a big catch.</p><p>All the money wouldn't be tax-free as part of this compromise.  Some of  that tax-free savings might go to the backs end rather than the front end.   And that's to save money for the tax reform effort.  Here's more of the  rationale.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BRADY:  Those 401(k)'s most people are saving $200 or less a month.  That  won't do it in retirement.  They're going to be in trouble.</p><p>So we're asking experts how we can help theses families save more.  And so  we're working to reach a good solution there.  If not, we'll leave them as  they are.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  As they are.  Now that's basically, Trish, where we are right  now.  I should tell you there is still a very ambitious timeline up here.   I mean Chairman Brady has talked about this a number of times.  But they  want to get the bill introduced by next week and still talking about at  getting it passed by Thanksgiving.  But two issues, the deductions in the  401(k), still going to work something out.</p><p>REGAN:  Thanks so much, Connell.</p><p>The IRS, everyone, finally admitting it did target conservatives and Tea  Party groups.  And The DOJ is paying out big time.</p><p>But will any heads roll over this blatant abuse of power?  And finally what  does this telling you about the Obama Administration?  They passed a deal  to allow the Russians to buy 20 percent of our uranium assets.</p><p>That's very skeptical.  And now we're learning what they did, targeting,  deliberately targeting conservatives and Tea Party activists.  We're on it.</p><p>Plus \"The Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel is here.  She's running  about the so-called dirty dossier about President Trump, and she is warning  right now that there are many Russian bombshells to come, if and when the  bank records of who paid for this thing are actually uncovered.  She's got  a lot of Intel for you.  Do not miss it.  Stay with me.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  We got another scandal to talk about today from the Obama era.   As the Trump Justice Department is forced to settle two lawsuits that date  back to the Obama administration.  The IRS admitting in court documents  that intentionally delayed tax-exempt status for Tea Party and conservative  groups.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions says there's no excuse for this  conduct.  And then on to President Trump, this abuse of power will not be  tolerated.</p><p>Joining me with more, American majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  Abuse of power, is  that what it is?</p><p>NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Yes.  Oh, Absolutely.  I mean Trish  we're not dealing -- we weren't dealing with just dozens of Tea Party and  conservative groups.  This is hundreds and hundreds almost 500.</p><p>By the time you add everything up.  And I guess the question I would have  for those watching is, do you really think the IRS of its own volition just  decided to target Tea Party groups and conservatives?  I mean IRS,  bureaucrats acting of their own volition.</p><p>I think this went higher and it is kind of a microcosm of what a lot of us  were concerned about with the Obama administration that it was weaponizing  governments, the states against those that opposed it.  And so, when you  look at the IRS scandal, again it's just one of many things that concerned  us during the Obama administration.  People in D.C. and New York, still  don't understand why 2016 happened and this is a microcosm of why it  happened.  People are losing trust in their institutions.</p><p>REGAN:  And it leads you, of course, down the path of looking it what  happened with that, now infamous dossier.  And was the FBI -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  </p><p>REGAN: -- under President Obama using that in order to wiretap.  Save that  because I want to ask you something else and Kimberly Strassel is going to  be on momentarily to talk about that.  But I know you've been digging into  the Uranium One story quite extensively.</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  </p><p>REGAN:  And, you know, we just heard from a guest who sat on homeland  security who try to tell us, look, you know, this is no big deal.   Absolutely no big deal at all that all -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's true.</p><p>REGAN: -- these people at CFIUS day signed off on it.  And he also tried to  say, Ned that none of this uranium left the country, when in fact we know  that it went to Canada.  And we know that in part because Uranium One  confirmed it in April 2015 that this uranium went to Canada.  And who knows  what it happens to the uranium once it's out of the country.</p><p>RYUN:  No.  This is correct, Trish.  And to say that this is no big deal,  I'm sorry you had nine people, CFIUS members.  Again, Hillary Clinton and  Eric Holder, and Timothy Geithner, you can look on my Twitter feed and see  all these names.</p><p>These people in expedited fashion, usually these things, Trish, 75 to 90  days they're looking at this deals started first part of August of 2010,  and it was approved by October 22nd, 2010.  It was expedited process.  Most  to this time when you're dealing with something such national security  implications, usually 120 days.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I just want to point out.  You're saying national  security implications.  And, you know, you're the guest who said, no, no,  no national security.  I would just say and I'm reading the name of this  company that bought 51 percent stake in Uranium One, it's called ARMZ  Uranium Holdings and it's from Russia, right?</p><p>So if that's not enough to kind of red flag some of this called Uranium  Holdings.  How about this?  Guess who owns, ARMZ Uranium Holdings it's  Rosatom which stands for --</p><p>RYUN:  Rosatom.</p><p>REGAN: -- Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.  And no one cares?</p><p>RYUN:  By the way, we're also helping Iran build these nuclear facilities  and training Iranian nuclear scientists.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  And we knew that back in 2007.</p><p>RYUN:  And the thing about it is, it wasn't as though Republicans weren't  raising red flags.  On October 5th, 2010, Republicans sent a letter to  Timothy Geithner and said, we have real issues with this deal.  And you  know what they did?  They went ahead signed off on it basically two weeks  later and said this deal was fine to go forward.</p><p>There are a lot of questions, and I think the only way we get to bottom of  this, Trish is we have all nine of those CFIUS voting members, brought to  the Hill, put under oath in a public setting and asked, why did you approve  this deal?  Why did you do it in expedited fashion?  And we get answers  because I think we deserve answers.</p><p>Was this to help Russia come in on a terrible Iranian deal, or even worse,  Trish, was this some sort of a payback to Democrat and Clinton Foundation  donors as I thank you for all the support they've gotten?  We deserve  answers.</p><p>REGAN:  You're hitting on something that I think is very interesting  because as I've been telling the viewer and I remember covering Russia, the  Ukraine elections, I covered the lobster --</p><p>RYUN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- summit in Kennebunkport.  And during the Ukrainian elections it  was very clear the Ukraine's were definitely warning about Russia as a real  threat.  As I've been citing (INAUDIBLE) -- cover article in 2007 in the  foreign affairs journal from the CFR where she basically outlined exactly  what Putin was up to and his imperialistic tendency.  She talked about his  support of those in Iran that were doing bad stuff.  And she warned of  everything.</p><p>We knew about this that Condoleezza Rice was there.  And she was a Russian  scholar.  She knew exactly what was at stake.  There was a lot of concern  and yet, Ned, everything shifted, when President Obama came into office,  Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, the last guest try to say, well,  you know, that that money they went to the Clinton Foundation that happened  two years before that deal was approved.  But if you follow your logic,  perhaps that was money well-spent as far as Russians go.</p><p>Now I'm not saying anything.  I just think that say it looks awfully  suspicious that we changed our policy tone towards Russia shortly after -- </p><p>RYUN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN: --in the years after all this money had been pouring into the  Clinton Foundation.  I mean, why you're going not to be -- not getting  along with someone who's giving you so much money?</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  There are a lot of questions.  And again Trish, there  are a lot of questions that still need to be answered.  And you make a good  point.</p><p>We knew who Russia was at this point.  We also knew, the CFIUS board  members, this voting board members knew that there was actually a bribery  case taking place that the FBI uncovered and regards this uranium deal.   And they also knew exactly what Russia was doing.  It was trying to Annex  Georgia this time.  It was threatening Ukraine.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  It was also threatening Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia with small  nuclear weapons.  We knew exactly what was going on and we still approved  this deal in expedited fashion.  Bring these nine CFIUS voting members to  the Hill.  Put them under oath either in front of the House Intelligence  Committee or the Senate Judiciary Committee to get answers.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  There are questions that need to be answer for sure.  I mean  they've -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's right.</p><p>REGAN: -- long needed to be answered.  But now we know in fact the FBI was  investigating Vladimir Putin for trying to have outsized reach in our  atomic energy industry at the same time that they were approving this deal.   So yes lots of questions.  Ned Ryun good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel writing about the so-called  dirty dossier on President Trump warning of, \"The coming Russian  Bombshells\" if and when those bank records of those who paid for this whole  thing are uncovered.  She's here to explain what those bank records might  reveal.  Kimberly's here.  She's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  New questions today over the controversial and unverified and  largely discredited anti-Trump dossier.  Top Democrats are passing the buck  here, claiming they had no idea that the dirty document was ever being  compiled, let alone that they have anything to do with paying for it.  Of  course now we have learned that the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign were  funneling money through a law firm in order to dig up all this disgusting  stuff.</p><p>Joining me right now with more, \"Wall Street Journal\" writer, Kimberley  Strassel.  She says even more Russia-linked bombshells are on the way.   Good to see you, Kimberley.  What do you mean by that?</p><p>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WRITER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Hi, Trish.  So I think  people need to ask themselves why it is that Fusion, this oppo research  firm, finally came out and said who had hired it, the DNC and the Clinton  campaign.  They have resisted doing that for almost an entire year.  They  had Democrats and Congress helping them and then suddenly boom, they give  the names.</p><p>And it's because there is something they want to hide even more than those  names and that is their bank records.  And I think they thought, or hoped  that by putting these names out there, that maybe the House investigators  would drop their subpoena is for the bank records.  House investigators are  not doing that.  But it's very clear Fusion, which has taken then to court,  does not want them to see what's in those bank records.</p><p>REGAN:  So the bank records would tell us basically, who all their clients  were, who was paying them?</p><p>STRASSEL:  Well I think House investigators will probably be careful not to  drag any of Fusion's clients out into the open that have nothing to do with  this investigation.  But let's just say we know, for instance, that Fusion  in the past has had contacts and contracts with Russians.  One of those  Russians, Natalia Veselnitskaya, she worked for a company called Prevezon.   You know, she was one that recently ended up in Donald Trump, Jr.'s office  having a meeting with him.</p><p>Is she linked up with Fusion?  Are they still working because if there was  money coming from Russia simultaneous to the fact that they were working on  this dossier, it brings up some questions about whether or not the Russians  didn't know this dossier project was on going and sought to influence it.</p><p>REGAN:  So, in other words, this was a disinformation campaign that Fusion  GPS was putting together and your thinking on this might be that the  Russians had a direct hand in this.  That they somehow wanted to be  involved in this disinformation.</p><p>STRASSEL:  Well, what we do know from the dossier's author, he writes it in  the dossier.  Is that a lot of this, the allegation, which you said have  been almost entirely disprove and -- were based off of tips and knowledge  from anonymous Russian sources.  So I think the question we have to ask  ourselves is, was the Kremlin aware that this dossier was being put  together?  And they did they deliberately, yes, feed false information to  this British intelligence officer to inject that into our political system.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, hen, how on earth does the FBI fall for that, Kimberly?  I  mean, how is it that -- and by the way, I would just point out that most  journalist organizations, this thing had been floating out there, and they  found it discredited, so they never bothered  published it, except for  \"BuzzFeed\", and that certainly a whole other debate as to whether they even  are a journalist organization.  But no one published this, right?</p><p>And, yet the FBI, Kimberly, took this to heart.  And said OK, now we're  going to have to look into all these campaign folks and wiretapping, et  cetera, et cetera?</p><p>STRASSEL:  Yes.  This is the other huge unanswered question here.  I keep  trying to remind people just to contemplate this one sentence.  We had law  enforcement agencies working for a government opposition party from one  that's in now.</p><p>Basically, wiretapping in a presidential election campaign, which is a  pretty astonishing thought when you think about it.  Now add in the  possibility that it was relying or justifying that investigation on the  basis of a Democratic commissioned opposition research document that was  sourced from anonymous Russians.  And you just have to wonder, you know,  who was in charge there?</p><p>Now, we still don't know the answers to that question.  The dossier file in  the FBI is supposed to go to Congress this next week, but then we may have  a better sense of how much it was used.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  All right, well, Kimberly thanks you so much.  Appreciate all  your Intel on this and we'll keep talking to you about it.  Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right everyone, let's go to Spain for a minute because people  are taking to the streets there after the Catalan parliament voted today in  favor of independence from Spain.  They want to break apart away from the  rest of Spain, taking the country's deepening political crisis here into  uncharted territory.</p><p>Spain is Europe's fifth largest economy and whatever happens there could  certainly have major financial implications.</p><p>The U.S. is not wild about this, but I'll tell you having spent a lot of  time in Barcelona, they have always had this separatist strain in their  population and it's really coming to a head right now.  So we'll go to  Spain right after this, with more pictures.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Breaking news right now.  Can you imagine if Texas said, you know  what, see you United States of America, we want to break off on to our own?   That's effectively what's happening in Barcelona, Spain, right now.  You  see people celebrating there in the street.</p><p>The prime minister there in Spain is dissolving their Catalonia Parliament  following the region's history vote declaring independent from Spain.  In  other words, the people there in Barcelona and Catalonia have said, see you  to Spain, I guess see you to the E.U. but is that going to fly?  Let's go  to Ashley Webster who joins me with the latest now.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely not.  There they  are celebrating in Barcelona tonight.  Huge dark cloud on the horizon is  that no one recognizes Catalonia as an independent state, not the EU, not  the UK, not the U.S., Germany, France have all pitched in and said we don't  even recognize you.  We do not believe you are an independent state.</p><p>Now, Catalonia says well, you know, we'd be happy to be still in the EU.   EU says where you are because you're part of Spain.  So the question now  is, this has been going on and building and building a game of chicken and  here we are, what happens next?  Does this really descend into civil  disobedience?</p><p>What happens when Madrid tries to dissolve the parliament?  Maybe arrest  those Catalonian leaders that held the vote in the first place?  What do  the Catalan police do?  Are they loyal to Madrid or are they loyal to  Catalonia?   There's a lot of big questions here.</p><p>REGAN:  I want to point again this is coming to us live from Spain right  now from Barcelona.  And this is something that has been going on for  sometimes, I have shared with you, Ashley, the story when I was a young  student over there in Spain studying Spanish.  And I got to Spain, I was  all excited.  And they started speaking Catalan to me, so much for all my  Spanish.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Excuse me?</p><p>REGAN:  But really you get into a taxicab and they speak Catalan, because  it was so ingrained to them that they were Catalanian or Catalonian first - - </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And before they were Spanish back in the years of Franco, for  example, they were not allowed to speak Spanish, forgive me Catalan.  He  made them speak Spanish</p><p>And so, this is been something that has been brewing for some time.  And  now there's a lot of economic components to it as well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Huge.</p><p>REGAN:  Given how successful they are.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, listen.  We're in uncharted territory.  What happens?</p><p>At least 1500 companies have already moved out of Catalonia.  So, major  banks have moved their headquarters out of Catalonia, very worried about  what happens next.  So there is a big economic hit.  This is very rich  region of Spain, 25 percent of the GDP comes out of this one region.   It's  upset -- </p><p>REGAN:  It is little like Greece and Germany?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Pretty much.  Catalonia believes it pays way too much in taxes  and gets way too little back compared to the rest of the country.  Now, all  of the sudden we're going to have to basks in Spain and the Corsicans in  France, in the Northern League in Italy, and the Bavarians in Germany.   Then they will lose in Belgium.  The EU is very concerned that they don't  want cracks to stop forming in the union where there are cracks.</p><p>REGAN:  And there are, I mean let's -- yes Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Brexit.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean Brexit is a great example.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Scotland.  What about Scotland Island?  It's covering the  Scottish independence.  I mean, they covered that vote, there were large  group of Catalonians in Edinburgh egging them on to vote for independence.   That's how, you know, strong they are for their statehood.</p><p>REGAN:  So, ultimately?  We don't know.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We don't know but I -- it's going to be an uphill battle for  Catalonia to get their own statehood.  Let's put it that way.</p><p>REGAN:  Ashley, thank you very much.</p><p>WEBSTER:  My pleasure</p><p>REGAN:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Interesting story, the national archives releasing some, but not  all, of the long secret files relating to the 1963 assassination of  President JFK.  President Trump blocked the release of nearly 300 records  on the urging of CIA, and the FBI, those files are going to be under review  for another six months.  Those that were released described how federal  agents madly chased after tips, after rumors and leads worldwide.</p><p>But the fact that some were held back, well, you know, that's fueling a  whole lot more speculation.  And by the way, they were held back because of  national security concerns.  What does that mean?</p><p>Presidential historian Doug Wead is back with me.  And Doug, you know, one  of the interesting things in all of this, is that we have learned that  Oswald went to Mexico City for a meeting at the Soviet embassy shortly  before this all transpired.  Does that lead you in any direction towards  maybe the Soviets, the Soviets perhaps, and the Cubans combined had a hand  in this?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  That was my thought.</p><p>WEAD:  All of the conspiracy theories, all of them are alive, and there is  a bunch more after we've seen these documents.  It is truly, truly  stunning.</p><p>REGAN:  But I mean is there any one that sticks out more so than others  given what we know thus far? </p><p>WEAD:  Here is what sticks out to me, Trish, and that's the questions that  the American people were asking, that the taxicab driver, the beautician  asking.  They were the right questions.  And the elite media and the  government tried to make us feel like we're idiots and conspiracy  theorists, but, they themselves are asking this question.</p><p>Richard Helms, the director of the CIA, sends out a memo that's in these  documents and says was he one of ours?  Meaning Oswald, was he a CIA agent?   So, this isn't some blogger from Tulsa.  This is the director of the CIA  asking that question.</p><p>And then there is LBJ, LBJ is quoted in here as saying, the reason John F.  Kennedy was assassinated was because he himself assassinated Ngo Dinh Diem,  the president of our ally, president of South Vietnam, who was a fellow  catholic.  I mean, this, again, is president of the United States making  this allegation in these documents.  No wonder they wanted to keep them  hidden.</p><p>REGAN:  So what is your suspicion?  Do you question all of this as well?  I  mean do you think that there is more to this story than was ever presented  to the public?</p><p>WEAD:  Oh, obviously so here because the principals themselves thought  that.  Johnson thought that.  Helms thought that.</p><p>You can -- we've got to apologize to all the conspiracy theorists.  They  may not have the right conclusions. We don't know those conclusions and  maybe that's the lone gunman as many say.  But they certainly had the right  questions and the questions they were asking should have been asked and no  one should have been shamed from talking about it.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Doug, I guess now the concern is national security,  right?  And I understand that, by the way.  I kept saying, well the  president surely must know what's in these documents before they get  released because I would think that you run the risk of anyone maybe being  named that was a spy for us, possibly still being a live and being put into  jeopardy.  And also he is citing national security concerns, which makes me  wonder, if it was another country involved in this assassination, do we run  the risk of flaring up a scenario and perhaps is the reason why they want  to be more careful?</p><p>I don't fault them by the way for wanting to be more careful.  Because it  is all sensitive stuff and you don't want to find yourself in a situation  where we're going into some World War III over something done that many  years ago, Doug.</p><p>WEAD:  I don't think that's the problem.  I think it's political and it's  personal.  Trish, when I wrote the book, \"All the President's Children,\" I  had the Warren G. Harding family lobbying me not to include the story of  his illegitimate daughter which is now proven by DNA.  But that tells you  the pressure that was on.</p><p>And one of the revealing moments in this documents that I read last night  is when J Edgar Hoover tips off Bobby Kennedy and says there's book coming  out next year bout you and Marilyn Monroe.  Giving the Kennedy's time to  issue other books to dilute that book and to get their answers ready, that  tells me why these docs are really hidden from the public.  There are  people who would be embarrassed by them.</p><p>REGAN:  Dough, thank you so much.  Good to see you.</p><p>WEAD:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  The White House briefing just wrapping up moments ago,  our own Blake Burman was there and he has a very important question about  the President 401K tax position.  Let's listen.  We got the question and  the answer I believe. There we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Is the president considering dropping the amount of pre taxed  contributions that Americans can put in to their 401(k) currently?  That  said about $18,000.  It seems is that this whole issue is up for  negotiation.  Does the president support taking that $18,000 a level and  potentially lowering that?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  As I said earlier  this week the president wants to continue to fight and push for protection  of Americans retirement.  And that hasn't changed, but I'm not making any - - negotiate any deals beyond that.  But that's the president's position and  that's the same today as it was earlier this week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I tell you, there's lot of opportunity had as we look at  the market that once again is looking at new a high.  New high anyway on  the Nasdaq, and we have got the Dow up 31 points right now as we head into  the weekend. </p><p>I hope you do have a wonderful one but there's a lot more news coming your  way right now in the final hour of trading.  Liz Claman has you covered.   Hey Liz!</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thank you so  much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, we got stocks at all-time highs on strong  earnings reports plus a gangbuster GDP report, that's the measurement of  our overall economy showing that we grew a lot in 30 percent despite  suffering two major hurricanes last month.  This is some good news.  I'm  Trish Regan.  Welcome everyone to \"The Intelligence Report\" on this Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the Nasdaq on pace for its biggest gain of the year during the strong  tech earnings, and of course that much better than expected, economic  growth, three percent.  So just imagine what kind of growth we might  actually get if Republicans manage to pass tax reform this year.  We're on  it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, three Obama era scandals in the spotlight today, the Russian's  dossier, the Russian uranium deal, and now the IRS.  Not a good week for  President Obama and Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal's\" Kimberly Strassel is here and she is going to  tell us about more bombshells that are on the way.  She joins us straight  ahead.</p><p>Plus, the National Archives refusing to publish some 300 records about the  JFK assassination.  What are they hiding?  Presidential Historian Doug Wead  has a theory.  He has the Intel for you coming up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story here, third quarter GDP, three percent,  how about it.  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment  Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Our own Nicole Petallides down at floor in  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And Keith, it's pretty good, I mean, especially considering we had a couple  hurricanes in there.</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  This is  knock the leather off the ball time, you know, the thing that's surprising  to me is that Wall Street is claiming they were surprised.  Big tech has  been the story, not just a story, the story, for a long time.  And it will  continue to change the world we live in.</p><p>REGAN:  I love it.  Nicole, down on the floor, are they surprised?  I mean,  I didn't get expectations have been tempered somewhat knowing that we  clearly had gone through a lot in the past quarter with all the hurricanes  and yet, a pretty stellar report.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  It really is.  For the GDP,  obviously, we saw that three percent gain.  That was more than expected.   You noted Hurricane Harvey and Irma.  And we thought that could cut into  it.  But it didn't.  And the big picture here is that earnings and  employment have continued to boost optimism going forward and now with  these tech earnings today, blowout.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  Hey, it's looking pretty good, as we said Nasdaq on pace to  hit a record.</p><p>Joining me right now, Kingsview Asset Management as well CIO, Scott Martin.   Scott, how much of this is attributable to just the sort of secular shift  if you would, or cyclical shift rather in the economy?  How much is  attributable to the president?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  I think a lot of it Trish,  I mean, you guys were talking about the GDP numbers.  You know a lot of  pick up in GDP this quarter -- past quarter rather in this report was  businesses, right?  Because the consumers got hit with the hurricanes, but  businesses picked up the slack, because Trish, as I like to say, gone is  the -- you didn't build that message that was just delivered to the  business community over and over again by President Obama.</p><p>And now it is, how can we help you, Mr. And Mrs. Businessman and woman,  from D.C.?  So that's why businesses are going out there confident,  spending, and hiring workers, which is going to drive the S&amp;P prices  higher, because of the fact that businesses are back in this country.</p><p>REGAN:  That's good stuff.  I like the sound of that, Keith.  It's -- you  can't underestimate, Keith, how much psychology and sentiment plays?  What  kind of role it plays, when you're out there repealing regulations one  after another.  When you're out there promising lower taxes for business  owners, for corporations and for individuals, what does that do to overall  confidence levels?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  It brings into play the most important word in the investment  vocabulary, certainty, because CEOs want and need certainty to spend and  gain customers.  Customers need certainty because they know the companies  that they're going to buy from are dependable, and the markets need  certainty because it means there is stability.</p><p>So to me, this a win, win, win, all the way across the board.  It's  important political nonsense aside, because the CEOs are the ones who have  to navigate this on behalf of their shareholders.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, so Scott, assuming the tax reform happens, we're looking  at a market that's 23,434 on the Dow right now.  Where do we go?</p><p>MARTIN:  Easy, Dow 25,000, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>MARTIN:  And it's probably relatively soon, you know, we'll get this,  probably not.  And maybe by the end of the year, maybe in 2018 which is OK,  because that's about going forward that the market really wants to see.   And so, I think you are easily going to see the Dow pop here as we're going  in end of the year, especially given as you guys talked about.  It's really  amazingly strong earnings report that we're just seeing today from say,  some of the Google and the Amazons of the world.  Plus we got Facebook and  Apple next week.  So don't forget -- </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: -- we got another lift coming I think in matter of days too.</p><p>REGAN:  Is that what you're hearing Nicole?</p><p>PETALLIDES:  In Washington I mean, what you're seeing in Washington, you  still see the ball rolling.  I know we've been talking a lot about tax  reform, budgets and that really still, well, on its way.  Everybody bet on  that.  And you couple that with the great earnings this season that we've  seen.  And fundamentals, things have improved.  I know it feels crazy in  the run-up that we've seen, all-time highs, one record after another.  And  sure, everybody is always cautious and watching, but the feeling is still  optimistic big picture, for the longer term.  And what a day today with  this tech earnings blowout numbers.</p><p>REGAN:  Indeed.  Well, thank you so much.  Good to see you all, Keith,  Scott, and Nicole.</p><p>The DOJ lifting a gag order everyone, on an FBI informant who could  potentially blow the lid off this entire Uranium One scandal.  He's going  to be speaking to at least three Congressional committees who only now want  to get to the bottom of why this deal was ever allowed in the first place.</p><p>Let's go to Blake Burman.  He's live at the White House with the latest on  this.  Blake, there could be some pretty interesting stuff in his  testimony.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and Trish, here is what we  could tell you.  That President Trump here at White House, last week,  rather during a meeting made it clear that he thought it was appropriate  for the Department of Justice to go forward to lift this gag order on this  confidential informant.  This informant was speaking with the FBI when it  was looking several years back into possible bribery and extortion by  Russian energy officials.</p><p>Now, that informant is going to be able to talk to Congressional  investigators.  That informant's attorney saying earlier today claiming  that her client might be able to draw a link between the Clintons and the  Uranium One deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY:  We have the Clinton Foundation getting tens  of millions of dollars from the same people involved in the deal.  So you  got it, right there, the quid pro quo.  Now my client can put some meat on  those bones and tell you what the Russians were saying during that time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, now it is -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The White House, though, is now forced to defend the president's  involvement in this high-level decision.  Here is Kellyanne Conway earlier  today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  There are some reports that  the president interfered, the president weighed in.  Not unusual for a  president to weigh in on any other topics, but remember, Chairman Grassley  got that party started last week when he asked the Department of Justice to  allow the FBI informant to speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Trish, one of the bottom line here is after months of this Russian  investigation being put on President Trump and those within his orbit, the  president and White House very clearly feel that they are now able to turn  this headline around on to the other side.  For example, the president  tweeted out earlier today, and I quote here he said, \"It is now commonly  agreed after many months of costly looking that there was no collusion  between Russia and Trump.  Was collusion with H.C.\"  Of course that being  Hillary Clinton.  Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, we want to talk about this a little more.  Blake  Burman, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now with his take former Deputy Secretary for Policy at  the Department of Homeland Security, Paul Rosenzweig.  Good, you here,  Paul.</p><p>Given your background, given your background there at Homeland Security,  are you surprised that a deal like this went through?</p><p>PAUL ROSENZWEIG, FMR DEPUTY SECY FOR POLICY, DHS:  Not really.  It was  approved or rather it was not blocked by a committee -- the Committee of  Foreign Investment in the United States, which actually has nine cabinet  agencies sitting in it, as well as director of National Intelligence.</p><p>And in this case, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look to the deal as  well and approved it.  As far as one can tell from looking at the  historical record, there was really no dispute about it.  And that's pretty  unsurprising given that, yes, in many ways -- </p><p>REGAN:  Yes, OK, so but I heard and understand what you're saying here,  sir, because you're saying, it's a little surprising that there is no  dispute.  And by the way, there was some dispute, not from members of  CFIUS, the nine people that were sitting on CFIUS, including State  Department and treasury, et cetera.</p><p>But there was concern, I mean, Chuck Grassley sending a note to Loretta  Lynch at the time.  We do know that there was an FBI investigation going  into or delving into whether or not, Vladimir Putin was trying to gain  undue (ph) influence in our atomic energy sector.</p><p>So by the way, when you got the Russian state energy company trying to  purchase Uranium One in the United States of America, I would just think  that that would send off some red flags.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Well, apparently not.  The Nuclear Regulatory -- well, let's  start with that.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved this because  the ore that they purchased doesn't get exported.  Uranium One didn't have  an export license.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  And also amounted to no more than two percent -- </p><p>REGAN:  But it was exported?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No, it wasn't ma'am, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  approved the deal on the grounds that Uranium One did not have a -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK, so they approved it under assumption that it wouldn't actually  be exported?  But, Paul, let me share with you -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- they are the ones who issues the licenses.</p><p>REGAN:  It could get exported.  For \"The New York Times\" -- </p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right?</p><p>REGAN:  Here's a quote \"New York Times\", 2015, April, where they were  talking about how there was one particular individual there who was saying  that -- </p><p>ROSENWEIG:  -- that he saw some of the yellowcake in this property going  on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right, he didn't say anything to that whether or not it was  part -- it was owned by Uranium One and whether or not it was returned  after processing right?</p><p>REGAN:  If you would let me finish I will tell you exactly what \"The New  York Times\" reported, \"Asked about the commission, it confirmed that  Uranium one has in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada.\"</p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  OK, so there you go.  The commission confirmed that Uranium One  has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada, even though it does not have an  export license.  So if you try and tell me, none of their stuff left the  country, well, that's just wrong.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Now, here's a good question for you.  How much uranium does  the United States consume every year?</p><p>REGAN:  I don't know.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Fifty million-pound, roughly.  How much do we make  domestically?</p><p>REGAN:  I don't know.  Tell me.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  About 10 percent of that, about 5 million.  What's the uranium  production from Uranium One?</p><p>REGAN:  Twenty percent of the U.S. supply.  Listen, I don't care.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG:  Right.  So 20 percent of -- </p><p>REGAN:  What you're trying to say is somehow this was OK that this deal  happened.  Because there are some just basic things -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN: -- in the world.  And that is that you do not allow the supply of  uranium to go to the Russians.  I mean, why would you allow that?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No.  Not to go to the Russians.  Not to go to the Russians.   To be -- the mining contracts went -- were owned by the Russian Rosatom.   But you don't know -- you've not told me anything about where the -- </p><p>REGAN:  Well, we just talked how the uranium went to Canada, Paul.  We just  talked about that and Uranium One confirming that.  OK?  So, you know, once  it goes to Canada, I don't know where it goes from there.</p><p>But the point is that uranium is strategic resource, so why is it nobody at  CFIUS, including Hillary Clinton, by the way, who is running State  Department at that time even care.</p><p>Let me also ask you this Paul, why is it that that, by the way, during the  Bush administration we were concerned about Russia.  We really were, I  mean, I cited a foreign affairs article the other day from the CFR where  (INAUDIBLE) was talking about the threat of Vladimir Putin.  It was the  cover article back in 2007.  I remember the lobster summit in  Kennebunkport, which I covered in Maine.</p><p>A lot of concerns about Putin back then.  And then suddenly Hillary Clinton  becomes Secretary of State.  And President Obama is there and suddenly  we're approving deals like this while simultaneously $146 million is going  to the Clinton Foundation?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Well, I don't know anything about the deals with the Clinton  Foundation, except that most of the money went about two years before this  deal was, went down.</p><p>So, you know, that -- I really don't have any information about that.  What  I do know is that CFIUS committee is charged with examining whether or not  there is a -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- national security concern and they determined that there was  not.  And the reason there's not is because two percent of the U.S.'s  uranium production is not a material concern to the United -- </p><p>REGAN:  That tells me that they're either incompetent or something else is  going on, because uranium is -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No, I think they're exercising their best judgment, that  you're second-guessing.</p><p>REGAN: -- should be giving that to a Russian state-controlled company.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Look, I think Hillary is liar in most instances.  I spent most  of my life trying to prosecute her, right, with the Whitewater  investigation.  So I'm not one to give her any credit at all.  But when a  committee of United States that is mostly run by career bureaucrats says  that there's no problem, you know, to try and hang that on her without the  least bit of evidence that she had any knowledge of it is kind of  frivolous.</p><p>REGAN: -- because you know, it wasn't just Hillary Clinton.  These were all  Clintonites, actually, if you look at this list.  You got Eric Holder  there, you got Janet Napolitano.  You got a whole bunch of people, Steven  Chu, Tim Geithner that were close to Clinton, close to Obama.  And I would  only point out when you talk about the money that's changing hands.  You  said this money came in two years before this deal.</p><p>Well, $500,000 went to Bill Clinton in the weeks after over the first  speaking event in Russia.  And I get, I would just once again ask like,  there's nobody think that's inappropriate?  Does nobody think that's  bizarre?  A $146 million to the Clinton Foundation while she is Secretary  of State from Russia and $500K for a gig speaking there from the Russians  to Bill Clinton?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Nobody says that the Clinton Foundation should have been  taking this money.  They probably should not have been taking money from  any foreign source as long as the past of -- she was Secretary of State.   But to suggest the Uranium One deal is outside the bounds of normal  procedure is really just to be indulging in with respect to conspiracy  theories.</p><p>REGAN:  No.  No.  You're wrong on that.  I mean, we had a lot of concerns  about Russia.  We still have a lot of concerns about Russia.  And I really  question -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  I agree with you.  I have lots of concerns about Russia.  I  worry about the president's decision to try and lift sanctions.</p><p>REGAN:  To the Russians.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG:  That's the type of concern I have.</p><p>REGAN:  So it tells me it's either incompetence on the part of our  government or there's something else at play.  Paul, thank you very much  for joining us, thanks very much.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Thanks for having me.  It's a great pleasure.</p><p>REGAN:  Congress taking a major step forward in passing tax reform, but a  battle is growing between Republicans from high-taxed states and those from  low-taxed states.  Are we heading for a showdown?</p><p>Plus, the IRS finally admitting it targeted conservative and Tea Party  groups and the DOJ is paying out big time.  Stay with me.  I'm back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Here we are just days away from seeing the first text of the  Republican tax form bill.  Are you excited?  The big question is going to  be, is it going to get rid of state and local tax deductions?  And look, I  said this many times on this show, I like getting a state and local tax  deduction.  Heck, I live in New York City, right?</p><p>But the reality is those deductions that I'm allowed to take they aren't  really entirely fair.  Because while they benefit New York or California or  New Jersey, they don't do much good for Texas or New Hampshire or Florida,  because you don't have any state income tax there that you can deduct.  So  you see what's happening.  Essentially, part of the country is helping to  subsidize spending in these blue states.  And the president is calling that  out.</p><p>But Republican lawmakers from those blue states, because there are a few  Republicans in the blue states, they say, they're not going to pass a bill  that gets rids of these deductions.  So is this turning into a massive  showdown?  We're going to Connell McShane for the latest.  Hey Connell!</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE. FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Trish.  Yes, well,  they might need the votes from those Republican lawmakers that you allude  to.  So they are working on a compromise for that, for the deduction issue.   There's also a lot of interesting talk here in Washington today about  401(k) contributions.  OK, so I'll get to that in a second.  But since you  brought up the deductions, so let's start with that.</p><p>We had 20 no votes on the budget yesterday in the House.  And 11 of the 20  were New York and New Jersey representatives on the Republican side.  So  that really tells you how important this issue is.  And leadership is  talking to those members but he's trying to kind of work something out that  maybe softens the blow.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX), 8TH DISTRICT WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We  know as we're working with these lawmakers, that if you couple lower taxes,  a bigger child tax credit and we work with, to find a compromise on state  and local, we can help Americans in every bracket keep more of what they  earn.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you know, the other possibility is you have the deductions  going away for some people but not for others.  Maybe there's some sort of  an upper income limit put on it, but again, a lot being talked about there.</p><p>Now on the 401(k) issue, you remember the president brought that up in a  tweet.  But that got very interesting earlier today as well.  You just  heard from Chairman Brady.  I was speaking to him about this a little bit  earlier the day and he has made a suggestion, in fact, he's told us that he  talked to the president about this, where the limit on contributions to  your 401(k) plan, they might actually increase of its 18,000 now, up to  20,000 plus.  But there's a big catch.</p><p>All the money wouldn't be tax-free as part of this compromise.  Some of  that tax-free savings might go to the backs end rather than the front end.   And that's to save money for the tax reform effort.  Here's more of the  rationale.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BRADY:  Those 401(k)'s most people are saving $200 or less a month.  That  won't do it in retirement.  They're going to be in trouble.</p><p>So we're asking experts how we can help theses families save more.  And so  we're working to reach a good solution there.  If not, we'll leave them as  they are.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  As they are.  Now that's basically, Trish, where we are right  now.  I should tell you there is still a very ambitious timeline up here.   I mean Chairman Brady has talked about this a number of times.  But they  want to get the bill introduced by next week and still talking about at  getting it passed by Thanksgiving.  But two issues, the deductions in the  401(k), still going to work something out.</p><p>REGAN:  Thanks so much, Connell.</p><p>The IRS, everyone, finally admitting it did target conservatives and Tea  Party groups.  And The DOJ is paying out big time.</p><p>But will any heads roll over this blatant abuse of power?  And finally what  does this telling you about the Obama Administration?  They passed a deal  to allow the Russians to buy 20 percent of our uranium assets.</p><p>That's very skeptical.  And now we're learning what they did, targeting,  deliberately targeting conservatives and Tea Party activists.  We're on it.</p><p>Plus \"The Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel is here.  She's running  about the so-called dirty dossier about President Trump, and she is warning  right now that there are many Russian bombshells to come, if and when the  bank records of who paid for this thing are actually uncovered.  She's got  a lot of Intel for you.  Do not miss it.  Stay with me.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  We got another scandal to talk about today from the Obama era.   As the Trump Justice Department is forced to settle two lawsuits that date  back to the Obama administration.  The IRS admitting in court documents  that intentionally delayed tax-exempt status for Tea Party and conservative  groups.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions says there's no excuse for this  conduct.  And then on to President Trump, this abuse of power will not be  tolerated.</p><p>Joining me with more, American majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  Abuse of power, is  that what it is?</p><p>NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Yes.  Oh, Absolutely.  I mean Trish  we're not dealing -- we weren't dealing with just dozens of Tea Party and  conservative groups.  This is hundreds and hundreds almost 500.</p><p>By the time you add everything up.  And I guess the question I would have  for those watching is, do you really think the IRS of its own volition just  decided to target Tea Party groups and conservatives?  I mean IRS,  bureaucrats acting of their own volition.</p><p>I think this went higher and it is kind of a microcosm of what a lot of us  were concerned about with the Obama administration that it was weaponizing  governments, the states against those that opposed it.  And so, when you  look at the IRS scandal, again it's just one of many things that concerned  us during the Obama administration.  People in D.C. and New York, still  don't understand why 2016 happened and this is a microcosm of why it  happened.  People are losing trust in their institutions.</p><p>REGAN:  And it leads you, of course, down the path of looking it what  happened with that, now infamous dossier.  And was the FBI -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  </p><p>REGAN: -- under President Obama using that in order to wiretap.  Save that  because I want to ask you something else and Kimberly Strassel is going to  be on momentarily to talk about that.  But I know you've been digging into  the Uranium One story quite extensively.</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  </p><p>REGAN:  And, you know, we just heard from a guest who sat on homeland  security who try to tell us, look, you know, this is no big deal.   Absolutely no big deal at all that all -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's true.</p><p>REGAN: -- these people at CFIUS day signed off on it.  And he also tried to  say, Ned that none of this uranium left the country, when in fact we know  that it went to Canada.  And we know that in part because Uranium One  confirmed it in April 2015 that this uranium went to Canada.  And who knows  what it happens to the uranium once it's out of the country.</p><p>RYUN:  No.  This is correct, Trish.  And to say that this is no big deal,  I'm sorry you had nine people, CFIUS members.  Again, Hillary Clinton and  Eric Holder, and Timothy Geithner, you can look on my Twitter feed and see  all these names.</p><p>These people in expedited fashion, usually these things, Trish, 75 to 90  days they're looking at this deals started first part of August of 2010,  and it was approved by October 22nd, 2010.  It was expedited process.  Most  to this time when you're dealing with something such national security  implications, usually 120 days.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I just want to point out.  You're saying national  security implications.  And, you know, you're the guest who said, no, no,  no national security.  I would just say and I'm reading the name of this  company that bought 51 percent stake in Uranium One, it's called ARMZ  Uranium Holdings and it's from Russia, right?</p><p>So if that's not enough to kind of red flag some of this called Uranium  Holdings.  How about this?  Guess who owns, ARMZ Uranium Holdings it's  Rosatom which stands for --</p><p>RYUN:  Rosatom.</p><p>REGAN: -- Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.  And no one cares?</p><p>RYUN:  By the way, we're also helping Iran build these nuclear facilities  and training Iranian nuclear scientists.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  And we knew that back in 2007.</p><p>RYUN:  And the thing about it is, it wasn't as though Republicans weren't  raising red flags.  On October 5th, 2010, Republicans sent a letter to  Timothy Geithner and said, we have real issues with this deal.  And you  know what they did?  They went ahead signed off on it basically two weeks  later and said this deal was fine to go forward.</p><p>There are a lot of questions, and I think the only way we get to bottom of  this, Trish is we have all nine of those CFIUS voting members, brought to  the Hill, put under oath in a public setting and asked, why did you approve  this deal?  Why did you do it in expedited fashion?  And we get answers  because I think we deserve answers.</p><p>Was this to help Russia come in on a terrible Iranian deal, or even worse,  Trish, was this some sort of a payback to Democrat and Clinton Foundation  donors as I thank you for all the support they've gotten?  We deserve  answers.</p><p>REGAN:  You're hitting on something that I think is very interesting  because as I've been telling the viewer and I remember covering Russia, the  Ukraine elections, I covered the lobster --</p><p>RYUN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- summit in Kennebunkport.  And during the Ukrainian elections it  was very clear the Ukraine's were definitely warning about Russia as a real  threat.  As I've been citing (INAUDIBLE) -- cover article in 2007 in the  foreign affairs journal from the CFR where she basically outlined exactly  what Putin was up to and his imperialistic tendency.  She talked about his  support of those in Iran that were doing bad stuff.  And she warned of  everything.</p><p>We knew about this that Condoleezza Rice was there.  And she was a Russian  scholar.  She knew exactly what was at stake.  There was a lot of concern  and yet, Ned, everything shifted, when President Obama came into office,  Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, the last guest try to say, well,  you know, that that money they went to the Clinton Foundation that happened  two years before that deal was approved.  But if you follow your logic,  perhaps that was money well-spent as far as Russians go.</p><p>Now I'm not saying anything.  I just think that say it looks awfully  suspicious that we changed our policy tone towards Russia shortly after -- </p><p>RYUN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN: --in the years after all this money had been pouring into the  Clinton Foundation.  I mean, why you're going not to be -- not getting  along with someone who's giving you so much money?</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  There are a lot of questions.  And again Trish, there  are a lot of questions that still need to be answered.  And you make a good  point.</p><p>We knew who Russia was at this point.  We also knew, the CFIUS board  members, this voting board members knew that there was actually a bribery  case taking place that the FBI uncovered and regards this uranium deal.   And they also knew exactly what Russia was doing.  It was trying to Annex  Georgia this time.  It was threatening Ukraine.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  It was also threatening Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia with small  nuclear weapons.  We knew exactly what was going on and we still approved  this deal in expedited fashion.  Bring these nine CFIUS voting members to  the Hill.  Put them under oath either in front of the House Intelligence  Committee or the Senate Judiciary Committee to get answers.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  There are questions that need to be answer for sure.  I mean  they've -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's right.</p><p>REGAN: -- long needed to be answered.  But now we know in fact the FBI was  investigating Vladimir Putin for trying to have outsized reach in our  atomic energy industry at the same time that they were approving this deal.   So yes lots of questions.  Ned Ryun good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel writing about the so-called  dirty dossier on President Trump warning of, \"The coming Russian  Bombshells\" if and when those bank records of those who paid for this whole  thing are uncovered.  She's here to explain what those bank records might  reveal.  Kimberly's here.  She's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  New questions today over the controversial and unverified and  largely discredited anti-Trump dossier.  Top Democrats are passing the buck  here, claiming they had no idea that the dirty document was ever being  compiled, let alone that they have anything to do with paying for it.  Of  course now we have learned that the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign were  funneling money through a law firm in order to dig up all this disgusting  stuff.</p><p>Joining me right now with more, \"Wall Street Journal\" writer, Kimberley  Strassel.  She says even more Russia-linked bombshells are on the way.   Good to see you, Kimberley.  What do you mean by that?</p><p>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WRITER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Hi, Trish.  So I think  people need to ask themselves why it is that Fusion, this oppo research  firm, finally came out and said who had hired it, the DNC and the Clinton  campaign.  They have resisted doing that for almost an entire year.  They  had Democrats and Congress helping them and then suddenly boom, they give  the names.</p><p>And it's because there is something they want to hide even more than those  names and that is their bank records.  And I think they thought, or hoped  that by putting these names out there, that maybe the House investigators  would drop their subpoena is for the bank records.  House investigators are  not doing that.  But it's very clear Fusion, which has taken then to court,  does not want them to see what's in those bank records.</p><p>REGAN:  So the bank records would tell us basically, who all their clients  were, who was paying them?</p><p>STRASSEL:  Well I think House investigators will probably be careful not to  drag any of Fusion's clients out into the open that have nothing to do with  this investigation.  But let's just say we know, for instance, that Fusion  in the past has had contacts and contracts with Russians.  One of those  Russians, Natalia Veselnitskaya, she worked for a company called Prevezon.   You know, she was one that recently ended up in Donald Trump, Jr.'s office  having a meeting with him.</p><p>Is she linked up with Fusion?  Are they still working because if there was  money coming from Russia simultaneous to the fact that they were working on  this dossier, it brings up some questions about whether or not the Russians  didn't know this dossier project was on going and sought to influence it.</p><p>REGAN:  So, in other words, this was a disinformation campaign that Fusion  GPS was putting together and your thinking on this might be that the  Russians had a direct hand in this.  That they somehow wanted to be  involved in this disinformation.</p><p>STRASSEL:  Well, what we do know from the dossier's author, he writes it in  the dossier.  Is that a lot of this, the allegation, which you said have  been almost entirely disprove and -- were based off of tips and knowledge  from anonymous Russian sources.  So I think the question we have to ask  ourselves is, was the Kremlin aware that this dossier was being put  together?  And they did they deliberately, yes, feed false information to  this British intelligence officer to inject that into our political system.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, hen, how on earth does the FBI fall for that, Kimberly?  I  mean, how is it that -- and by the way, I would just point out that most  journalist organizations, this thing had been floating out there, and they  found it discredited, so they never bothered  published it, except for  \"BuzzFeed\", and that certainly a whole other debate as to whether they even  are a journalist organization.  But no one published this, right?</p><p>And, yet the FBI, Kimberly, took this to heart.  And said OK, now we're  going to have to look into all these campaign folks and wiretapping, et  cetera, et cetera?</p><p>STRASSEL:  Yes.  This is the other huge unanswered question here.  I keep  trying to remind people just to contemplate this one sentence.  We had law  enforcement agencies working for a government opposition party from one  that's in now.</p><p>Basically, wiretapping in a presidential election campaign, which is a  pretty astonishing thought when you think about it.  Now add in the  possibility that it was relying or justifying that investigation on the  basis of a Democratic commissioned opposition research document that was  sourced from anonymous Russians.  And you just have to wonder, you know,  who was in charge there?</p><p>Now, we still don't know the answers to that question.  The dossier file in  the FBI is supposed to go to Congress this next week, but then we may have  a better sense of how much it was used.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  All right, well, Kimberly thanks you so much.  Appreciate all  your Intel on this and we'll keep talking to you about it.  Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right everyone, let's go to Spain for a minute because people  are taking to the streets there after the Catalan parliament voted today in  favor of independence from Spain.  They want to break apart away from the  rest of Spain, taking the country's deepening political crisis here into  uncharted territory.</p><p>Spain is Europe's fifth largest economy and whatever happens there could  certainly have major financial implications.</p><p>The U.S. is not wild about this, but I'll tell you having spent a lot of  time in Barcelona, they have always had this separatist strain in their  population and it's really coming to a head right now.  So we'll go to  Spain right after this, with more pictures.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Breaking news right now.  Can you imagine if Texas said, you know  what, see you United States of America, we want to break off on to our own?   That's effectively what's happening in Barcelona, Spain, right now.  You  see people celebrating there in the street.</p><p>The prime minister there in Spain is dissolving their Catalonia Parliament  following the region's history vote declaring independent from Spain.  In  other words, the people there in Barcelona and Catalonia have said, see you  to Spain, I guess see you to the E.U. but is that going to fly?  Let's go  to Ashley Webster who joins me with the latest now.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely not.  There they  are celebrating in Barcelona tonight.  Huge dark cloud on the horizon is  that no one recognizes Catalonia as an independent state, not the EU, not  the UK, not the U.S., Germany, France have all pitched in and said we don't  even recognize you.  We do not believe you are an independent state.</p><p>Now, Catalonia says well, you know, we'd be happy to be still in the EU.   EU says where you are because you're part of Spain.  So the question now  is, this has been going on and building and building a game of chicken and  here we are, what happens next?  Does this really descend into civil  disobedience?</p><p>What happens when Madrid tries to dissolve the parliament?  Maybe arrest  those Catalonian leaders that held the vote in the first place?  What do  the Catalan police do?  Are they loyal to Madrid or are they loyal to  Catalonia?   There's a lot of big questions here.</p><p>REGAN:  I want to point again this is coming to us live from Spain right  now from Barcelona.  And this is something that has been going on for  sometimes, I have shared with you, Ashley, the story when I was a young  student over there in Spain studying Spanish.  And I got to Spain, I was  all excited.  And they started speaking Catalan to me, so much for all my  Spanish.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Excuse me?</p><p>REGAN:  But really you get into a taxicab and they speak Catalan, because  it was so ingrained to them that they were Catalanian or Catalonian first - - </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And before they were Spanish back in the years of Franco, for  example, they were not allowed to speak Spanish, forgive me Catalan.  He  made them speak Spanish</p><p>And so, this is been something that has been brewing for some time.  And  now there's a lot of economic components to it as well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Huge.</p><p>REGAN:  Given how successful they are.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, listen.  We're in uncharted territory.  What happens?</p><p>At least 1500 companies have already moved out of Catalonia.  So, major  banks have moved their headquarters out of Catalonia, very worried about  what happens next.  So there is a big economic hit.  This is very rich  region of Spain, 25 percent of the GDP comes out of this one region.   It's  upset -- </p><p>REGAN:  It is little like Greece and Germany?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Pretty much.  Catalonia believes it pays way too much in taxes  and gets way too little back compared to the rest of the country.  Now, all  of the sudden we're going to have to basks in Spain and the Corsicans in  France, in the Northern League in Italy, and the Bavarians in Germany.   Then they will lose in Belgium.  The EU is very concerned that they don't  want cracks to stop forming in the union where there are cracks.</p><p>REGAN:  And there are, I mean let's -- yes Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Brexit.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean Brexit is a great example.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Scotland.  What about Scotland Island?  It's covering the  Scottish independence.  I mean, they covered that vote, there were large  group of Catalonians in Edinburgh egging them on to vote for independence.   That's how, you know, strong they are for their statehood.</p><p>REGAN:  So, ultimately?  We don't know.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We don't know but I -- it's going to be an uphill battle for  Catalonia to get their own statehood.  Let's put it that way.</p><p>REGAN:  Ashley, thank you very much.</p><p>WEBSTER:  My pleasure</p><p>REGAN:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Interesting story, the national archives releasing some, but not  all, of the long secret files relating to the 1963 assassination of  President JFK.  President Trump blocked the release of nearly 300 records  on the urging of CIA, and the FBI, those files are going to be under review  for another six months.  Those that were released described how federal  agents madly chased after tips, after rumors and leads worldwide.</p><p>But the fact that some were held back, well, you know, that's fueling a  whole lot more speculation.  And by the way, they were held back because of  national security concerns.  What does that mean?</p><p>Presidential historian Doug Wead is back with me.  And Doug, you know, one  of the interesting things in all of this, is that we have learned that  Oswald went to Mexico City for a meeting at the Soviet embassy shortly  before this all transpired.  Does that lead you in any direction towards  maybe the Soviets, the Soviets perhaps, and the Cubans combined had a hand  in this?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  That was my thought.</p><p>WEAD:  All of the conspiracy theories, all of them are alive, and there is  a bunch more after we've seen these documents.  It is truly, truly  stunning.</p><p>REGAN:  But I mean is there any one that sticks out more so than others  given what we know thus far? </p><p>WEAD:  Here is what sticks out to me, Trish, and that's the questions that  the American people were asking, that the taxicab driver, the beautician  asking.  They were the right questions.  And the elite media and the  government tried to make us feel like we're idiots and conspiracy  theorists, but, they themselves are asking this question.</p><p>Richard Helms, the director of the CIA, sends out a memo that's in these  documents and says was he one of ours?  Meaning Oswald, was he a CIA agent?   So, this isn't some blogger from Tulsa.  This is the director of the CIA  asking that question.</p><p>And then there is LBJ, LBJ is quoted in here as saying, the reason John F.  Kennedy was assassinated was because he himself assassinated Ngo Dinh Diem,  the president of our ally, president of South Vietnam, who was a fellow  catholic.  I mean, this, again, is president of the United States making  this allegation in these documents.  No wonder they wanted to keep them  hidden.</p><p>REGAN:  So what is your suspicion?  Do you question all of this as well?  I  mean do you think that there is more to this story than was ever presented  to the public?</p><p>WEAD:  Oh, obviously so here because the principals themselves thought  that.  Johnson thought that.  Helms thought that.</p><p>You can -- we've got to apologize to all the conspiracy theorists.  They  may not have the right conclusions. We don't know those conclusions and  maybe that's the lone gunman as many say.  But they certainly had the right  questions and the questions they were asking should have been asked and no  one should have been shamed from talking about it.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Doug, I guess now the concern is national security,  right?  And I understand that, by the way.  I kept saying, well the  president surely must know what's in these documents before they get  released because I would think that you run the risk of anyone maybe being  named that was a spy for us, possibly still being a live and being put into  jeopardy.  And also he is citing national security concerns, which makes me  wonder, if it was another country involved in this assassination, do we run  the risk of flaring up a scenario and perhaps is the reason why they want  to be more careful?</p><p>I don't fault them by the way for wanting to be more careful.  Because it  is all sensitive stuff and you don't want to find yourself in a situation  where we're going into some World War III over something done that many  years ago, Doug.</p><p>WEAD:  I don't think that's the problem.  I think it's political and it's  personal.  Trish, when I wrote the book, \"All the President's Children,\" I  had the Warren G. Harding family lobbying me not to include the story of  his illegitimate daughter which is now proven by DNA.  But that tells you  the pressure that was on.</p><p>And one of the revealing moments in this documents that I read last night  is when J Edgar Hoover tips off Bobby Kennedy and says there's book coming  out next year bout you and Marilyn Monroe.  Giving the Kennedy's time to  issue other books to dilute that book and to get their answers ready, that  tells me why these docs are really hidden from the public.  There are  people who would be embarrassed by them.</p><p>REGAN:  Dough, thank you so much.  Good to see you.</p><p>WEAD:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  The White House briefing just wrapping up moments ago,  our own Blake Burman was there and he has a very important question about  the President 401K tax position.  Let's listen.  We got the question and  the answer I believe. There we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Is the president considering dropping the amount of pre taxed  contributions that Americans can put in to their 401(k) currently?  That  said about $18,000.  It seems is that this whole issue is up for  negotiation.  Does the president support taking that $18,000 a level and  potentially lowering that?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  As I said earlier  this week the president wants to continue to fight and push for protection  of Americans retirement.  And that hasn't changed, but I'm not making any - - negotiate any deals beyond that.  But that's the president's position and  that's the same today as it was earlier this week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I tell you, there's lot of opportunity had as we look at  the market that once again is looking at new a high.  New high anyway on  the Nasdaq, and we have got the Dow up 31 points right now as we head into  the weekend. </p><p>I hope you do have a wonderful one but there's a lot more news coming your  way right now in the final hour of trading.  Liz Claman has you covered.   Hey Liz!</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thank you so  much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, we got stocks at all-time highs on strong  earnings reports plus a gangbuster GDP report, that's the measurement of  our overall economy showing that we grew a lot in 30 percent despite  suffering two major hurricanes last month.  This is some good news.  I'm  Trish Regan.  Welcome everyone to \"The Intelligence Report\" on this Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the Nasdaq on pace for its biggest gain of the year during the strong  tech earnings, and of course that much better than expected, economic  growth, three percent.  So just imagine what kind of growth we might  actually get if Republicans manage to pass tax reform this year.  We're on  it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, three Obama era scandals in the spotlight today, the Russian's  dossier, the Russian uranium deal, and now the IRS.  Not a good week for  President Obama and Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal's\" Kimberly Strassel is here and she is going to  tell us about more bombshells that are on the way.  She joins us straight  ahead.</p><p>Plus, the National Archives refusing to publish some 300 records about the  JFK assassination.  What are they hiding?  Presidential Historian Doug Wead  has a theory.  He has the Intel for you coming up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story here, third quarter GDP, three percent,  how about it.  Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment  Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald.  Our own Nicole Petallides down at floor in  New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And Keith, it's pretty good, I mean, especially considering we had a couple  hurricanes in there.</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS:  This is  knock the leather off the ball time, you know, the thing that's surprising  to me is that Wall Street is claiming they were surprised.  Big tech has  been the story, not just a story, the story, for a long time.  And it will  continue to change the world we live in.</p><p>REGAN:  I love it.  Nicole, down on the floor, are they surprised?  I mean,  I didn't get expectations have been tempered somewhat knowing that we  clearly had gone through a lot in the past quarter with all the hurricanes  and yet, a pretty stellar report.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  It really is.  For the GDP,  obviously, we saw that three percent gain.  That was more than expected.   You noted Hurricane Harvey and Irma.  And we thought that could cut into  it.  But it didn't.  And the big picture here is that earnings and  employment have continued to boost optimism going forward and now with  these tech earnings today, blowout.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  Hey, it's looking pretty good, as we said Nasdaq on pace to  hit a record.</p><p>Joining me right now, Kingsview Asset Management as well CIO, Scott Martin.   Scott, how much of this is attributable to just the sort of secular shift  if you would, or cyclical shift rather in the economy?  How much is  attributable to the president?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  I think a lot of it Trish,  I mean, you guys were talking about the GDP numbers.  You know a lot of  pick up in GDP this quarter -- past quarter rather in this report was  businesses, right?  Because the consumers got hit with the hurricanes, but  businesses picked up the slack, because Trish, as I like to say, gone is  the -- you didn't build that message that was just delivered to the  business community over and over again by President Obama.</p><p>And now it is, how can we help you, Mr. And Mrs. Businessman and woman,  from D.C.?  So that's why businesses are going out there confident,  spending, and hiring workers, which is going to drive the S&amp;P prices  higher, because of the fact that businesses are back in this country.</p><p>REGAN:  That's good stuff.  I like the sound of that, Keith.  It's -- you  can't underestimate, Keith, how much psychology and sentiment plays?  What  kind of role it plays, when you're out there repealing regulations one  after another.  When you're out there promising lower taxes for business  owners, for corporations and for individuals, what does that do to overall  confidence levels?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD:  It brings into play the most important word in the investment  vocabulary, certainty, because CEOs want and need certainty to spend and  gain customers.  Customers need certainty because they know the companies  that they're going to buy from are dependable, and the markets need  certainty because it means there is stability.</p><p>So to me, this a win, win, win, all the way across the board.  It's  important political nonsense aside, because the CEOs are the ones who have  to navigate this on behalf of their shareholders.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, so Scott, assuming the tax reform happens, we're looking  at a market that's 23,434 on the Dow right now.  Where do we go?</p><p>MARTIN:  Easy, Dow 25,000, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>MARTIN:  And it's probably relatively soon, you know, we'll get this,  probably not.  And maybe by the end of the year, maybe in 2018 which is OK,  because that's about going forward that the market really wants to see.   And so, I think you are easily going to see the Dow pop here as we're going  in end of the year, especially given as you guys talked about.  It's really  amazingly strong earnings report that we're just seeing today from say,  some of the Google and the Amazons of the world.  Plus we got Facebook and  Apple next week.  So don't forget -- </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: -- we got another lift coming I think in matter of days too.</p><p>REGAN:  Is that what you're hearing Nicole?</p><p>PETALLIDES:  In Washington I mean, what you're seeing in Washington, you  still see the ball rolling.  I know we've been talking a lot about tax  reform, budgets and that really still, well, on its way.  Everybody bet on  that.  And you couple that with the great earnings this season that we've  seen.  And fundamentals, things have improved.  I know it feels crazy in  the run-up that we've seen, all-time highs, one record after another.  And  sure, everybody is always cautious and watching, but the feeling is still  optimistic big picture, for the longer term.  And what a day today with  this tech earnings blowout numbers.</p><p>REGAN:  Indeed.  Well, thank you so much.  Good to see you all, Keith,  Scott, and Nicole.</p><p>The DOJ lifting a gag order everyone, on an FBI informant who could  potentially blow the lid off this entire Uranium One scandal.  He's going  to be speaking to at least three Congressional committees who only now want  to get to the bottom of why this deal was ever allowed in the first place.</p><p>Let's go to Blake Burman.  He's live at the White House with the latest on  this.  Blake, there could be some pretty interesting stuff in his  testimony.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and Trish, here is what we  could tell you.  That President Trump here at White House, last week,  rather during a meeting made it clear that he thought it was appropriate  for the Department of Justice to go forward to lift this gag order on this  confidential informant.  This informant was speaking with the FBI when it  was looking several years back into possible bribery and extortion by  Russian energy officials.</p><p>Now, that informant is going to be able to talk to Congressional  investigators.  That informant's attorney saying earlier today claiming  that her client might be able to draw a link between the Clintons and the  Uranium One deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY:  We have the Clinton Foundation getting tens  of millions of dollars from the same people involved in the deal.  So you  got it, right there, the quid pro quo.  Now my client can put some meat on  those bones and tell you what the Russians were saying during that time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, now it is -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The White House, though, is now forced to defend the president's  involvement in this high-level decision.  Here is Kellyanne Conway earlier  today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  There are some reports that  the president interfered, the president weighed in.  Not unusual for a  president to weigh in on any other topics, but remember, Chairman Grassley  got that party started last week when he asked the Department of Justice to  allow the FBI informant to speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Trish, one of the bottom line here is after months of this Russian  investigation being put on President Trump and those within his orbit, the  president and White House very clearly feel that they are now able to turn  this headline around on to the other side.  For example, the president  tweeted out earlier today, and I quote here he said, \"It is now commonly  agreed after many months of costly looking that there was no collusion  between Russia and Trump.  Was collusion with H.C.\"  Of course that being  Hillary Clinton.  Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, we want to talk about this a little more.  Blake  Burman, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now with his take former Deputy Secretary for Policy at  the Department of Homeland Security, Paul Rosenzweig.  Good, you here,  Paul.</p><p>Given your background, given your background there at Homeland Security,  are you surprised that a deal like this went through?</p><p>PAUL ROSENZWEIG, FMR DEPUTY SECY FOR POLICY, DHS:  Not really.  It was  approved or rather it was not blocked by a committee -- the Committee of  Foreign Investment in the United States, which actually has nine cabinet  agencies sitting in it, as well as director of National Intelligence.</p><p>And in this case, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look to the deal as  well and approved it.  As far as one can tell from looking at the  historical record, there was really no dispute about it.  And that's pretty  unsurprising given that, yes, in many ways -- </p><p>REGAN:  Yes, OK, so but I heard and understand what you're saying here,  sir, because you're saying, it's a little surprising that there is no  dispute.  And by the way, there was some dispute, not from members of  CFIUS, the nine people that were sitting on CFIUS, including State  Department and treasury, et cetera.</p><p>But there was concern, I mean, Chuck Grassley sending a note to Loretta  Lynch at the time.  We do know that there was an FBI investigation going  into or delving into whether or not, Vladimir Putin was trying to gain  undue (ph) influence in our atomic energy sector.</p><p>So by the way, when you got the Russian state energy company trying to  purchase Uranium One in the United States of America, I would just think  that that would send off some red flags.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Well, apparently not.  The Nuclear Regulatory -- well, let's  start with that.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved this because  the ore that they purchased doesn't get exported.  Uranium One didn't have  an export license.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  And also amounted to no more than two percent -- </p><p>REGAN:  But it was exported?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No, it wasn't ma'am, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  approved the deal on the grounds that Uranium One did not have a -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK, so they approved it under assumption that it wouldn't actually  be exported?  But, Paul, let me share with you -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- they are the ones who issues the licenses.</p><p>REGAN:  It could get exported.  For \"The New York Times\" -- </p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right?</p><p>REGAN:  Here's a quote \"New York Times\", 2015, April, where they were  talking about how there was one particular individual there who was saying  that -- </p><p>ROSENWEIG:  -- that he saw some of the yellowcake in this property going  on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right, he didn't say anything to that whether or not it was  part -- it was owned by Uranium One and whether or not it was returned  after processing right?</p><p>REGAN:  If you would let me finish I will tell you exactly what \"The New  York Times\" reported, \"Asked about the commission, it confirmed that  Uranium one has in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada.\"</p><p>ROSENWEIG:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  OK, so there you go.  The commission confirmed that Uranium One  has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada, even though it does not have an  export license.  So if you try and tell me, none of their stuff left the  country, well, that's just wrong.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Now, here's a good question for you.  How much uranium does  the United States consume every year?</p><p>REGAN:  I don't know.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Fifty million-pound, roughly.  How much do we make  domestically?</p><p>REGAN:  I don't know.  Tell me.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  About 10 percent of that, about 5 million.  What's the uranium  production from Uranium One?</p><p>REGAN:  Twenty percent of the U.S. supply.  Listen, I don't care.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG:  Right.  So 20 percent of -- </p><p>REGAN:  What you're trying to say is somehow this was OK that this deal  happened.  Because there are some just basic things -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN: -- in the world.  And that is that you do not allow the supply of  uranium to go to the Russians.  I mean, why would you allow that?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No.  Not to go to the Russians.  Not to go to the Russians.   To be -- the mining contracts went -- were owned by the Russian Rosatom.   But you don't know -- you've not told me anything about where the -- </p><p>REGAN:  Well, we just talked how the uranium went to Canada, Paul.  We just  talked about that and Uranium One confirming that.  OK?  So, you know, once  it goes to Canada, I don't know where it goes from there.</p><p>But the point is that uranium is strategic resource, so why is it nobody at  CFIUS, including Hillary Clinton, by the way, who is running State  Department at that time even care.</p><p>Let me also ask you this Paul, why is it that that, by the way, during the  Bush administration we were concerned about Russia.  We really were, I  mean, I cited a foreign affairs article the other day from the CFR where  (INAUDIBLE) was talking about the threat of Vladimir Putin.  It was the  cover article back in 2007.  I remember the lobster summit in  Kennebunkport, which I covered in Maine.</p><p>A lot of concerns about Putin back then.  And then suddenly Hillary Clinton  becomes Secretary of State.  And President Obama is there and suddenly  we're approving deals like this while simultaneously $146 million is going  to the Clinton Foundation?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Well, I don't know anything about the deals with the Clinton  Foundation, except that most of the money went about two years before this  deal was, went down.</p><p>So, you know, that -- I really don't have any information about that.  What  I do know is that CFIUS committee is charged with examining whether or not  there is a -- </p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- national security concern and they determined that there was  not.  And the reason there's not is because two percent of the U.S.'s  uranium production is not a material concern to the United -- </p><p>REGAN:  That tells me that they're either incompetent or something else is  going on, because uranium is -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  No, I think they're exercising their best judgment, that  you're second-guessing.</p><p>REGAN: -- should be giving that to a Russian state-controlled company.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Look, I think Hillary is liar in most instances.  I spent most  of my life trying to prosecute her, right, with the Whitewater  investigation.  So I'm not one to give her any credit at all.  But when a  committee of United States that is mostly run by career bureaucrats says  that there's no problem, you know, to try and hang that on her without the  least bit of evidence that she had any knowledge of it is kind of  frivolous.</p><p>REGAN: -- because you know, it wasn't just Hillary Clinton.  These were all  Clintonites, actually, if you look at this list.  You got Eric Holder  there, you got Janet Napolitano.  You got a whole bunch of people, Steven  Chu, Tim Geithner that were close to Clinton, close to Obama.  And I would  only point out when you talk about the money that's changing hands.  You  said this money came in two years before this deal.</p><p>Well, $500,000 went to Bill Clinton in the weeks after over the first  speaking event in Russia.  And I get, I would just once again ask like,  there's nobody think that's inappropriate?  Does nobody think that's  bizarre?  A $146 million to the Clinton Foundation while she is Secretary  of State from Russia and $500K for a gig speaking there from the Russians  to Bill Clinton?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Nobody says that the Clinton Foundation should have been  taking this money.  They probably should not have been taking money from  any foreign source as long as the past of -- she was Secretary of State.   But to suggest the Uranium One deal is outside the bounds of normal  procedure is really just to be indulging in with respect to conspiracy  theories.</p><p>REGAN:  No.  No.  You're wrong on that.  I mean, we had a lot of concerns  about Russia.  We still have a lot of concerns about Russia.  And I really  question -- </p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  I agree with you.  I have lots of concerns about Russia.  I  worry about the president's decision to try and lift sanctions.</p><p>REGAN:  To the Russians.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG:  That's the type of concern I have.</p><p>REGAN:  So it tells me it's either incompetence on the part of our  government or there's something else at play.  Paul, thank you very much  for joining us, thanks very much.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  Thanks for having me.  It's a great pleasure.</p><p>REGAN:  Congress taking a major step forward in passing tax reform, but a  battle is growing between Republicans from high-taxed states and those from  low-taxed states.  Are we heading for a showdown?</p><p>Plus, the IRS finally admitting it targeted conservative and Tea Party  groups and the DOJ is paying out big time.  Stay with me.  I'm back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Here we are just days away from seeing the first text of the  Republican tax form bill.  Are you excited?  The big question is going to  be, is it going to get rid of state and local tax deductions?  And look, I  said this many times on this show, I like getting a state and local tax  deduction.  Heck, I live in New York City, right?</p><p>But the reality is those deductions that I'm allowed to take they aren't  really entirely fair.  Because while they benefit New York or California or  New Jersey, they don't do much good for Texas or New Hampshire or Florida,  because you don't have any state income tax there that you can deduct.  So  you see what's happening.  Essentially, part of the country is helping to  subsidize spending in these blue states.  And the president is calling that  out.</p><p>But Republican lawmakers from those blue states, because there are a few  Republicans in the blue states, they say, they're not going to pass a bill  that gets rids of these deductions.  So is this turning into a massive  showdown?  We're going to Connell McShane for the latest.  Hey Connell!</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE. FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Trish.  Yes, well,  they might need the votes from those Republican lawmakers that you allude  to.  So they are working on a compromise for that, for the deduction issue.   There's also a lot of interesting talk here in Washington today about  401(k) contributions.  OK, so I'll get to that in a second.  But since you  brought up the deductions, so let's start with that.</p><p>We had 20 no votes on the budget yesterday in the House.  And 11 of the 20  were New York and New Jersey representatives on the Republican side.  So  that really tells you how important this issue is.  And leadership is  talking to those members but he's trying to kind of work something out that  maybe softens the blow.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX), 8TH DISTRICT WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We  know as we're working with these lawmakers, that if you couple lower taxes,  a bigger child tax credit and we work with, to find a compromise on state  and local, we can help Americans in every bracket keep more of what they  earn.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you know, the other possibility is you have the deductions  going away for some people but not for others.  Maybe there's some sort of  an upper income limit put on it, but again, a lot being talked about there.</p><p>Now on the 401(k) issue, you remember the president brought that up in a  tweet.  But that got very interesting earlier today as well.  You just  heard from Chairman Brady.  I was speaking to him about this a little bit  earlier the day and he has made a suggestion, in fact, he's told us that he  talked to the president about this, where the limit on contributions to  your 401(k) plan, they might actually increase of its 18,000 now, up to  20,000 plus.  But there's a big catch.</p><p>All the money wouldn't be tax-free as part of this compromise.  Some of  that tax-free savings might go to the backs end rather than the front end.   And that's to save money for the tax reform effort.  Here's more of the  rationale.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BRADY:  Those 401(k)'s most people are saving $200 or less a month.  That  won't do it in retirement.  They're going to be in trouble.</p><p>So we're asking experts how we can help theses families save more.  And so  we're working to reach a good solution there.  If not, we'll leave them as  they are.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  As they are.  Now that's basically, Trish, where we are right  now.  I should tell you there is still a very ambitious timeline up here.   I mean Chairman Brady has talked about this a number of times.  But they  want to get the bill introduced by next week and still talking about at  getting it passed by Thanksgiving.  But two issues, the deductions in the  401(k), still going to work something out.</p><p>REGAN:  Thanks so much, Connell.</p><p>The IRS, everyone, finally admitting it did target conservatives and Tea  Party groups.  And The DOJ is paying out big time.</p><p>But will any heads roll over this blatant abuse of power?  And finally what  does this telling you about the Obama Administration?  They passed a deal  to allow the Russians to buy 20 percent of our uranium assets.</p><p>That's very skeptical.  And now we're learning what they did, targeting,  deliberately targeting conservatives and Tea Party activists.  We're on it.</p><p>Plus \"The Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel is here.  She's running  about the so-called dirty dossier about President Trump, and she is warning  right now that there are many Russian bombshells to come, if and when the  bank records of who paid for this thing are actually uncovered.  She's got  a lot of Intel for you.  Do not miss it.  Stay with me.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  We got another scandal to talk about today from the Obama era.   As the Trump Justice Department is forced to settle two lawsuits that date  back to the Obama administration.  The IRS admitting in court documents  that intentionally delayed tax-exempt status for Tea Party and conservative  groups.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions says there's no excuse for this  conduct.  And then on to President Trump, this abuse of power will not be  tolerated.</p><p>Joining me with more, American majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  Abuse of power, is  that what it is?</p><p>NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Yes.  Oh, Absolutely.  I mean Trish  we're not dealing -- we weren't dealing with just dozens of Tea Party and  conservative groups.  This is hundreds and hundreds almost 500.</p><p>By the time you add everything up.  And I guess the question I would have  for those watching is, do you really think the IRS of its own volition just  decided to target Tea Party groups and conservatives?  I mean IRS,  bureaucrats acting of their own volition.</p><p>I think this went higher and it is kind of a microcosm of what a lot of us  were concerned about with the Obama administration that it was weaponizing  governments, the states against those that opposed it.  And so, when you  look at the IRS scandal, again it's just one of many things that concerned  us during the Obama administration.  People in D.C. and New York, still  don't understand why 2016 happened and this is a microcosm of why it  happened.  People are losing trust in their institutions.</p><p>REGAN:  And it leads you, of course, down the path of looking it what  happened with that, now infamous dossier.  And was the FBI -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  </p><p>REGAN: -- under President Obama using that in order to wiretap.  Save that  because I want to ask you something else and Kimberly Strassel is going to  be on momentarily to talk about that.  But I know you've been digging into  the Uranium One story quite extensively.</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  </p><p>REGAN:  And, you know, we just heard from a guest who sat on homeland  security who try to tell us, look, you know, this is no big deal.   Absolutely no big deal at all that all -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's true.</p><p>REGAN: -- these people at CFIUS day signed off on it.  And he also tried to  say, Ned that none of this uranium left the country, when in fact we know  that it went to Canada.  And we know that in part because Uranium One  confirmed it in April 2015 that this uranium went to Canada.  And who knows  what it happens to the uranium once it's out of the country.</p><p>RYUN:  No.  This is correct, Trish.  And to say that this is no big deal,  I'm sorry you had nine people, CFIUS members.  Again, Hillary Clinton and  Eric Holder, and Timothy Geithner, you can look on my Twitter feed and see  all these names.</p><p>These people in expedited fashion, usually these things, Trish, 75 to 90  days they're looking at this deals started first part of August of 2010,  and it was approved by October 22nd, 2010.  It was expedited process.  Most  to this time when you're dealing with something such national security  implications, usually 120 days.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I just want to point out.  You're saying national  security implications.  And, you know, you're the guest who said, no, no,  no national security.  I would just say and I'm reading the name of this  company that bought 51 percent stake in Uranium One, it's called ARMZ  Uranium Holdings and it's from Russia, right?</p><p>So if that's not enough to kind of red flag some of this called Uranium  Holdings.  How about this?  Guess who owns, ARMZ Uranium Holdings it's  Rosatom which stands for --</p><p>RYUN:  Rosatom.</p><p>REGAN: -- Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.  And no one cares?</p><p>RYUN:  By the way, we're also helping Iran build these nuclear facilities  and training Iranian nuclear scientists.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  And we knew that back in 2007.</p><p>RYUN:  And the thing about it is, it wasn't as though Republicans weren't  raising red flags.  On October 5th, 2010, Republicans sent a letter to  Timothy Geithner and said, we have real issues with this deal.  And you  know what they did?  They went ahead signed off on it basically two weeks  later and said this deal was fine to go forward.</p><p>There are a lot of questions, and I think the only way we get to bottom of  this, Trish is we have all nine of those CFIUS voting members, brought to  the Hill, put under oath in a public setting and asked, why did you approve  this deal?  Why did you do it in expedited fashion?  And we get answers  because I think we deserve answers.</p><p>Was this to help Russia come in on a terrible Iranian deal, or even worse,  Trish, was this some sort of a payback to Democrat and Clinton Foundation  donors as I thank you for all the support they've gotten?  We deserve  answers.</p><p>REGAN:  You're hitting on something that I think is very interesting  because as I've been telling the viewer and I remember covering Russia, the  Ukraine elections, I covered the lobster --</p><p>RYUN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- summit in Kennebunkport.  And during the Ukrainian elections it  was very clear the Ukraine's were definitely warning about Russia as a real  threat.  As I've been citing (INAUDIBLE) -- cover article in 2007 in the  foreign affairs journal from the CFR where she basically outlined exactly  what Putin was up to and his imperialistic tendency.  She talked about his  support of those in Iran that were doing bad stuff.  And she warned of  everything.</p><p>We knew about this that Condoleezza Rice was there.  And she was a Russian  scholar.  She knew exactly what was at stake.  There was a lot of concern  and yet, Ned, everything shifted, when President Obama came into office,  Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, the last guest try to say, well,  you know, that that money they went to the Clinton Foundation that happened  two years before that deal was approved.  But if you follow your logic,  perhaps that was money well-spent as far as Russians go.</p><p>Now I'm not saying anything.  I just think that say it looks awfully  suspicious that we changed our policy tone towards Russia shortly after -- </p><p>RYUN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN: --in the years after all this money had been pouring into the  Clinton Foundation.  I mean, why you're going not to be -- not getting  along with someone who's giving you so much money?</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.  There are a lot of questions.  And again Trish, there  are a lot of questions that still need to be answered.  And you make a good  point.</p><p>We knew who Russia was at this point.  We also knew, the CFIUS board  members, this voting board members knew that there was actually a bribery  case taking place that the FBI uncovered and regards this uranium deal.   And they also knew exactly what Russia was doing.  It was trying to Annex  Georgia this time.  It was threatening Ukraine.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  It was also threatening Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia with small  nuclear weapons.  We knew exactly what was going on and we still approved  this deal in expedited fashion.  Bring these nine CFIUS voting members to  the Hill.  Put them under oath either in front of the House Intelligence  Committee or the Senate Judiciary Committee to get answers.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  There are questions that need to be answer for sure.  I mean  they've -- </p><p>RYUN:  That's right.</p><p>REGAN: -- long needed to be answered.  But now we know in fact the FBI was  investigating Vladimir Putin for trying to have outsized reach in our  atomic energy industry at the same time that they were approving this deal.   So yes lots of questions.  Ned Ryun good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel writing about the so-called  dirty dossier on President Trump warning of, \"The coming Russian  Bombshells\" if and when those bank records of those who paid for this whole  thing are uncovered.  She's here to explain what those bank records might  reveal.  Kimberly's here.  She's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  New questions today over the controversial and unverified and  largely discredited anti-Trump dossier.  Top Democrats are passing the buck  here, claiming they had no idea that the dirty document was ever being  compiled, let alone that they have anything to do with paying for it.  Of  course now we have learned that the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign were  funneling money through a law firm in order to dig up all this disgusting  stuff.</p><p>Joining me right now with more, \"Wall Street Journal\" writer, Kimberley  Strassel.  She says even more Russia-linked bombshells are on the way.   Good to see you, Kimberley.  What do you mean by that?</p><p>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WRITER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Hi, Trish.  So I think  people need to ask themselves why it is that Fusion, this oppo research  firm, finally came out and said who had hired it, the DNC and the Clinton  campaign.  They have resisted doing that for almost an entire year.  They  had Democrats and Congress helping them and then suddenly boom, they give  the names.</p><p>And it's because there is something they want to hide even more than those  names and that is their bank records.  And I think they thought, or hoped  that by putting these names out there, that maybe the House investigators  would drop their subpoena is for the bank records.  House investigators are  not doing that.  But it's very clear Fusion, which has taken then to court,  does not want them to see what's in those bank records.</p><p>REGAN:  So the bank records would tell us basically, who all their clients  were, who was paying them?</p><p>STRASSEL:  Well I think House investigators will probably be careful not to  drag any of Fusion's clients out into the open that have nothing to do with  this investigation.  But let's just say we know, for instance, that Fusion  in the past has had contacts and contracts with Russians.  One of those  Russians, Natalia Veselnitskaya, she worked for a company called Prevezon.   You know, she was one that recently ended up in Donald Trump, Jr.'s office  having a meeting with him.</p><p>Is she linked up with Fusion?  Are they still working because if there was  money coming from Russia simultaneous to the fact that they were working on  this dossier, it brings up some questions about whether or not the Russians  didn't know this dossier project was on going and sought to influence it.</p><p>REGAN:  So, in other words, this was a disinformation campaign that Fusion  GPS was putting together and your thinking on this might be that the  Russians had a direct hand in this.  That they somehow wanted to be  involved in this disinformation.</p><p>STRASSEL:  Well, what we do know from the dossier's author, he writes it in  the dossier.  Is that a lot of this, the allegation, which you said have  been almost entirely disprove and -- were based off of tips and knowledge  from anonymous Russian sources.  So I think the question we have to ask  ourselves is, was the Kremlin aware that this dossier was being put  together?  And they did they deliberately, yes, feed false information to  this British intelligence officer to inject that into our political system.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, hen, how on earth does the FBI fall for that, Kimberly?  I  mean, how is it that -- and by the way, I would just point out that most  journalist organizations, this thing had been floating out there, and they  found it discredited, so they never bothered  published it, except for  \"BuzzFeed\", and that certainly a whole other debate as to whether they even  are a journalist organization.  But no one published this, right?</p><p>And, yet the FBI, Kimberly, took this to heart.  And said OK, now we're  going to have to look into all these campaign folks and wiretapping, et  cetera, et cetera?</p><p>STRASSEL:  Yes.  This is the other huge unanswered question here.  I keep  trying to remind people just to contemplate this one sentence.  We had law  enforcement agencies working for a government opposition party from one  that's in now.</p><p>Basically, wiretapping in a presidential election campaign, which is a  pretty astonishing thought when you think about it.  Now add in the  possibility that it was relying or justifying that investigation on the  basis of a Democratic commissioned opposition research document that was  sourced from anonymous Russians.  And you just have to wonder, you know,  who was in charge there?</p><p>Now, we still don't know the answers to that question.  The dossier file in  the FBI is supposed to go to Congress this next week, but then we may have  a better sense of how much it was used.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  All right, well, Kimberly thanks you so much.  Appreciate all  your Intel on this and we'll keep talking to you about it.  Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right everyone, let's go to Spain for a minute because people  are taking to the streets there after the Catalan parliament voted today in  favor of independence from Spain.  They want to break apart away from the  rest of Spain, taking the country's deepening political crisis here into  uncharted territory.</p><p>Spain is Europe's fifth largest economy and whatever happens there could  certainly have major financial implications.</p><p>The U.S. is not wild about this, but I'll tell you having spent a lot of  time in Barcelona, they have always had this separatist strain in their  population and it's really coming to a head right now.  So we'll go to  Spain right after this, with more pictures.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Breaking news right now.  Can you imagine if Texas said, you know  what, see you United States of America, we want to break off on to our own?   That's effectively what's happening in Barcelona, Spain, right now.  You  see people celebrating there in the street.</p><p>The prime minister there in Spain is dissolving their Catalonia Parliament  following the region's history vote declaring independent from Spain.  In  other words, the people there in Barcelona and Catalonia have said, see you  to Spain, I guess see you to the E.U. but is that going to fly?  Let's go  to Ashley Webster who joins me with the latest now.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely not.  There they  are celebrating in Barcelona tonight.  Huge dark cloud on the horizon is  that no one recognizes Catalonia as an independent state, not the EU, not  the UK, not the U.S., Germany, France have all pitched in and said we don't  even recognize you.  We do not believe you are an independent state.</p><p>Now, Catalonia says well, you know, we'd be happy to be still in the EU.   EU says where you are because you're part of Spain.  So the question now  is, this has been going on and building and building a game of chicken and  here we are, what happens next?  Does this really descend into civil  disobedience?</p><p>What happens when Madrid tries to dissolve the parliament?  Maybe arrest  those Catalonian leaders that held the vote in the first place?  What do  the Catalan police do?  Are they loyal to Madrid or are they loyal to  Catalonia?   There's a lot of big questions here.</p><p>REGAN:  I want to point again this is coming to us live from Spain right  now from Barcelona.  And this is something that has been going on for  sometimes, I have shared with you, Ashley, the story when I was a young  student over there in Spain studying Spanish.  And I got to Spain, I was  all excited.  And they started speaking Catalan to me, so much for all my  Spanish.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Excuse me?</p><p>REGAN:  But really you get into a taxicab and they speak Catalan, because  it was so ingrained to them that they were Catalanian or Catalonian first - - </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And before they were Spanish back in the years of Franco, for  example, they were not allowed to speak Spanish, forgive me Catalan.  He  made them speak Spanish</p><p>And so, this is been something that has been brewing for some time.  And  now there's a lot of economic components to it as well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Huge.</p><p>REGAN:  Given how successful they are.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, listen.  We're in uncharted territory.  What happens?</p><p>At least 1500 companies have already moved out of Catalonia.  So, major  banks have moved their headquarters out of Catalonia, very worried about  what happens next.  So there is a big economic hit.  This is very rich  region of Spain, 25 percent of the GDP comes out of this one region.   It's  upset -- </p><p>REGAN:  It is little like Greece and Germany?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Pretty much.  Catalonia believes it pays way too much in taxes  and gets way too little back compared to the rest of the country.  Now, all  of the sudden we're going to have to basks in Spain and the Corsicans in  France, in the Northern League in Italy, and the Bavarians in Germany.   Then they will lose in Belgium.  The EU is very concerned that they don't  want cracks to stop forming in the union where there are cracks.</p><p>REGAN:  And there are, I mean let's -- yes Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Brexit.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean Brexit is a great example.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Scotland.  What about Scotland Island?  It's covering the  Scottish independence.  I mean, they covered that vote, there were large  group of Catalonians in Edinburgh egging them on to vote for independence.   That's how, you know, strong they are for their statehood.</p><p>REGAN:  So, ultimately?  We don't know.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We don't know but I -- it's going to be an uphill battle for  Catalonia to get their own statehood.  Let's put it that way.</p><p>REGAN:  Ashley, thank you very much.</p><p>WEBSTER:  My pleasure</p><p>REGAN:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Interesting story, the national archives releasing some, but not  all, of the long secret files relating to the 1963 assassination of  President JFK.  President Trump blocked the release of nearly 300 records  on the urging of CIA, and the FBI, those files are going to be under review  for another six months.  Those that were released described how federal  agents madly chased after tips, after rumors and leads worldwide.</p><p>But the fact that some were held back, well, you know, that's fueling a  whole lot more speculation.  And by the way, they were held back because of  national security concerns.  What does that mean?</p><p>Presidential historian Doug Wead is back with me.  And Doug, you know, one  of the interesting things in all of this, is that we have learned that  Oswald went to Mexico City for a meeting at the Soviet embassy shortly  before this all transpired.  Does that lead you in any direction towards  maybe the Soviets, the Soviets perhaps, and the Cubans combined had a hand  in this?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  That was my thought.</p><p>WEAD:  All of the conspiracy theories, all of them are alive, and there is  a bunch more after we've seen these documents.  It is truly, truly  stunning.</p><p>REGAN:  But I mean is there any one that sticks out more so than others  given what we know thus far? </p><p>WEAD:  Here is what sticks out to me, Trish, and that's the questions that  the American people were asking, that the taxicab driver, the beautician  asking.  They were the right questions.  And the elite media and the  government tried to make us feel like we're idiots and conspiracy  theorists, but, they themselves are asking this question.</p><p>Richard Helms, the director of the CIA, sends out a memo that's in these  documents and says was he one of ours?  Meaning Oswald, was he a CIA agent?   So, this isn't some blogger from Tulsa.  This is the director of the CIA  asking that question.</p><p>And then there is LBJ, LBJ is quoted in here as saying, the reason John F.  Kennedy was assassinated was because he himself assassinated Ngo Dinh Diem,  the president of our ally, president of South Vietnam, who was a fellow  catholic.  I mean, this, again, is president of the United States making  this allegation in these documents.  No wonder they wanted to keep them  hidden.</p><p>REGAN:  So what is your suspicion?  Do you question all of this as well?  I  mean do you think that there is more to this story than was ever presented  to the public?</p><p>WEAD:  Oh, obviously so here because the principals themselves thought  that.  Johnson thought that.  Helms thought that.</p><p>You can -- we've got to apologize to all the conspiracy theorists.  They  may not have the right conclusions. We don't know those conclusions and  maybe that's the lone gunman as many say.  But they certainly had the right  questions and the questions they were asking should have been asked and no  one should have been shamed from talking about it.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Doug, I guess now the concern is national security,  right?  And I understand that, by the way.  I kept saying, well the  president surely must know what's in these documents before they get  released because I would think that you run the risk of anyone maybe being  named that was a spy for us, possibly still being a live and being put into  jeopardy.  And also he is citing national security concerns, which makes me  wonder, if it was another country involved in this assassination, do we run  the risk of flaring up a scenario and perhaps is the reason why they want  to be more careful?</p><p>I don't fault them by the way for wanting to be more careful.  Because it  is all sensitive stuff and you don't want to find yourself in a situation  where we're going into some World War III over something done that many  years ago, Doug.</p><p>WEAD:  I don't think that's the problem.  I think it's political and it's  personal.  Trish, when I wrote the book, \"All the President's Children,\" I  had the Warren G. Harding family lobbying me not to include the story of  his illegitimate daughter which is now proven by DNA.  But that tells you  the pressure that was on.</p><p>And one of the revealing moments in this documents that I read last night  is when J Edgar Hoover tips off Bobby Kennedy and says there's book coming  out next year bout you and Marilyn Monroe.  Giving the Kennedy's time to  issue other books to dilute that book and to get their answers ready, that  tells me why these docs are really hidden from the public.  There are  people who would be embarrassed by them.</p><p>REGAN:  Dough, thank you so much.  Good to see you.</p><p>WEAD:  Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  The White House briefing just wrapping up moments ago,  our own Blake Burman was there and he has a very important question about  the President 401K tax position.  Let's listen.  We got the question and  the answer I believe. There we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Is the president considering dropping the amount of pre taxed  contributions that Americans can put in to their 401(k) currently?  That  said about $18,000.  It seems is that this whole issue is up for  negotiation.  Does the president support taking that $18,000 a level and  potentially lowering that?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  As I said earlier  this week the president wants to continue to fight and push for protection  of Americans retirement.  And that hasn't changed, but I'm not making any - - negotiate any deals beyond that.  But that's the president's position and  that's the same today as it was earlier this week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  You know, I tell you, there's lot of opportunity had as we look at  the market that once again is looking at new a high.  New high anyway on  the Nasdaq, and we have got the Dow up 31 points right now as we head into  the weekend. </p><p>I hope you do have a wonderful one but there's a lot more news coming your  way right now in the final hour of trading.  Liz Claman has you covered.   Hey Liz!</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, we got stocks at all-time highs on strong earnings reports plus a gangbuster GDP report, that's the measurement of our overall economy showing that we grew a lot in 30 percent despite suffering two major hurricanes last month. This is some good news. I'm Trish Regan. Welcome everyone to \"The Intelligence Report\" on this Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the Nasdaq on pace for its biggest gain of the year during the strong tech earnings, and of course that much better than expected, economic growth, three percent. So just imagine what kind of growth we might actually get if Republicans manage to pass tax reform this year. We're on it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, three Obama era scandals in the spotlight today, the Russian's dossier, the Russian uranium deal, and now the IRS. Not a good week for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton.</nameText></person></p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal's\" Kimberly Strassel is here and she is going to tell us about more bombshells that are on the way. She joins us straight ahead.</p><p>Plus, the National Archives refusing to publish some 300 records about the <person><nameText>JFK assassination. </nameText></person>What are they hiding? Presidential Historian Doug Wead has a theory. He has the Intel for you coming up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story here, third quarter GDP, three percent, how about it. Joining me right now, Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist, Keith Fitz-Gerald. Our own Nicole Petallides down at floor in New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>And Keith, it's pretty good, I mean, especially considering we had a couple hurricanes in there.</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MONEY MAP PRESS: This is knock the leather off the ball time, you know, the thing that's surprising to me is that Wall Street is claiming they were surprised. Big tech has been the story, not just a story, the story, for a long time. And it will continue to change the world we live in.</p><p>REGAN: I love it. Nicole, down on the floor, are they surprised? I mean, I didn't get expectations have been tempered somewhat knowing that we clearly had gone through a lot in the past quarter with all the hurricanes and yet, a pretty stellar report.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWSCORRESPONDENT: It really is. For the GDP, obviously, we saw that three percent gain. That was more than expected. You noted Hurricane Harvey and Irma. And we thought that could cut into it. But it didn't. And the big picture here is that earnings and employment have continued to boost optimism going forward and now with these tech earnings today, blowout.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. Hey, it's looking pretty good, as we said Nasdaq on pace to hit a record.</p><p>Joining me right now, Kingsview Asset Management as well CIO, Scott Martin. Scott, how much of this is attributable to just the sort of secular shift if you would, or cyclical shift rather in the economy? How much is attributable to the president?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: I think a lot of it Trish, I mean, you guys were talking about the GDP numbers. You know a lot of pick up in GDP this quarter -- past quarter rather in this report was businesses, right? Because the consumers got hit with the hurricanes, but businesses picked up the slack, because Trish, as I like to say, gone is the -- you didn't build that message that was just delivered to the business community over and over again by <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>And now it is, how can we help you, Mr. And Mrs. Businessman and woman, from D.C.? So that's why businesses are going out there confident, spending, and hiring workers, which is going to drive the S&amp;P prices higher, because of the fact that businesses are back in this country.</p><p>REGAN: That's good stuff. I like the sound of that, Keith. It's -- you can't underestimate, Keith, how much psychology and sentiment plays? What kind of role it plays, when you're out there repealing regulations one after another. When you're out there promising lower taxes for business owners, for corporations and for individuals, what does that do to overall confidence levels?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: It brings into play the most important word in the investment vocabulary, certainty, because CEOs want and need certainty to spend and gain customers. Customers need certainty because they know the companies that they're going to buy from are dependable, and the markets need certainty because it means there is stability.</p><p>So to me, this a win, win, win, all the way across the board. It's important political nonsense aside, because the CEOs are the ones who have to navigate this on behalf of their shareholders.</p><p>REGAN: All right, so Scott, assuming the tax reform happens, we're looking at a market that's 23,434 on the Dow right now. Where do we go?</p><p>MARTIN: Easy, Dow 25,000, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: Wow.</p><p>MARTIN: And it's probably relatively soon, you know, we'll get this, probably not. And maybe by the end of the year, maybe in 2018 which is OK, because that's about going forward that the market really wants to see. And so, I think you are easily going to see the Dow pop here as we're going in end of the year, especially given as you guys talked about. It's really amazingly strong earnings report that we're just seeing today from say, some of the Google and the Amazons of the world. Plus we got Facebook and Apple next week. So don't forget --</p><p>PETALLIDES: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN: -- we got another lift coming I think in matter of days too.</p><p>REGAN: Is that what you're hearing Nicole?</p><p>PETALLIDES: In Washington I mean, what you're seeing in Washington, you still see the ball rolling. I know we've been talking a lot about tax reform, budgets and that really still, well, on its way. Everybody bet on that. And you couple that with the great earnings this season that we've seen. And fundamentals, things have improved. I know it feels crazy in the run-up that we've seen, all-time highs, one record after another. And sure, everybody is always cautious and watching, but the feeling is still optimistic big picture, for the longer term. And what a day today with this tech earnings blowout numbers.</p><p>REGAN: Indeed. Well, thank you so much. Good to see you all, Keith, Scott, and Nicole.</p><p>The DOJ lifting a gag order everyone, on an FBI informant who could potentially blow the lid off this entire Uranium One scandal. He's going to be speaking to at least three Congressional committees who only now want to get to the bottom of why this deal was ever allowed in the first place.</p><p>Let's go to Blake Burman. He's live at the White House with the latest on this. Blake, there could be some pretty interesting stuff in his testimony.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWSCORRESPONDENT: Yes, and Trish, here is what we could tell you. That President Trump here at White House, last week, rather during a meeting made it clear that he thought it was appropriate for the Department of Justice to go forward to lift this gag order on this confidential informant. This informant was speaking with the FBI when it was looking several years back into possible bribery and extortion by Russian energy officials.</p><p>Now, that informant is going to be able to talk to Congressional investigators. That informant's attorney saying earlier today claiming that her client might be able to draw a link between the Clintons and the Uranium One deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY: We have the Clinton Foundation getting tens of millions of dollars from the same people involved in the deal. So you got it, right there, the quid pro quo. Now my client can put some meat on those bones and tell you what the Russians were saying during that time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, now it is --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The White House, though, is now forced to defend the president's involvement in this high-level decision. Here is Kellyanne Conway earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: There are some reports that the president interfered, the president weighed in. Not unusual for a president to weigh in on any other topics, but remember, Chairman Grassley got that party started last week when he asked the Department of Justice to allow the FBI informant to speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Trish, one of the bottom line here is after months of this Russian investigation being put on President Trump and those within his orbit, the president and White House very clearly feel that they are now able to turn this headline around on to the other side. For example, the president tweeted out earlier today, and I quote here he said, \"It is now commonly agreed after many months of costly looking that there was no collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with H.C.\" Of course that being <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Trish.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Well, we want to talk about this a little more. Blake Burman, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now with his take former Deputy Secretary for Policy at the Department of Homeland Security, Paul Rosenzweig. Good, you here, Paul.</p><p>Given your background, given your background there at Homeland Security, are you surprised that a deal like this went through?</p><p>PAUL ROSENZWEIG, FMR DEPUTY SECY FOR POLICY, DHS: Not really. It was approved or rather it was not blocked by a committee -- the Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States, which actually has nine cabinet agencies sitting in it, as well as director of National Intelligence.</p><p>And in this case, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look to the deal as well and approved it. As far as one can tell from looking at the historical record, there was really no dispute about it. And that's pretty unsurprising given that, yes, in many ways --</p><p>REGAN: Yes, OK, so but I heard and understand what you're saying here, sir, because you're saying, it's a little surprising that there is no dispute. And by the way, there was some dispute, not from members of CFIUS, the nine people that were sitting on CFIUS, including State Department and treasury, et cetera.</p><p>But there was concern, I mean, Chuck Grassley sending a note to Loretta Lynch at the time. We do know that there was an FBI investigation going into or delving into whether or not, Vladimir Putin was trying to gain undue (ph) influence in our atomic energy sector.</p><p>So by the way, when you got the Russian state energy company trying to purchase Uranium One in the United States of America, I would just think that that would send off some red flags.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: Well, apparently not. The Nuclear Regulatory -- well, let's start with that. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved this because the ore that they purchased doesn't get exported. Uranium One didn't have an export license.</p><p>REGAN: OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: And also amounted to no more than two percent --</p><p>REGAN: But it was exported?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: No, it wasn't ma'am, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the deal on the grounds that Uranium One did not have a --</p><p>REGAN: OK, so they approved it under assumption that it wouldn't actually be exported? But, Paul, let me share with you --</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- they are the ones who issues the licenses.</p><p>REGAN: It could get exported. For \"The New York Times\" --</p><p>ROSENWEIG: Right?</p><p>REGAN: Here's a quote \"New York Times\", 2015, April, where they were talking about how there was one particular individual there who was saying that --</p><p>ROSENWEIG: -- that he saw some of the yellowcake in this property going on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN: Yes.</p><p>ROSENWEIG: Right, he didn't say anything to that whether or not it was part -- it was owned by Uranium One and whether or not it was returned after processing right?</p><p>REGAN: If you would let me finish I will tell you exactly what \"The New York Times\" reported, \"Asked about the commission, it confirmed that Uranium one has in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada.\"</p><p>ROSENWEIG: Right.</p><p>REGAN: OK, so there you go. The commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada, even though it does not have an export license. So if you try and tell me, none of their stuff left the country, well, that's just wrong.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: Now, here's a good question for you. How much uranium does the United States consume every year?</p><p>REGAN: I don't know.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: Fifty million-pound, roughly. How much do we make domestically?</p><p>REGAN: I don't know. Tell me.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: About 10 percent of that, about 5 million. What's the uranium production from Uranium One?</p><p>REGAN: Twenty percent of the U.S. supply. Listen, I don't care.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG: Right. So 20 percent of --</p><p>REGAN: What you're trying to say is somehow this was OK that this deal happened. Because there are some just basic things --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REGAN: -- in the world. And that is that you do not allow the supply of uranium to go to the Russians. I mean, why would you allow that?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: No. Not to go to the Russians. Not to go to the Russians. To be -- the mining contracts went -- were owned by the Russian Rosatom. But you don't know -- you've not told me anything about where the --</p><p>REGAN: Well, we just talked how the uranium went to Canada, Paul. We just talked about that and Uranium One confirming that. OK? So, you know, once it goes to Canada, I don't know where it goes from there.</p><p>But the point is that uranium is strategic resource, so why is it nobody at CFIUS, including <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>by the way, who is running State Department at that time even care.</p><p>Let me also ask you this Paul, why is it that that, by the way, during the Bush administration we were concerned about Russia. We really were, I mean, I cited a foreign affairs article the other day from the CFR where (INAUDIBLE) was talking about the threat of Vladimir Putin. It was the cover article back in 2007. I remember the lobster summit in Kennebunkport, which I covered in Maine.</p><p>A lot of concerns about Putin back then. And then suddenly <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>becomes Secretary of State. And <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is there and suddenly we're approving deals like this while simultaneously $146 million is going to the Clinton Foundation?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: Well, I don't know anything about the deals with the Clinton Foundation, except that most of the money went about two years before this deal was, went down.</p><p>So, you know, that -- I really don't have any information about that. What I do know is that CFIUS committee is charged with examining whether or not there is a --</p><p>REGAN: OK.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: -- national security concern and they determined that there was not. And the reason there's not is because two percent of the U.S.'s uranium production is not a material concern to the United --</p><p>REGAN: That tells me that they're either incompetent or something else is going on, because uranium is --</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: No, I think they're exercising their best judgment, that you're second-guessing.</p><p>REGAN: -- should be giving that to a Russian state-controlled company.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: Look, I think Hillary is liar in most instances. I spent most of my life trying to prosecute her, right, with the Whitewater investigation. So I'm not one to give her any credit at all. But when a committee of United States that is mostly run by career bureaucrats says that there's no problem, you know, to try and hang that on her without the least bit of evidence that she had any knowledge of it is kind of frivolous.</p><p>REGAN: -- because you know, it wasn't just <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>These were all Clintonites, actually, if you look at this list. You got Eric Holder there, you got Janet Napolitano. You got a whole bunch of people, Steven Chu, Tim Geithner that were close to Clinton, close to Obama. And I would only point out when you talk about the money that's changing hands. You said this money came in two years before this deal.</p><p>Well, $500,000 went to Bill Clinton in the weeks after over the first speaking event in Russia. And I get, I would just once again ask like, there's nobody think that's inappropriate? Does nobody think that's bizarre? A $146 million to the Clinton Foundation while she is Secretary of State from Russia and $500K for a gig speaking there from the Russians to Bill Clinton?</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: Nobody says that the Clinton Foundation should have been taking this money. They probably should not have been taking money from any foreign source as long as the past of -- she was Secretary of State. But to suggest the Uranium One deal is outside the bounds of normal procedure is really just to be indulging in with respect to conspiracy theories.</p><p>REGAN: No. No. You're wrong on that. I mean, we had a lot of concerns about Russia. We still have a lot of concerns about Russia. And I really question --</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: I agree with you. I have lots of concerns about Russia. I worry about the president's decision to try and lift sanctions.</p><p>REGAN: To the Russians.</p><p>ROSENZWIEG: That's the type of concern I have.</p><p>REGAN: So it tells me it's either incompetence on the part of our government or there's something else at play. Paul, thank you very much for joining us, thanks very much.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG: Thanks for having me. It's a great pleasure.</p><p>REGAN: Congress taking a major step forward in passing tax reform, but a battle is growing between Republicans from high-taxed states and those from low-taxed states. Are we heading for a showdown?</p><p>Plus, the IRS finally admitting it targeted conservative and Tea Party groups and the DOJ is paying out big time. Stay with me. I'm back in two.</p><p>REGAN: Here we are just days away from seeing the first text of the Republican tax form bill. Are you excited? The big question is going to be, is it going to get rid of state and local tax deductions? And look, I said this many times on this show, I like getting a state and local tax deduction. Heck, I live in New York City, right?</p><p>But the reality is those deductions that I'm allowed to take they aren't really entirely fair. Because while they benefit New York or California or New Jersey, they don't do much good for Texas or New Hampshire or Florida, because you don't have any state income tax there that you can deduct. So you see what's happening. Essentially, part of the country is helping to subsidize spending in these blue states. And the president is calling that out.</p><p>But Republican lawmakers from those blue states, because there are a few Republicans in the blue states, they say, they're not going to pass a bill that gets rids of these deductions. So is this turning into a massive showdown? We're going to Connell McShane for the latest. Hey Connell!</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE. FOX NEWSCORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Trish. Yes, well, they might need the votes from those Republican lawmakers that you allude to. So they are working on a compromise for that, for the deduction issue. There's also a lot of interesting talk here in Washington today about 401(k) contributions. OK, so I'll get to that in a second. But since you brought up the deductions, so let's start with that.</p><p>We had 20 no votes on the budget yesterday in the House. And 11 of the 20 were New York and New Jersey representatives on the Republican side. So that really tells you how important this issue is. And leadership is talking to those members but he's trying to kind of work something out that maybe softens the blow. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KEVIN BRADY, (R-TX), 8TH DISTRICT WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We know as we're working with these lawmakers, that if you couple lower taxes, a bigger child tax credit and we work with, to find a compromise on state and local, we can help Americans in every bracket keep more of what they earn.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, you know, the other possibility is you have the deductions going away for some people but not for others. Maybe there's some sort of an upper income limit put on it, but again, a lot being talked about there.</p><p>Now on the 401(k) issue, you remember the president brought that up in a tweet. But that got very interesting earlier today as well. You just heard from Chairman Brady. I was speaking to him about this a little bit earlier the day and he has made a suggestion, in fact, he's told us that he talked to the president about this, where the limit on contributions to your 401(k) plan, they might actually increase of its 18,000 now, up to 20,000 plus. But there's a big catch.</p><p>All the money wouldn't be tax-free as part of this compromise. Some of that tax-free savings might go to the backs end rather than the front end. And that's to save money for the tax reform effort. Here's more of the rationale.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BRADY: Those 401(k)'s most people are saving $200 or less a month. That won't do it in retirement. They're going to be in trouble.</p><p>So we're asking experts how we can help theses families save more. And so we're working to reach a good solution there. If not, we'll leave them as they are.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: As they are. Now that's basically, Trish, where we are right now. I should tell you there is still a very ambitious timeline up here. I mean Chairman Brady has talked about this a number of times. But they want to get the bill introduced by next week and still talking about at getting it passed by Thanksgiving. But two issues, the deductions in the 401(k), still going to work something out.</p><p>REGAN: Thanks so much, Connell.</p><p>The IRS, everyone, finally admitting it did target conservatives and Tea Party groups. And The DOJ is paying out big time.</p><p>But will any heads roll over this blatant abuse of power? And finally what does this telling you about the Obama Administration? They passed a deal to allow the Russians to buy 20 percent of our uranium assets.</p><p>That's very skeptical. And now we're learning what they did, targeting, deliberately targeting conservatives and Tea Party activists. We're on it.</p><p>Plus \"The Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel is here. She's running about the so-called dirty dossier about President Trump, and she is warning right now that there are many Russian bombshells to come, if and when the bank records of who paid for this thing are actually uncovered. She's got a lot of Intel for you. Do not miss it. Stay with me.</p><p>REGAN: OK. We got another scandal to talk about today from the Obama era. As the Trump Justice Department is forced to settle two lawsuits that date back to the Obama administration. The IRS admitting in court documents that intentionally delayed tax-exempt status for Tea Party and conservative groups. Attorney General Jeff Sessions says there's no excuse for this conduct. And then on to President Trump, this abuse of power will not be tolerated.</p><p>Joining me with more, American majority CEO, Ned Ryun. Abuse of power, is that what it is?</p><p>NED RYUN, CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Yes. Oh, Absolutely. I mean Trish we're not dealing -- we weren't dealing with just dozens of Tea Party and conservative groups. This is hundreds and hundreds almost 500.</p><p>By the time you add everything up. And I guess the question I would have for those watching is, do you really think the IRS of its own volition just decided to target Tea Party groups and conservatives? I mean IRS, bureaucrats acting of their own volition.</p><p>I think this went higher and it is kind of a microcosm of what a lot of us were concerned about with the Obama administration that it was weaponizing governments, the states against those that opposed it. And so, when you look at the IRS scandal, again it's just one of many things that concerned us during the Obama administration. People in D.C. and New York, still don't understand why 2016 happened and this is a microcosm of why it happened. People are losing trust in their institutions.</p><p>REGAN: And it leads you, of course, down the path of looking it what happened with that, now infamous dossier. And was the FBI --</p><p>RYUN: That's right.</p><p>REGAN: -- under <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>using that in order to wiretap. Save that because I want to ask you something else and Kimberly Strassel is going to be on momentarily to talk about that. But I know you've been digging into the Uranium One story quite extensively.</p><p>RYUN: That's right.</p><p>REGAN: And, you know, we just heard from a guest who sat on homeland security who try to tell us, look, you know, this is no big deal. Absolutely no big deal at all that all --</p><p>RYUN: That's true.</p><p>REGAN: -- these people at CFIUS day signed off on it. And he also tried to say, Ned that none of this uranium left the country, when in fact we know that it went to Canada. And we know that in part because Uranium One confirmed it in April 2015 that this uranium went to Canada. And who knows what it happens to the uranium once it's out of the country.</p><p>RYUN: No. This is correct, Trish. And to say that this is no big deal, I'm sorry you had nine people, CFIUS members. Again, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>and Eric Holder, and Timothy Geithner, you can look on my Twitter feed and see all these names.</p><p>These people in expedited fashion, usually these things, Trish, 75 to 90 days they're looking at this deals started first part of August of 2010, and it was approved by October 22nd, 2010. It was expedited process. Most to this time when you're dealing with something such national security implications, usually 120 days.</p><p>REGAN: You know, I just want to point out. You're saying national security implications. And, you know, you're the guest who said, no, no, no national security. I would just say and I'm reading the name of this company that bought 51 percent stake in Uranium One, it's called ARMZ Uranium Holdings and it's from Russia, right?</p><p>So if that's not enough to kind of red flag some of this called Uranium Holdings. How about this? Guess who owns, ARMZ Uranium Holdings it's Rosatom which stands for --</p><p>RYUN: Rosatom.</p><p>REGAN: -- Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation. And no one cares?</p><p>RYUN: By the way, we're also helping Iran build these nuclear facilities and training Iranian nuclear scientists.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. And we knew that back in 2007.</p><p>RYUN: And the thing about it is, it wasn't as though Republicans weren't raising red flags. On October 5th, 2010, Republicans sent a letter to Timothy Geithner and said, we have real issues with this deal. And you know what they did? They went ahead signed off on it basically two weeks later and said this deal was fine to go forward.</p><p>There are a lot of questions, and I think the only way we get to bottom of this, Trish is we have all nine of those CFIUS voting members, brought to the Hill, put under oath in a public setting and asked, why did you approve this deal? Why did you do it in expedited fashion? And we get answers because I think we deserve answers.</p><p>Was this to help Russia come in on a terrible Iranian deal, or even worse, Trish, was this some sort of a payback to Democrat and Clinton Foundation donors as I thank you for all the support they've gotten? We deserve answers.</p><p>REGAN: You're hitting on something that I think is very interesting because as I've been telling the viewer and I remember covering Russia, the Ukraine elections, I covered the lobster --</p><p>RYUN: Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- summit in Kennebunkport. And during the Ukrainian elections it was very clear the Ukraine's were definitely warning about Russia as a real threat. As I've been citing (INAUDIBLE) -- cover article in 2007 in the foreign affairs journal from the CFR where she basically outlined exactly what Putin was up to and his imperialistic tendency. She talked about his support of those in Iran that were doing bad stuff. And she warned of everything.</p><p>We knew about this that Condoleezza Rice was there. And she was a Russian scholar. She knew exactly what was at stake. There was a lot of concern and yet, Ned, everything shifted, when <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>came into office, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>was secretary of state, the last guest try to say, well, you know, that that money they went to the Clinton Foundation that happened two years before that deal was approved. But if you follow your logic, perhaps that was money well-spent as far as Russians go.</p><p>Now I'm not saying anything. I just think that say it looks awfully suspicious that we changed our policy tone towards Russia shortly after --</p><p>RYUN: Right.</p><p>REGAN: --in the years after all this money had been pouring into the Clinton Foundation. I mean, why you're going not to be -- not getting along with someone who's giving you so much money?</p><p>RYUN: That's right. There are a lot of questions. And again Trish, there are a lot of questions that still need to be answered. And you make a good point.</p><p>We knew who Russia was at this point. We also knew, the CFIUS board members, this voting board members knew that there was actually a bribery case taking place that the FBI uncovered and regards this uranium deal. And they also knew exactly what Russia was doing. It was trying to Annex Georgia this time. It was threatening Ukraine.</p><p>REGAN: Yes.</p><p>RYUN: It was also threatening Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia with small nuclear weapons. We knew exactly what was going on and we still approved this deal in expedited fashion. Bring these nine CFIUS voting members to the Hill. Put them under oath either in front of the House Intelligence Committee or the Senate Judiciary Committee to get answers.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. There are questions that need to be answer for sure. I mean they've --</p><p>RYUN: That's right.</p><p>REGAN: -- long needed to be answered. But now we know in fact the FBI was investigating Vladimir Putin for trying to have outsized reach in our atomic energy industry at the same time that they were approving this deal. So yes lots of questions. Ned Ryun good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" Kimberley Strassel writing about the so-called dirty dossier on President Trump warning of, \"The coming Russian Bombshells\" if and when those bank records of those who paid for this whole thing are uncovered. She's here to explain what those bank records might reveal. Kimberly's here. She's next.</p><p>REGAN: New questions today over the controversial and unverified and largely discredited anti-Trump dossier. Top Democrats are passing the buck here, claiming they had no idea that the dirty document was ever being compiled, let alone that they have anything to do with paying for it. Of course now we have learned that the DNC and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>campaign were funneling money through a law firm in order to dig up all this disgusting stuff.</p><p>Joining me right now with more, \"Wall Street Journal\" writer, Kimberley Strassel. She says even more Russia-linked bombshells are on the way. Good to see you, Kimberley. What do you mean by that?</p><p>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WRITER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Hi, Trish. So I think people need to ask themselves why it is that Fusion, this oppo research firm, finally came out and said who had hired it, the DNC and the Clinton campaign. They have resisted doing that for almost an entire year. They had Democrats and Congress helping them and then suddenly boom, they give the names.</p><p>And it's because there is something they want to hide even more than those names and that is their bank records. And I think they thought, or hoped that by putting these names out there, that maybe the House investigators would drop their subpoena is for the bank records. House investigators are not doing that. But it's very clear Fusion, which has taken then to court, does not want them to see what's in those bank records.</p><p>REGAN: So the bank records would tell us basically, who all their clients were, who was paying them?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well I think House investigators will probably be careful not to drag any of Fusion's clients out into the open that have nothing to do with this investigation. But let's just say we know, for instance, that Fusion in the past has had contacts and contracts with Russians. One of those Russians, Natalia Veselnitskaya, she worked for a company called Prevezon. You know, she was one that recently ended up in <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>Jr.'s office having a meeting with him.</p><p>Is she linked up with Fusion? Are they still working because if there was money coming from Russia simultaneous to the fact that they were working on this dossier, it brings up some questions about whether or not the Russians didn't know this dossier project was on going and sought to influence it.</p><p>REGAN: So, in other words, this was a disinformation campaign that Fusion GPS was putting together and your thinking on this might be that the Russians had a direct hand in this. That they somehow wanted to be involved in this disinformation.</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, what we do know from the dossier's author, he writes it in the dossier. Is that a lot of this, the allegation, which you said have been almost entirely disprove and -- were based off of tips and knowledge from anonymous Russian sources. So I think the question we have to ask ourselves is, was the Kremlin aware that this dossier was being put together? And they did they deliberately, yes, feed false information to this British intelligence officer to inject that into our political system.</p><p>REGAN: Well, hen, how on earth does the FBI fall for that, Kimberly? I mean, how is it that -- and by the way, I would just point out that most journalist organizations, this thing had been floating out there, and they found it discredited, so they never bothered published it, except for \"BuzzFeed\", and that certainly a whole other debate as to whether they even are a journalist organization. But no one published this, right?</p><p>And, yet the FBI, Kimberly, took this to heart. And said OK, now we're going to have to look into all these campaign folks and wiretapping, et cetera, et cetera?</p><p>STRASSEL: Yes. This is the other huge unanswered question here. I keep trying to remind people just to contemplate this one sentence. We had law enforcement agencies working for a government opposition party from one that's in now.</p><p>Basically, wiretapping in a presidential election campaign, which is a pretty astonishing thought when you think about it. Now add in the possibility that it was relying or justifying that investigation on the basis of a Democratic commissioned opposition research document that was sourced from anonymous Russians. And you just have to wonder, you know, who was in charge there?</p><p>Now, we still don't know the answers to that question. The dossier file in the FBI is supposed to go to Congress this next week, but then we may have a better sense of how much it was used.</p><p>REGAN: Wow. All right, well, Kimberly thanks you so much. Appreciate all your Intel on this and we'll keep talking to you about it. Thank you.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thanks.</p><p>REGAN: All right everyone, let's go to Spain for a minute because people are taking to the streets there after the Catalan parliament voted today in favor of independence from Spain. They want to break apart away from the rest of Spain, taking the country's deepening political crisis here into uncharted territory.</p><p>Spain is Europe's fifth largest economy and whatever happens there could certainly have major financial implications.</p><p>The U.S. is not wild about this, but I'll tell you having spent a lot of time in Barcelona, they have always had this separatist strain in their population and it's really coming to a head right now. So we'll go to Spain right after this, with more pictures.</p><p>REGAN: Breaking news right now. Can you imagine if Texas said, you know what, see you United States of America, we want to break off on to our own? That's effectively what's happening in Barcelona, Spain, right now. You see people celebrating there in the street.</p><p>The prime minister there in Spain is dissolving their Catalonia Parliament following the region's history vote declaring independent from Spain. In other words, the people there in Barcelona and Catalonia have said, see you to Spain, I guess see you to the E.U. but is that going to fly? Let's go to Ashley Webster who joins me with the latest now.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely not. There they are celebrating in Barcelona tonight. Huge dark cloud on the horizon is that no one recognizes Catalonia as an independent state, not the EU, not the UK, not the U.S., Germany, France have all pitched in and said we don't even recognize you. We do not believe you are an independent state.</p><p>Now, Catalonia says well, you know, we'd be happy to be still in the EU. EU says where you are because you're part of Spain. So the question now is, this has been going on and building and building a game of chicken and here we are, what happens next? Does this really descend into civil disobedience?</p><p>What happens when Madrid tries to dissolve the parliament? Maybe arrest those Catalonian leaders that held the vote in the first place? What do the Catalan police do? Are they loyal to Madrid or are they loyal to Catalonia? There's a lot of big questions here.</p><p>REGAN: I want to point again this is coming to us live from Spain right now from Barcelona. And this is something that has been going on for sometimes, I have shared with you, Ashley, the story when I was a young student over there in Spain studying Spanish. And I got to Spain, I was all excited. And they started speaking Catalan to me, so much for all my Spanish.</p><p>WEBSTER: Excuse me?</p><p>REGAN: But really you get into a taxicab and they speak Catalan, because it was so ingrained to them that they were Catalanian or Catalonian first - -</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: And before they were Spanish back in the years of Franco, for example, they were not allowed to speak Spanish, forgive me Catalan. He made them speak Spanish</p><p>And so, this is been something that has been brewing for some time. And now there's a lot of economic components to it as well.</p><p>WEBSTER: Huge.</p><p>REGAN: Given how successful they are.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, listen. We're in uncharted territory. What happens?</p><p>At least 1500 companies have already moved out of Catalonia. So, major banks have moved their headquarters out of Catalonia, very worried about what happens next. So there is a big economic hit. This is very rich region of Spain, 25 percent of the GDP comes out of this one region. It's upset --</p><p>REGAN: It is little like Greece and Germany?</p><p>WEBSTER: Pretty much. Catalonia believes it pays way too much in taxes and gets way too little back compared to the rest of the country. Now, all of the sudden we're going to have to basks in Spain and the Corsicans in France, in the Northern League in Italy, and the Bavarians in Germany. Then they will lose in Belgium. The EU is very concerned that they don't want cracks to stop forming in the union where there are cracks.</p><p>REGAN: And there are, I mean let's -- yes Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER: Brexit.</p><p>REGAN: I mean Brexit is a great example.</p><p>WEBSTER: Scotland. What about Scotland Island? It's covering the Scottish independence. I mean, they covered that vote, there were large group of Catalonians in Edinburgh egging them on to vote for independence. That's how, you know, strong they are for their statehood.</p><p>REGAN: So, ultimately? We don't know.</p><p>WEBSTER: We don't know but I -- it's going to be an uphill battle for Catalonia to get their own statehood. Let's put it that way.</p><p>REGAN: Ashley, thank you very much.</p><p>WEBSTER: My pleasure</p><p>REGAN: We'll be right back.</p><p>REGAN: Interesting story, the national archives releasing some, but not all, of the long secret files relating to the 1963 assassination of President <person><nameText>JFK. </nameText></person>President Trump blocked the release of nearly 300 records on the urging of CIA, and the FBI, those files are going to be under review for another six months. Those that were released described how federal agents madly chased after tips, after rumors and leads worldwide.</p><p>But the fact that some were held back, well, you know, that's fueling a whole lot more speculation. And by the way, they were held back because of national security concerns. What does that mean?</p><p>Presidential historian Doug Wead is back with me. And Doug, you know, one of the interesting things in all of this, is that we have learned that Oswald went to Mexico City for a meeting at the Soviet embassy shortly before this all transpired. Does that lead you in any direction towards maybe the Soviets, the Soviets perhaps, and the Cubans combined had a hand in this?</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. That was my thought.</p><p>WEAD: All of the conspiracy theories, all of them are alive, and there is a bunch more after we've seen these documents. It is truly, truly stunning.</p><p>REGAN: But I mean is there any one that sticks out more so than others given what we know thus far?</p><p>WEAD: Here is what sticks out to me, Trish, and that's the questions that the American people were asking, that the taxicab driver, the beautician asking. They were the right questions. And the elite media and the government tried to make us feel like we're idiots and conspiracy theorists, but, they themselves are asking this question.</p><p>Richard Helms, the director of the CIA, sends out a memo that's in these documents and says was he one of ours? Meaning Oswald, was he a CIA agent? So, this isn't some blogger from Tulsa. This is the director of the CIA asking that question.</p><p>And then there is LBJ, LBJ is quoted in here as saying, the reason <person><nameText>John F. Kennedy </nameText></person>was assassinated was because he himself assassinated Ngo Dinh Diem, the president of our ally, president of South Vietnam, who was a fellow catholic. I mean, this, again, is president of the United States making this allegation in these documents. No wonder they wanted to keep them hidden.</p><p>REGAN: So what is your suspicion? Do you question all of this as well? I mean do you think that there is more to this story than was ever presented to the public?</p><p>WEAD: Oh, obviously so here because the principals themselves thought that. Johnson thought that. Helms thought that.</p><p>You can -- we've got to apologize to all the conspiracy theorists. They may not have the right conclusions. We don't know those conclusions and maybe that's the lone gunman as many say. But they certainly had the right questions and the questions they were asking should have been asked and no one should have been shamed from talking about it.</p><p>REGAN: You know, Doug, I guess now the concern is national security, right? And I understand that, by the way. I kept saying, well the president surely must know what's in these documents before they get released because I would think that you run the risk of anyone maybe being named that was a spy for us, possibly still being a live and being put into jeopardy. And also he is citing national security concerns, which makes me wonder, if it was another country involved in this assassination, do we run the risk of flaring up a scenario and perhaps is the reason why they want to be more careful?</p><p>I don't fault them by the way for wanting to be more careful. Because it is all sensitive stuff and you don't want to find yourself in a situation where we're going into some World War III over something done that many years ago, Doug.</p><p>WEAD: I don't think that's the problem. I think it's political and it's personal. Trish, when I wrote the book, \"All the President's Children,\" I had the Warren G. Harding family lobbying me not to include the story of his illegitimate daughter which is now proven by DNA. But that tells you the pressure that was on.</p><p>And one of the revealing moments in this documents that I read last night is when J Edgar Hoover tips off Bobby Kennedy and says there's book coming out next year bout you and Marilyn Monroe. Giving the Kennedy's time to issue other books to dilute that book and to get their answers ready, that tells me why these docs are really hidden from the public. There are people who would be embarrassed by them.</p><p>REGAN: Dough, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p>WEAD: Good to see you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: All right. The White House briefing just wrapping up moments ago, our own Blake Burman was there and he has a very important question about the President 401K tax position. Let's listen. We got the question and the answer I believe. There we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Is the president considering dropping the amount of pre taxed contributions that Americans can put in to their 401(k) currently? That said about $18,000. It seems is that this whole issue is up for negotiation. Does the president support taking that $18,000 a level and potentially lowering that?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: As I said earlier this week the president wants to continue to fight and push for protection of Americans retirement. And that hasn't changed, but I'm not making any - - negotiate any deals beyond that. But that's the president's position and that's the same today as it was earlier this week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: You know, I tell you, there's lot of opportunity had as we look at the market that once again is looking at new a high. New high anyway on the Nasdaq, and we have got the Dow up 31 points right now as we head into the weekend.</p><p>I hope you do have a wonderful one but there's a lot more news coming your way right now in the final hour of trading. Liz Claman has you covered. Hey Liz!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2017102701cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PTS-BXS1-DXH2-641Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7430\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 27, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp; RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hillary Clinton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bill Clinton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John F.

What a day yesterday.  We are looking at a follow through  this morning.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it  Thursday, November 29th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are pulling back this morning after that huge rally yesterday.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow Industrials now down 81 points.  We are following through on what led  the market higher yesterday.  It was a major rally on the street.  The Dow  and the S&amp;P 500 now in positive territory for this month.</p><p>Stocks rallied on the comment -- this comment from Fed Chairman Jay Powell,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  Interest rates are still low by  historical standards, and they remain just below the range of estimates of  that level that would be neutral for the economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that, the markets shut up 600 points in Europe.  This  morning, there is some follow through.  </p><p>The markets are higher across the board.  </p><p>FT-100 up 45 points right now, two-thirds of one percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris also up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up a  fraction this morning, 21 points higher.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances.  Hong Kong and China were lower, but  Japan was higher by a fraction, as was the Korean KOSPI Index.  </p><p>Deutsche Bank has been raided.  Prosecutors alleging that the bank helped  clients create tax havens and launder money.  </p><p>What it means for the already struggling bank coming up.</p><p>And a new tariff threat, President Trump warning of new charges on vehicles  following the G.M. layoffs.  </p><p>Plus Volvo is slowing hiring plans here in the U.S. because of those  tariffs.  The fallout coming up this morning.  </p><p>Honoring our heroes, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald,  pays tribute to Pat Tillman and Senator John McCain on his feet.  </p><p>A closer look at his special cleats for Sunday's big game, that's coming  up.</p><p>And it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas at Taco Bell.  The fast- food giant unveiling a line of themed clothes, from socks to sweaters, even  onesies.  </p><p>We will tell you about it.  All those stories coming up this Thursday  morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman,  and Rosecliff CEO/Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.  </p><p>Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning.  I'll wear the onesie  on T.V.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Taco Bell clothing -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- here we come.  Big move yesterday in the markets, huh?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  It is  a big move, and the oil dipping blow, 50 bucks a barrel, suggests the  argument Mr. Powell was making has been bolstered this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.  And yesterday, I was -- I was at The New  York Economic Club -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and everyone was waiting, will Jay Powell make comments  about the interest rate story.  </p><p>He did a lot about financial stability -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in his speech.  It wasn't until he said, \"Look, we're still  at low levels,\" which we all knew and yet the market saw that as a reason  to run up, Mike.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think, really, the main thing that they got was six week  ago, he said that, \"We're nowhere near neutral on rates.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A long way.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Which is why there was a long -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A long way was -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Sorry, a long way.  </p><p>And now he's saying we're a lot closes to that, which implies there'll be  less rate hikes, which the market likes, that's why he saw the rally  yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was the change in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That one word usually tells it, right?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I've -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James Freeman, where you work, don't know if you had your  hands in this, says that this is a welcome rethink.</p><p>But as \"The Journal\" does point out that we have a market, a global market,  and a world that is grappling with global slowing growth, bad trade policy  that's deterring investment, and a fed that is also still gradually  reducing this unprecedented bond portfolio.  </p><p>And we have no way of knowing what the knock-on effects of that are or will  be, so this is a very welcome, at least, reasonable approach to hiking  short-term interest rates.</p><p>I paraphrase.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.  And just the editorial also adds those Vice Chairman  -- Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida comments from earlier in the week  saying the fact that you've got a lot of people working doesn't  automatically lead to inflation.  </p><p>That's a -- that's a welcome sign from the fed.  </p><p>Personally, I kind of like going a bit higher.  I don't think the fed funds  rate ought to be equal to the rate of inflation.  </p><p>But again, this oil news this morning, if you want to be dovish, if you  want to say inflation is very restrained, you have a better case today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you sure do.  We're going to check markets this morning.  </p><p>Take a look at oil, sitting right at $50.00 a barrel right now, what a  selloff in the last month and a half.  </p><p>Then another half a percent this morning with light sweet crude at $50.02 a  barrel.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is the Chairman of UBS, Axel Weber is  with us this morning in an exclusive interview talking about markets and  investing capital today.  </p><p>The CEO of Calamos Investments, John Koudounis, is joining us as well.  </p><p>Almost looking at the backdrop for stocks.  </p><p>Patron Spirits Founder, John Paul Mitchell Co-Founder, John Paul DeJoria is  here as well.  </p><p>Along with Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Subcommittee  Chairman, Sean Duffy.  </p><p>Plus Tennessee Senator Elect, Marsha Blackburn with us.  </p><p>A lot to talk about with the Senator Elect, so stay with us.  We got a big  three hours coming up.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with this top story, and that is the stock market  comeback.  Check out these numbers, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ  surged yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell's comments on  interest rates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they  remain just below the range of estimates of that level that would be  neutral for the economy.</p><p>That is neither speeding up nor slowing up growth.</p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private sector economists are  forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation  remaining near two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is TIGER 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.  </p><p>Michael, it is good to see you.  Thank so much for joining us.  </p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How's the sentiment in terms of your members?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  I -- our members are trying to have the discipline that when  the market went down 600, they didn't overreact and when it goes up 600,  but clearly interest rates and tariffs are the story of the day.  </p><p>Are the tariffs really hurting the economy and what's going to happen with  the exploding deficit and will we get some infrastructure?  These are the  bigger stories they are dealing with across the country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they impacting things, the tariffs right now?  </p><p>I mean look we've news this morning in terms of companies making moves in  the auto sector as a result of these tariffs.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Yes.  There's no question that auto, for sure, particularly  with the news around G.M. and what's going on, tariffs are having a huge  impact on the auto industry.</p><p>We have members in our Detroit group who are clearly worried because with  the closings of G.M. that has an impact, real estate prices are probably  still too high.  </p><p>That group is waiting for prices to come down and they've taken some real  estate off the table in the last quarter.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm trying to get a sense of how you think your members,  investors generally might react to any news we get out of this weekend's  G20 meeting.  </p><p>Obviously both the U.S. and the Chinese side have kind of downplayed hopes  for a solution to the trade dispute, but what if at the dinner Xi Jinping  and Donald Trump solve it? </p><p>What if we have an agreement or maybe a framework to get to an agreement?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Sure.  So I would say that that would be a very important  news, but when our members meet in groups every month, there are a load of  struggling like what's the really important news and what's going to  happen.  </p><p>And they try to have a All-Weather portfolio, so when I was talking to a  member recently, he was saying -- it was an interesting thing, he's  shorting hundred-year bonds.  </p><p>Why?  Because if interest rates come up a little, those bonds are going to  be a great stabilizer as they fall.</p><p>The Australian markets way overheated, American real estate somewhat  overheated sector by sector, so our members in the last quarter took --  last two quarters have taken about 10 percent of their holdings off of the  table.</p><p>MURPHY:  So when you talk to your members, I'm kind of talking my own book  here because we invest venture capital private equity.  </p><p>So much focus on unicorns right now in the market.  How do your members see  that and do they want to be involved in the private space?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Totally.  The largest shift over the last decade in our  membership is private equity, grown from 10 percent to 24, all-time high.  </p><p>So as real estate is coming down, all-time high to private equity now  exceeding even public equity 23 percent, private equity 24 percent.  </p><p>Why?  Because in venture and in private, you have these scalable businesses  given our technology, that's where the action is, not as passive investors.  </p><p>Our members were the great entrepreneurs who built businesses, so when they  sell their business, what they can do is invest in another business where  they can be on the board or they can actually kick the tires and understand  really what's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does that tell you anything about where we are in terms of  growth, this optimism about the unicorns?  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So what it tells you is when you see real estate coming down  so quickly, that's the biggest sign that those markets are frothy.</p><p>But in total, our members are allocated over 73 percent of public equity,  private equity in real estate, that's a pretty long-term bullish referendum  on the U.S. economy.</p><p>So, I would say long-term optimism about the U.S., short-term, we're in  choppy waters, but still sailing still fine.</p><p>MURPHY:  And I would assume that they're the type A personalities that,  like you said, have built things so they want more control.  </p><p>So being able to invest private and have a little control from a board  level or whatever it may be.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Absolutely.  And if you compare it to, say, the public  equities today, take Apple, or G.M., or Facebook, these are big stories,  but our members have learned that they can't mark -- they can't time the  market</p><p>So, if they overreact to any one of those stocks one way or another,  history is very clear, they can't time the market.  They're better off with  an index fund or a long-term holding.  </p><p>Even taking Apple, which is in bear market territory today, still up for  the year.  </p><p>So, if you're a long-term holder, if you're a 10-year holder, you're still  in holding position.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The -- wanted to ask you, you mentioned Australia being  overheated.  Fed Chairman Jay Powell yesterday said -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was funny.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- they had 27 straight years of growth.  </p><p>If you get 27 straight years of growth, you probably ought to have a sky- high valuation, right?  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  It's a little geriatric in the -- in the cycle right there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a funny comment about Australia.  </p><p>When you look at tech, you mentioned tech stocks.  Microsoft briefly  overtaking Apple -- </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Amazing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as the world's most valuable company yesterday as Apple  faces pressure on the slumping iPhone demand.  </p><p>In terms of this volatility in technology, I know they're not trying to  time the market, how much are they invested within tech versus elsewhere  within equities?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So within the public equity exposure, the growth is in index  funds to avoid just this problem, but the largest concentration of specific  stocks is all the FAANGs.  </p><p>And then now you get the turbulent waters.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and -- or Alphabet.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Exactly.  And now NVIDIA seems to have come into the four.  </p><p>But who talked about Microsoft?  All of a sudden, Microsoft came back after  being so moribund.  </p><p>And then you have to look at the specifics, the problems Facebook is  having, members are concerned about that.  </p><p>And Apple, although Apple is rock solid in its balance sheet, you have the  tariff issue that could have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, though, that investors, if they  watched MORNINGS WITH MARIA and Maria Bartiromo every day, they would know  about the success of Microsoft and what was going on at that company for  years -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- literally.  Your interview with Satya Nadella, your coverage  of Microsoft before that, but also what was going on with Apple and your  interview with Dan Niles -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- well ahead of the selloff in Apple, so you name it, again,  because of the people that you interview on this program, we're giving a  very big window into what these companies are doing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And when Dan joined us, when I spoke with him from San  Francisco, you know, Apple was in this bull market, you know, moment and he  was skeptical.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it was -- he -- his skepticism was born out of the  inventory problem.  </p><p>He said inventories were up 89 percent year over year in the second  quarter, and looking at an economy that is poised to slow down, who is  going to buy a thousand dollar phone particularly in China?  </p><p>And he was right, and Apple has sold-off since he said it, and I -- and I  think Dan Niles is one of the smartest guys within technology, because he  does the backdrop analysis.  </p><p>He's looking for real, specific reasons of why these stocks are moving.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  We see it through a different lens.  Our members in Detroit  are seeing what's happening in the auto industry firsthand.  Our members in  Seattle see this tension between Apple and what's happening with Amazon in  Seattle and what's happening in Microsoft.</p><p>So, when you're on the ground and you're an active investor, you can get  the same kind of -- same kind of lead. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I just want to point out, like, the administration gave  a bit of a bailout, a handout to farmers hurt by the retaliatory tariffs  from china, which we saw in the GDP report yesterday.  </p><p>So, how long does it take for these automakers to come calling and say  \"Where is our handout?\"  Because the President is threatening -- well,  import tariffs on small cars, but threatening to take away at least the  subsidies on General Motors.  </p><p>Which, by the way, started going away shortly.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They got their handouts, didn't they?  The automakers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, ten years ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, that's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ford did -- Ford did -- </p><p>MURPHY:  -- $7,500 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They got a bailout.  They got a bailout.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- vehicle credit for electric cars.  They want to keep going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they want that $7,500-, that was what I said yesterday, the  7,500-dollar tax credit that you get for buying electric vehicles makes  certainly the Chevy Bolt more attractive.  </p><p>They want an extension, their tax - that tax break for G.M. expires shortly  because they've hit that 200,000 vehicle threshold, so we can talk about  the tariffs.  </p><p>But again, these things are hard to quantify.  Until they start showing up  in layoffs of almost 15,000 individuals -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's hard to know what the real impact is of how businesses  make decisions about future investment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But when you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what you're saying is it's a slippery slope.  Farmers want  help, maybe the autos will want it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe somebody else will want it, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Have you seen though the other -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody had -- how about pipeline builders?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're all -- anybody who uses steel and aluminum in this  country.  </p><p>And I pointed out yesterday when the President was tweeting about more  tariffs on small car imports, I just said, you know, anybody who says that  the President wants zero tariffs are non, my -- I'll follow him on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  You know, the only thing I want to say it's true, it's a  slippery slope.  </p><p>Our members are fervent capitalist, but we wouldn't have an Internet  without government investment.  </p><p>We wouldn't have a space program without government.  </p><p>So, there are critical industries that private industry doesn't support.  </p><p>We can debate it, but the facts are we got an Internet, we have a space  program, and we have some alternative energy project and they all got paid  back to the Energy Department.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's -- </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Notwithstanding Solyndra.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, treasury loss, $11.2 billion on the -- just the General  Motors bailout.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So that didn't get paid back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Not much happened on the Internet before they commercialized it.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Anyway.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael, it's great to get your insights this morning.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>Michael Sonnenfeldt joining us there, TIGER 21.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking overnight, officials have raided Deutsche Bank's  headquarters in connection with a money laundering probe.  </p><p>Details coming up right there.</p><p>And then the honor run, one Cardinals player is paying tribute to American  heroes like Pat Tillman and John McCain by putting them on his cleats.</p><p>Back in a minute with that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news this morning, new legal trouble  for Deutsche Bank.  </p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details now.  Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  </p><p>Several offices, including Deutsche Bank's Headquarters being searched by  authorities as part of a money laundering probe.  </p><p>Roughly a hundred and seventy.  That is a lot of prosecutors, police  officers, and tax inspectors are involved in the search of six offices in  and around Frankfurt.  </p><p>So, that suggest the significance of this.  </p><p>German prosecutors allege that two employees, who still work at the bank,  helped clients create offshore accounts and then transfer funds from those  illegal activities.  </p><p>All this investigation was sparked by \"The Panama Papers,\" that was a  massive, massive document leak of millions of pages.  </p><p>Back in 2016, it detailed how wealthy people use tax havens to shield their  money.</p><p>Authorities also claim that Deutsche Bank failed to report the suspicious  accounts, could be used to launder money.  </p><p>Deutsche Bank says it's fully cooperating with this investigation.  </p><p>The stock is down almost five percent ahead of this.  If you look at the  year-to-date chart, it is down almost 50 percent.  </p><p>So the stock is the Wells Fargo to Germany.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Wells Fargo to America, that's its significance in a sense  in Germany.  It was such an icon.  </p><p>And it's had so many troubles between everything that happened in the  financial crisis and the $18 billion in fines and legal fees that they  paid, and now these latest allegations.  </p><p>And on top of all of this, where's the profit?  They're' paying bonuses,  they've increased their bonuses, in fact, to many of their workers, it's a  -- it's a mess.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James, what do you think about this? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think investors, as you said, have had this question  about, what is their business model?  This has been kind of the most  troubled of the giant banks in a lot of ways lately.  </p><p>But, obviously, it deserves the presumption of innocence, but investors  hoping this is not the business model, but disturbing news certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look how the stock has fallen.  Is this a takeover candidate at  this point, Mike?  </p><p>MURPHY:  No.  This is something that they've -- for the last 10 years,  they've been defending themselves from one scandal after the next, and  what's breaking this morning.  </p><p>I don't know that anyone expected this, but they've never been able to  right the ship, so to speak, since the financial crisis, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MURPHY:  -- I don't know where it ends for Deutsche Bank, because there are  so many other great stories out there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess it's hard to believe that Germany would allow somebody  else, a foreigner to acquire Deutsche Bank.</p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, for sure.  I mean -- and I mean that and I don't know why a  foreigner would want to -- because by buying Deutsche Bank, you're buying  all the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The problems.  </p><p>MURPHY:  -- potential issues that are there as well.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Regulators are breathing down their back right now, especially  with these money laundering allegations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll watch that.  </p><p>Obviously, it's going to be a busy day.  </p><p>The stock is down about five percent right now.  And Deutsche Bank, we're  watching that.  </p><p>Let's take a short break.  </p><p>When we come back, Facebook and the data problem.  New court document show  that the social media giant considered selling user data.  </p><p>That's the fallout, and we will tell you about it.  </p><p>Then 'tis the season to be saucy, Taco Bell rolls out their brand new  Christmas apparel line based on their hot sauce packets, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Facebook under fire, internal emails show that the social media giant  considered doing something it said it never would.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's pretty fascinating,  Maria.  </p><p>These emails that were seized by British lawmakers suggest that Facebook  once considered selling users data even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised  not to do that.  </p><p>According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the emails also indicate Facebook  employees discussed pushing some advertisers to spend more in return for  increased access to users' information.  </p><p>At a congressional hearing back in April, Zuckerberg said that he opposed  selling that data.  Take a look at shares of Facebook, they're lower in the  premarket.  </p><p>Maria, of course, can have more on this and reining in big tech when she  interviews Tennessee's incoming Senator, Marsha Blackburn, that's going to  be in the 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time hour.  </p><p>Well, there is a change coming at the top of Unilever, the maker of Dove  soap and Hellmann's Mayonnaise.  </p><p>Alan Jope, who is currently the President of the company's beauty and  personal care division is going to take over for Paul Polman, who's going  to step down January 1st.  </p><p>Polman did lead Unilever for 10 years.  Unilever, of course, is working to  adjust the changes and consumer takes.</p><p>Shares of Unilever, little changed in the premarket.  </p><p>Well, Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi have reaffirmed their commitment to  their alliance.  </p><p>The companies issued a joint statement, saying they remain fully committed  to that three-way deal.  </p><p>The alliance sold more than ten million vehicles last year.  </p><p>But, of course, Nissan and Mitsubishi did out Carlos Ghosn as their  Chairman for alleged financial misconduct.  </p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\" says that Nissan's investigation also has revealed  $80 million in deferred pay forgone.  </p><p>Share of Nissan, Maria, down 14 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Lot to discuss in that story, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there's a lot to discuss because we continue to see  Carlos Ghosn sitting in a jail in Tokyo and - or in -- outside of Tokyo,  and we still don't have any official charges from the --from the Tokyo  government, from the Japanese government.  </p><p>I don't understand this.  I mean I questioned this on Twitter the other  day, James, because what kind of a judicial system throws you in detention  and then they decide what to charge you with.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.  And I think a lot of people looking at this are a little bit  shocked, because, again, this is not Communist China, this is Japan, this  is a modern industrialized democracy.  </p><p>And yet as you said, thrown in jail, not able to consult with a lawyer  before getting interrogated -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- not being able to have your lawyer present getting  interrogated.  </p><p>And this is a guy who achieved a lot of great results for that company.   And we're not getting -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was icon in Japan at one point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're now -- and, you know, he -- we'll see.  Maybe  they've really got the goods on them, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  We'll see.  But -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is this just a question of deferred compensation and whether  it was -- whether it was adequately disclosed or not -- I -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or is this political?  We know that within the Nissan ranks,  they were upset that they were about to be either acquired or merged with  in this alliance with a French company, Renault, that was much weaker than  Nissan.  </p><p>Now Nissan's the larger company, the more successful.  </p><p>So there was this movement going on, Mike, within Nissan to take him down.</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.  And you just hope that this isn't just some political  or go after one person, because it just -- it's like a scene from a movie  right now.  </p><p>But if he's guilty, he should be charged.  And if not, she should be let  go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget about Greg Kelly, the number two guy.  </p><p>His number two is also in jail.  He's an American citizen, these are the  only two people that are in jail for this deferred compensation problem.  </p><p>Where was the CFO as \"The Journal\" wrote about earlier this week, where was  the board?</p><p>So I just have a big problem with what they have done to Carlos Ghosn,  because I'm not -- I'm not buying it, I don't see the charges coming out of  the government there.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what about there -- what is the U.S. government doing about  the American Citizen that's being held under a standard that would -- is --  would not see light of day here in the United States in terms of being  essentially to what you said in terms of the judicial system in Japan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Put in jail and then the charges are being weighed as he  sits in a -- in a jail cell.  </p><p>We'll keep watching that.  </p><p>Coming up, the tariff effect, it is real.  </p><p>Volvo has canceled their multibillion dollar IPO and it is slowing hiring  at American plants, we will take a look at the fallout there.</p><p>And giving away, Patagonia is using money from President Trump's tax  savings plan, but it is not going to their employees, we will tell you  where it is going coming up, back in a moment right here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, November 29th,  your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures showing the markets will pull back, this morning, at the opening of  trading.  Dow Industrials down 72 points right now, S&amp;P 500 is down 9, and  the NASDAQ down 40 points, that's two-thirds of one percent, lower, that  after a powerful rally yesterday.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, gave the economy a thumbs up,  yesterday, in his 12:00 p.m. speech, it sent the market, shooting higher.   The Dow, in fact, erasing the November decline, finishing higher on the  session, by better than 600 points.  Now, the Dow is in positive territory  for 2018, with that huge rally of better than 2-1/2 percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we are not -- we are seeing some follow through  there, in European indices, up 43 points, the CAC Quarante up 30 points  right now, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 30 points, that's about a  quarter percent higher, right now.</p><p>Markets were mixed, overnight, in Asia, meanwhile, Japan did well up a  third of a percent, but the Hang Seng and the Shanghai, under pressure,  overnight.</p><p>Trade troubles hitting the automakers, Volvo is cancelling its IPO.  It is  announcing a cutback and hiring plans, as well, all over increased tariffs  from China.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting out that downsizing at General Motors  may justify new tariffs.  We'll tell you what the President has to say  about that, as we break it all down.</p><p>Then, this, giving it away, Patagonia, deciding not to give its millions of  dollars in tax cut savings, back to employees, why, we will tell you where  they decided to send that money.</p><p>Then, honoring a hero, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald,  pays tribute to the late senator John McCain, with a special pair of  cleats, the details, coming up.</p><p>And it is a Taco Bell Christmas.  The fast food chain celebrates its own  line of holiday clothing based on sauce packets, yes, we will tell you  about that, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  tensions are simmering, President Trump headed to Buenos Aires for the G20  summit, this morning, where he is expected to sit down with the President  of China, Xi Jinping, for a crucial dinner, discussing the potential of a  trade truce.</p><p>The administration floating the idea that a deal can be achieved, but also  additional tariffs should the two companies not strike an agreement,  joining me right now, is the Former Undersecretary of State for Economic  Growth, Energy and the Environment, Bob Hormats, Bob, it's good to see you  this morning.</p><p>BOB HORMATS, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE:  Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  What could come out of this  meeting, in Argentina?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, hopefully, some kind of deal that's sufficient to stop the  escalation in tariffs, which are harmful to China, but also harmful to the  U.S., a lot of American companies are uncomfortable with this trade war  with China, and the fact that it could get worse.</p><p>The probability, though, is that they are not going to have a breakthrough,  because to have a breakthrough, a lot of work needs to be done, there has  to be agreement on principles, neither of those have occurred at this  point, so the best they can do is develop a process for moving forward with  some broad outlines of objectives that both leaders support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of these -- one of the reasons for these tariffs against  China, the President says, is because of China's behavior, the fact that it  is stealing intellectual property.  It is forcing the transfer of  technology.</p><p>It is not opening its markets to foreign companies the way the rest of the  world would like.  And yet, there is another impact of these tariffs, look  at the toll on automakers, as you mentioned.  Volvo is slowing down hiring  in its new assembly plans in Charleston, South Carolina, we learned, this  morning.</p><p>It's citing the increased tariffs from the trade fight with China.  The  company also said it's calling off plans for an IPO, potentially where $30  billion as result of this dispute, follows General Motors plans to cut  14,000 jobs, shut down 5 U.S. factories next year.  The President is now  saying that G.M. closures may actually justify the auto tariffs.</p><p>So, how much longer can this go and how damaging will this be, do you  think, to companies that are getting, sort of, caught up in this fight?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, it's going to be even more damaging if the President  follows through and at the end of year, early next year, raises the tariffs  from 10 percent to 25 percent, and adds a whole new swaff of items to the  tariff list.</p><p>And the reason is, it does certainly hurt China, but it does hurt us  because of the interdependence and relationship.  We get a lot of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do, Bob?  I mean, you know the  issues about the -- about the intellectual property.</p><p>HORMATS:  Yes, I spent 10 days in China intellectual property, when I was  in government, intellectual property issues, questions of partnership,  subsidies, they all come up.  There have been negotiations on them.</p><p>I think what's needed is, for the two presidents to agree that if they are  going to move ahead in this relationship, they've got to take a much more  determined view to get changes that are acceptable and level the playing  field between foreign companies and Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  or could this --</p><p>HORMATS:  I think the Chinese understand something has to be done.  I just  think that the tariff escalation is probably so harmful to both sides that  it's unlikely to be the way of getting real progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you say, the Chinese understand something needs to be done.   What does that mean, though, I mean, we're talking about dictator for life,  in President Xi?</p><p>HORMATS:  I give you one example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HORMATS:  I gave keynote speech at the Shenzhen Technology (INAUDIBLE)  high-tech products from China and all around the world.</p><p>Even the foreign companies that represented there, said the Chinese are  developing intellectual property of their own, innovative stuff of -- on  many levels in China, so they -- their entrepreneurs now have an interest  in protecting their intellectual property, just as, of course, our  companies do.</p><p>So, I think there's a greater chance now of getting some agreement on  intellectual property protection that there might not have been five years  ago when the Chinese were not developing their own intellectual property.   That's an area where, I think, they're (INAUDIBLE) overlap some  convergence, also subsidies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very good point.</p><p>HORMATS:  The Chinese are trying to cut back on subsidies.  Their big  spending -- even though the reserves are substantial, their spending is  substantial, as well.  I think reducing subsidies in their interest and, of  course, in the interest of avoiding unfair competition, would be something  they might decide that they can do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, there's some room here.  There's room for upside potential  at this meeting, isn't there?</p><p>HORMATS:  There is.  And I think that it's not that if they're going to  have a breakthrough in either or these or other items.  But if they  establish a process, whereby the leaders ask for their experts to sit  together and work for, say, six months and report back to them, on two or  three or four items, it won't be a whole list of the kind United States has  proposed to try.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  But two or three items of particular significance that might be  the way out of it and avoid further escalation of tariffs, which as you  correctly point out, is going to be harmful, just because these economies  are so interdependent.</p><p>And one point for Americans to bear in mind, most of the tariffs we've  imposed so far, are intermediate goods, products that are components for  American companies, which squeezes American companies to the next realm, if  their new items added.  They'll be on consumer goods, like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the iPhone.</p><p>HORMATS:  Exactly.  And those -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why, Apple has been trading down.</p><p>HORMATS:  Exactly, they're 10 percent or 25 percent that virtually goes  right to the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's a potential, I think, I hear you saying, of a big  rally, if we get any upside potential out of this, maybe markets get a  relief rally -- </p><p>HORMATS:  I think they will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  if we see something -- </p><p>HORMATS:  For two reasons, one, they'll make progress or hopefully make  progress on certain subsidy issues or other issues.  And second, if it  works or if it's the right kind of deal, can avoid further escalation, so  both would be market movers on the positive side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to note that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,  Mohammed bin Salman, MBS, also arriving in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit,  amid the outrage, over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  I want to get your  take on how he is going to be treated.  I recently spoke with Prince Al- Waleed bin Talal, about this incident, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A month ago, a brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, where his body  was dismembered, is Mohammed bin Salman for real, or is he lying to us  about this modernization plan?</p><p>PRINCE AL-WALEED BIN TALAL, MEMBER OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY:  As for the  Jamal Khashoggi incident, you know, you have to understand, Jamal was not  only my friend.  He was working with me.  And his last job in Saudi Arabia,  it was me and then Arab Channel.</p><p>And I like to give through you my condolences, again, to his family, to his  wife, ex-wife, and to his children, and to his family, because Jamal was a  reformer, he was in no position at all and what took place in that Saudi  consulate was clearly horrific, despicable and tragic and I believe that  Saudi Arabia is going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>But please, you have to give us some time until the investigation is done  and made public by the government of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, Bob, it's hard to know if Prince Al-Waleed was  talking the party lines for Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince,  trying to give back in his good graces.  We know that Al-Waleed was jailed  by MBS, and then he came out, or if, in fact, he is being honest in terms  of saying, well, let's see what the investigation shows.</p><p>Your reaction to the Crown Prince's attendance and what the U.S. should do  now in terms of its relationship with the Saudis?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, I think the problem the U.S. and other countries have is,  first of all, they're appalled at what happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we all are.</p><p>HORMATS:  There's no question about that, and for good reason.  The second  question, though, is they, a lot of these countries need Saudi oil, we  don't really depend so much on Saudi oil, a lot of the other countries in  the G20, do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  Third, they have opportunities to sell more things to Saudi  Arabia, so their abhorrence at this event, is tempered by the fact that  they have real economic interest, and the fact is that some of them also,  want to work with the Saudis for strategic reasons in the gulf.  So, they  have to work this balance -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, but we know that Iran --</p><p>HORMATS:  that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Iran is the problem.  The Saudis have been a partner of the  United States not just for oil but against Iran, so can the U.S. walk away?</p><p>HORMATS:  U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS:  U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was what I was getting at.  But you mentioned oil.  Take a  look at crowd oil now, below $50.00 yesterday, sitting right at $50.00,  we're back below $50.00 this morning, first time in over a year, Bob, that  we're seeing below $5.000, ahead of this OPEC meeting, which is happening  next week.</p><p>Is this telling us something about the global economy, that things have  weakened, is that why oil is selling off or is this more about oversupply?   What do you think?</p><p>HORMATS:  It's both.  It's a weakening of the global economy, not a  dramatic one, but a moderate one.  And it's also a supply factor, and that  goes to another Saudi point.  Again, as much as we're appalled by what  happened, the Saudis are the key members of OPEC.</p><p>So, if there's going to be a tightening of production, it's going to have  to be led by Saudi Arabia.  They have the most excess capacity and  therefore, they would have to reduce output to help push prices up, if  that's the objective of oil producers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you expect that to happen?</p><p>HORMATS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think oil -- I mean, what's your take on oil?  If  it goes much lower than this, you're going to have a problem with the Shell  producers, as well, aren't you?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, see, this is the other part where the Saudis have had two  objectives here.  They don't want the price of oil to fall too much because  they depend on it.  On the other hand, a couple of years ago, the Saudis  had a view, if they keep the prices down, because some of these Shell  producers, in the U.S., and also (INAUDIBLE) have a lot of leverage. </p><p>They will push some of them out of the market or force them to cut back on  productions.  So, again, Saudi strategy plays a key role in that, as well,  even though we're not so dependent on their oil.  It's a global price and  they have the biggest impact of anyone on that global price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, do you think with the slowdown on the horizon,  economic slowdown, the Fed, obviously, yesterday, talked about how great  things are going, but markets have been worried.</p><p>HORMATS:  I think the slowdown is modest, I don't think it's a plunge.  I  do think escalation of a trade war does slow the world economy down, not  just for the United States and China, but a lot of other countries depend,  for instance, in East Asia -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  on sales to China, if their economy slows, and it's slowing for  other reasons, a bit, not a lot.  But trade war would make it a lot slower.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has a big impact.</p><p>HORMATS:  And Asia gets impacted and that affects their finances because  they have a lot of debt, so they have to earn money to pay off their debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm feeling coupled, coupling, remember that?</p><p>HORMATS:  There is coupling.  It's an interdependent world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS:  Once you do one thing, it affects a lot of other things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  And sometimes, people don't think through the secondary effects.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is great to see you this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>HORMATS:  Pleasure to be with you, Maria, as always.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always a pleasure to get your insights, Bob Hormats.  Tune in  tomorrow on FOX Business, Liz Claman will be in Argentina.  She's anchoring  Countdown to the Closing Bell, live, from the G20 summit, in Argentina.   She will be in Buenos Aires, beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, tomorrow, so  join Liz for her special coverage.</p><p>But first, President Trump just tweeted this, he wants to talk about G.M.   He says, General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other  companies are doing.  Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over  the country.  Auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including BMW,  which just announced a major new plant.  The USA is booming, writes the  President, this morning.</p><p>We will take a short break.  When we come back, running with the heroes,  the Cardinals, Larry Fitzgerald's touching tribute to Pat Tillman and John  McCain, showing up on his cleats, we'll tell you more about that, coming  up.</p><p>And then, a spicy Christmas, that's for sure, Taco Bell rolls out a holiday  apparel line, featuring sweaters, blankets, even onesies, back in a minute</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As you saw, markets are pulling back this  morning after that 600-plus-point rally yesterday.  We are expecting a  lower opening this morning for the broader averages.  Stormy Daniels  calling out her attorney, Michael Avenatti.  Cheryl Casone with this story  and headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  In an interview with The Daily Beast,  Daniels claims that Avenatti filed a defamation lawsuit against President  Trump without her permission.  Last month, the federal judge threw out that  lawsuit and ordered Daniels to pay Trump's legal fees, which are estimated  to be $350,000.  Daniels also said she had no idea Avenatti started a  second crowd-funding site for her legal expenses.  Avenatti says, he's  always been with Daniels and says he started the fund-raising to cover his  legal fees.  Because most of the money so far has gone to her security.  </p><p>Well, outdoor gear company, Patagonia, donating the $1o million it saved  from President Trump's tax cuts to non-profit environmental groups.   Patagonia says, the donation is an addition to one percent of sales it  gives to environmental groups every year.  The new GOP tax law cut  corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, you may remember.   Patagonia CEO called Trump's tax cuts \"irresponsible\" for taking away from  environmental services.  </p><p>Well, Taco Bell waste no time getting into the Christmas spirit.  The  company rolling out festive sweaters, they've also got blankets.  Take a  look at all of these onesies that look like Taco Bell hot sauce packets,  because who doesn't need that?  But the clothing and other gifts don't come  as cheap as Taco Bell food.  Sweaters are $59.00 each.  The onesie, Maria,  $78.00.  Shares of Taco Bell's parent, Yum! Brands, up nine percent so far  this year.  I dare somebody on the panel to wear that one day on  television.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, somebody with six kids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MURPHY:  I'm in.  Set me up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need the onesie --</p><p>MURPHY:  I'm on for the onesie.  I don't know if $78.00 is actually  expensive for a onesie or if that's -- I don't know about the onesie mark.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not cheap.  You need the onesie to hide -- that you're fat  from eating at Taco Bell all the time.  And I say that from personal  experience, Nachos BellGrande every day and I was at least 40 pounds  heavier than I am right now.  So, there you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nacho Grande every day?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nacho -- yes, Nachos BellGrande and a beer, that was college.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE).  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come  back, a hero's honor; the Cardinal's Larry Fitzgerald pays tribute to Pat  Tillman and John McCain with some eye-catching cleats next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Here's a change, NFL ratings are up; Jared Max,  why are ratings turning around here?  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Maybe, Maria, good  morning, it's record scoring, more legalized gambling.  You know, some  betters will say, I'm only interested to watch if I have action on the  game.  Oh, and have you noticed, we have not been talking about players  kneeling for the national anthem, maybe some who were turned away are  coming back.  </p><p>Let's take a look at the numbers -- keep in mind, this is strictly Nielsen  T.V. rating not streaming.  Average audience for games this season at 15.8  million, five percent higher than last year's average, but still noticeably  behind 2016 and 2015.  Expect good numbers tonight on Fox, 8:20 Eastern.   First place teams: Cowboys 6-5, tied with Washington to top the NFC East,  host the 10-1 Saints, New Orleans, has won 10 in a row. And what we'll  notice tonight, the Cowboys wearing the alternate white color rush  uniforms; Saints will be in all black.  Teams don't have to wear the color  rush on Thursdays as they did in the past but the Cowboys elected to do so.  </p><p>And hey, fashion goes hand-in-hand this week, week 13 of NFL, is my cause  for my cleats' week -- an initiative began by Larry Fitzgerald around 500  players set to show case their cleats for charitable foundations.  Now, the  cleats that the players are going to be wearing, Arizona Cardinals' Larry  Fitzgerald wears these to honors the late Pat Tillman, who joined the army  after 9/11, died in friendly fire in 2004.  Camouflage design, we see  Tillman's face, his foundation provides scholarships to veterans and their  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY FITZGERALD, FOOTBALL PLAYER, ARIZONA CARDINALS:  Every game day in  Arizona, we remember Pat Tillman's sacrifice, his legacy lives on through  the Pat Tillman foundation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Larry Fitzgerald's cleats also honor his old friend, the late Senator  John McCain, you recall Fitzgerald spoke at McCain's memorial service.   Megan McCain writing on Twitter: \"This is so special -- thank you, Larry  Fitzgerald, my father would have loved this.  Thank you for your continued  love and friendship for my father and for the amazing hero, Pat Tillman.   Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very nice.  Thank you, Jared.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And we should really focus, if the NFL wants their ratings going  up, they should focus on guys like Larry Fitzgerald and things like this  that they're doing because it's an awesome story.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and look at the reaction that you get when you actually  see the guys playing football.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not focused on politics.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's the great American game and you're right, once the off-the- field stuff is not the focus, people want to watch.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MURPHY:  52-51 scores help also.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared's sports reports on Fox News 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.   Still ahead, the A.I. mini car; Amazon's new venture into self-driving  cars, wait until you see this.  It's powered by artificial intelligence,  right here, next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Good Thursday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets pulling back this morning after a powerful rally yesterday.  We're  right down 70 points on the Dow Industrials right now, near the lows once  again this morning.  Nasdaq down 46 points.  That's two-thirds of 1  percent, after a major rally in stocks yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500  are now in positive territory for the month.</p><p>Stocks rallying 617 points on the Dow, 2.5 percent higher at the close  yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up two and a third percent.  The Nasdaq -- check  that out -- 208 points higher, that's almost 3 percent higher.</p><p>Why the rally?  These comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  We know that moving too fast would  risk shortening the expansion.  We also know that moving too slowly,  keeping interest rates too low for too long, could risk other distortions  in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Follow-through in Europe this morning.  the FT 100 is up a half  a percent, 33 points higher.  The CAC 40 in Paris is up a half of a  percent, 25 points higher.  And the DAX index up 12 points, fractional gain  there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances -- take a look.  Best performer was  in Japan.  Nikkei average up a third of a percent.</p><p>We are watching the price of oil today -- take a look.  Crude oil fighting  to hold a $50 a barrel level.  It briefly fell below that for the first  time in over a year just a few minutes ago.  Oil now at $50.02 a barrel,  down one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>Reining in big technology -- Facebook under fire after a new report says it  was considering charging companies for user data.</p><p>Plus Google faces backlash for its project in China from its own employees.  </p><p>All those stories coming up.</p><p>Facebook shares down another 1 percent his morning.  Alphabet, parent of  Google, down a half of a percent -- worries about regulation to come.</p><p>Ford Motor meanwhile is shifting gears.  The automaker reworking its plans  to ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production.  It will not be cutting jobs.  </p><p>A major change for Dick's Sporting Goods to report.  The retailer  considering removing all hunting gear from its store shelves. </p><p>And replacing Alexa with Big Mouth Billy Bass -- how you can get the  talking fish to handle your usual Alexa request.  Wait until you see this,  coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO  and managing partner Mike Murphy.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning.   Happy to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James -- I want to ask you about your op-ed that you wrote  yesterday.  The title was \"Tax cut working better than advertised\".</p><p>What I liked about this piece you wrote is you go into business spending.   And why we haven't seen -- and we were talking about this yesterday, Dagen  and me -- and why we haven't seen a bigger move in companies putting money  to work.  And I argued they are but it's in technology.  We've moved from  an industrial society to a technological society.  So maybe the numbers  don't tell the whole story.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well they do -- and they do tell part of the story.  Obviously  we've seen that increase in business investment this year.  We've seen  productivity going up which is good, allows for higher wages.</p><p>But, yes, that third quarter report on GDP it showed kind of softer than  expected business investment.  We kind of wondered why.  Larry Lindsey, a  former Bush advisor, says the time will -- hold on, I think maybe the  investment numbers are going to get revised upwards.  And that's just  exactly what happened yesterday.</p><p>So better investment, more business spending on equipment, a lot of it  technology to make employees more productive as we saw in yesterday's  report.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It went from four-tenths of a  percent increase to north of 3 percent, right, yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So again, it's not the blowout of the first and second  quarters but overall this year very strong and right on track with what the  corporate tax rate cut enacted in December 2017 was intended to do --  increase investment in the United States.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And for those people who are saying it hasn't done enough, isn't  it hard to go back and say where we would be without the tax cut or what  the economy would look like without the tax cut?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  We saw it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We might look like Germany.  Germany's economy is contracting,  and so is Japan's.  So we might not be in a recession.  But if we hadn't  had that tax cut, we would be -- well, we saw it during the Obama  administration, is that what you were going to say that we never got 3  percent growth in any one calendar year.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, as soon as the tax cut plan hit earlier this  year when it first went into effect, we did see business spending shoot up.   I mean, people -- businesses were reacting to that and then it slowed down,  maybe the worry over tariffs.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that is a concern, certainly.  I think that's why we're  looking -- if they get something resolved this weekend, I think you would  expect some kind of market pop in response.</p><p>But the point is still very strong investment.  Even if it's not quite at  the pace of that initial burst right after the passage of the law,  basically right on target and still in that 3 percent overall economic  growth mode which was the point of the tax reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check out James' op-ed in the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning, joining this conversation, my exclusive interview  with the chairman of UBS.  Axel Weber is here.  We will also speak with  Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis.  We're talking about this market  activity this year with John and Axel has a lot to stay in terms of the  global story.  Rock Group co-founder and Patron Spirits co-found John Paul  Dejoria is here as well.  Plus Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy.  Also  Senate-Elect Marsha Blackburn joining us as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off here with this top story -- turmoil for big tech.  The  \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting Facebook considered charging companies  access for users' data.  This is from internal e-mails viewed by the  \"Journal\".</p><p>Facebook not the only technology company facing trouble and potential  regulation.  Google is facing employee backlash over its project Dragonfly  which would be a censored search engine for China.  Really interesting to  note that Google walked away from doing business with the Pentagon and  instead chose to do business with China where they have to censor their  search engine.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Tennessee Congresswoman and  Senator-Elect Marsha Blackburn.  Senator-Elect -- congratulations to you.   Good to see you.</p><p>SENATOR-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Thank you, Maria.  Nice to  see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  You've been  working a lot on this potential, I don't know if you want to call it  regulatory response or what is the response to this in terms of technology?   What do you want to see happen within big tech?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  What I would like to see happen is passage of the Browser Act  which is privacy regulations.  It puts one -- one template in place for the  entire ecosystem, whether it is your Internet service provider, which is  your ISP or it is one of the edge providers which is Facebook, Google,  Twitter, those companies, big tech.</p><p>And Maria -- they have resisted this.  What they wanted was to put all of  the privacy regulation on the ISPs.  That would have been the 2015 rules  that the Obama administration had wanted to put in place.  But it needs to  be one set of rules for the ecosystem.</p><p>And then you get into issues past that and the privacy regulations, you get  into the other issues which have to do with the operating systems, which is  the Google operating system which you can turn the thing off, pull the sim  card, these devices still are tracking you.  And yes, that is an invasion  of your privacy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that the big issue?  Characterize what the problem is  around big tech.  They're tracking us all the time and we don't know it.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's also an issue that you and your colleagues have  pointed out about censoring conservative conversation.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That is right.  And those are two separate issues.</p><p>Now when it comes to privacy, here is what we need to do.  We need to make  certain that the consumer, the individual that is looking at that computer  screen and conducting much of their transactional life online, that they  have the ability to say to these different systems, whether it is Google or  Facebook or whomever on the edge, no, you do not have access to my  sensitive data and I have the right to block you from using that.</p><p>And when it comes to non-sensitive data, like your search history that you  can say I am opting out and reserving to myself the individual the right to  protect my virtual self online; and you, big tech, cannot use my search  data and then turn around and sell that to an advertiser or somebody.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Senator-Elect -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street  Journal\".</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I hate to raise a discouraging word, because I don't know many  people who are more excited about your election than I am.  I'm not going  to knock your predecessor at this moment, but in this particular issue, do  you worry about creating a new Internet regulator in Washington?  Do you  worry about big companies like Facebook benefiting from heavy regulation  more than their potential competitors will, who may have a tougher time  complying with this kind of regulation?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Not at all -- James.  That is why I think it's important  that we do light touch privacy standards and put that in place.</p><p>And we have a privacy regulator in the marketplace now.  It's called the  Federal Trade Commission, the FTC.  And having that light touch regulation  in place where they are able to say, ok, the individual reserves their  privacy.  It is the same thing that has happened in the physical space, if  you will.</p><p>And for decades, different retailers and merchants and individuals you  conduct transactions with have had affinity programs, loyalty programs.   And what you want to do is replicate that in the virtual space and allow  the individual to decide what information they want to share and what they  want to hold private.</p><p>As it is right now, big tech can just run roughshod if you will over your  transactional life online and they are scooping this information.  When you  look at things like the Science Project and you see that these Google  operating systems will track every single base station that you pass, even  with the phone deactivated, if you will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So you don't know who to trust.  You've got the  technology companies tracking us.  You've got China tracking us.  </p><p>I've got to get your take on this breaking news this morning.  And this  comes from Reuters, Senator-Elect Blackburn.  The Trump administration  reportedly considering checking Chinese students' phone records and social  media accounts for anything that may raise concerns about why they are in  the United States.  Your reaction to this report?</p><p>And it only comes a couple days after we know that there was another report  that showed us that China is judging everybody -- the 1.4 billion people  there -- and coming up with a national score, an individual score, rather,  for each person.  And that's going to dictate whether you can get a  mortgage, whether you can get on a train or a plane.</p><p>So should the U.S. be spying on Chinese citizens to make sure they're here  for the right reasons?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, let me say this about China.  We have been concerned  about the way they interact with U.S. companies for many, many, many years.   And when it comes to dealing with them, I've not seen the report that  you're referencing but I will say this.  I think that Secretary Pompeo is  doing a really quite remarkable job handling and working on the world stage  and making certain that we make wise decisions in our interactions with  other countries.  And so I look forward to seeing what he has to say about  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're going to keep the pressure on big tech.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else are your priorities once you begin your term in the  Senate?</p><p>I mean the President tweeted on the Mueller probe this morning, I'd like to  know what you think about that.  Here's what the President said just a  little while ago.  \"Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a  crime?  At the same time Mueller and the angry Democrats aren't even  looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed  by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.  A total disgrace.\"</p><p>This of course, as Senate Republicans blocked legislation yesterday that  would protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.  Was that the  right move?  Tell us where you are on the Mueller investigation and what  you're going to do once you get there in the Senate.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  I'll tell you, Maria -- when I was campaigning across the state  in Tennessee, and something would be said about the Mueller investigation,  Tennesseans would say this thing needs to get wrapped up.  This thing needs  to get finished.  And Tennesseans are really not, you know, they're not  that concerned about the story of the day, if you will.</p><p>What they are concerned about is the story of their lives and they are  absolutely so pleased with what they see as consistent growth.  And I was  listening to the conversation -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- relative to that.  They like the fact that the economy is  growing.  Things are better for their family.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They are looking forward to having a good Christmas and just  really rocking it in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, like I said yesterday, it's time.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  It's time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's see what you've got, Robert Mueller.  It's been two years.   We'll see if you and your colleagues will see that report early in the new  year.</p><p>Good to see you.  Marsha Blackburn -- thanks very much for your insights  this morning.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. </p><p>Coming up, Ford is shifting gears -- the automaker reworking its plants to  ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production.  It will not cutting jobs while  doing so.</p><p>Then a change for Dick's Sporting Goods, the controversial decision by the  athletic retailer to potentially get rid of virtually all of its hunting  gear.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Futures are lower this morning, well off of the lows of the morning though.   Dow Industrials now looking down about 30 points, S&amp;P down 6, down 30  points on the Nasdaq as well.</p><p>Do you think it's good news, Mike Murphy, if we see follow-through to a  600-point rally yesterday or is it bad news?  Sometimes people want to make  sure that you see that the selling is done before coming in.  You want to  see -- </p><p>MURPHY: We had a 10 percent correction.  We had a lot of selling come into  the market.  We had a very positive announcement from the Fed yesterday.   We had a big rally.  I want more of the rally.  And if we get anything out  of the G-20 this weekend, yesterday's rally will be tame in what happens  Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So does that tell you anything about what happens the rest of  the year if in fact we see buying follow-through this morning?  Even though  markets are lower right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  It does.  I mean the way I look at it is that we sold off for one  of the main reasons was the trade war, the tariffs and the effect that  could have.  And if you take that off the table, we go back to where we  were in the markets.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The steel and aluminum tariffs are not going away.  And when  President Trump is tweeting about import tariffs on small cars to match  what we already do on light trucks, I don't think that this tariff issue is  going away any time soon.  </p><p>MURPHY:  But that's part of the China issue, right.  If that gets resolved.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They say, but it's not.  It's to save the steel industry in the  United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets are lower this morning, down as you can see.  We'll  keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this.  Ford Motor moving around some of its U.S. workers  to meet the growing demand for pickups and SUVs.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone on that now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>The change is going to affect more than 1,100 workers but no jobs are going  to be cut in this one.  Ford added it's confident it's going to be able to  find new jobs for 150 other workers at a Michigan plant.</p><p>Now this is just days after General Motors said its' cutting nearly 15,000  jobs and closing five factories in North America. </p><p>Ford shares are down 25 percent this year while GM shares are down 10  percent.  So some pressure on these stocks for the year.</p><p>I want to stay on cars.  Amazon is getting into the toy car business.  This  is Amazon's new self-driving toy car.  It's called the AWS DeepRacer.  You  can program the car to drive itself.  It uses A.I. to learn to drive better  through trial and error.</p><p>It's also launching a racing league of these cars to put customers'  programming skills to the test.  That's $400, by the way, when it comes out  next year if you're willing to spend that on a toy car.  It's available to  preorder now for a special price of $249 -- Maria.  Sending it back to the  group that has kids because I don't know.  It's expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>MURPHY:  Do you ride in the car or is it you just control the car?  </p><p>CASONE:  You just control it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Does the car record everything going on in the household and then  send that back -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- to Amazon while it's moving around the living room?  Or does  it just drive I think would be one natural question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It comes like -- I'm betting that they're recording us at all  times.</p><p>Meanwhile President Trump just tweeted on the Mueller probe again.  Here's  what he said.  \"When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style witch hunt,  one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end or will it just go  on forever.  After wasting more than $40 million (is that possible), it has  proven only one thing -- there was no collusion with Russia.  So  ridiculous.\"  The President writes this morning.</p><p>We're looking at real estate realities next, the outlook on housing.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New concerns about the health of the housing market.  October new home  sales sliding to the lowest level in more than two and-a-half years.  It is  the latest sign that rising interest rates are hitting the market.</p><p>Joining us now is Rogers Healy and Associates real estate owner and CEO,  Rogers Healy.  Good to see you Rogers.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>Are we seeing a slowdown -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGERS HEALY, CEO, ROGERS HEALY AND ASSOCIATES:  Good morning.  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in housing and tell us how severe it is.  </p><p>HEALY:  It's not severe.  I mean first of all, what we do is seasonal,  right.  Especially in residential, it is seasonal.  And so this time of  year we do see a slowdown.  But obviously the last two years, really the  last four or five years it's been really, really, really, really, really,  really busy and really, really good.  </p><p>But it has slowed down a little bit.  And for interest rates to get closer  to 5 percent, it's more expensive for the house the person thought they  could afford.  Now they really can't.  So, you know, that has definitely  slowed us down but the market is still fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rogers -- sorry, Mike.  Rogers -- you're in Texas.</p><p>HEALY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you worried about the impact on the major drop in oil prices  on the Texas economy and on your business?  </p><p>HEALY:  You said do I worry about it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because you would hear -- everybody's in the oil business  or at least they know somebody in the oil business, oil and gas business,  so you would hear from them that they're concerned, that they're getting  ready to cut, you know, cut jobs.  They're not going to pass on a pay  increase.  I just wonder what you're hearing on the ground about the impact  there on real estate.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I guess I should start with yes, ma'am, I will tell you.</p><p>Yes.  You know, we saw this happen about seven or eight years ago.  And  people just kind of sit on the sideline.  But I'm in Dallas.  So in Dallas  we don't really see the effect of the oil and gas market like if Houston  would.  But it's still people just cautious, right, and prior they were  cautiously optimistic.  Now they're just a little bit hesitant.</p><p>But just like the real estate market, the oil and gas market is cyclical  and goes in waves.  But we're really not concerned.  I think I saw this  morning that oil is about to be under $50 a barrel for the first time in a  little bit.  But it's going to come back, just like everything always does.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Rogers -- you hear so much about millennials and their desire to  rent versus owning a home.  I see that changing at some point.  Are there  any signs of that yet?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I saw a meme the other day that said millennials are walking  around here like they rent the place.  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, so we work a lot with millennials.  And you know, obviously  the American dream has been, will always be owning your own piece of real  estate.  But, you know, the shift is going to happen I think with rental  rates -- I think rental rates are going to eventually start to decrease.   And we've seen this with rental rates as real estate rates have increased  as far as owning a home, rental rates have increased too.</p><p>So I think it's going to become a beggar's can't be choosers situation.   And eventually millennials and especially the millennials that are in real  estate -- they're going to go toward leaning towards purchasing a home.</p><p>But right now they're obviously still renting.  But, you know, when they  want to start a family, when they want to go and actually have savings,  they're going to probably go do something more strategic.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Rogers -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\", news  side of our paper had a story about people doing cash-out refinancings even  as rates go up.  So they're taking the equity out of the home, they're  accepting a mortgage with a higher interest rate.</p><p>This doesn't sound like a recipe for healthy financial system when the  downturn comes.  I guess in some ways maybe there is already a downturn in  real estate.  But are you seeing a lot of these cash-out refinancings where  the borrower ends up much more with a higher rate and less equity in the  home?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, it sounds like they need a better financial advisor, not a  better realtor.  And you know, these people that got in over their heads  back in 2005, 2006, 2007 -- you know, that was the big foreclosure boom  that I experienced with my first group of clients.</p><p>But these guys that are doing cash-out refinances, they didn't manage their  money, you know, strategically probably all across the board.  I mean if  they've got enough equity in their home and you know, you've seen a year  over year 4 percent to 8 percent compounded adjustment, yes -- hello?   Sorry.</p><p>If you see a year over year, you're going to try to find some money  somewhere.  That's going to always happen.  But we're not going to have the  foreclosures that we had back in the days of the big short.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers -- good to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>HEALY:  You too.  Thank you.  Have a good day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers Healy here.</p><p>Coming up, stock market surge - we break down Wall Street's reaction to Fed  chairman Powell's remarks yesterday that he erased November's losses.  It  was a 650-point move on the Dow.</p><p>We're talking with the chairman of UBS, Axel Weber in studio next,  exclusive.</p><p>Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November  29th.  Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages.  We are well  off of the lows of the morning actually.  Markets have been under pressure  this morning after a powerful rally yesterday that took the market soaring.   Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a positive read of on the economy  yesterday sending markets higher across the board.  Powell gave some  insight on what the Federal Reserve's plans are moving forward.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is no preset policy path.   We'll be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and  financial data are telling us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that, the markets soared.  The Dow re-raising its  November decline on Powell's speech, finishing higher by more than 600  points, the Dow Industrials on track for the best week since the 2016  election.  </p><p>This morning, European markets are higher as well.  Take a look at the FT- 100 up three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two  thirds of a percent and the DAX Index in Germany up a quarter of a percent.  </p><p>Markets were mixed overnight in Asia.  As you can see here, fractional  moves although the Shanghai Composite in China down 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Investing in vaping, tobacco giant Altria is looking to take a stake in the  embattled e-cigarette company Juul.  Details on that deal potentially  coming up.  </p><p>Then the future of the future, the phone of the future, rather, we are  taking a look at the new 3D phone that doesn't need any special glasses.   We'll show it to you.</p><p>Plus, hunting season could be over, why Dick's Sporting season is thinking  about pulling hunting gear from its stores all together.</p><p>But first this, our top story this half an hour, Federal Reserve Chairman  Jay Powell, he said the economy is doing well yesterday.  He addressed the  New York Economic Club yesterday.  Powell said that the Fed is close to  fulfilling its goals of promoting maximum employment and price stability.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent.  A 49-year low and many  other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests.   Inflation is near our two percent target and the economy is growing at an  annual rate of about three percent, well above most estimates of its longer  run trend.  </p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I as well as many private sector economists are  forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment and inflation  remaining near two percent.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those comments particularly about being close to neutral on  rates, two percent, getting the attention of investors.  The Dow  Industrials shot up as you can see, closing up better than 600 points on  the session.  That was 2-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive, UBS chairman, Axel Weber.   Great to see you Mr. Chairman.  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Jay Powell yesterday?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think as a former central banker I would say there was nothing  extraordinary he said.  He was just acknowledging that by now after several  rate hikes over two or three years, the Fed is close to neutral.  And I  think the real issue for markets is they have been quite jibbery this year  because three major expectation of what really supported equity markets in  the past are starting to be questioned.  </p><p>The first is will earning growth continue to be as strong as it has?  And  there's some doubt about that.  The second one is really monetary policy  that was a major supporter of equity, markets is starting to be at neutral,  so it's less supportive, it may actually become restrictive.  And the final  point is the economy data, the economic data we're seeing are more mixed.  </p><p>So, there is a mix of head winds that the markets are experiencing that we  haven't seen in that combination for the last couple of years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, there are other things that the Fed is dealing  with.  I mean, you were the chairman of the Bundesbank -- the president of  the Bundesbank.  And you didn't have the kind of issue of winding down a $3  trillion balance sheet, right?  That's one of the issues that the Federal  Reserve faces right now, not just raising rates but winding down the  balance sheet.  Are they going to be able to do that without tightening too  much too fast?  </p><p>WEBER:  But that's exactly what Jay was pointing at.  There are two issues  that they face.  First one is they need to contain inflation because with  the economy doing well, there is a risk that inflation will go up.  It's  been pretty contained.  The Fed was able in this cycle to raise rates,  roughly at half the speed of what they did in the past, and they've  traveled about half the distance.  </p><p>And the real question is, I don't think that normalization of monetary  policy will be completed in the current cycle.  It will take another  economic cycle to really go to neutral.  Because after a very long period  of very low interest rates, raising interest rates has happened very  cautious, but the balance sheets are still very, very expanded.  So they'll  continue to reduce the balance sheet.  </p><p>But my expectation is they won't even go back to where the Fed's balance  sheet was before the crisis.  Central banks have now become a much larger  central counterparty in markets.  And for that, I think structurally  central bank balance sheets will be larger.  </p><p>And I think there's good reasons to be cautious about normalizing monetary  policy because we're coming out of a 10 year low interest rate environment  and therefore you have to be cautious and you should not overshoot.  You  need to look at the economy where central bank support has been taken for  granted for a decade, and weaning that off has to happen with some eyes on  a really cautious normalization.  In can't stay where they are for a long  time because financial markets stability could be threatened.  And that  balance was pointed out by Jay Powell yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But of course, as rates move higher and as we see commodities  prices facing the impact of perhaps tariffs, you're seeing this worry about  margins.  So market has been very volatile.  Are you seeing margin pressure  at UBS?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we're expecting going forward is there will be  continued to be challenges in the markets and margin pressure will arise  here and there.  But the real challenge that I think the markets will have  is liquidity.  </p><p>As the ECB gets off their purchase program for the first time in the last  10 years, central bank balance sheets globally, the sum of what central  banks are doing will no longer support the economy.  It will no longer  expand balance sheet.  Central bank balance sheets globally will start to  shrink and that is a new phenomenon.  Because so far, the ECB's expansion  and the bank of Japan's expansion has more than made up the shrinking of  the balance sheet by the Fed.  That will change at the end of the year.</p><p>So, there's clearly going to be some headwinds for the next year economy.   There's clearly going to be some headwinds from -- you know, the effects of  the -- of the tax reductions and physical reforms in the U.S. are starting  to ban.  Market growth is going to be more normalized.  But there's no  reason to worry, I don't see an imminent recession on the horizon, maybe a  soft spot in the economy for the next first half of the year.  </p><p>Because one thing that has taken toll now is these trade disputes which  didn't really impact the economy but now with China, U.S. heading ahead in  a sort of more conflicted way, many global firms are re-wiring their global  production chains.  So multinationals are really changing the way where  they produce and how they produce and that has taken a toll for a short- term on the economy.  </p><p>So, I expect the first quarter, the second quarter next year to be quite  weak and that is a soft spot.  It's not a recession.  Most data that we're  seeing are not in the typical pattern of what usually you see before a  recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are expecting a weak first and second quarter in 2019  then?  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and we saw some of that in what you said when you reported  earnings last month, they were 26 percent above the expectations.  But you  set new targets in terms of what you want to achieve.  </p><p>One of those targets is you want to bring more money into your wealth  management business.  Tell us about it.  </p><p>WEBER:  It's true.  So, what we did is basically reaffirmed our strategy.   You know, about seven years ago when we looked at the strategy we changed  the way we ran the bank.  Now, a couple of years later, we've given  different market developments.  We wanted to look at whether that's still  in place and we felt that is the case.  </p><p>But we have some targeted growth initiative.  One is really our ultra  business and we're the only truly global wealth manager with a large amount  of clients in the ultra space that is the richest individual and the  richest people in our economies.  And we want to grow that business by $70  billion over the next three years, largely focused on growing our U.S.  business.  </p><p>And that is something where we feel -- you know, unlike a couple of years  ago we're expanding our global business and in particular with the U.S.  being a strong market, we're expanding our U.S. business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do that, Axel?  How do you that grow a business when  you're seeing such uncertainty and worry in a market where the market will  be down 600 points one day and up 600 the next day?  How do you invest that  money and make the case for these very wealthy individuals that you want  UBS to be handling that allocation?  </p><p>WEBER:  Well, I think what you're seeing in the next few years is  diversification will become much more important than it has been in the  past even for U.S. based investors.  </p><p>So, U.S. based investors typically have a very strong bias in their  portfolio towards U.S. investments.  As the U.S. economy is starting to see  some soft spots, and its emerging markets are coming out of a correction,  you would start see investors looking globally at a different mix between  developed markets and emerging markets.  You will also see them look at a  different balance between fixed income and equity investment.  And as  global investor we can bring that diversification to clients and we can  help them invest.  </p><p>Part of what we're also very good at and what we're expanding is investment  in sustainability.  And that in particular is very attractive for the  richest -- you know, clients that we have because they want to see their  investments also raise sustainability and many of the clients around the  globe look at sustainable investment as a new form which is under- represented in their portfolio.  And we have a targeted initiative in that  area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  And I know these are investors that want  long-term performance.  They're not looking to -- you know, make major  moves overnight.  I want to get back to that because that's an important  point.  </p><p>Let me get your reaction though first to this breaking news overnight and  that is about Deutsche Bank, a competitor of yours, authorities raided  Deutsche Bank's headquarters as part of a probe into money laundering.  Now  there's expectations that this company has gotten so weak it's going to  need some kind of a takeover.  Anybody's guess whether or not the German  government will allow its largest bank to be acquired by another but will  UBS be interested in acquiring Deutsche Bank?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we've said already in the past is we're looking  for targeted growth in our areas that where we have expertise and we're a  wealth manager.  And wealth management and asset management, that's the  core of what we do and we continue to look at that.  </p><p>We don't rule out inorganic options but it will not be full-fledged  mergers.  It will be more targeted acquisitions in the areas where we  already excel, where we've feel that we have a value proposition and we  want to expand that value proposition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any issues to that are still ongoing that you can tell us about  with regard to UBS in terms of any of this regulatory or rulings from -- I  know the French court was ruling on a trial back in February for UBS.  Is  that now in the rear view mirror for the company?  </p><p>WEBER:  It's not yet.  We have a -- we have a verdict that comes out in  February.  So, there will be no new news until then.  We're still in  discussion with authorities.  </p><p>We have not foregone the ability to settle the two remaining issues that we  have and for us really what matters going forward is to not have new issues  emerge.  So, we're very focused on compliance.  We're very focused on  operational risk and dealing with them, cyber resilience.  So, we really  want to avoid problems in the future and we've learned our lessons from the  past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that was a priority of yours when you first stepped  into the role.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's get the bad news out of the way and deal with this.  Your  thoughts on the regulatory environment in general.  The president to the  U.S. obviously has rolled back a number of regulations.  How does the  industry change from that standpoint?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think the U.S. is setting the pace here.  What we've seen is  almost a decade of re-regulation.  What is important now is -- you know,  like, with monetary policy normalization, do not overdo it.  </p><p>Of course, you can always rollout additional regulation but I think banks  now need some certainty around the regulatory environment in the future.   So that they can refocused on supporting the economy and that is happening  in the United States.  And I see that happening with some delay in Europe  and in Asia-Pacific.  </p><p>In Switzerland we're discussing some of the final regulations around  (INAUDIBLE) three implementation and too big to fail.  But my expectation  is by summer next year we'll have more regulatory certainty and then we can  refocused on doing business and doing business well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the investor sentiment right now in the face of all of  this, how does it look?  Are you worried about investing in this -- in this  market today?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think we see a lot of our clients are on the sidelines.  There's  a huge amount of cash sitting on the sidelines.  But you know in  (INAUDIBLE) the mood was very good and I was actually one of the few that  wasn't as positive about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WEBER:  We're seeing now a correction that has gone further and was more  pronounced than I expected then.  I think the market is overdoing it in the  other direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Overdue in the other direction.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Axel, it's great to see you.  </p><p>WEBER:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  The chairman of UBS, Axel Weber.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The president is tweeting this morning on  tariffs, here's what he just wrote, billions of dollars pouring into the  coffers of the USA because of the tariffs being charged to China.  There's  a long way to go.  If companies do not want to pay tariffs, build in the  USA.  Otherwise, let's just make our country richer than ever before.   Writes the president.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One, it will never pay down  the debt.  You're running over trillion dollar annual budget deficit right  now.  And number two, its attacks on people who buy stuff from overseas.   So, let's not brag about taxing the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've had a problem with these tariffs from day one and we are  seeing an impact in terms of companies making moves like Volvo this  morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and that's actually in relation -- Volvo is holding off  on hiring down in South Carolina because of the retaliatory tariff from  China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's now a 40 percent tariff on car imports from the U.S.  into China.  So that's hurting companies that make cars here and export  them to China and that's a lot of the foreign manufacturers that have plans  here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we've got a deal in the works.  Altria Group  reportedly in talks to acquire juul labs, that's the e-cigarette company.   Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines.  Cheryl, over you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's interesting, Maria.  The  Journal says that Altria, of course the maker of Marlboro and parliament  cigarettes is looking to take in a significant minority stake in Juul.   Right now there's no definitive deal on the table, but Juuls value by  investors this summer about $16 billion.  Shares of Altria are higher in  the premarket right now.  So stock to watch for all of you more than half a  percent.  </p><p>Well, Dick's Sporting Goods is considering dropping hunting supplies from  over 700 stores because of declining sales.  It's already pulled hunting  gear from 10 stores.  Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods are up about 26  percent so far this year.  </p><p>And remember Big Mouth Billy Bass?  He's back and he can talk back too.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Don't worry, be happy.

He will lip sync to Alexa's voice and dance to  sounds fom Amazon music when you pair it with a compatible echo device,  Maria.  Fun for the whole family.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  </p><p>CASONE:  I love the singing fish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is fun.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, it is 3D without the glasses, we're checking out the brand-new  cell phone that's aiming to shake up the business.  My exclusive interview  with ROK Group co-founder John Paul DeJoria is next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  3D content with a click, a mobile brand is  aiming to shake up the cell phone industry with a game-changing new device.   In a Fox Business exclusive right now, ROKiT is revealing its first ever  smartphone that allows users to watch 3D content without any 3D glasses.   Joining us right now is the co-founder of ROK Group, co-founder of Patron  Spirits and co-founder and chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems, he is  John Paul DeJoria and it is good to see you, John Paul.  </p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CO-FOUNDER OF ROK GROUP, CO-FOUNDER OF PATRON SPIRITS  AND CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS:  Always a  pleasure.  You know, we're launching these phones with the same philosophy  we have at all our Paul Mitchell Schools, give back first.  All of our  students participate, you know, in raising funds to help people out.  So,  we thought to start a business, why not change the dynamics.  First thing  we did was before (INAUDIBLE) we gave away free to homeless veterans that  were on the street there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Gave them the phone and at the same time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then you gave them for also veterans.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO OF ROSECLIFF:  You obviously conquered  the market with shampoo then tequila.  So I'm betting on you not against  you on this, but going after Apple seems like a kind of tough person to go  after.  Can you unseat the iPhone or just take some of their market share?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Well, what I'm looking at is not unseating anybody.  I want  everybody to prosper.  I'm looking at a brand-new field, it's a whole new  area.  Granted, they'll sell for under $300 each and it's a smartphone that  does unbelievable things.  We have a bundle that goes with it.  </p><p>For example, telemedicine, where seven days a week, 24 hours a day, there's  a doctor on the phone with you.  Other technologies we're working with the  NASA as one of our partners that scan the body to do unbelievable health  things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DEJORIA:  We're going to introduce those in about three months from now.   So, shall we say we're a bit of a disrupter because the price, no one can  believe these smartphones are going to sell for under $300 but they are --  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  When you talked about giving away  some of the phones.  That seems like almost giving it away compared to a  $1,000 or more phone.  What are we giving up if we're the customer and  we're getting this $300 phone with 3D images, what are we not getting that  you would get in a more expensive phone?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  An extra $700 or $800 added on.  No, this is a very advanced  smartphone and it has different things you can bundle on it.  Life  insurance, but this is for dollars.  </p><p>Give you an idea, recently we took the country of India, we're wi-fiing the  entire country of India, to help the lower classes become higher classes  because we're putting them on the internet and some of our technologies  doing that.  And we're looking at right now, doing a city in the United  States so.  People, no matter where you are, could try (INAUDIBLE) and make  phone calls anywhere in the world for less than $5.00 a month.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are a true entrepreneur and innovator.  J.P., good to see  you.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  It's always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We'll be watching the developments.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Paul DeJoria.  Still ahead, spotlight on America's  Heartland, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, November  29th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  pulling back this morning after a powerful rally yesterday.  Futures  indicating a decline at the start of trading, about 50 points on Dow  Industrials, about 41 points lower on NASDAQ; after a major rally in stocks  yesterday, where the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are now back in positive territory  for the month.  Stocks rallied, 617 points on the Dow, 2-1/2 percent; the  S&amp;P was up 2-1/3 percent; and the NASDAQ with 208-point rally was up almost  three percent at the close, all on these comments from Fed Chairman Jay  Powell.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIR OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE:  My FOMC colleagues and I, as  well as many private sector economists are forecasting continued solid  growth, low unemployment and inflation remaining near two percent.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Global markets this morning are higher as you can see: FTSE100  up, two-thirds of a percent, 45 points higher; the CAC Quarante in Paris is  also up almost half a percent, 20 points higher; and the DAX Index in  Germany, up a fraction right now.  </p><p>In Asia, overnight, mixed performances as you see here, fractional moves  for the most part.  Big mover is oil.  Take a look at oil this morning,  crude is fighting to hold the $50.00 a barrel level.  It briefly fell below  50 earlier this morning, that was the first time that happened in more than  a year.  Now, oil is up better than one percent at $50.86 a barrel.  </p><p>President Trump is headed south.  The president will leave for Argentina  and the G20 later this morning, where the focus will be on tariffs and on  the president's meeting with China President Xi Jinping.  We will get a  preview from Buenos Aires coming up, this morning.  </p><p>Bailout payments hitting farmers' mailboxes; some of the payouts will not  even cover a cup of coffee.  And then, Deutsche Bank was raided;  prosecutors alleging that the bank helped clients create tax savings and  launder money, what it means for the already struggling company.  The stock  is down another four percent right now.  </p><p>The ultimate Christmas gift for kids, this luxury playhouse, has a living  room, a rock wall and a slide.  It doesn't come cheap.  The eye-popping  price tag later this hour, for that.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street  Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO  and Managing Partner Mike Murphy.  Greatly to see everybody this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURHPY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning,  great show.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.   You know, a lot of good news -- some bad news: U.S. life expectancy  falling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By a fraction, right?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  By a fraction.  And some of this is the opioid epidemic.  But  just a reminder that this mania to count how many people are joining  government health programs is a measure of health is not the right metric.   The right metric is life expectancy and not good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the life expectancy is about 78.6, 78.7.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  So, it's down a tenth of a percent, or a tenth of  a year, I should say.  And it's a -- what's happened is a very positive  long-term trend of higher life expectancy in the United States has come to  an end and has now turned around the last few years and is actually  declining.  So, part of that, we are talking about the fed, thinking there  are more 25 to 54-year-olds who want to come into the labor force, can come  into the labor force.  Part of the reason they haven't to this point sadly  is this issue with the drug abuse and suicide as well.  So, let's hope  there's some effort to get help to those people.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Meantime, on Facebook I  followed Greg Palkot, Fox News Correspondent, his dad whose 105.  So, shout  out to Ed Palkot. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that!</p><p>MURPHY:  Technology and new medicines I think can help people's lives be  longer and better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what we've been seeing; we've been living longer and  the life expectancy has been going up before this little decline.  Love  that 105-year-old dad that you refer, sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed Palkot.  You can follow him; he'll friend you back, on  Facebook.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll talk about all that this morning.  Joining the  conversation: Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here, along with the CEO  of Calamos Investments John Koudounis is here, to talk more about investing  today and the Host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in.  Don't  miss a moment, we've got a big hour ahead.  Kicking it off right here with  this top story: President Trump is going to be headed to Argentina this  morning to meet with world leaders at G20 summit.  Blake Burman is in  Buenos Aires right now with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  President Trump set to leave the White House in a  couple hours.  He will arrive here in Argentina much later this evening, as  he will have a series of events over the next couple of days for the G20  gathering, the gathering of world leaders and that includes a handful of  bilateral events with some of the biggest world leaders: The leaders of  Argentina, Germany, Japan, Russia and China as well.</p><p>Now, it appears as if the meeting with Vladimir Putin is still on.  The  president had threatened to cancel that meeting because of Russia's latest  provocative actions against Ukraine but the Kremlin says, as far as they  know, the Saturday get-together is still scheduled.  And then, there will  be a dinner between President Trump and President Xi of China, Saturday  night.  Trade, of course, is going to be one of the major focal points at  that dinner.</p><p>Now, the president actually has an unusual ally back home as it relates to  his trade position in China, with the top Democrat in the Senate Chuck  Schumer.  Schumer says, he stands with the president much more so than he  ever stood with President Obama and President Bush as it relates to their  position on China and trade.  But Schumer also had this warning for the  president saying do not cut a deal with China over that dinner simply for  the sake of generating a headline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Now, that we're finally  putting the screws to China, we cannot relate for the sake of a photo-op at  G20.  Yes, our actions will cause some pain.  But in the long-term, there's  much more gain than pain.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  We anticipate that tariffs will be a part of the discussion,  Saturday evening.  And the president this morning continues to talk up the  use of tariffs, he just took to Twitter a little while ago and wrote the  following, saying: \"Billions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of the  USA because of the tariffs being charged to China and there is a long way  to go.  If companies don't want to pay tariffs, build in the USA.   Otherwise, let's just make our country richer than ever before.\"  Thursday  morning here in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Maria, a couple days to go until  Saturday, a lot of events between now and then, but Saturday is going to be  the big day here between Putin and Xi. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure is.  You've got the Putin meeting and the Xi meeting.   Blake, we're going to be following your every move.  Thank you so much.   Blake Burman is in Buenos Aires and we'll follow all the news coming out of  the G20.  Joining us right now is Congressman Sean Duffy to talk more about  all of the above.  And congressman let's kick it off with what you think  might get accomplished at the G20 in the next couple of days, are you  optimistic about a deal with China?  </p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  Listen, I think it's important to do a  sit-down and have a face-to-face conversation about what are we doing in  regard to trade.  Let's be clear, Donald Trump doesn't impose tariffs  because he's trying to protect the American worker or the American economy.   He's doing it because he wants trade barriers to go away, because if we  have a fair playing field, we and he knows that the American worker, the  American farmer, the American business will thrive and grow.  So,  hopefully, with China and with other European leaders, he can sit down and  start to break down some of these barriers on trade so he can get rid of  tariffs and get back to free trade, is my hope.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal.  From  Blake Burman's report looks like the weather is pretty good in Buenos  Aires.  So, I would suggest there's a chance that Putin may be shirtless  but -- whether he's wearing a shirt or not --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUFFY:  I think there's great horses in Buenos Aires as well.  So, he can  go shirtless on horses and maybe have some guns, who knows?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  His -- his wardrobe aside, why is he even at this meeting,  why was he not disinvited after invading his neighbor or at least a minor  incursion last weekend.  </p><p>DUFFY:  That's a really a good point, but I think this is the gentleman's  club and who wants to take the lead in disinvite Putin becomes the  question?  But -- outrageous in what Russia has done and frankly, I agree  with you, he probably should have been disinvited but who takes the lead on  that?  Should've Trump or someone else done that?  I don't know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking of being disinvited, you are also going to see Crown  Prince MBS from Saudi Arabia in Argentina.</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is he going to get a cold hello from the others or what?  How  is the world treating MBS these days given the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?  </p><p>DUFFY:  All the world's greatest players, right, coming together in Buenos  Aires.  Yes, so, you know, the conference -- I think the president is going  (INAUDIBLE); we're all going to watch, you know, how everyone reacts to the  crowned prince.  But I think that President Trump needs to make sure he  sends a message to Saudi Arabia and the world, that we don't stand for, you  know, ruthless murder, especially from, you know, regimes or leadership of  countries.  </p><p>However, we also have to recognize that, you know, in a really bad region  of the world, where they behead people, cut little kid's hands off if they  steal bread.  It is a rough region.  We want to, you know, pick the best of  the worst to be our friends.  And you know, frankly, the best of the worst,  especially when you consider Iran, Saudi Arabia is best and we don't know  that relationship I think -- (INAUDIBLE) accountable for the murder of  Khashoggi.  </p><p>MURHPY:  Congressman, it's Mike Murphy, I think --</p><p>DUFFY:  Hey, Mike.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- when President Trump meets with China, on Saturday, I think,  one thing is, we should not be expecting to have a meeting and no more  tariffs and everything is kumbaya after that meeting.  I think that would  be a mistake for the markets and for the American people to expect.  I'm  hoping we get a framework of a -- positive long-term deal, just wondering  if you have similar thoughts on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and also coming from Wisconsin, you are impacted by these  tariffs.  Volvo has made a move today, it says it's going to slow down  hiring at new assembly plant in South Carolina because of the tariffs.  The  automaker was supposed to hire 1500 workers there by the end of the year.   It also scrapped its IPO, that was going to be a big deal $30 billion now,  not happening.  The president is threatening new tariffs after G.M.  announced closure of five U.S. plants.  He tweeted this: \"Tariffs of 25  percent have been put on small trucks coming into our country.  It is  called \"chicken tax.\"  If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars  would be built there.\"  So, Mike, you asked the right question in terms of  the impact here on tariffs.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Forget about Putin and the crowned prince.  I mean, you have Chuck  Schumer actually saying Donald Trump is doing something right in regard to  trying to bring us back to free trade -- oh, my hair is on fire.  I can't  believe --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no he didn't say that, congressman.  He didn't say anything  about free trade.  He likes the fact that this is a handout to the unions.   He likes the -- no, seriously, and to your point earlier, I am going to  push back on this, you said that this is about -- the tariffs are about  China, congressman?  But the president likes tariffs.  He is saying in that  tweet, I like that chicken tax, which goes back to the mid-60s, it was  related to a fight we got into with Europe over poultry, that's why we  called it -- </p><p>DUFFY:  No, no, no.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's why we called the 25 percent tariff we have on light  truck imports, the chicken tax.  So, he likes these tariffs and has nothing  to do with China, that is my argument.  </p><p>DUFFY:  You know I love you, Dagen, but I totally disagree with you.  So,  you look at Donald Trump, right?  You have a raging economy, you know  things are going well for the American worker and the American family, why  would you engage in a fight in regard to free trade or fair trade for  America as relates to the rest of the world?  The only reason you do that  is because you love your country.  And the politics of this aren't good,  but the long-term rewards are great for America.  </p><p>And so, Donald Trump realizes that if I don't put tariffs on foreign  products to get a better deal for the American worker, a fair playing  field, America is going to lose in the long run.  So, he's fighting a long  game as opposed to short game.  All politicians look short term, to the  next reelection; not President Trump.  What he said, no, no, I'm going to  look for long-term growth and success of the American economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but that long game --</p><p>DUFFY:  I'll side of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that long game has some industries, wanting more and wanting  a bailout, right?  </p><p>DUFFY:  Of course, this -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, you got a fallout for farmers, the president's bailout  offering $10 million for Wisconsin farmers.  That's an average over $2000  for each farmer in the state.  In neighboring Iowa, there are some checks  going to farmers that are only $25.00, some are less than $10.00, so how is  that supposed to be a help?  And what do you see happening next for the  farmer in Wisconsin?  </p><p>DUFFY:  So, we have a couple issues at play: One, the price have fallen --  in regard -- in milk, because we're great farmers and we produce more milk.   And when milk prices go down or milk prices go up regardless, we milk more  cows.  I mean, so that's the problem; it's basic supply and demand.  And  right now, we sell a lot of milk to Mexico, they still have their tariffs.   You know, the kind of deal with Mexico and Canada, they still have tariffs  on milk, and we're going to open up our Canadians market, so it's going to  get better for the farmer because of what President Trump has done,  especially Wisconsin.  </p><p>But, you know, we grow most cranberries in America in my district and we  have the best and the most ginseng grown in my district and Asia has put  tariffs on both of those products.  And in regard to cranberries, they  spent millions of dollars developing these markets and now they're going  away because of the tariffs, reciprocal tariffs that China has put on  America, in American agriculture.  And so, you know, we're trying to help  our farmers get through a difficult time.  And let's be clear what's  happening, Achilles heel is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- agriculture in America.  And so, if we try to get a fair-trade  deal for American worker, our counterparts around the world will always go  after agriculture and when they do, we fold.  Trump has said, OK, we're  going to engage in this fight and to sustain the political fight at home,  we got to make sure we prop up ag that we don't want to, we're going to  because I want to build -- to survive long term here, in regard to the  trade fight.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman, last thing, I should have said an attack not  invasion on those Ukrainian forces, but this question where do we go from  here, is this trying to get open markets around the world or is just about  advantaging U.S. manufacturing?  </p><p>DUFFY:  No, this is about open markets.  Because I think the president --  and I think all of you at the table agree that if you have free and fair  trade, the American worker, the American manufacturer, the American farmer  will win; we're smartest and the best in the world but we can't do it when  you have unfair trade deal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got to jump.  Congressman, I guess your new speaker will be  Nancy Pelosi soon.  Sean Duffy, thank you. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have this breaking news.  The White House  reportedly weighing tighter rules on Chinese students.  Cheryl Casone with  the details and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  U.S. officials  and Congressional sources telling Reuters that the Trump administration may  impose tighter restrictions on Chinese students that study her in the U.S.   The issue growing concerns about espionage.  Maria, you spoke to educations  secretary, Betsy DeVos two days ago about the issue of Chinese students in  our country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talking about China, has there been any conversation in terms  of academia and what academia can do in terms of China and Chinese students  coming here going to our universities then taking the best of the best back  to China? </p><p>BETSY DEVOS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION:  Well, I think that's an  issue that we have to have lot further conversation about.  It's good to  have international exchanges.  I think that's important for our students  from America and for our students from around the world.  But I think we  need to also do it with our eyes wide-open about the potential for abuses  in that in that -- in that -- in that regard.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Wow.  There you go.  Well, Reuters says that one possible step the  Trump administration is considering would involve checking students' phone  records and their personal accounts on social media.  </p><p>Well, the headquarters of Deutsche Bank and other offices raided this  morning by German prosecutors and police in connection with an alleged  money laundering scheme.  Nearly 200 prosecutors and state police and tax  investigators involved in searches of six buildings in and around Frankfurt  alone.  Investigation targets two Deutsche Bank employees and other  unidentified officials who are suspected of helping clients create entities  and tax savings.</p><p>Deutsche is cooperating with authorities at this point.  Shares of Deutsche  Bank taking a hit this morning in the premarket on the news down three  percent.  Well, it is that time of year, President Trump lighting the  National Christmas Tree last night as he declared, Merry Christmas.  First  Lady hit the switch to light the tree behind the White House for the  presidential tradition that actually began back in 1923.</p><p>Meanwhile, we got to show you what happened here in New York last night.   The Rockefellers and their Christmas tree lit up nice and bright.  72 feet  tall, it's five miles if LED lights.  900 pounds Swarovski crystal stars  right on top of it.  The Rockefeller Center ceremony actually dates back to  1931, Maria.  And so does the midtown traffic jam that comes with it.</p><p>And then finally this.  Sorry.  Take a look at this.  A kid's playhouse  bigger than someone at departments.  It's 10 by 12 feet for the living  area, a screened sandbox.  That keeps mosquitoes out.  Plenty of storage  space, sofas, it's also got an outdoor a deck, a rock climbing wall and  tomb slide.  The price tagged 44 grand for the child in your heart, Maria.   And there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is nice.  Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming.  Facebook's data problem.  Details on the shocking  report suggesting that the social media giant wanted to sell users data.   Yes, that is next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy at Facebook continues.  Internal e- mails reportedly revealed that the social media company once considered  charging companies for user data.  Gerri Willis on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange with the details there.  Gerri, good morning to you.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That is  right.  The drip, drip, drip of bad news continues for Facebook.  Those  stocks -- shares down marginally in premarket trading here about almost one  percent.  Here's what happened.  Internal e-mail showing executives  discussion charging companies for their user data right.  This flies in the  face of us what Mark Zuckerberg has been saying over and over again about  their policy towards user data.</p><p>He said on Capitol Hill not that long ago.  I can't be clear on this topic.   We don't sell data but all of this now up in the air question after these  e-mails were released.  The Wall Street Journal carrying the story today.   2.27 billion users out there.  Maybe you're one of them. </p><p>Meanwhile, Dunkin' Donuts announcing that a third party was able to gain  access to DDD Perks account number, their last name, their passwords.   They've sent e-mails out for a password reset for those folks and you  probably already been alerted.  And they say that their security kicked in  and started alerting everybody to the problem.  One point to think about  this morning, October 31st.  That was the date that Dunkin' found out about  this.</p><p>We're only hearing about it now.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much.  Gerri Willis on the floor of  the NYSE where we are expecting a lower opening for the broader average  this morning after that big rally yesterday.</p><p>Coming up.  Washington and your wallet.  We break down how the economy is  doing under President Trump and how it's impacting your pocket book.  Then,  the CEO of Calamos Investments works through the markets yesterday and  today and how to allocate capital.  John Doudonunis is here.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, November  29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  We have  breaking news right now.  We are waiting on the October reading on personal  income and personal spending.  Both are expected to be up four-tenths of  one percent.  As soon as we get the numbers which should be in about 15  seconds or so.</p><p>We will bring those to you.  We are also waiting on weekly jobless claims.   The estimate there, 220,000 jobless claims for the last week.  We will  flash it on the screen as soon as it hits the tape.  These are typically  not market movers, but this morning, we are expecting a lower opening from  the broader averages.  The Dow Industrials expected to be down about 30  points on the Dow, down 32 points on the NASDAQ, that's one half of one  percent, after that big powerful rally yesterday of up 600 points.</p><p>In Europe this -- in Europe this morning, we've got a higher showing as  well.  The numbers are coming out a little better-than-expected, up six- tenths of a percent on personal income and spending.  Up six-tenths of a  percent, we were expecting up four-tenths of a percent.  Again, these are  typically not market movers, so we'll be watching the impact here from --  income up five-tenths of a percent and spending up six-tenths of a percent.   As you can see, personal spending and income are out.</p><p>Markets mixed in Asia overnight.  Take a look at the Asian indices, and as  you will see, the best performer there was in Japan, the Nikkei Average up  a fraction.</p><p>We want to bring in Calamos Investments CEO, John Koudounis, right now.   And, John, it is good to see you this morning, thank you so much for  joining us.  </p><p>JOHN KOUDOUNIS, CEO, CALAMOS INVESTMENTS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations on the great couple of years at Calamos.  You  took over a CEO two years ago.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Assets under management at the time was 16 billion?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Just over that, a little bit over that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A little?  And now you're at 23 billion.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Just over 23 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you gather assets in an environment where you do see  the nervousness that we see and worries over the slowdown?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Well, it's -- I have to give a lot of credit to our Founder  John Calamos, he's built an incredible firm.  And the fabric of our firm is  we're great risk managers, and our portfolio managers have done a great  job.  We've used convertibles to do that.  And in this environment, it's  been very, very effective for us.  If you look at these conditions of  possible rates rising of huge volatility, a lot of our funds saw for those  problems, and that's why we've seen an incredible amount of inflows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you've got these inflows and you're allocating it  differently.  Do you worry that things are about to slow down, because that  seems to be the market worry?  Of course, yesterday, after Federal Reserve  Chairman said that we're close to neutral, basically given the market what  it wanted, we saw a 600-plus-point rally, but it's been a really tough  month.  So, tell us how you're dealing with this volatility in markets.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Well, we look at the markets with -- we take a very long-term  perspective.  And it was not a huge surprise, at least to me, that the Fed  was going to be accommodative.  A lot of the numbers and -- that were  building up to this, led for this decision.  And so, there's going to be  noise back-and-forth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not really accommodative.  I mean, they've raised  rates three times this year, they're going to raise rates again on December  17, and the next meeting is four rate hikes, and we're expecting another  three rate hikes next year.  Will this higher interest rates slow down what  has been a very strong economy on the President's economic policies.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Well, there's -- they're saying that they might do another  three interest rates hikes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  I don't think -- I'm not buying it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  I think they will be accommodative, and I think we're starting  to see that language yesterday.  And that's why we had that move over 600  points in the Dow.  So, what do you do to protect yourselves?  There's  certainly alternates that you can use to protect yourself.  We are market  neutral that protect yourself in volatility.  We have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mean market neutral funds.  Yes?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Market neutral funds, it's had a huge inflows in the last  couple of years.  It's up over $6 billion in terms of AUM on that  particular fund.  We have (INAUDIBLE) short that deals also with the market  volatility, because you're (INAUDIBLE) short, and we've seen that  particular part of the firm, the liquid alts, convertibles have done  really, really well.  And if you look at the markets since '08 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We've had 21 corrections that have been over five percent in  the equity markets.  All but one of them convertibles have outperformed.   So, just the mere fact that convertibles get you the majority of the upside  and limits your downside, they work.  So, what's been our secret of  successes, our managers have done a great job, but they're doing what  they're saying that they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Our funds are doing what they're saying that they're doing, and  that's what people like, they trust us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you deal with this race to the bottom on fees for some  of your competitors?  I mean, you've got lots of things coming at you,  whether it's Fidelity cutting fees to rock-bottom levels, and Vanguard  doing the same thing on ETFs and index funds, as well as, you know, people  saying, let's go passive, instead of active, then you've got FinTech coming  at you with technology.  How do you address all of these things coming at  your traditional money-manager firm like Calamos.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  That's a great, great question, and frankly, a lot of people  have difficulty with that, and you've seen other firms, our size actually  going the other way, where AUM has been decreasing, how do you deal with  that?  A couple of years ago, I know that I've been on your show, we're  talking about passive was extremely in, and when the markets were going  straight up, why do you need to ask the manager?  We're at the managers'.   There's nothing hiding about that, we're very active, we have to justify  our fees, and you're right, it gets harder and harder as we get few  compression in the markets.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're saying good managers are going to be able to give  you alternatives when markets are going down, you're going to want that  active manager as opposed to a passive venture, is that what you're saying?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Not just -- I'm exactly saying that, not just when markets are  going down, but when they're volatile.  People need their hand held.  Most  of our base right now is retail.  We have incredible distribution through  our intermediaries, our RIAs, we're on all the wire houses from Merrill to  Wells Fargo to UBS, and a lot of our clients are mom and pop.  And so, when  they see these markets, they're looking for solutions.  We were the number  one inflow asset manager for the last 12 months out of anyone in the world.   And we stand in a great company, top 10 guys, people at BlackRock,  Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, PIMCO, great firms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's working now then, John, tell me what's working.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  It's active management in this particular space.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But in what particular funds?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Since the volatility, since the current administration, since  they've taken out the regulations or limited them, since the tax cuts  things have changed, markets have changed, people are trying to navigate  through them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  And so, when we have people that have been dealing with this,  our firm is over 41 years old, have been conservative, and have been very,  very -- have great track records over the long run, it works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So, where do you want to see -- so where are you seeing  the performance right now?  You mentioned liquid alts, is that where you're  -- the alternatives -- you're seeing --</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We're seeing -- we're seeing the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where is the performance?  What's working now?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  What's working is our liquid alt books, are outperforming both  equities and bond market.  And some of them are bond -- we'll use them  instead of bond funds, and some of them are just alternatives to straight  growth of equity funds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about straight growth equities, do you still like growth,  do you still see sentiment on the part of your customers, your clients  wanting things like Apple, and these, you know, growth funds that have seen  such volatility?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We're seeing a slowdown in that particular market.  Because  when you see some of these volatilities and the downtrend of the market,  there's always the growth versus value type of question that comes out.   And then, you have to be a lot more specific in what stocks you pick in the  growing market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in terms of the growth and where is the growth within the  growth sector, are you seeing any other real performance coming out of some  of the growth equity portion of the firm?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We're seeing a huge internal cyclical move, where the FAANGs  were leading the markets and it was the biggest percentage, we're starting  to see other stocks, other -- whether it'd be tech, we feel that finance is  still going to do really well in the FAANG stocks.  So, we're seeing  movement out of some into the others, not just from --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, an allocation shift is going on.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Huge allocation shift, and we're not just seeing a pull, we're  just seeing more of an allocation shift and a slowdown of growth in the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry that rates are going to spoil the party that  higher rates?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Look, there always going to be mistakes that are done, but I  think Jay Powell is doing a great job, he knows what he's doing, he will be  accommodative.  They say three rate hikes, I don't believe it.  Unless the  market is so strong and growth is so strong that they will do those hikes,  they will watch it, and it's not all the battering because of the current  administration is saying.  They may listen to that but I think they're  looking at the data, and they know -- nobody does well if they choke the  market by raising rates too quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  So, they're going to be very, very -- looking at all statistics  and I think they're going to continue to be accommodative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there seems to be a better tone right now.  I mean, the  market is lower, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, but  it's only 20 points, and this is after a powerful rally yesterday.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did it feel like you wanted to buy into that rally yesterday  when things were moving up?  Were you on the buy side or were you selling  into the strength?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  I think there's been a lot of cash on the sidelines. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  And I think a lot of people were looking for this opportunity,  and that's why we saw that big of a movement.  And we -- the market kind of  sensed that Powell was going to say some positive things for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We saw it go up, and then we saw it double again, the increase  after the speech.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's incredible, because as soon as the embargoed comments  came out, markets shoots up and then stayed up 500 points while Mr. Powell  was speaking.  It's great to see you, John.  Thank you so much.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  It's great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Koudounis joining us there, CEO of Calamos.</p><p>Coming up, battle at the border, the growing concerns of a potential health  risks among the migrant caravan members.  Then, President Trump on the  world stage this weekend.  Stuart Varney's expectations for the G20 summit.   He's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching by Buenos Aires this morning.   President Trump is headed to the G20 summit in Argentina, this morning, as  he prepares for the high-stakes dinner with China's President Xi Jinping.   Joining us now to talk more about that is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\"  Stuart Varney with some high expectations, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, let's compare and  contrast, in all previous G20 meetings or whatever they call it, G10, G12 - - whatever -- they all appear for the photo-op wearing some strange  costumes from the host country, then they get together and give this final  communique which says absolutely nothing, it is totally meaningless.  This  time around, this G20, this one in Buenos Aires, is going to be radically  different.  This is a place where something is going to happen.  And the  headlines will be flowing thick and fast.  </p><p>Number one, you've got Saturday night's dinner with Xi Jinping.  Don't tell  me there'll be no headline after that.  Saturday morning or lunchtime I  think it is, he meets with Putin.  Putin has just set his navy on the  Ukrainian Navy.  Don't tell me that nothing's going to happen with that  meeting.  Theresa May and Angela Merkel, they're there, do you think he'll  have something to say about Brexit?  How about the leader of Japan and  South Korea, do you think they'll have something to say about North Korea?   I do.  I think it's going to be a thick and fast flow of headlines,  meaningful headlines, news will be made.  And that's a wonderful thing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  Lots to cover on Sunday and Monday that's  for sure.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think these are going to be largely positive headlines?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know.  I mean, you're laughing at me because you know - - you know, it's going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  I think thick and fast </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that's the wildcard.  We'll see.</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  But I'll guarantee that at the end of the dinner with Xi Jinping,  they'll be a smile, there will be a handshake, but after that, I don't  know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of potential for upside surprises, you know, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because markets aren't expecting much on the China front,  right.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Well, look at the Fed yesterday.  And were we expecting that  yesterday?  We got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was wild.  Stu, thanks.  We'll see you in about 10  minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you'll have a lot more at the top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join  Stuart and company, coming up.</p><p>But first, there's this, health concerns at the southern border.  We are  headed live to Mexico, next up.  We'll get the latest on the caravan  crisis.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Health problems now at the southern border.  The  undocumented immigrants from the caravan could potentially bring serious  health concerns to the United States.  Griff Jenkins is live this morning  in Tijuana, Mexico.  Here's more on this.  Good morning to you, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria, good morning.   Yes, we're getting really troubling and concerning members for this migrant  caravan.  There are 6,000 here in Tijuana, and the health officials here  told me yesterday that this is what they're seeing out of the 2,267 people  they've treated, over 60 percent have respiratory infections.  There have  been three confirmed cases of tuberculosis, four cases of HIV aids, and 101  cases of lice, as well as four cases of chicken pox, and they're very  worried about hepatitis because of the unsanitary conditions.  And also,  because of the overcrowding.  If you just look over here for one second,  Maria, you see, over that fence line is 6,000 close people, packed into a  space for 1,000.  </p><p>Then, if you quickly look just down this way, you see that white tent and  one truck, that is the Tijuana health officials, that is the only resources  that is dealing with all of that overcrowding.  There is a lot of coughing,  a lot of spitting, there are signs that say \"prohibido escupir\" no  spitting, because they're worried about the spread.  And it is -- the  migrants here that are under these conditions, they believe they're getting  very exhausted, and they say, listen, we were lied to in the very beginning  from organizers who said it was going to be easier, not this tough.  And  they worry of breaking points coming.  This is immigrant Marco Munoz from  Honduras.  Take at a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARCO MUNOZ, IMMIGRANT FROM HONDURAS:  They lied to us from the beginning.   So, most of these people are disappointed, you know, and getting frustrated  as time -- so as you can see, every day that come -- that passes, there's  more and more people that are coming.  So, there's going to be a point  break, but they're just going to say, let's just -- let's rush in there,  you know?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  So, you've got rain coming earlier today already, and it's  expected throughout the day, that makes things even worse under these  conditions, the migrants are wet, cold, and tired, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thank you so much.  Griff Jenkins is live in  Tijuana this morning.</p><p>Coming up, corporate patriots, how U.S. companies can do their part  protecting intellectual property from China, one of the biggest issues  today.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're taking a look at American companies doing their part.  A  new op-ed this morning calls for companies to do more, that's in today's  Wall Street Journal.  The headline reads this: \"Where Are the Corporate  Patriots?\" And in it, the author writes: \"Too many American companies have  been too quick to sell out in exchange for access to the Chinese market.   They are more than business decisions, they are matters of national  security.\"</p><p>And, you know, James, I always go back to the Google decision, when Google  decided we don't want to do evil, so we're not going to work with the  Pentagon and we're not going to work with the U.S. government on anything  regarding immigration, after parents were separated from their children.   And, instead, Google turns around and they go to China, with all of the bad  behavior in China from human rights to everything else, stealing of theft - - theft of technology.  They are OK with censoring their search engine in  China.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it was outrageous.  And I think this article -- I'm glad we  were able to run this op-ed by Samantha Ravich who is on the Trump  intelligence advisory board, also at the Foundation for Defense of  Democracies.  And it raises, I think, a big question here, which is we're  watching obviously the President try to negotiate to change China's  behavior, and she's saying, well, what responsibilities do companies have?   Should they just refuse to share their technology?  Should they refuse on  the Google end to participate in the -- in the police state there?  You  know, are there options that companies have, and are there things they  should be doing that they're not in terms of reporting intelligence back to  the U.S. government?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Dagen, Andrew Higgins is mentioned in the piece,  who's of course, Higgins boat was instrumental in the D-Day invasion. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, I love that she reminds the American people where -- who  made those boats and kind of partnership between private industry and the  United States that help us win World War II, she points out that Higgins  was paid tribute in 1944 in Eisenhower's Thanksgiving Day address.  To that  point, there is a responsibility that American corporations have to  protecting what is ours, and doing right by everyone in this nation.  And I  think that more and more, we call out these individual companies as you  have with Google, the more -- you know, the more power we might have over  their businesses decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think they have a responsibility, it's this great country  that made them strong, powerful, and rich, Mike Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, they have a responsibility to an extent, but it's a different  world now, it's a global economy that we live in, and these companies that  are being -- their job -- you know, the CEOs of these public companies,  especially, they have to do what's best for their shareholders.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  I shouldn't say this country made them rich, that's not  right.  It enabled them with our freedoms and our democracy.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It helped them do so.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  And they see China as the biggest market in the world, and a  great way for them to increase their company profits, and I think, really,  what I bring this back to is the current issue that we have with the trade  war and tariffs, and that's we -- what the President wants is fair trade  across the globe.  And I think if we get that, it's better for China, it's  better for the United States, it's better for everyone in between  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It raises a -- it raises a bigger issue, though, these companies  -- it's their intellectual property that's getting stolen, $600 billion --  up to $600 billion a year.  And so then, when there's trouble, then they  turn to the government and want the government to fix what they needed to  take charge of to begin with. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Trump is doing right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  That's what he wants.  So --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And I think, maybe, a hopeful part of this story is that I  think a lot of businesses have realized, they went into China thinking huge  long-term market, last few years, they're seeing this communist regime has  become more communist, it's kind of reverted, become less open, not  liberalizing anymore.  I don't think China is getting the help from the  American business community they thought they were going to get to pressure  Donald Trump.  I think they have found a lot of American companies saying,  yes, Trump is right, we're getting a raw deal.  So, I think that is maybe  the hopeful sign here, and perhaps this op-ed will encourage more on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but the likes of Google, they say, if they're saying that  at all, they're saying it privately and quietly because some of these  liberal companies, they won't stand next to the President in agreement on  him doing what is right for the entire nation and every worker in this  country because they don't want to be associated with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that's just --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's just ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've thrown out -- I mean, the mainstream media, they've  thrown out their ideals and values of what we deem so important to us, and  that is freedom, due process because they hate Donald Trump.  I mean, it's  really disgusting.  </p><p>Before we go, we've got a couple of seconds left.  Mike, you're expecting a  pretty good performance in markets, aren't you, after yesterday's big  rally?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we get a rally after the G20, and I think it's a big  rally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Mike Murphy, James Freeman,  Dagen McDowell, great to see everybody, have a great day.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  That will do it for us.  Go seize the day, \"VARNEY  &amp;COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, this is a day to be seized.  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Prosecutors alleging that the bank helped  clients create tax havens and launder money.  </p><p>What it means for the already struggling bank coming up.</p><p>And a new tariff threat, President Trump warning of new charges on vehicles  following the G.M. layoffs.  </p><p>Plus Volvo is slowing hiring plans here in the U.S. because of those  tariffs.  The fallout coming up this morning.  </p><p>Honoring our heroes, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald,  pays tribute to Pat Tillman and Senator John McCain on his feet.  </p><p>A closer look at his special cleats for Sunday's big game, that's coming  up.</p><p>And it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas at Taco Bell.  The fast- food giant unveiling a line of themed clothes, from socks to sweaters, even  onesies.  </p><p>We will tell you about it.  All those stories coming up this Thursday  morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman,  and Rosecliff CEO/Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.  </p><p>Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning.  I'll wear the onesie  on T.V.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Taco Bell clothing -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- here we come.  Big move yesterday in the markets, huh?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  It is  a big move, and the oil dipping blow, 50 bucks a barrel, suggests the  argument Mr. Powell was making has been bolstered this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.  And yesterday, I was -- I was at The New  York Economic Club -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and everyone was waiting, will Jay Powell make comments  about the interest rate story.  </p><p>He did a lot about financial stability -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in his speech.  It wasn't until he said, \"Look, we're still  at low levels,\" which we all knew and yet the market saw that as a reason  to run up, Mike.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think, really, the main thing that they got was six week  ago, he said that, \"We're nowhere near neutral on rates.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A long way.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Which is why there was a long -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A long way was -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Sorry, a long way.  </p><p>And now he's saying we're a lot closes to that, which implies there'll be  less rate hikes, which the market likes, that's why he saw the rally  yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was the change in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That one word usually tells it, right?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I've -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James Freeman, where you work, don't know if you had your  hands in this, says that this is a welcome rethink.</p><p>But as \"The Journal\" does point out that we have a market, a global market,  and a world that is grappling with global slowing growth, bad trade policy  that's deterring investment, and a fed that is also still gradually  reducing this unprecedented bond portfolio.  </p><p>And we have no way of knowing what the knock-on effects of that are or will  be, so this is a very welcome, at least, reasonable approach to hiking  short-term interest rates.</p><p>I paraphrase.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.  And just the editorial also adds those Vice Chairman  -- Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida comments from earlier in the week  saying the fact that you've got a lot of people working doesn't  automatically lead to inflation.  </p><p>That's a -- that's a welcome sign from the fed.  </p><p>Personally, I kind of like going a bit higher.  I don't think the fed funds  rate ought to be equal to the rate of inflation.  </p><p>But again, this oil news this morning, if you want to be dovish, if you  want to say inflation is very restrained, you have a better case today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you sure do.  We're going to check markets this morning.  </p><p>Take a look at oil, sitting right at $50.00 a barrel right now, what a  selloff in the last month and a half.  </p><p>Then another half a percent this morning with light sweet crude at $50.02 a  barrel.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is the Chairman of UBS, Axel Weber is  with us this morning in an exclusive interview talking about markets and  investing capital today.  </p><p>The CEO of Calamos Investments, John Koudounis, is joining us as well.  </p><p>Almost looking at the backdrop for stocks.  </p><p>Patron Spirits Founder, John Paul Mitchell Co-Founder, John Paul DeJoria is  here as well.  </p><p>Along with Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Subcommittee  Chairman, Sean Duffy.  </p><p>Plus Tennessee Senator Elect, Marsha Blackburn with us.  </p><p>A lot to talk about with the Senator Elect, so stay with us.  We got a big  three hours coming up.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with this top story, and that is the stock market  comeback.  Check out these numbers, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ  surged yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell's comments on  interest rates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they  remain just below the range of estimates of that level that would be  neutral for the economy.</p><p>That is neither speeding up nor slowing up growth.</p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private sector economists are  forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation  remaining near two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is TIGER 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.  </p><p>Michael, it is good to see you.  Thank so much for joining us.  </p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How's the sentiment in terms of your members?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  I -- our members are trying to have the discipline that when  the market went down 600, they didn't overreact and when it goes up 600,  but clearly interest rates and tariffs are the story of the day.  </p><p>Are the tariffs really hurting the economy and what's going to happen with  the exploding deficit and will we get some infrastructure?  These are the  bigger stories they are dealing with across the country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they impacting things, the tariffs right now?  </p><p>I mean look we've news this morning in terms of companies making moves in  the auto sector as a result of these tariffs.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Yes.  There's no question that auto, for sure, particularly  with the news around G.M. and what's going on, tariffs are having a huge  impact on the auto industry.</p><p>We have members in our Detroit group who are clearly worried because with  the closings of G.M. that has an impact, real estate prices are probably  still too high.  </p><p>That group is waiting for prices to come down and they've taken some real  estate off the table in the last quarter.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm trying to get a sense of how you think your members,  investors generally might react to any news we get out of this weekend's  G20 meeting.  </p><p>Obviously both the U.S. and the Chinese side have kind of downplayed hopes  for a solution to the trade dispute, but what if at the dinner Xi Jinping  and Donald Trump solve it? </p><p>What if we have an agreement or maybe a framework to get to an agreement?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Sure.  So I would say that that would be a very important  news, but when our members meet in groups every month, there are a load of  struggling like what's the really important news and what's going to  happen.  </p><p>And they try to have a All-Weather portfolio, so when I was talking to a  member recently, he was saying -- it was an interesting thing, he's  shorting hundred-year bonds.  </p><p>Why?  Because if interest rates come up a little, those bonds are going to  be a great stabilizer as they fall.</p><p>The Australian markets way overheated, American real estate somewhat  overheated sector by sector, so our members in the last quarter took --  last two quarters have taken about 10 percent of their holdings off of the  table.</p><p>MURPHY:  So when you talk to your members, I'm kind of talking my own book  here because we invest venture capital private equity.  </p><p>So much focus on unicorns right now in the market.  How do your members see  that and do they want to be involved in the private space?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Totally.  The largest shift over the last decade in our  membership is private equity, grown from 10 percent to 24, all-time high.  </p><p>So as real estate is coming down, all-time high to private equity now  exceeding even public equity 23 percent, private equity 24 percent.  </p><p>Why?  Because in venture and in private, you have these scalable businesses  given our technology, that's where the action is, not as passive investors.  </p><p>Our members were the great entrepreneurs who built businesses, so when they  sell their business, what they can do is invest in another business where  they can be on the board or they can actually kick the tires and understand  really what's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does that tell you anything about where we are in terms of  growth, this optimism about the unicorns?  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So what it tells you is when you see real estate coming down  so quickly, that's the biggest sign that those markets are frothy.</p><p>But in total, our members are allocated over 73 percent of public equity,  private equity in real estate, that's a pretty long-term bullish referendum  on the U.S. economy.</p><p>So, I would say long-term optimism about the U.S., short-term, we're in  choppy waters, but still sailing still fine.</p><p>MURPHY:  And I would assume that they're the type A personalities that,  like you said, have built things so they want more control.  </p><p>So being able to invest private and have a little control from a board  level or whatever it may be.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Absolutely.  And if you compare it to, say, the public  equities today, take Apple, or G.M., or Facebook, these are big stories,  but our members have learned that they can't mark -- they can't time the  market</p><p>So, if they overreact to any one of those stocks one way or another,  history is very clear, they can't time the market.  They're better off with  an index fund or a long-term holding.  </p><p>Even taking Apple, which is in bear market territory today, still up for  the year.  </p><p>So, if you're a long-term holder, if you're a 10-year holder, you're still  in holding position.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The -- wanted to ask you, you mentioned Australia being  overheated.  Fed Chairman Jay Powell yesterday said -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was funny.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- they had 27 straight years of growth.  </p><p>If you get 27 straight years of growth, you probably ought to have a sky- high valuation, right?  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  It's a little geriatric in the -- in the cycle right there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a funny comment about Australia.  </p><p>When you look at tech, you mentioned tech stocks.  Microsoft briefly  overtaking Apple -- </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Amazing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as the world's most valuable company yesterday as Apple  faces pressure on the slumping iPhone demand.  </p><p>In terms of this volatility in technology, I know they're not trying to  time the market, how much are they invested within tech versus elsewhere  within equities?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So within the public equity exposure, the growth is in index  funds to avoid just this problem, but the largest concentration of specific  stocks is all the FAANGs.  </p><p>And then now you get the turbulent waters.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and -- or Alphabet.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Exactly.  And now NVIDIA seems to have come into the four.  </p><p>But who talked about Microsoft?  All of a sudden, Microsoft came back after  being so moribund.  </p><p>And then you have to look at the specifics, the problems Facebook is  having, members are concerned about that.  </p><p>And Apple, although Apple is rock solid in its balance sheet, you have the  tariff issue that could have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, though, that investors, if they  watched MORNINGS WITH MARIA and Maria Bartiromo every day, they would know  about the success of Microsoft and what was going on at that company for  years -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- literally.  Your interview with Satya Nadella, your coverage  of Microsoft before that, but also what was going on with Apple and your  interview with Dan Niles -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- well ahead of the selloff in Apple, so you name it, again,  because of the people that you interview on this program, we're giving a  very big window into what these companies are doing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And when Dan joined us, when I spoke with him from San  Francisco, you know, Apple was in this bull market, you know, moment and he  was skeptical.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it was -- he -- his skepticism was born out of the  inventory problem.  </p><p>He said inventories were up 89 percent year over year in the second  quarter, and looking at an economy that is poised to slow down, who is  going to buy a thousand dollar phone particularly in China?  </p><p>And he was right, and Apple has sold-off since he said it, and I -- and I  think Dan Niles is one of the smartest guys within technology, because he  does the backdrop analysis.  </p><p>He's looking for real, specific reasons of why these stocks are moving.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  We see it through a different lens.  Our members in Detroit  are seeing what's happening in the auto industry firsthand.  Our members in  Seattle see this tension between Apple and what's happening with Amazon in  Seattle and what's happening in Microsoft.</p><p>So, when you're on the ground and you're an active investor, you can get  the same kind of -- same kind of lead. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I just want to point out, like, the administration gave  a bit of a bailout, a handout to farmers hurt by the retaliatory tariffs  from china, which we saw in the GDP report yesterday.  </p><p>So, how long does it take for these automakers to come calling and say  \"Where is our handout?\"  Because the President is threatening -- well,  import tariffs on small cars, but threatening to take away at least the  subsidies on General Motors.  </p><p>Which, by the way, started going away shortly.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They got their handouts, didn't they?  The automakers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, ten years ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, that's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ford did -- Ford did -- </p><p>MURPHY:  -- $7,500 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They got a bailout.  They got a bailout.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- vehicle credit for electric cars.  They want to keep going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they want that $7,500-, that was what I said yesterday, the  7,500-dollar tax credit that you get for buying electric vehicles makes  certainly the Chevy Bolt more attractive.  </p><p>They want an extension, their tax - that tax break for G.M. expires shortly  because they've hit that 200,000 vehicle threshold, so we can talk about  the tariffs.  </p><p>But again, these things are hard to quantify.  Until they start showing up  in layoffs of almost 15,000 individuals -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's hard to know what the real impact is of how businesses  make decisions about future investment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But when you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what you're saying is it's a slippery slope.  Farmers want  help, maybe the autos will want it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe somebody else will want it, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Have you seen though the other -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody had -- how about pipeline builders?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're all -- anybody who uses steel and aluminum in this  country.  </p><p>And I pointed out yesterday when the President was tweeting about more  tariffs on small car imports, I just said, you know, anybody who says that  the President wants zero tariffs are non, my -- I'll follow him on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  You know, the only thing I want to say it's true, it's a  slippery slope.  </p><p>Our members are fervent capitalist, but we wouldn't have an Internet  without government investment.  </p><p>We wouldn't have a space program without government.  </p><p>So, there are critical industries that private industry doesn't support.  </p><p>We can debate it, but the facts are we got an Internet, we have a space  program, and we have some alternative energy project and they all got paid  back to the Energy Department.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's -- </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Notwithstanding Solyndra.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, treasury loss, $11.2 billion on the -- just the General  Motors bailout.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So that didn't get paid back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Not much happened on the Internet before they commercialized it.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Anyway.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael, it's great to get your insights this morning.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>Michael Sonnenfeldt joining us there, TIGER 21.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking overnight, officials have raided Deutsche Bank's  headquarters in connection with a money laundering probe.  </p><p>Details coming up right there.</p><p>And then the honor run, one Cardinals player is paying tribute to American  heroes like Pat Tillman and John McCain by putting them on his cleats.</p><p>Back in a minute with that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news this morning, new legal trouble  for Deutsche Bank.  </p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details now.  Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  </p><p>Several offices, including Deutsche Bank's Headquarters being searched by  authorities as part of a money laundering probe.  </p><p>Roughly a hundred and seventy.  That is a lot of prosecutors, police  officers, and tax inspectors are involved in the search of six offices in  and around Frankfurt.  </p><p>So, that suggest the significance of this.  </p><p>German prosecutors allege that two employees, who still work at the bank,  helped clients create offshore accounts and then transfer funds from those  illegal activities.  </p><p>All this investigation was sparked by \"The Panama Papers,\" that was a  massive, massive document leak of millions of pages.  </p><p>Back in 2016, it detailed how wealthy people use tax havens to shield their  money.</p><p>Authorities also claim that Deutsche Bank failed to report the suspicious  accounts, could be used to launder money.  </p><p>Deutsche Bank says it's fully cooperating with this investigation.  </p><p>The stock is down almost five percent ahead of this.  If you look at the  year-to-date chart, it is down almost 50 percent.  </p><p>So the stock is the Wells Fargo to Germany.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Wells Fargo to America, that's its significance in a sense  in Germany.  It was such an icon.  </p><p>And it's had so many troubles between everything that happened in the  financial crisis and the $18 billion in fines and legal fees that they  paid, and now these latest allegations.  </p><p>And on top of all of this, where's the profit?  They're' paying bonuses,  they've increased their bonuses, in fact, to many of their workers, it's a  -- it's a mess.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James, what do you think about this? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think investors, as you said, have had this question  about, what is their business model?  This has been kind of the most  troubled of the giant banks in a lot of ways lately.  </p><p>But, obviously, it deserves the presumption of innocence, but investors  hoping this is not the business model, but disturbing news certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look how the stock has fallen.  Is this a takeover candidate at  this point, Mike?  </p><p>MURPHY:  No.  This is something that they've -- for the last 10 years,  they've been defending themselves from one scandal after the next, and  what's breaking this morning.  </p><p>I don't know that anyone expected this, but they've never been able to  right the ship, so to speak, since the financial crisis, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MURPHY:  -- I don't know where it ends for Deutsche Bank, because there are  so many other great stories out there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess it's hard to believe that Germany would allow somebody  else, a foreigner to acquire Deutsche Bank.</p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, for sure.  I mean -- and I mean that and I don't know why a  foreigner would want to -- because by buying Deutsche Bank, you're buying  all the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The problems.  </p><p>MURPHY:  -- potential issues that are there as well.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Regulators are breathing down their back right now, especially  with these money laundering allegations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll watch that.  </p><p>Obviously, it's going to be a busy day.  </p><p>The stock is down about five percent right now.  And Deutsche Bank, we're  watching that.  </p><p>Let's take a short break.  </p><p>When we come back, Facebook and the data problem.  New court document show  that the social media giant considered selling user data.  </p><p>That's the fallout, and we will tell you about it.  </p><p>Then 'tis the season to be saucy, Taco Bell rolls out their brand new  Christmas apparel line based on their hot sauce packets, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Facebook under fire, internal emails show that the social media giant  considered doing something it said it never would.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's pretty fascinating,  Maria.  </p><p>These emails that were seized by British lawmakers suggest that Facebook  once considered selling users data even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised  not to do that.  </p><p>According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the emails also indicate Facebook  employees discussed pushing some advertisers to spend more in return for  increased access to users' information.  </p><p>At a congressional hearing back in April, Zuckerberg said that he opposed  selling that data.  Take a look at shares of Facebook, they're lower in the  premarket.  </p><p>Maria, of course, can have more on this and reining in big tech when she  interviews Tennessee's incoming Senator, Marsha Blackburn, that's going to  be in the 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time hour.  </p><p>Well, there is a change coming at the top of Unilever, the maker of Dove  soap and Hellmann's Mayonnaise.  </p><p>Alan Jope, who is currently the President of the company's beauty and  personal care division is going to take over for Paul Polman, who's going  to step down January 1st.  </p><p>Polman did lead Unilever for 10 years.  Unilever, of course, is working to  adjust the changes and consumer takes.</p><p>Shares of Unilever, little changed in the premarket.  </p><p>Well, Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi have reaffirmed their commitment to  their alliance.  </p><p>The companies issued a joint statement, saying they remain fully committed  to that three-way deal.  </p><p>The alliance sold more than ten million vehicles last year.  </p><p>But, of course, Nissan and Mitsubishi did out Carlos Ghosn as their  Chairman for alleged financial misconduct.  </p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\" says that Nissan's investigation also has revealed  $80 million in deferred pay forgone.  </p><p>Share of Nissan, Maria, down 14 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Lot to discuss in that story, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there's a lot to discuss because we continue to see  Carlos Ghosn sitting in a jail in Tokyo and - or in -- outside of Tokyo,  and we still don't have any official charges from the --from the Tokyo  government, from the Japanese government.  </p><p>I don't understand this.  I mean I questioned this on Twitter the other  day, James, because what kind of a judicial system throws you in detention  and then they decide what to charge you with.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.  And I think a lot of people looking at this are a little bit  shocked, because, again, this is not Communist China, this is Japan, this  is a modern industrialized democracy.  </p><p>And yet as you said, thrown in jail, not able to consult with a lawyer  before getting interrogated -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- not being able to have your lawyer present getting  interrogated.  </p><p>And this is a guy who achieved a lot of great results for that company.   And we're not getting -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was icon in Japan at one point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're now -- and, you know, he -- we'll see.  Maybe  they've really got the goods on them, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  We'll see.  But -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is this just a question of deferred compensation and whether  it was -- whether it was adequately disclosed or not -- I -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or is this political?  We know that within the Nissan ranks,  they were upset that they were about to be either acquired or merged with  in this alliance with a French company, Renault, that was much weaker than  Nissan.  </p><p>Now Nissan's the larger company, the more successful.  </p><p>So there was this movement going on, Mike, within Nissan to take him down.</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.  And you just hope that this isn't just some political  or go after one person, because it just -- it's like a scene from a movie  right now.  </p><p>But if he's guilty, he should be charged.  And if not, she should be let  go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget about Greg Kelly, the number two guy.  </p><p>His number two is also in jail.  He's an American citizen, these are the  only two people that are in jail for this deferred compensation problem.  </p><p>Where was the CFO as \"The Journal\" wrote about earlier this week, where was  the board?</p><p>So I just have a big problem with what they have done to Carlos Ghosn,  because I'm not -- I'm not buying it, I don't see the charges coming out of  the government there.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what about there -- what is the U.S. government doing about  the American Citizen that's being held under a standard that would -- is --  would not see light of day here in the United States in terms of being  essentially to what you said in terms of the judicial system in Japan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Put in jail and then the charges are being weighed as he  sits in a -- in a jail cell.  </p><p>We'll keep watching that.  </p><p>Coming up, the tariff effect, it is real.  </p><p>Volvo has canceled their multibillion dollar IPO and it is slowing hiring  at American plants, we will take a look at the fallout there.</p><p>And giving away, Patagonia is using money from President Trump's tax  savings plan, but it is not going to their employees, we will tell you  where it is going coming up, back in a moment right here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, November 29th,  your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures showing the markets will pull back, this morning, at the opening of  trading.  Dow Industrials down 72 points right now, S&amp;P 500 is down 9, and  the NASDAQ down 40 points, that's two-thirds of one percent, lower, that  after a powerful rally yesterday.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, gave the economy a thumbs up,  yesterday, in his 12:00 p.m. speech, it sent the market, shooting higher.   The Dow, in fact, erasing the November decline, finishing higher on the  session, by better than 600 points.  Now, the Dow is in positive territory  for 2018, with that huge rally of better than 2-1/2 percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we are not -- we are seeing some follow through  there, in European indices, up 43 points, the CAC Quarante up 30 points  right now, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 30 points, that's about a  quarter percent higher, right now.</p><p>Markets were mixed, overnight, in Asia, meanwhile, Japan did well up a  third of a percent, but the Hang Seng and the Shanghai, under pressure,  overnight.</p><p>Trade troubles hitting the automakers, Volvo is cancelling its IPO.  It is  announcing a cutback and hiring plans, as well, all over increased tariffs  from China.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting out that downsizing at General Motors  may justify new tariffs.  We'll tell you what the President has to say  about that, as we break it all down.</p><p>Then, this, giving it away, Patagonia, deciding not to give its millions of  dollars in tax cut savings, back to employees, why, we will tell you where  they decided to send that money.</p><p>Then, honoring a hero, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald,  pays tribute to the late senator John McCain, with a special pair of  cleats, the details, coming up.</p><p>And it is a Taco Bell Christmas.  The fast food chain celebrates its own  line of holiday clothing based on sauce packets, yes, we will tell you  about that, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  tensions are simmering, President Trump headed to Buenos Aires for the G20  summit, this morning, where he is expected to sit down with the President  of China, Xi Jinping, for a crucial dinner, discussing the potential of a  trade truce.</p><p>The administration floating the idea that a deal can be achieved, but also  additional tariffs should the two companies not strike an agreement,  joining me right now, is the Former Undersecretary of State for Economic  Growth, Energy and the Environment, Bob Hormats, Bob, it's good to see you  this morning.</p><p>BOB HORMATS, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE:  Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  What could come out of this  meeting, in Argentina?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, hopefully, some kind of deal that's sufficient to stop the  escalation in tariffs, which are harmful to China, but also harmful to the  U.S., a lot of American companies are uncomfortable with this trade war  with China, and the fact that it could get worse.</p><p>The probability, though, is that they are not going to have a breakthrough,  because to have a breakthrough, a lot of work needs to be done, there has  to be agreement on principles, neither of those have occurred at this  point, so the best they can do is develop a process for moving forward with  some broad outlines of objectives that both leaders support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of these -- one of the reasons for these tariffs against  China, the President says, is because of China's behavior, the fact that it  is stealing intellectual property.  It is forcing the transfer of  technology.</p><p>It is not opening its markets to foreign companies the way the rest of the  world would like.  And yet, there is another impact of these tariffs, look  at the toll on automakers, as you mentioned.  Volvo is slowing down hiring  in its new assembly plans in Charleston, South Carolina, we learned, this  morning.</p><p>It's citing the increased tariffs from the trade fight with China.  The  company also said it's calling off plans for an IPO, potentially where $30  billion as result of this dispute, follows General Motors plans to cut  14,000 jobs, shut down 5 U.S. factories next year.  The President is now  saying that G.M. closures may actually justify the auto tariffs.</p><p>So, how much longer can this go and how damaging will this be, do you  think, to companies that are getting, sort of, caught up in this fight?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, it's going to be even more damaging if the President  follows through and at the end of year, early next year, raises the tariffs  from 10 percent to 25 percent, and adds a whole new swaff of items to the  tariff list.</p><p>And the reason is, it does certainly hurt China, but it does hurt us  because of the interdependence and relationship.  We get a lot of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do, Bob?  I mean, you know the  issues about the -- about the intellectual property.</p><p>HORMATS:  Yes, I spent 10 days in China intellectual property, when I was  in government, intellectual property issues, questions of partnership,  subsidies, they all come up.  There have been negotiations on them.</p><p>I think what's needed is, for the two presidents to agree that if they are  going to move ahead in this relationship, they've got to take a much more  determined view to get changes that are acceptable and level the playing  field between foreign companies and Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  or could this --</p><p>HORMATS:  I think the Chinese understand something has to be done.  I just  think that the tariff escalation is probably so harmful to both sides that  it's unlikely to be the way of getting real progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you say, the Chinese understand something needs to be done.   What does that mean, though, I mean, we're talking about dictator for life,  in President Xi?</p><p>HORMATS:  I give you one example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HORMATS:  I gave keynote speech at the Shenzhen Technology (INAUDIBLE)  high-tech products from China and all around the world.</p><p>Even the foreign companies that represented there, said the Chinese are  developing intellectual property of their own, innovative stuff of -- on  many levels in China, so they -- their entrepreneurs now have an interest  in protecting their intellectual property, just as, of course, our  companies do.</p><p>So, I think there's a greater chance now of getting some agreement on  intellectual property protection that there might not have been five years  ago when the Chinese were not developing their own intellectual property.   That's an area where, I think, they're (INAUDIBLE) overlap some  convergence, also subsidies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very good point.</p><p>HORMATS:  The Chinese are trying to cut back on subsidies.  Their big  spending -- even though the reserves are substantial, their spending is  substantial, as well.  I think reducing subsidies in their interest and, of  course, in the interest of avoiding unfair competition, would be something  they might decide that they can do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, there's some room here.  There's room for upside potential  at this meeting, isn't there?</p><p>HORMATS:  There is.  And I think that it's not that if they're going to  have a breakthrough in either or these or other items.  But if they  establish a process, whereby the leaders ask for their experts to sit  together and work for, say, six months and report back to them, on two or  three or four items, it won't be a whole list of the kind United States has  proposed to try.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  But two or three items of particular significance that might be  the way out of it and avoid further escalation of tariffs, which as you  correctly point out, is going to be harmful, just because these economies  are so interdependent.</p><p>And one point for Americans to bear in mind, most of the tariffs we've  imposed so far, are intermediate goods, products that are components for  American companies, which squeezes American companies to the next realm, if  their new items added.  They'll be on consumer goods, like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the iPhone.</p><p>HORMATS:  Exactly.  And those -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why, Apple has been trading down.</p><p>HORMATS:  Exactly, they're 10 percent or 25 percent that virtually goes  right to the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's a potential, I think, I hear you saying, of a big  rally, if we get any upside potential out of this, maybe markets get a  relief rally -- </p><p>HORMATS:  I think they will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  if we see something -- </p><p>HORMATS:  For two reasons, one, they'll make progress or hopefully make  progress on certain subsidy issues or other issues.  And second, if it  works or if it's the right kind of deal, can avoid further escalation, so  both would be market movers on the positive side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to note that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,  Mohammed bin Salman, MBS, also arriving in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit,  amid the outrage, over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  I want to get your  take on how he is going to be treated.  I recently spoke with Prince Al- Waleed bin Talal, about this incident, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A month ago, a brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, where his body  was dismembered, is Mohammed bin Salman for real, or is he lying to us  about this modernization plan?</p><p>PRINCE AL-WALEED BIN TALAL, MEMBER OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY:  As for the  Jamal Khashoggi incident, you know, you have to understand, Jamal was not  only my friend.  He was working with me.  And his last job in Saudi Arabia,  it was me and then Arab Channel.</p><p>And I like to give through you my condolences, again, to his family, to his  wife, ex-wife, and to his children, and to his family, because Jamal was a  reformer, he was in no position at all and what took place in that Saudi  consulate was clearly horrific, despicable and tragic and I believe that  Saudi Arabia is going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>But please, you have to give us some time until the investigation is done  and made public by the government of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, Bob, it's hard to know if Prince Al-Waleed was  talking the party lines for Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince,  trying to give back in his good graces.  We know that Al-Waleed was jailed  by MBS, and then he came out, or if, in fact, he is being honest in terms  of saying, well, let's see what the investigation shows.</p><p>Your reaction to the Crown Prince's attendance and what the U.S. should do  now in terms of its relationship with the Saudis?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, I think the problem the U.S. and other countries have is,  first of all, they're appalled at what happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we all are.</p><p>HORMATS:  There's no question about that, and for good reason.  The second  question, though, is they, a lot of these countries need Saudi oil, we  don't really depend so much on Saudi oil, a lot of the other countries in  the G20, do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  Third, they have opportunities to sell more things to Saudi  Arabia, so their abhorrence at this event, is tempered by the fact that  they have real economic interest, and the fact is that some of them also,  want to work with the Saudis for strategic reasons in the gulf.  So, they  have to work this balance -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, but we know that Iran --</p><p>HORMATS:  that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Iran is the problem.  The Saudis have been a partner of the  United States not just for oil but against Iran, so can the U.S. walk away?</p><p>HORMATS:  U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS:  U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was what I was getting at.  But you mentioned oil.  Take a  look at crowd oil now, below $50.00 yesterday, sitting right at $50.00,  we're back below $50.00 this morning, first time in over a year, Bob, that  we're seeing below $5.000, ahead of this OPEC meeting, which is happening  next week.</p><p>Is this telling us something about the global economy, that things have  weakened, is that why oil is selling off or is this more about oversupply?   What do you think?</p><p>HORMATS:  It's both.  It's a weakening of the global economy, not a  dramatic one, but a moderate one.  And it's also a supply factor, and that  goes to another Saudi point.  Again, as much as we're appalled by what  happened, the Saudis are the key members of OPEC.</p><p>So, if there's going to be a tightening of production, it's going to have  to be led by Saudi Arabia.  They have the most excess capacity and  therefore, they would have to reduce output to help push prices up, if  that's the objective of oil producers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you expect that to happen?</p><p>HORMATS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think oil -- I mean, what's your take on oil?  If  it goes much lower than this, you're going to have a problem with the Shell  producers, as well, aren't you?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, see, this is the other part where the Saudis have had two  objectives here.  They don't want the price of oil to fall too much because  they depend on it.  On the other hand, a couple of years ago, the Saudis  had a view, if they keep the prices down, because some of these Shell  producers, in the U.S., and also (INAUDIBLE) have a lot of leverage. </p><p>They will push some of them out of the market or force them to cut back on  productions.  So, again, Saudi strategy plays a key role in that, as well,  even though we're not so dependent on their oil.  It's a global price and  they have the biggest impact of anyone on that global price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, do you think with the slowdown on the horizon,  economic slowdown, the Fed, obviously, yesterday, talked about how great  things are going, but markets have been worried.</p><p>HORMATS:  I think the slowdown is modest, I don't think it's a plunge.  I  do think escalation of a trade war does slow the world economy down, not  just for the United States and China, but a lot of other countries depend,  for instance, in East Asia -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  on sales to China, if their economy slows, and it's slowing for  other reasons, a bit, not a lot.  But trade war would make it a lot slower.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has a big impact.</p><p>HORMATS:  And Asia gets impacted and that affects their finances because  they have a lot of debt, so they have to earn money to pay off their debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm feeling coupled, coupling, remember that?</p><p>HORMATS:  There is coupling.  It's an interdependent world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS:  Once you do one thing, it affects a lot of other things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  And sometimes, people don't think through the secondary effects.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is great to see you this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>HORMATS:  Pleasure to be with you, Maria, as always.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always a pleasure to get your insights, Bob Hormats.  Tune in  tomorrow on FOX Business, Liz Claman will be in Argentina.  She's anchoring  Countdown to the Closing Bell, live, from the G20 summit, in Argentina.   She will be in Buenos Aires, beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, tomorrow, so  join Liz for her special coverage.</p><p>But first, President Trump just tweeted this, he wants to talk about G.M.   He says, General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other  companies are doing.  Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over  the country.  Auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including BMW,  which just announced a major new plant.  The USA is booming, writes the  President, this morning.</p><p>We will take a short break.  When we come back, running with the heroes,  the Cardinals, Larry Fitzgerald's touching tribute to Pat Tillman and John  McCain, showing up on his cleats, we'll tell you more about that, coming  up.</p><p>And then, a spicy Christmas, that's for sure, Taco Bell rolls out a holiday  apparel line, featuring sweaters, blankets, even onesies, back in a minute</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As you saw, markets are pulling back this  morning after that 600-plus-point rally yesterday.  We are expecting a  lower opening this morning for the broader averages.  Stormy Daniels  calling out her attorney, Michael Avenatti.  Cheryl Casone with this story  and headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  In an interview with The Daily Beast,  Daniels claims that Avenatti filed a defamation lawsuit against President  Trump without her permission.  Last month, the federal judge threw out that  lawsuit and ordered Daniels to pay Trump's legal fees, which are estimated  to be $350,000.  Daniels also said she had no idea Avenatti started a  second crowd-funding site for her legal expenses.  Avenatti says, he's  always been with Daniels and says he started the fund-raising to cover his  legal fees.  Because most of the money so far has gone to her security.  </p><p>Well, outdoor gear company, Patagonia, donating the $1o million it saved  from President Trump's tax cuts to non-profit environmental groups.   Patagonia says, the donation is an addition to one percent of sales it  gives to environmental groups every year.  The new GOP tax law cut  corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, you may remember.   Patagonia CEO called Trump's tax cuts \"irresponsible\" for taking away from  environmental services.  </p><p>Well, Taco Bell waste no time getting into the Christmas spirit.  The  company rolling out festive sweaters, they've also got blankets.  Take a  look at all of these onesies that look like Taco Bell hot sauce packets,  because who doesn't need that?  But the clothing and other gifts don't come  as cheap as Taco Bell food.  Sweaters are $59.00 each.  The onesie, Maria,  $78.00.  Shares of Taco Bell's parent, Yum! Brands, up nine percent so far  this year.  I dare somebody on the panel to wear that one day on  television.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, somebody with six kids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MURPHY:  I'm in.  Set me up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need the onesie --</p><p>MURPHY:  I'm on for the onesie.  I don't know if $78.00 is actually  expensive for a onesie or if that's -- I don't know about the onesie mark.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not cheap.  You need the onesie to hide -- that you're fat  from eating at Taco Bell all the time.  And I say that from personal  experience, Nachos BellGrande every day and I was at least 40 pounds  heavier than I am right now.  So, there you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nacho Grande every day?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nacho -- yes, Nachos BellGrande and a beer, that was college.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE).  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come  back, a hero's honor; the Cardinal's Larry Fitzgerald pays tribute to Pat  Tillman and John McCain with some eye-catching cleats next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Here's a change, NFL ratings are up; Jared Max,  why are ratings turning around here?  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Maybe, Maria, good  morning, it's record scoring, more legalized gambling.  You know, some  betters will say, I'm only interested to watch if I have action on the  game.  Oh, and have you noticed, we have not been talking about players  kneeling for the national anthem, maybe some who were turned away are  coming back.  </p><p>Let's take a look at the numbers -- keep in mind, this is strictly Nielsen  T.V. rating not streaming.  Average audience for games this season at 15.8  million, five percent higher than last year's average, but still noticeably  behind 2016 and 2015.  Expect good numbers tonight on Fox, 8:20 Eastern.   First place teams: Cowboys 6-5, tied with Washington to top the NFC East,  host the 10-1 Saints, New Orleans, has won 10 in a row. And what we'll  notice tonight, the Cowboys wearing the alternate white color rush  uniforms; Saints will be in all black.  Teams don't have to wear the color  rush on Thursdays as they did in the past but the Cowboys elected to do so.  </p><p>And hey, fashion goes hand-in-hand this week, week 13 of NFL, is my cause  for my cleats' week -- an initiative began by Larry Fitzgerald around 500  players set to show case their cleats for charitable foundations.  Now, the  cleats that the players are going to be wearing, Arizona Cardinals' Larry  Fitzgerald wears these to honors the late Pat Tillman, who joined the army  after 9/11, died in friendly fire in 2004.  Camouflage design, we see  Tillman's face, his foundation provides scholarships to veterans and their  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY FITZGERALD, FOOTBALL PLAYER, ARIZONA CARDINALS:  Every game day in  Arizona, we remember Pat Tillman's sacrifice, his legacy lives on through  the Pat Tillman foundation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Larry Fitzgerald's cleats also honor his old friend, the late Senator  John McCain, you recall Fitzgerald spoke at McCain's memorial service.   Megan McCain writing on Twitter: \"This is so special -- thank you, Larry  Fitzgerald, my father would have loved this.  Thank you for your continued  love and friendship for my father and for the amazing hero, Pat Tillman.   Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very nice.  Thank you, Jared.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And we should really focus, if the NFL wants their ratings going  up, they should focus on guys like Larry Fitzgerald and things like this  that they're doing because it's an awesome story.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and look at the reaction that you get when you actually  see the guys playing football.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not focused on politics.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's the great American game and you're right, once the off-the- field stuff is not the focus, people want to watch.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MURPHY:  52-51 scores help also.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared's sports reports on Fox News 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.   Still ahead, the A.I. mini car; Amazon's new venture into self-driving  cars, wait until you see this.  It's powered by artificial intelligence,  right here, next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Good Thursday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets pulling back this morning after a powerful rally yesterday.  We're  right down 70 points on the Dow Industrials right now, near the lows once  again this morning.  Nasdaq down 46 points.  That's two-thirds of 1  percent, after a major rally in stocks yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500  are now in positive territory for the month.</p><p>Stocks rallying 617 points on the Dow, 2.5 percent higher at the close  yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up two and a third percent.  The Nasdaq -- check  that out -- 208 points higher, that's almost 3 percent higher.</p><p>Why the rally?  These comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  We know that moving too fast would  risk shortening the expansion.  We also know that moving too slowly,  keeping interest rates too low for too long, could risk other distortions  in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Follow-through in Europe this morning.  the FT 100 is up a half  a percent, 33 points higher.  The CAC 40 in Paris is up a half of a  percent, 25 points higher.  And the DAX index up 12 points, fractional gain  there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances -- take a look.  Best performer was  in Japan.  Nikkei average up a third of a percent.</p><p>We are watching the price of oil today -- take a look.  Crude oil fighting  to hold a $50 a barrel level.  It briefly fell below that for the first  time in over a year just a few minutes ago.  Oil now at $50.02 a barrel,  down one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>Reining in big technology -- Facebook under fire after a new report says it  was considering charging companies for user data.</p><p>Plus Google faces backlash for its project in China from its own employees.  </p><p>All those stories coming up.</p><p>Facebook shares down another 1 percent his morning.

And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO  and managing partner Mike Murphy.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning.   Happy to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James -- I want to ask you about your op-ed that you wrote  yesterday.  The title was \"Tax cut working better than advertised\".</p><p>What I liked about this piece you wrote is you go into business spending.   And why we haven't seen -- and we were talking about this yesterday, Dagen  and me -- and why we haven't seen a bigger move in companies putting money  to work.  And I argued they are but it's in technology.  We've moved from  an industrial society to a technological society.  So maybe the numbers  don't tell the whole story.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well they do -- and they do tell part of the story.  Obviously  we've seen that increase in business investment this year.  We've seen  productivity going up which is good, allows for higher wages.</p><p>But, yes, that third quarter report on GDP it showed kind of softer than  expected business investment.  We kind of wondered why.  Larry Lindsey, a  former Bush advisor, says the time will -- hold on, I think maybe the  investment numbers are going to get revised upwards.  And that's just  exactly what happened yesterday.</p><p>So better investment, more business spending on equipment, a lot of it  technology to make employees more productive as we saw in yesterday's  report.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It went from four-tenths of a  percent increase to north of 3 percent, right, yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So again, it's not the blowout of the first and second  quarters but overall this year very strong and right on track with what the  corporate tax rate cut enacted in December 2017 was intended to do --  increase investment in the United States.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And for those people who are saying it hasn't done enough, isn't  it hard to go back and say where we would be without the tax cut or what  the economy would look like without the tax cut?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  We saw it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We might look like Germany.  Germany's economy is contracting,  and so is Japan's.  So we might not be in a recession.  But if we hadn't  had that tax cut, we would be -- well, we saw it during the Obama  administration, is that what you were going to say that we never got 3  percent growth in any one calendar year.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, as soon as the tax cut plan hit earlier this  year when it first went into effect, we did see business spending shoot up.   I mean, people -- businesses were reacting to that and then it slowed down,  maybe the worry over tariffs.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that is a concern, certainly.  I think that's why we're  looking -- if they get something resolved this weekend, I think you would  expect some kind of market pop in response.</p><p>But the point is still very strong investment.  Even if it's not quite at  the pace of that initial burst right after the passage of the law,  basically right on target and still in that 3 percent overall economic  growth mode which was the point of the tax reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check out James' op-ed in the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning, joining this conversation, my exclusive interview  with the chairman of UBS.  Axel Weber is here.  We will also speak with  Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis.  We're talking about this market  activity this year with John and Axel has a lot to stay in terms of the  global story.  Rock Group co-founder and Patron Spirits co-found John Paul  Dejoria is here as well.  Plus Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy.  Also  Senate-Elect Marsha Blackburn joining us as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off here with this top story -- turmoil for big tech.  The  \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting Facebook considered charging companies  access for users' data.  This is from internal e-mails viewed by the  \"Journal\".</p><p>Facebook not the only technology company facing trouble and potential  regulation.  Google is facing employee backlash over its project Dragonfly  which would be a censored search engine for China.  Really interesting to  note that Google walked away from doing business with the Pentagon and  instead chose to do business with China where they have to censor their  search engine.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Tennessee Congresswoman and  Senator-Elect Marsha Blackburn.  Senator-Elect -- congratulations to you.   Good to see you.</p><p>SENATOR-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Thank you, Maria.  Nice to  see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  You've been  working a lot on this potential, I don't know if you want to call it  regulatory response or what is the response to this in terms of technology?   What do you want to see happen within big tech?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  What I would like to see happen is passage of the Browser Act  which is privacy regulations.  It puts one -- one template in place for the  entire ecosystem, whether it is your Internet service provider, which is  your ISP or it is one of the edge providers which is Facebook, Google,  Twitter, those companies, big tech.</p><p>And Maria -- they have resisted this.  What they wanted was to put all of  the privacy regulation on the ISPs.  That would have been the 2015 rules  that the Obama administration had wanted to put in place.  But it needs to  be one set of rules for the ecosystem.</p><p>And then you get into issues past that and the privacy regulations, you get  into the other issues which have to do with the operating systems, which is  the Google operating system which you can turn the thing off, pull the sim  card, these devices still are tracking you.  And yes, that is an invasion  of your privacy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that the big issue?  Characterize what the problem is  around big tech.  They're tracking us all the time and we don't know it.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's also an issue that you and your colleagues have  pointed out about censoring conservative conversation.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That is right.  And those are two separate issues.</p><p>Now when it comes to privacy, here is what we need to do.  We need to make  certain that the consumer, the individual that is looking at that computer  screen and conducting much of their transactional life online, that they  have the ability to say to these different systems, whether it is Google or  Facebook or whomever on the edge, no, you do not have access to my  sensitive data and I have the right to block you from using that.</p><p>And when it comes to non-sensitive data, like your search history that you  can say I am opting out and reserving to myself the individual the right to  protect my virtual self online; and you, big tech, cannot use my search  data and then turn around and sell that to an advertiser or somebody.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Senator-Elect -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street  Journal\".</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I hate to raise a discouraging word, because I don't know many  people who are more excited about your election than I am.  I'm not going  to knock your predecessor at this moment, but in this particular issue, do  you worry about creating a new Internet regulator in Washington?  Do you  worry about big companies like Facebook benefiting from heavy regulation  more than their potential competitors will, who may have a tougher time  complying with this kind of regulation?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Not at all -- James.  That is why I think it's important  that we do light touch privacy standards and put that in place.</p><p>And we have a privacy regulator in the marketplace now.  It's called the  Federal Trade Commission, the FTC.  And having that light touch regulation  in place where they are able to say, ok, the individual reserves their  privacy.  It is the same thing that has happened in the physical space, if  you will.</p><p>And for decades, different retailers and merchants and individuals you  conduct transactions with have had affinity programs, loyalty programs.   And what you want to do is replicate that in the virtual space and allow  the individual to decide what information they want to share and what they  want to hold private.</p><p>As it is right now, big tech can just run roughshod if you will over your  transactional life online and they are scooping this information.  When you  look at things like the Science Project and you see that these Google  operating systems will track every single base station that you pass, even  with the phone deactivated, if you will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So you don't know who to trust.  You've got the  technology companies tracking us.  You've got China tracking us.  </p><p>I've got to get your take on this breaking news this morning.  And this  comes from Reuters, Senator-Elect Blackburn.  The Trump administration  reportedly considering checking Chinese students' phone records and social  media accounts for anything that may raise concerns about why they are in  the United States.  Your reaction to this report?</p><p>And it only comes a couple days after we know that there was another report  that showed us that China is judging everybody -- the 1.4 billion people  there -- and coming up with a national score, an individual score, rather,  for each person.  And that's going to dictate whether you can get a  mortgage, whether you can get on a train or a plane.</p><p>So should the U.S. be spying on Chinese citizens to make sure they're here  for the right reasons?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, let me say this about China.  We have been concerned  about the way they interact with U.S. companies for many, many, many years.   And when it comes to dealing with them, I've not seen the report that  you're referencing but I will say this.  I think that Secretary Pompeo is  doing a really quite remarkable job handling and working on the world stage  and making certain that we make wise decisions in our interactions with  other countries.  And so I look forward to seeing what he has to say about  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're going to keep the pressure on big tech.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else are your priorities once you begin your term in the  Senate?</p><p>I mean the President tweeted on the Mueller probe this morning, I'd like to  know what you think about that.  Here's what the President said just a  little while ago.  \"Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a  crime?  At the same time Mueller and the angry Democrats aren't even  looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed  by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.  A total disgrace.\"</p><p>This of course, as Senate Republicans blocked legislation yesterday that  would protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.  Was that the  right move?  Tell us where you are on the Mueller investigation and what  you're going to do once you get there in the Senate.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  I'll tell you, Maria -- when I was campaigning across the state  in Tennessee, and something would be said about the Mueller investigation,  Tennesseans would say this thing needs to get wrapped up.  This thing needs  to get finished.  And Tennesseans are really not, you know, they're not  that concerned about the story of the day, if you will.</p><p>What they are concerned about is the story of their lives and they are  absolutely so pleased with what they see as consistent growth.  And I was  listening to the conversation -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- relative to that.  They like the fact that the economy is  growing.  Things are better for their family.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They are looking forward to having a good Christmas and just  really rocking it in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, like I said yesterday, it's time.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  It's time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's see what you've got, Robert Mueller.  It's been two years.   We'll see if you and your colleagues will see that report early in the new  year.</p><p>Good to see you.  Marsha Blackburn -- thanks very much for your insights  this morning.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. </p><p>Coming up, Ford is shifting gears -- the automaker reworking its plants to  ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production.  It will not cutting jobs while  doing so.</p><p>Then a change for Dick's Sporting Goods, the controversial decision by the  athletic retailer to potentially get rid of virtually all of its hunting  gear.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Futures are lower this morning, well off of the lows of the morning though.   Dow Industrials now looking down about 30 points, S&amp;P down 6, down 30  points on the Nasdaq as well.</p><p>Do you think it's good news, Mike Murphy, if we see follow-through to a  600-point rally yesterday or is it bad news?  Sometimes people want to make  sure that you see that the selling is done before coming in.  You want to  see -- </p><p>MURPHY: We had a 10 percent correction.  We had a lot of selling come into  the market.  We had a very positive announcement from the Fed yesterday.   We had a big rally.  I want more of the rally.  And if we get anything out  of the G-20 this weekend, yesterday's rally will be tame in what happens  Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So does that tell you anything about what happens the rest of  the year if in fact we see buying follow-through this morning?  Even though  markets are lower right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  It does.  I mean the way I look at it is that we sold off for one  of the main reasons was the trade war, the tariffs and the effect that  could have.  And if you take that off the table, we go back to where we  were in the markets.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The steel and aluminum tariffs are not going away.  And when  President Trump is tweeting about import tariffs on small cars to match  what we already do on light trucks, I don't think that this tariff issue is  going away any time soon.  </p><p>MURPHY:  But that's part of the China issue, right.  If that gets resolved.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They say, but it's not.  It's to save the steel industry in the  United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets are lower this morning, down as you can see.  We'll  keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this.  Ford Motor moving around some of its U.S. workers  to meet the growing demand for pickups and SUVs.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone on that now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>The change is going to affect more than 1,100 workers but no jobs are going  to be cut in this one.  Ford added it's confident it's going to be able to  find new jobs for 150 other workers at a Michigan plant.</p><p>Now this is just days after General Motors said its' cutting nearly 15,000  jobs and closing five factories in North America. </p><p>Ford shares are down 25 percent this year while GM shares are down 10  percent.  So some pressure on these stocks for the year.</p><p>I want to stay on cars.  Amazon is getting into the toy car business.  This  is Amazon's new self-driving toy car.  It's called the AWS DeepRacer.  You  can program the car to drive itself.  It uses A.I. to learn to drive better  through trial and error.</p><p>It's also launching a racing league of these cars to put customers'  programming skills to the test.  That's $400, by the way, when it comes out  next year if you're willing to spend that on a toy car.  It's available to  preorder now for a special price of $249 -- Maria.  Sending it back to the  group that has kids because I don't know.  It's expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>MURPHY:  Do you ride in the car or is it you just control the car?  </p><p>CASONE:  You just control it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Does the car record everything going on in the household and then  send that back -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- to Amazon while it's moving around the living room?  Or does  it just drive I think would be one natural question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It comes like -- I'm betting that they're recording us at all  times.</p><p>Meanwhile President Trump just tweeted on the Mueller probe again.  Here's  what he said.  \"When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style witch hunt,  one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end or will it just go  on forever.  After wasting more than $40 million (is that possible), it has  proven only one thing -- there was no collusion with Russia.  So  ridiculous.\"  The President writes this morning.</p><p>We're looking at real estate realities next, the outlook on housing.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New concerns about the health of the housing market.  October new home  sales sliding to the lowest level in more than two and-a-half years.  It is  the latest sign that rising interest rates are hitting the market.</p><p>Joining us now is Rogers Healy and Associates real estate owner and CEO,  Rogers Healy.  Good to see you Rogers.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>Are we seeing a slowdown -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGERS HEALY, CEO, ROGERS HEALY AND ASSOCIATES:  Good morning.  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in housing and tell us how severe it is.  </p><p>HEALY:  It's not severe.  I mean first of all, what we do is seasonal,  right.  Especially in residential, it is seasonal.  And so this time of  year we do see a slowdown.  But obviously the last two years, really the  last four or five years it's been really, really, really, really, really,  really busy and really, really good.  </p><p>But it has slowed down a little bit.  And for interest rates to get closer  to 5 percent, it's more expensive for the house the person thought they  could afford.  Now they really can't.  So, you know, that has definitely  slowed us down but the market is still fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rogers -- sorry, Mike.  Rogers -- you're in Texas.</p><p>HEALY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you worried about the impact on the major drop in oil prices  on the Texas economy and on your business?  </p><p>HEALY:  You said do I worry about it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because you would hear -- everybody's in the oil business  or at least they know somebody in the oil business, oil and gas business,  so you would hear from them that they're concerned, that they're getting  ready to cut, you know, cut jobs.  They're not going to pass on a pay  increase.  I just wonder what you're hearing on the ground about the impact  there on real estate.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I guess I should start with yes, ma'am, I will tell you.</p><p>Yes.  You know, we saw this happen about seven or eight years ago.  And  people just kind of sit on the sideline.  But I'm in Dallas.  So in Dallas  we don't really see the effect of the oil and gas market like if Houston  would.  But it's still people just cautious, right, and prior they were  cautiously optimistic.  Now they're just a little bit hesitant.</p><p>But just like the real estate market, the oil and gas market is cyclical  and goes in waves.  But we're really not concerned.  I think I saw this  morning that oil is about to be under $50 a barrel for the first time in a  little bit.  But it's going to come back, just like everything always does.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Rogers -- you hear so much about millennials and their desire to  rent versus owning a home.  I see that changing at some point.  Are there  any signs of that yet?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I saw a meme the other day that said millennials are walking  around here like they rent the place.  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, so we work a lot with millennials.  And you know, obviously  the American dream has been, will always be owning your own piece of real  estate.  But, you know, the shift is going to happen I think with rental  rates -- I think rental rates are going to eventually start to decrease.   And we've seen this with rental rates as real estate rates have increased  as far as owning a home, rental rates have increased too.</p><p>So I think it's going to become a beggar's can't be choosers situation.   And eventually millennials and especially the millennials that are in real  estate -- they're going to go toward leaning towards purchasing a home.</p><p>But right now they're obviously still renting.  But, you know, when they  want to start a family, when they want to go and actually have savings,  they're going to probably go do something more strategic.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Rogers -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\", news  side of our paper had a story about people doing cash-out refinancings even  as rates go up.  So they're taking the equity out of the home, they're  accepting a mortgage with a higher interest rate.</p><p>This doesn't sound like a recipe for healthy financial system when the  downturn comes.  I guess in some ways maybe there is already a downturn in  real estate.  But are you seeing a lot of these cash-out refinancings where  the borrower ends up much more with a higher rate and less equity in the  home?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, it sounds like they need a better financial advisor, not a  better realtor.  And you know, these people that got in over their heads  back in 2005, 2006, 2007 -- you know, that was the big foreclosure boom  that I experienced with my first group of clients.</p><p>But these guys that are doing cash-out refinances, they didn't manage their  money, you know, strategically probably all across the board.  I mean if  they've got enough equity in their home and you know, you've seen a year  over year 4 percent to 8 percent compounded adjustment, yes -- hello?   Sorry.</p><p>If you see a year over year, you're going to try to find some money  somewhere.  That's going to always happen.  But we're not going to have the  foreclosures that we had back in the days of the big short.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers -- good to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>HEALY:  You too.  Thank you.  Have a good day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers Healy here.</p><p>Coming up, stock market surge - we break down Wall Street's reaction to Fed  chairman Powell's remarks yesterday that he erased November's losses.  It  was a 650-point move on the Dow.</p><p>We're talking with the chairman of UBS, Axel Weber in studio next,  exclusive.</p><p>Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November  29th.  Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages.  We are well  off of the lows of the morning actually.  Markets have been under pressure  this morning after a powerful rally yesterday that took the market soaring.   Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a positive read of on the economy  yesterday sending markets higher across the board.  Powell gave some  insight on what the Federal Reserve's plans are moving forward.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is no preset policy path.   We'll be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and  financial data are telling us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that, the markets soared.  The Dow re-raising its  November decline on Powell's speech, finishing higher by more than 600  points, the Dow Industrials on track for the best week since the 2016  election.  </p><p>This morning, European markets are higher as well.  Take a look at the FT- 100 up three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two  thirds of a percent and the DAX Index in Germany up a quarter of a percent.  </p><p>Markets were mixed overnight in Asia.  As you can see here, fractional  moves although the Shanghai Composite in China down 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Investing in vaping, tobacco giant Altria is looking to take a stake in the  embattled e-cigarette company Juul.  Details on that deal potentially  coming up.  </p><p>Then the future of the future, the phone of the future, rather, we are  taking a look at the new 3D phone that doesn't need any special glasses.   We'll show it to you.</p><p>Plus, hunting season could be over, why Dick's Sporting season is thinking  about pulling hunting gear from its stores all together.</p><p>But first this, our top story this half an hour, Federal Reserve Chairman  Jay Powell, he said the economy is doing well yesterday.  He addressed the  New York Economic Club yesterday.  Powell said that the Fed is close to  fulfilling its goals of promoting maximum employment and price stability.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent.  A 49-year low and many  other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests.   Inflation is near our two percent target and the economy is growing at an  annual rate of about three percent, well above most estimates of its longer  run trend.  </p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I as well as many private sector economists are  forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment and inflation  remaining near two percent.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those comments particularly about being close to neutral on  rates, two percent, getting the attention of investors.  The Dow  Industrials shot up as you can see, closing up better than 600 points on  the session.  That was 2-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive, UBS chairman, Axel Weber.   Great to see you Mr. Chairman.  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Jay Powell yesterday?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think as a former central banker I would say there was nothing  extraordinary he said.  He was just acknowledging that by now after several  rate hikes over two or three years, the Fed is close to neutral.  And I  think the real issue for markets is they have been quite jibbery this year  because three major expectation of what really supported equity markets in  the past are starting to be questioned.  </p><p>The first is will earning growth continue to be as strong as it has?  And  there's some doubt about that.  The second one is really monetary policy  that was a major supporter of equity, markets is starting to be at neutral,  so it's less supportive, it may actually become restrictive.  And the final  point is the economy data, the economic data we're seeing are more mixed.  </p><p>So, there is a mix of head winds that the markets are experiencing that we  haven't seen in that combination for the last couple of years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, there are other things that the Fed is dealing  with.  I mean, you were the chairman of the Bundesbank -- the president of  the Bundesbank.  And you didn't have the kind of issue of winding down a $3  trillion balance sheet, right?  That's one of the issues that the Federal  Reserve faces right now, not just raising rates but winding down the  balance sheet.  Are they going to be able to do that without tightening too  much too fast?  </p><p>WEBER:  But that's exactly what Jay was pointing at.  There are two issues  that they face.  First one is they need to contain inflation because with  the economy doing well, there is a risk that inflation will go up.  It's  been pretty contained.  The Fed was able in this cycle to raise rates,  roughly at half the speed of what they did in the past, and they've  traveled about half the distance.  </p><p>And the real question is, I don't think that normalization of monetary  policy will be completed in the current cycle.  It will take another  economic cycle to really go to neutral.  Because after a very long period  of very low interest rates, raising interest rates has happened very  cautious, but the balance sheets are still very, very expanded.  So they'll  continue to reduce the balance sheet.  </p><p>But my expectation is they won't even go back to where the Fed's balance  sheet was before the crisis.  Central banks have now become a much larger  central counterparty in markets.  And for that, I think structurally  central bank balance sheets will be larger.  </p><p>And I think there's good reasons to be cautious about normalizing monetary  policy because we're coming out of a 10 year low interest rate environment  and therefore you have to be cautious and you should not overshoot.  You  need to look at the economy where central bank support has been taken for  granted for a decade, and weaning that off has to happen with some eyes on  a really cautious normalization.  In can't stay where they are for a long  time because financial markets stability could be threatened.  And that  balance was pointed out by Jay Powell yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But of course, as rates move higher and as we see commodities  prices facing the impact of perhaps tariffs, you're seeing this worry about  margins.  So market has been very volatile.  Are you seeing margin pressure  at UBS?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we're expecting going forward is there will be  continued to be challenges in the markets and margin pressure will arise  here and there.  But the real challenge that I think the markets will have  is liquidity.  </p><p>As the ECB gets off their purchase program for the first time in the last  10 years, central bank balance sheets globally, the sum of what central  banks are doing will no longer support the economy.  It will no longer  expand balance sheet.  Central bank balance sheets globally will start to  shrink and that is a new phenomenon.  Because so far, the ECB's expansion  and the bank of Japan's expansion has more than made up the shrinking of  the balance sheet by the Fed.  That will change at the end of the year.</p><p>So, there's clearly going to be some headwinds for the next year economy.   There's clearly going to be some headwinds from -- you know, the effects of  the -- of the tax reductions and physical reforms in the U.S. are starting  to ban.  Market growth is going to be more normalized.  But there's no  reason to worry, I don't see an imminent recession on the horizon, maybe a  soft spot in the economy for the next first half of the year.  </p><p>Because one thing that has taken toll now is these trade disputes which  didn't really impact the economy but now with China, U.S. heading ahead in  a sort of more conflicted way, many global firms are re-wiring their global  production chains.  So multinationals are really changing the way where  they produce and how they produce and that has taken a toll for a short- term on the economy.  </p><p>So, I expect the first quarter, the second quarter next year to be quite  weak and that is a soft spot.  It's not a recession.  Most data that we're  seeing are not in the typical pattern of what usually you see before a  recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are expecting a weak first and second quarter in 2019  then?  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and we saw some of that in what you said when you reported  earnings last month, they were 26 percent above the expectations.  But you  set new targets in terms of what you want to achieve.  </p><p>One of those targets is you want to bring more money into your wealth  management business.  Tell us about it.  </p><p>WEBER:  It's true.  So, what we did is basically reaffirmed our strategy.   You know, about seven years ago when we looked at the strategy we changed  the way we ran the bank.  Now, a couple of years later, we've given  different market developments.  We wanted to look at whether that's still  in place and we felt that is the case.  </p><p>But we have some targeted growth initiative.  One is really our ultra  business and we're the only truly global wealth manager with a large amount  of clients in the ultra space that is the richest individual and the  richest people in our economies.  And we want to grow that business by $70  billion over the next three years, largely focused on growing our U.S.  business.  </p><p>And that is something where we feel -- you know, unlike a couple of years  ago we're expanding our global business and in particular with the U.S.  being a strong market, we're expanding our U.S. business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do that, Axel?  How do you that grow a business when  you're seeing such uncertainty and worry in a market where the market will  be down 600 points one day and up 600 the next day?  How do you invest that  money and make the case for these very wealthy individuals that you want  UBS to be handling that allocation?  </p><p>WEBER:  Well, I think what you're seeing in the next few years is  diversification will become much more important than it has been in the  past even for U.S. based investors.  </p><p>So, U.S. based investors typically have a very strong bias in their  portfolio towards U.S. investments.  As the U.S. economy is starting to see  some soft spots, and its emerging markets are coming out of a correction,  you would start see investors looking globally at a different mix between  developed markets and emerging markets.  You will also see them look at a  different balance between fixed income and equity investment.  And as  global investor we can bring that diversification to clients and we can  help them invest.  </p><p>Part of what we're also very good at and what we're expanding is investment  in sustainability.  And that in particular is very attractive for the  richest -- you know, clients that we have because they want to see their  investments also raise sustainability and many of the clients around the  globe look at sustainable investment as a new form which is under- represented in their portfolio.  And we have a targeted initiative in that  area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  And I know these are investors that want  long-term performance.  They're not looking to -- you know, make major  moves overnight.  I want to get back to that because that's an important  point.  </p><p>Let me get your reaction though first to this breaking news overnight and  that is about Deutsche Bank, a competitor of yours, authorities raided  Deutsche Bank's headquarters as part of a probe into money laundering.  Now  there's expectations that this company has gotten so weak it's going to  need some kind of a takeover.  Anybody's guess whether or not the German  government will allow its largest bank to be acquired by another but will  UBS be interested in acquiring Deutsche Bank?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we've said already in the past is we're looking  for targeted growth in our areas that where we have expertise and we're a  wealth manager.  And wealth management and asset management, that's the  core of what we do and we continue to look at that.  </p><p>We don't rule out inorganic options but it will not be full-fledged  mergers.  It will be more targeted acquisitions in the areas where we  already excel, where we've feel that we have a value proposition and we  want to expand that value proposition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any issues to that are still ongoing that you can tell us about  with regard to UBS in terms of any of this regulatory or rulings from -- I  know the French court was ruling on a trial back in February for UBS.  Is  that now in the rear view mirror for the company?  </p><p>WEBER:  It's not yet.  We have a -- we have a verdict that comes out in  February.  So, there will be no new news until then.  We're still in  discussion with authorities.  </p><p>We have not foregone the ability to settle the two remaining issues that we  have and for us really what matters going forward is to not have new issues  emerge.  So, we're very focused on compliance.  We're very focused on  operational risk and dealing with them, cyber resilience.  So, we really  want to avoid problems in the future and we've learned our lessons from the  past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that was a priority of yours when you first stepped  into the role.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's get the bad news out of the way and deal with this.  Your  thoughts on the regulatory environment in general.  The president to the  U.S. obviously has rolled back a number of regulations.  How does the  industry change from that standpoint?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think the U.S. is setting the pace here.  What we've seen is  almost a decade of re-regulation.  What is important now is -- you know,  like, with monetary policy normalization, do not overdo it.  </p><p>Of course, you can always rollout additional regulation but I think banks  now need some certainty around the regulatory environment in the future.   So that they can refocused on supporting the economy and that is happening  in the United States.  And I see that happening with some delay in Europe  and in Asia-Pacific.  </p><p>In Switzerland we're discussing some of the final regulations around  (INAUDIBLE) three implementation and too big to fail.  But my expectation  is by summer next year we'll have more regulatory certainty and then we can  refocused on doing business and doing business well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the investor sentiment right now in the face of all of  this, how does it look?  Are you worried about investing in this -- in this  market today?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think we see a lot of our clients are on the sidelines.  There's  a huge amount of cash sitting on the sidelines.  But you know in  (INAUDIBLE) the mood was very good and I was actually one of the few that  wasn't as positive about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WEBER:  We're seeing now a correction that has gone further and was more  pronounced than I expected then.  I think the market is overdoing it in the  other direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Overdue in the other direction.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Axel, it's great to see you.  </p><p>WEBER:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  The chairman of UBS, Axel Weber.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The president is tweeting this morning on  tariffs, here's what he just wrote, billions of dollars pouring into the  coffers of the USA because of the tariffs being charged to China.  There's  a long way to go.  If companies do not want to pay tariffs, build in the  USA.  Otherwise, let's just make our country richer than ever before.   Writes the president.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One, it will never pay down  the debt.  You're running over trillion dollar annual budget deficit right  now.  And number two, its attacks on people who buy stuff from overseas.   So, let's not brag about taxing the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've had a problem with these tariffs from day one and we are  seeing an impact in terms of companies making moves like Volvo this  morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and that's actually in relation -- Volvo is holding off  on hiring down in South Carolina because of the retaliatory tariff from  China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's now a 40 percent tariff on car imports from the U.S.  into China.  So that's hurting companies that make cars here and export  them to China and that's a lot of the foreign manufacturers that have plans  here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we've got a deal in the works.  Altria Group  reportedly in talks to acquire juul labs, that's the e-cigarette company.   Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines.  Cheryl, over you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's interesting, Maria.  The  Journal says that Altria, of course the maker of Marlboro and parliament  cigarettes is looking to take in a significant minority stake in Juul.   Right now there's no definitive deal on the table, but Juuls value by  investors this summer about $16 billion.  Shares of Altria are higher in  the premarket right now.  So stock to watch for all of you more than half a  percent.  </p><p>Well, Dick's Sporting Goods is considering dropping hunting supplies from  over 700 stores because of declining sales.  It's already pulled hunting  gear from 10 stores.  Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods are up about 26  percent so far this year.  </p><p>And remember Big Mouth Billy Bass?  He's back and he can talk back too.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Don't worry, be happy.  Don't worry, be happy now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Everyone's favorite wall-mounted singing fish is now programmed to  respond to Amazon's Alexa.  He will lip sync to Alexa's voice and dance to  sounds fom Amazon music when you pair it with a compatible echo device,  Maria.  Fun for the whole family.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  </p><p>CASONE:  I love the singing fish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is fun.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, it is 3D without the glasses, we're checking out the brand-new  cell phone that's aiming to shake up the business.  My exclusive interview  with ROK Group co-founder John Paul DeJoria is next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  3D content with a click, a mobile brand is  aiming to shake up the cell phone industry with a game-changing new device.   In a Fox Business exclusive right now, ROKiT is revealing its first ever  smartphone that allows users to watch 3D content without any 3D glasses.   Joining us right now is the co-founder of ROK Group, co-founder of Patron  Spirits and co-founder and chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems, he is  John Paul DeJoria and it is good to see you, John Paul.  </p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CO-FOUNDER OF ROK GROUP, CO-FOUNDER OF PATRON SPIRITS  AND CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS:  Always a  pleasure.  You know, we're launching these phones with the same philosophy  we have at all our Paul Mitchell Schools, give back first.  All of our  students participate, you know, in raising funds to help people out.  So,  we thought to start a business, why not change the dynamics.  First thing  we did was before (INAUDIBLE) we gave away free to homeless veterans that  were on the street there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Gave them the phone and at the same time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then you gave them for also veterans.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO OF ROSECLIFF:  You obviously conquered  the market with shampoo then tequila.  So I'm betting on you not against  you on this, but going after Apple seems like a kind of tough person to go  after.  Can you unseat the iPhone or just take some of their market share?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Well, what I'm looking at is not unseating anybody.  I want  everybody to prosper.  I'm looking at a brand-new field, it's a whole new  area.  Granted, they'll sell for under $300 each and it's a smartphone that  does unbelievable things.  We have a bundle that goes with it.  </p><p>For example, telemedicine, where seven days a week, 24 hours a day, there's  a doctor on the phone with you.  Other technologies we're working with the  NASA as one of our partners that scan the body to do unbelievable health  things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DEJORIA:  We're going to introduce those in about three months from now.   So, shall we say we're a bit of a disrupter because the price, no one can  believe these smartphones are going to sell for under $300 but they are --  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  When you talked about giving away  some of the phones.  That seems like almost giving it away compared to a  $1,000 or more phone.  What are we giving up if we're the customer and  we're getting this $300 phone with 3D images, what are we not getting that  you would get in a more expensive phone?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  An extra $700 or $800 added on.  No, this is a very advanced  smartphone and it has different things you can bundle on it.  Life  insurance, but this is for dollars.  </p><p>Give you an idea, recently we took the country of India, we're wi-fiing the  entire country of India, to help the lower classes become higher classes  because we're putting them on the internet and some of our technologies  doing that.  And we're looking at right now, doing a city in the United  States so.  People, no matter where you are, could try (INAUDIBLE) and make  phone calls anywhere in the world for less than $5.00 a month.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are a true entrepreneur and innovator.  J.P., good to see  you.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  It's always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We'll be watching the developments.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Paul DeJoria.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, November  29th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are  pulling back this morning after a powerful rally yesterday.  Futures  indicating a decline at the start of trading, about 50 points on Dow  Industrials, about 41 points lower on NASDAQ; after a major rally in stocks  yesterday, where the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are now back in positive territory  for the month.  Stocks rallied, 617 points on the Dow, 2-1/2 percent; the  S&amp;P was up 2-1/3 percent; and the NASDAQ with 208-point rally was up almost  three percent at the close, all on these comments from Fed Chairman Jay  Powell.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIR OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE:  My FOMC colleagues and I, as  well as many private sector economists are forecasting continued solid  growth, low unemployment and inflation remaining near two percent.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Global markets this morning are higher as you can see: FTSE100  up, two-thirds of a percent, 45 points higher; the CAC Quarante in Paris is  also up almost half a percent, 20 points higher; and the DAX Index in  Germany, up a fraction right now.  </p><p>In Asia, overnight, mixed performances as you see here, fractional moves  for the most part.  Big mover is oil.  Take a look at oil this morning,  crude is fighting to hold the $50.00 a barrel level.  It briefly fell below  50 earlier this morning, that was the first time that happened in more than  a year.  Now, oil is up better than one percent at $50.86 a barrel.  </p><p>President Trump is headed south.  The president will leave for Argentina  and the G20 later this morning, where the focus will be on tariffs and on  the president's meeting with China President Xi Jinping.  We will get a  preview from Buenos Aires coming up, this morning.  </p><p>Bailout payments hitting farmers' mailboxes; some of the payouts will not  even cover a cup of coffee.  And then, Deutsche Bank was raided;  prosecutors alleging that the bank helped clients create tax savings and  launder money, what it means for the already struggling company.  The stock  is down another four percent right now.  </p><p>The ultimate Christmas gift for kids, this luxury playhouse, has a living  room, a rock wall and a slide.  It doesn't come cheap.  The eye-popping  price tag later this hour, for that.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street  Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO  and Managing Partner Mike Murphy.  Greatly to see everybody this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURHPY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning,  great show.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.   You know, a lot of good news -- some bad news: U.S. life expectancy  falling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By a fraction, right?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  By a fraction.  And some of this is the opioid epidemic.  But  just a reminder that this mania to count how many people are joining  government health programs is a measure of health is not the right metric.   The right metric is life expectancy and not good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the life expectancy is about 78.6, 78.7.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  So, it's down a tenth of a percent, or a tenth of  a year, I should say.  And it's a -- what's happened is a very positive  long-term trend of higher life expectancy in the United States has come to  an end and has now turned around the last few years and is actually  declining.  So, part of that, we are talking about the fed, thinking there  are more 25 to 54-year-olds who want to come into the labor force, can come  into the labor force.  Part of the reason they haven't to this point sadly  is this issue with the drug abuse and suicide as well.  So, let's hope  there's some effort to get help to those people.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Meantime, on Facebook I  followed Greg Palkot, Fox News Correspondent, his dad whose 105.  So, shout  out to Ed Palkot. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that!</p><p>MURPHY:  Technology and new medicines I think can help people's lives be  longer and better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what we've been seeing; we've been living longer and  the life expectancy has been going up before this little decline.  Love  that 105-year-old dad that you refer, sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed Palkot.  You can follow him; he'll friend you back, on  Facebook.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll talk about all that this morning.  Joining the  conversation: Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here, along with the CEO  of Calamos Investments John Koudounis is here, to talk more about investing  today and the Host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in.  Don't  miss a moment, we've got a big hour ahead.  Kicking it off right here with  this top story: President Trump is going to be headed to Argentina this  morning to meet with world leaders at G20 summit.  Blake Burman is in  Buenos Aires right now with the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good  morning to you as well.  President Trump set to leave the White House in a  couple hours.  He will arrive here in Argentina much later this evening, as  he will have a series of events over the next couple of days for the G20  gathering, the gathering of world leaders and that includes a handful of  bilateral events with some of the biggest world leaders: The leaders of  Argentina, Germany, Japan, Russia and China as well.</p><p>Now, it appears as if the meeting with Vladimir Putin is still on.  The  president had threatened to cancel that meeting because of Russia's latest  provocative actions against Ukraine but the Kremlin says, as far as they  know, the Saturday get-together is still scheduled.  And then, there will  be a dinner between President Trump and President Xi of China, Saturday  night.  Trade, of course, is going to be one of the major focal points at  that dinner.</p><p>Now, the president actually has an unusual ally back home as it relates to  his trade position in China, with the top Democrat in the Senate Chuck  Schumer.  Schumer says, he stands with the president much more so than he  ever stood with President Obama and President Bush as it relates to their  position on China and trade.  But Schumer also had this warning for the  president saying do not cut a deal with China over that dinner simply for  the sake of generating a headline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Now, that we're finally  putting the screws to China, we cannot relate for the sake of a photo-op at  G20.  Yes, our actions will cause some pain.  But in the long-term, there's  much more gain than pain.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  We anticipate that tariffs will be a part of the discussion,  Saturday evening.  And the president this morning continues to talk up the  use of tariffs, he just took to Twitter a little while ago and wrote the  following, saying: \"Billions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of the  USA because of the tariffs being charged to China and there is a long way  to go.  If companies don't want to pay tariffs, build in the USA.   Otherwise, let's just make our country richer than ever before.\"  Thursday  morning here in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Maria, a couple days to go until  Saturday, a lot of events between now and then, but Saturday is going to be  the big day here between Putin and Xi. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure is.  You've got the Putin meeting and the Xi meeting.   Blake, we're going to be following your every move.  Thank you so much.   Blake Burman is in Buenos Aires and we'll follow all the news coming out of  the G20.  Joining us right now is Congressman Sean Duffy to talk more about  all of the above.  And congressman let's kick it off with what you think  might get accomplished at the G20 in the next couple of days, are you  optimistic about a deal with China?  </p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  Listen, I think it's important to do a  sit-down and have a face-to-face conversation about what are we doing in  regard to trade.  Let's be clear, Donald Trump doesn't impose tariffs  because he's trying to protect the American worker or the American economy.   He's doing it because he wants trade barriers to go away, because if we  have a fair playing field, we and he knows that the American worker, the  American farmer, the American business will thrive and grow.  So,  hopefully, with China and with other European leaders, he can sit down and  start to break down some of these barriers on trade so he can get rid of  tariffs and get back to free trade, is my hope.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman, James Freeman here of the Wall Street Journal.  From  Blake Burman's report looks like the weather is pretty good in Buenos  Aires.  So, I would suggest there's a chance that Putin may be shirtless  but -- whether he's wearing a shirt or not --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUFFY:  I think there's great horses in Buenos Aires as well.  So, he can  go shirtless on horses and maybe have some guns, who knows?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  His -- his wardrobe aside, why is he even at this meeting,  why was he not disinvited after invading his neighbor or at least a minor  incursion last weekend.  </p><p>DUFFY:  That's a really a good point, but I think this is the gentleman's  club and who wants to take the lead in disinvite Putin becomes the  question?  But -- outrageous in what Russia has done and frankly, I agree  with you, he probably should have been disinvited but who takes the lead on  that?  Should've Trump or someone else done that?  I don't know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Speaking of being disinvited, you are also going to see Crown  Prince MBS from Saudi Arabia in Argentina.</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is he going to get a cold hello from the others or what?  How  is the world treating MBS these days given the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?  </p><p>DUFFY:  All the world's greatest players, right, coming together in Buenos  Aires.  Yes, so, you know, the conference -- I think the president is going  (INAUDIBLE); we're all going to watch, you know, how everyone reacts to the  crowned prince.  But I think that President Trump needs to make sure he  sends a message to Saudi Arabia and the world, that we don't stand for, you  know, ruthless murder, especially from, you know, regimes or leadership of  countries.  </p><p>However, we also have to recognize that, you know, in a really bad region  of the world, where they behead people, cut little kid's hands off if they  steal bread.  It is a rough region.  We want to, you know, pick the best of  the worst to be our friends.  And you know, frankly, the best of the worst,  especially when you consider Iran, Saudi Arabia is best and we don't know  that relationship I think -- (INAUDIBLE) accountable for the murder of  Khashoggi.  </p><p>MURHPY:  Congressman, it's Mike Murphy, I think --</p><p>DUFFY:  Hey, Mike.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- when President Trump meets with China, on Saturday, I think,  one thing is, we should not be expecting to have a meeting and no more  tariffs and everything is kumbaya after that meeting.  I think that would  be a mistake for the markets and for the American people to expect.  I'm  hoping we get a framework of a -- positive long-term deal, just wondering  if you have similar thoughts on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and also coming from Wisconsin, you are impacted by these  tariffs.  Volvo has made a move today, it says it's going to slow down  hiring at new assembly plant in South Carolina because of the tariffs.  The  automaker was supposed to hire 1500 workers there by the end of the year.   It also scrapped its IPO, that was going to be a big deal $30 billion now,  not happening.  The president is threatening new tariffs after G.M.  announced closure of five U.S. plants.  He tweeted this: \"Tariffs of 25  percent have been put on small trucks coming into our country.  It is  called \"chicken tax.\"  If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars  would be built there.\"  So, Mike, you asked the right question in terms of  the impact here on tariffs.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Forget about Putin and the crowned prince.  I mean, you have Chuck  Schumer actually saying Donald Trump is doing something right in regard to  trying to bring us back to free trade -- oh, my hair is on fire.  I can't  believe --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no he didn't say that, congressman.  He didn't say anything  about free trade.  He likes the fact that this is a handout to the unions.   He likes the -- no, seriously, and to your point earlier, I am going to  push back on this, you said that this is about -- the tariffs are about  China, congressman?  But the president likes tariffs.  He is saying in that  tweet, I like that chicken tax, which goes back to the mid-60s, it was  related to a fight we got into with Europe over poultry, that's why we  called it -- </p><p>DUFFY:  No, no, no.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's why we called the 25 percent tariff we have on light  truck imports, the chicken tax.  So, he likes these tariffs and has nothing  to do with China, that is my argument.  </p><p>DUFFY:  You know I love you, Dagen, but I totally disagree with you.  So,  you look at Donald Trump, right?  You have a raging economy, you know  things are going well for the American worker and the American family, why  would you engage in a fight in regard to free trade or fair trade for  America as relates to the rest of the world?  The only reason you do that  is because you love your country.  And the politics of this aren't good,  but the long-term rewards are great for America.  </p><p>And so, Donald Trump realizes that if I don't put tariffs on foreign  products to get a better deal for the American worker, a fair playing  field, America is going to lose in the long run.  So, he's fighting a long  game as opposed to short game.  All politicians look short term, to the  next reelection; not President Trump.  What he said, no, no, I'm going to  look for long-term growth and success of the American economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but that long game --</p><p>DUFFY:  I'll side of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that long game has some industries, wanting more and wanting  a bailout, right?  </p><p>DUFFY:  Of course, this -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, you got a fallout for farmers, the president's bailout  offering $10 million for Wisconsin farmers.  That's an average over $2000  for each farmer in the state.  In neighboring Iowa, there are some checks  going to farmers that are only $25.00, some are less than $10.00, so how is  that supposed to be a help?  And what do you see happening next for the  farmer in Wisconsin?  </p><p>DUFFY:  So, we have a couple issues at play: One, the price have fallen --  in regard -- in milk, because we're great farmers and we produce more milk.   And when milk prices go down or milk prices go up regardless, we milk more  cows.  I mean, so that's the problem; it's basic supply and demand.  And  right now, we sell a lot of milk to Mexico, they still have their tariffs.   You know, the kind of deal with Mexico and Canada, they still have tariffs  on milk, and we're going to open up our Canadians market, so it's going to  get better for the farmer because of what President Trump has done,  especially Wisconsin.  </p><p>But, you know, we grow most cranberries in America in my district and we  have the best and the most ginseng grown in my district and Asia has put  tariffs on both of those products.  And in regard to cranberries, they  spent millions of dollars developing these markets and now they're going  away because of the tariffs, reciprocal tariffs that China has put on  America, in American agriculture.  And so, you know, we're trying to help  our farmers get through a difficult time.  And let's be clear what's  happening, Achilles heel is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>DUFFY:  -- agriculture in America.  And so, if we try to get a fair-trade  deal for American worker, our counterparts around the world will always go  after agriculture and when they do, we fold.  Trump has said, OK, we're  going to engage in this fight and to sustain the political fight at home,  we got to make sure we prop up ag that we don't want to, we're going to  because I want to build -- to survive long term here, in regard to the  trade fight.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman, last thing, I should have said an attack not  invasion on those Ukrainian forces, but this question where do we go from  here, is this trying to get open markets around the world or is just about  advantaging U.S. manufacturing?  </p><p>DUFFY:  No, this is about open markets.  Because I think the president --  and I think all of you at the table agree that if you have free and fair  trade, the American worker, the American manufacturer, the American farmer  will win; we're smartest and the best in the world but we can't do it when  you have unfair trade deal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got to jump.  Congressman, I guess your new speaker will be  Nancy Pelosi soon.  Sean Duffy, thank you. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have this breaking news.  The White House  reportedly weighing tighter rules on Chinese students.  Cheryl Casone with  the details and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  U.S. officials  and Congressional sources telling Reuters that the Trump administration may  impose tighter restrictions on Chinese students that study her in the U.S.   The issue growing concerns about espionage.  Maria, you spoke to educations  secretary, Betsy DeVos two days ago about the issue of Chinese students in  our country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talking about China, has there been any conversation in terms  of academia and what academia can do in terms of China and Chinese students  coming here going to our universities then taking the best of the best back  to China? </p><p>BETSY DEVOS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION:  Well, I think that's an  issue that we have to have lot further conversation about.  It's good to  have international exchanges.  I think that's important for our students  from America and for our students from around the world.  But I think we  need to also do it with our eyes wide-open about the potential for abuses  in that in that -- in that -- in that regard.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Wow.  There you go.  Well, Reuters says that one possible step the  Trump administration is considering would involve checking students' phone  records and their personal accounts on social media.  </p><p>Well, the headquarters of Deutsche Bank and other offices raided this  morning by German prosecutors and police in connection with an alleged  money laundering scheme.  Nearly 200 prosecutors and state police and tax  investigators involved in searches of six buildings in and around Frankfurt  alone.  Investigation targets two Deutsche Bank employees and other  unidentified officials who are suspected of helping clients create entities  and tax savings.</p><p>Deutsche is cooperating with authorities at this point.  Shares of Deutsche  Bank taking a hit this morning in the premarket on the news down three  percent.  Well, it is that time of year, President Trump lighting the  National Christmas Tree last night as he declared, Merry Christmas.  First  Lady hit the switch to light the tree behind the White House for the  presidential tradition that actually began back in 1923.</p><p>Meanwhile, we got to show you what happened here in New York last night.   The Rockefellers and their Christmas tree lit up nice and bright.  72 feet  tall, it's five miles if LED lights.  900 pounds Swarovski crystal stars  right on top of it.  The Rockefeller Center ceremony actually dates back to  1931, Maria.  And so does the midtown traffic jam that comes with it.</p><p>And then finally this.  Sorry.  Take a look at this.  A kid's playhouse  bigger than someone at departments.  It's 10 by 12 feet for the living  area, a screened sandbox.  That keeps mosquitoes out.  Plenty of storage  space, sofas, it's also got an outdoor a deck, a rock climbing wall and  tomb slide.  The price tagged 44 grand for the child in your heart, Maria.   And there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is nice.  Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming.  Facebook's data problem.  Details on the shocking  report suggesting that the social media giant wanted to sell users data.   Yes, that is next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Controversy at Facebook continues.  Internal e- mails reportedly revealed that the social media company once considered  charging companies for user data.  Gerri Willis on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange with the details there.  Gerri, good morning to you.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That is  right.  The drip, drip, drip of bad news continues for Facebook.  Those  stocks -- shares down marginally in premarket trading here about almost one  percent.  Here's what happened.  Internal e-mail showing executives  discussion charging companies for their user data right.  This flies in the  face of us what Mark Zuckerberg has been saying over and over again about  their policy towards user data.</p><p>He said on Capitol Hill not that long ago.  I can't be clear on this topic.   We don't sell data but all of this now up in the air question after these  e-mails were released.  The Wall Street Journal carrying the story today.   2.27 billion users out there.  Maybe you're one of them. </p><p>Meanwhile, Dunkin' Donuts announcing that a third party was able to gain  access to DDD Perks account number, their last name, their passwords.   They've sent e-mails out for a password reset for those folks and you  probably already been alerted.  And they say that their security kicked in  and started alerting everybody to the problem.  One point to think about  this morning, October 31st.  That was the date that Dunkin' found out about  this.</p><p>We're only hearing about it now.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much.  Gerri Willis on the floor of  the NYSE where we are expecting a lower opening for the broader average  this morning after that big rally yesterday.</p><p>Coming up.  Washington and your wallet.  We break down how the economy is  doing under President Trump and how it's impacting your pocket book.  Then,  the CEO of Calamos Investments works through the markets yesterday and  today and how to allocate capital.  John Doudonunis is here.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, November  29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  We have  breaking news right now.  We are waiting on the October reading on personal  income and personal spending.  Both are expected to be up four-tenths of  one percent.  As soon as we get the numbers which should be in about 15  seconds or so.</p><p>We will bring those to you.  We are also waiting on weekly jobless claims.   The estimate there, 220,000 jobless claims for the last week.  We will  flash it on the screen as soon as it hits the tape.  These are typically  not market movers, but this morning, we are expecting a lower opening from  the broader averages.  The Dow Industrials expected to be down about 30  points on the Dow, down 32 points on the NASDAQ, that's one half of one  percent, after that big powerful rally yesterday of up 600 points.</p><p>In Europe this -- in Europe this morning, we've got a higher showing as  well.  The numbers are coming out a little better-than-expected, up six- tenths of a percent on personal income and spending.  Up six-tenths of a  percent, we were expecting up four-tenths of a percent.  Again, these are  typically not market movers, so we'll be watching the impact here from --  income up five-tenths of a percent and spending up six-tenths of a percent.   As you can see, personal spending and income are out.</p><p>Markets mixed in Asia overnight.  Take a look at the Asian indices, and as  you will see, the best performer there was in Japan, the Nikkei Average up  a fraction.</p><p>We want to bring in Calamos Investments CEO, John Koudounis, right now.   And, John, it is good to see you this morning, thank you so much for  joining us.  </p><p>JOHN KOUDOUNIS, CEO, CALAMOS INVESTMENTS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations on the great couple of years at Calamos.  You  took over a CEO two years ago.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Assets under management at the time was 16 billion?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Just over that, a little bit over that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A little?  And now you're at 23 billion.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Just over 23 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you gather assets in an environment where you do see  the nervousness that we see and worries over the slowdown?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Well, it's -- I have to give a lot of credit to our Founder  John Calamos, he's built an incredible firm.  And the fabric of our firm is  we're great risk managers, and our portfolio managers have done a great  job.  We've used convertibles to do that.  And in this environment, it's  been very, very effective for us.  If you look at these conditions of  possible rates rising of huge volatility, a lot of our funds saw for those  problems, and that's why we've seen an incredible amount of inflows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you've got these inflows and you're allocating it  differently.  Do you worry that things are about to slow down, because that  seems to be the market worry?  Of course, yesterday, after Federal Reserve  Chairman said that we're close to neutral, basically given the market what  it wanted, we saw a 600-plus-point rally, but it's been a really tough  month.  So, tell us how you're dealing with this volatility in markets.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Well, we look at the markets with -- we take a very long-term  perspective.  And it was not a huge surprise, at least to me, that the Fed  was going to be accommodative.  A lot of the numbers and -- that were  building up to this, led for this decision.  And so, there's going to be  noise back-and-forth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not really accommodative.  I mean, they've raised  rates three times this year, they're going to raise rates again on December  17, and the next meeting is four rate hikes, and we're expecting another  three rate hikes next year.  Will this higher interest rates slow down what  has been a very strong economy on the President's economic policies.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Well, there's -- they're saying that they might do another  three interest rates hikes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  I don't think -- I'm not buying it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  I think they will be accommodative, and I think we're starting  to see that language yesterday.  And that's why we had that move over 600  points in the Dow.  So, what do you do to protect yourselves?  There's  certainly alternates that you can use to protect yourself.  We are market  neutral that protect yourself in volatility.  We have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mean market neutral funds.  Yes?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Market neutral funds, it's had a huge inflows in the last  couple of years.  It's up over $6 billion in terms of AUM on that  particular fund.  We have (INAUDIBLE) short that deals also with the market  volatility, because you're (INAUDIBLE) short, and we've seen that  particular part of the firm, the liquid alts, convertibles have done  really, really well.  And if you look at the markets since '08 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We've had 21 corrections that have been over five percent in  the equity markets.  All but one of them convertibles have outperformed.   So, just the mere fact that convertibles get you the majority of the upside  and limits your downside, they work.  So, what's been our secret of  successes, our managers have done a great job, but they're doing what  they're saying that they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Our funds are doing what they're saying that they're doing, and  that's what people like, they trust us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you deal with this race to the bottom on fees for some  of your competitors?  I mean, you've got lots of things coming at you,  whether it's Fidelity cutting fees to rock-bottom levels, and Vanguard  doing the same thing on ETFs and index funds, as well as, you know, people  saying, let's go passive, instead of active, then you've got FinTech coming  at you with technology.  How do you address all of these things coming at  your traditional money-manager firm like Calamos.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  That's a great, great question, and frankly, a lot of people  have difficulty with that, and you've seen other firms, our size actually  going the other way, where AUM has been decreasing, how do you deal with  that?  A couple of years ago, I know that I've been on your show, we're  talking about passive was extremely in, and when the markets were going  straight up, why do you need to ask the manager?  We're at the managers'.   There's nothing hiding about that, we're very active, we have to justify  our fees, and you're right, it gets harder and harder as we get few  compression in the markets.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're saying good managers are going to be able to give  you alternatives when markets are going down, you're going to want that  active manager as opposed to a passive venture, is that what you're saying?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Not just -- I'm exactly saying that, not just when markets are  going down, but when they're volatile.  People need their hand held.  Most  of our base right now is retail.  We have incredible distribution through  our intermediaries, our RIAs, we're on all the wire houses from Merrill to  Wells Fargo to UBS, and a lot of our clients are mom and pop.  And so, when  they see these markets, they're looking for solutions.  We were the number  one inflow asset manager for the last 12 months out of anyone in the world.   And we stand in a great company, top 10 guys, people at BlackRock,  Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, PIMCO, great firms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's working now then, John, tell me what's working.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  It's active management in this particular space.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But in what particular funds?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Since the volatility, since the current administration, since  they've taken out the regulations or limited them, since the tax cuts  things have changed, markets have changed, people are trying to navigate  through them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  And so, when we have people that have been dealing with this,  our firm is over 41 years old, have been conservative, and have been very,  very -- have great track records over the long run, it works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So, where do you want to see -- so where are you seeing  the performance right now?  You mentioned liquid alts, is that where you're  -- the alternatives -- you're seeing --</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We're seeing -- we're seeing the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where is the performance?  What's working now?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  What's working is our liquid alt books, are outperforming both  equities and bond market.  And some of them are bond -- we'll use them  instead of bond funds, and some of them are just alternatives to straight  growth of equity funds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about straight growth equities, do you still like growth,  do you still see sentiment on the part of your customers, your clients  wanting things like Apple, and these, you know, growth funds that have seen  such volatility?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We're seeing a slowdown in that particular market.  Because  when you see some of these volatilities and the downtrend of the market,  there's always the growth versus value type of question that comes out.   And then, you have to be a lot more specific in what stocks you pick in the  growing market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in terms of the growth and where is the growth within the  growth sector, are you seeing any other real performance coming out of some  of the growth equity portion of the firm?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We're seeing a huge internal cyclical move, where the FAANGs  were leading the markets and it was the biggest percentage, we're starting  to see other stocks, other -- whether it'd be tech, we feel that finance is  still going to do really well in the FAANG stocks.  So, we're seeing  movement out of some into the others, not just from --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, an allocation shift is going on.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Huge allocation shift, and we're not just seeing a pull, we're  just seeing more of an allocation shift and a slowdown of growth in the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry that rates are going to spoil the party that  higher rates?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Look, there always going to be mistakes that are done, but I  think Jay Powell is doing a great job, he knows what he's doing, he will be  accommodative.  They say three rate hikes, I don't believe it.  Unless the  market is so strong and growth is so strong that they will do those hikes,  they will watch it, and it's not all the battering because of the current  administration is saying.  They may listen to that but I think they're  looking at the data, and they know -- nobody does well if they choke the  market by raising rates too quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  So, they're going to be very, very -- looking at all statistics  and I think they're going to continue to be accommodative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there seems to be a better tone right now.  I mean, the  market is lower, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, but  it's only 20 points, and this is after a powerful rally yesterday.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did it feel like you wanted to buy into that rally yesterday  when things were moving up?  Were you on the buy side or were you selling  into the strength?</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  I think there's been a lot of cash on the sidelines. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  And I think a lot of people were looking for this opportunity,  and that's why we saw that big of a movement.  And we -- the market kind of  sensed that Powell was going to say some positive things for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  We saw it go up, and then we saw it double again, the increase  after the speech.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's incredible, because as soon as the embargoed comments  came out, markets shoots up and then stayed up 500 points while Mr. Powell  was speaking.  It's great to see you, John.  Thank you so much.</p><p>KOUDOUNIS:  It's great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Koudounis joining us there, CEO of Calamos.</p><p>Coming up, battle at the border, the growing concerns of a potential health  risks among the migrant caravan members.  Then, President Trump on the  world stage this weekend.  Stuart Varney's expectations for the G20 summit.   He's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching by Buenos Aires this morning.   President Trump is headed to the G20 summit in Argentina, this morning, as  he prepares for the high-stakes dinner with China's President Xi Jinping.   Joining us now to talk more about that is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\"  Stuart Varney with some high expectations, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, let's compare and  contrast, in all previous G20 meetings or whatever they call it, G10, G12 - - whatever -- they all appear for the photo-op wearing some strange  costumes from the host country, then they get together and give this final  communique which says absolutely nothing, it is totally meaningless.  This  time around, this G20, this one in Buenos Aires, is going to be radically  different.  This is a place where something is going to happen.  And the  headlines will be flowing thick and fast.  </p><p>Number one, you've got Saturday night's dinner with Xi Jinping.  Don't tell  me there'll be no headline after that.  Saturday morning or lunchtime I  think it is, he meets with Putin.  Putin has just set his navy on the  Ukrainian Navy.  Don't tell me that nothing's going to happen with that  meeting.  Theresa May and Angela Merkel, they're there, do you think he'll  have something to say about Brexit?  How about the leader of Japan and  South Korea, do you think they'll have something to say about North Korea?   I do.  I think it's going to be a thick and fast flow of headlines,  meaningful headlines, news will be made.  And that's a wonderful thing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  Lots to cover on Sunday and Monday that's  for sure.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think these are going to be largely positive headlines?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know.  I mean, you're laughing at me because you know - - you know, it's going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  I think thick and fast </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that's the wildcard.  We'll see.</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  But I'll guarantee that at the end of the dinner with Xi Jinping,  they'll be a smile, there will be a handshake, but after that, I don't  know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of potential for upside surprises, you know, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because markets aren't expecting much on the China front,  right.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Well, look at the Fed yesterday.  And were we expecting that  yesterday?  We got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was wild.  Stu, thanks.  We'll see you in about 10  minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you'll have a lot more at the top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join  Stuart and company, coming up.</p><p>But first, there's this, health concerns at the southern border.  We are  headed live to Mexico, next up.  We'll get the latest on the caravan  crisis.

The  undocumented immigrants from the caravan could potentially bring serious  health concerns to the United States.  Griff Jenkins is live this morning  in Tijuana, Mexico.  Here's more on this.  Good morning to you, Griff.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria, good morning.   Yes, we're getting really troubling and concerning members for this migrant  caravan.  There are 6,000 here in Tijuana, and the health officials here  told me yesterday that this is what they're seeing out of the 2,267 people  they've treated, over 60 percent have respiratory infections.  There have  been three confirmed cases of tuberculosis, four cases of HIV aids, and 101  cases of lice, as well as four cases of chicken pox, and they're very  worried about hepatitis because of the unsanitary conditions.  And also,  because of the overcrowding.  If you just look over here for one second,  Maria, you see, over that fence line is 6,000 close people, packed into a  space for 1,000.  </p><p>Then, if you quickly look just down this way, you see that white tent and  one truck, that is the Tijuana health officials, that is the only resources  that is dealing with all of that overcrowding.  There is a lot of coughing,  a lot of spitting, there are signs that say \"prohibido escupir\" no  spitting, because they're worried about the spread.  And it is -- the  migrants here that are under these conditions, they believe they're getting  very exhausted, and they say, listen, we were lied to in the very beginning  from organizers who said it was going to be easier, not this tough.  And  they worry of breaking points coming.  This is immigrant Marco Munoz from  Honduras.  Take at a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARCO MUNOZ, IMMIGRANT FROM HONDURAS:  They lied to us from the beginning.   So, most of these people are disappointed, you know, and getting frustrated  as time -- so as you can see, every day that come -- that passes, there's  more and more people that are coming.  So, there's going to be a point  break, but they're just going to say, let's just -- let's rush in there,  you know?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  So, you've got rain coming earlier today already, and it's  expected throughout the day, that makes things even worse under these  conditions, the migrants are wet, cold, and tired, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Griff, thank you so much.  Griff Jenkins is live in  Tijuana this morning.</p><p>Coming up, corporate patriots, how U.S. companies can do their part  protecting intellectual property from China, one of the biggest issues  today.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're taking a look at American companies doing their part.  A  new op-ed this morning calls for companies to do more, that's in today's  Wall Street Journal.  The headline reads this: \"Where Are the Corporate  Patriots?\" And in it, the author writes: \"Too many American companies have  been too quick to sell out in exchange for access to the Chinese market.   They are more than business decisions, they are matters of national  security.\"</p><p>And, you know, James, I always go back to the Google decision, when Google  decided we don't want to do evil, so we're not going to work with the  Pentagon and we're not going to work with the U.S. government on anything  regarding immigration, after parents were separated from their children.   And, instead, Google turns around and they go to China, with all of the bad  behavior in China from human rights to everything else, stealing of theft - - theft of technology.  They are OK with censoring their search engine in  China.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it was outrageous.  And I think this article -- I'm glad we  were able to run this op-ed by Samantha Ravich who is on the Trump  intelligence advisory board, also at the Foundation for Defense of  Democracies.  And it raises, I think, a big question here, which is we're  watching obviously the President try to negotiate to change China's  behavior, and she's saying, well, what responsibilities do companies have?   Should they just refuse to share their technology?  Should they refuse on  the Google end to participate in the -- in the police state there?  You  know, are there options that companies have, and are there things they  should be doing that they're not in terms of reporting intelligence back to  the U.S. government?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And Dagen, Andrew Higgins is mentioned in the piece,  who's of course, Higgins boat was instrumental in the D-Day invasion. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, I love that she reminds the American people where -- who  made those boats and kind of partnership between private industry and the  United States that help us win World War II, she points out that Higgins  was paid tribute in 1944 in Eisenhower's Thanksgiving Day address.  To that  point, there is a responsibility that American corporations have to  protecting what is ours, and doing right by everyone in this nation.  And I  think that more and more, we call out these individual companies as you  have with Google, the more -- you know, the more power we might have over  their businesses decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think they have a responsibility, it's this great country  that made them strong, powerful, and rich, Mike Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, they have a responsibility to an extent, but it's a different  world now, it's a global economy that we live in, and these companies that  are being -- their job -- you know, the CEOs of these public companies,  especially, they have to do what's best for their shareholders.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  I shouldn't say this country made them rich, that's not  right.  It enabled them with our freedoms and our democracy.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It helped them do so.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  And they see China as the biggest market in the world, and a  great way for them to increase their company profits, and I think, really,  what I bring this back to is the current issue that we have with the trade  war and tariffs, and that's we -- what the President wants is fair trade  across the globe.  And I think if we get that, it's better for China, it's  better for the United States, it's better for everyone in between  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It raises a -- it raises a bigger issue, though, these companies  -- it's their intellectual property that's getting stolen, $600 billion --  up to $600 billion a year.  And so then, when there's trouble, then they  turn to the government and want the government to fix what they needed to  take charge of to begin with. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Trump is doing right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  That's what he wants.  So --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And I think, maybe, a hopeful part of this story is that I  think a lot of businesses have realized, they went into China thinking huge  long-term market, last few years, they're seeing this communist regime has  become more communist, it's kind of reverted, become less open, not  liberalizing anymore.  I don't think China is getting the help from the  American business community they thought they were going to get to pressure  Donald Trump.  I think they have found a lot of American companies saying,  yes, Trump is right, we're getting a raw deal.  So, I think that is maybe  the hopeful sign here, and perhaps this op-ed will encourage more on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but the likes of Google, they say, if they're saying that  at all, they're saying it privately and quietly because some of these  liberal companies, they won't stand next to the President in agreement on  him doing what is right for the entire nation and every worker in this  country because they don't want to be associated with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that's just --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's just ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've thrown out -- I mean, the mainstream media, they've  thrown out their ideals and values of what we deem so important to us, and  that is freedom, due process because they hate Donald Trump.  I mean, it's  really disgusting.  </p><p>Before we go, we've got a couple of seconds left.  Mike, you're expecting a  pretty good performance in markets, aren't you, after yesterday's big  rally?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we get a rally after the G20, and I think it's a big  rally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Mike Murphy, James Freeman,  Dagen McDowell, great to see everybody, have a great day.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  That will do it for us.  Go seize the day, \"VARNEY  &amp;COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, this is a day to be seized.  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

What a day yesterday.  We are looking at a follow through  this morning.  Thank you so much.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it  Thursday, November 29th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are pulling back this morning after that huge rally yesterday.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow Industrials now down 81 points.  We are following through on what led  the market higher yesterday.  It was a major rally on the street.  The Dow  and the S&amp;P 500 now in positive territory for this month.</p><p>Stocks rallied on the comment -- this comment from Fed Chairman Jay Powell,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  Interest rates are still low by  historical standards, and they remain just below the range of estimates of  that level that would be neutral for the economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that, the markets shut up 600 points in Europe.  This  morning, there is some follow through.  </p><p>The markets are higher across the board.  </p><p>FT-100 up 45 points right now, two-thirds of one percent, CAC Quarante in  Paris also up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up a  fraction this morning, 21 points higher.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances.  Hong Kong and China were lower, but  Japan was higher by a fraction, as was the Korean KOSPI Index.  </p><p>Deutsche Bank has been raided.  Prosecutors alleging that the bank helped  clients create tax havens and launder money.  </p><p>What it means for the already struggling bank coming up.</p><p>And a new tariff threat, President Trump warning of new charges on vehicles  following the G.M. layoffs.  </p><p>Plus Volvo is slowing hiring plans here in the U.S. because of those  tariffs.  The fallout coming up this morning.  </p><p>Honoring our heroes, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald,  pays tribute to Pat Tillman and Senator John McCain on his feet.  </p><p>A closer look at his special cleats for Sunday's big game, that's coming  up.</p><p>And it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas at Taco Bell.  The fast- food giant unveiling a line of themed clothes, from socks to sweaters, even  onesies.  </p><p>We will tell you about it.  All those stories coming up this Thursday  morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman,  and Rosecliff CEO/Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.  </p><p>Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning.  I'll wear the onesie  on T.V.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Taco Bell clothing -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- here we come.  Big move yesterday in the markets, huh?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  It is  a big move, and the oil dipping blow, 50 bucks a barrel, suggests the  argument Mr. Powell was making has been bolstered this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure has.  And yesterday, I was -- I was at The New  York Economic Club -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and everyone was waiting, will Jay Powell make comments  about the interest rate story.  </p><p>He did a lot about financial stability -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in his speech.  It wasn't until he said, \"Look, we're still  at low levels,\" which we all knew and yet the market saw that as a reason  to run up, Mike.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think, really, the main thing that they got was six week  ago, he said that, \"We're nowhere near neutral on rates.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A long way.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Which is why there was a long -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A long way was -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Sorry, a long way.  </p><p>And now he's saying we're a lot closes to that, which implies there'll be  less rate hikes, which the market likes, that's why he saw the rally  yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was the change in -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That one word usually tells it, right?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I've -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- James Freeman, where you work, don't know if you had your  hands in this, says that this is a welcome rethink.</p><p>But as \"The Journal\" does point out that we have a market, a global market,  and a world that is grappling with global slowing growth, bad trade policy  that's deterring investment, and a fed that is also still gradually  reducing this unprecedented bond portfolio.  </p><p>And we have no way of knowing what the knock-on effects of that are or will  be, so this is a very welcome, at least, reasonable approach to hiking  short-term interest rates.</p><p>I paraphrase.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.  And just the editorial also adds those Vice Chairman  -- Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida comments from earlier in the week  saying the fact that you've got a lot of people working doesn't  automatically lead to inflation.  </p><p>That's a -- that's a welcome sign from the fed.  </p><p>Personally, I kind of like going a bit higher.  I don't think the fed funds  rate ought to be equal to the rate of inflation.  </p><p>But again, this oil news this morning, if you want to be dovish, if you  want to say inflation is very restrained, you have a better case today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you sure do.  We're going to check markets this morning.  </p><p>Take a look at oil, sitting right at $50.00 a barrel right now, what a  selloff in the last month and a half.  </p><p>Then another half a percent this morning with light sweet crude at $50.02 a  barrel.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is the Chairman of UBS, Axel Weber is  with us this morning in an exclusive interview talking about markets and  investing capital today.  </p><p>The CEO of Calamos Investments, John Koudounis, is joining us as well.  </p><p>Almost looking at the backdrop for stocks.  </p><p>Patron Spirits Founder, John Paul Mitchell Co-Founder, John Paul DeJoria is  here as well.  </p><p>Along with Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Subcommittee  Chairman, Sean Duffy.  </p><p>Plus Tennessee Senator Elect, Marsha Blackburn with us.  </p><p>A lot to talk about with the Senator Elect, so stay with us.  We got a big  three hours coming up.  </p><p>We kick it off right here with this top story, and that is the stock market  comeback.  Check out these numbers, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ  surged yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell's comments on  interest rates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they  remain just below the range of estimates of that level that would be  neutral for the economy.</p><p>That is neither speeding up nor slowing up growth.</p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private sector economists are  forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation  remaining near two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is TIGER 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.  </p><p>Michael, it is good to see you.  Thank so much for joining us.  </p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How's the sentiment in terms of your members?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  I -- our members are trying to have the discipline that when  the market went down 600, they didn't overreact and when it goes up 600,  but clearly interest rates and tariffs are the story of the day.  </p><p>Are the tariffs really hurting the economy and what's going to happen with  the exploding deficit and will we get some infrastructure?  These are the  bigger stories they are dealing with across the country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they impacting things, the tariffs right now?  </p><p>I mean look we've news this morning in terms of companies making moves in  the auto sector as a result of these tariffs.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Yes.  There's no question that auto, for sure, particularly  with the news around G.M. and what's going on, tariffs are having a huge  impact on the auto industry.</p><p>We have members in our Detroit group who are clearly worried because with  the closings of G.M. that has an impact, real estate prices are probably  still too high.  </p><p>That group is waiting for prices to come down and they've taken some real  estate off the table in the last quarter.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm trying to get a sense of how you think your members,  investors generally might react to any news we get out of this weekend's  G20 meeting.  </p><p>Obviously both the U.S. and the Chinese side have kind of downplayed hopes  for a solution to the trade dispute, but what if at the dinner Xi Jinping  and Donald Trump solve it? </p><p>What if we have an agreement or maybe a framework to get to an agreement?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Sure.  So I would say that that would be a very important  news, but when our members meet in groups every month, there are a load of  struggling like what's the really important news and what's going to  happen.  </p><p>And they try to have a All-Weather portfolio, so when I was talking to a  member recently, he was saying -- it was an interesting thing, he's  shorting hundred-year bonds.  </p><p>Why?  Because if interest rates come up a little, those bonds are going to  be a great stabilizer as they fall.</p><p>The Australian markets way overheated, American real estate somewhat  overheated sector by sector, so our members in the last quarter took --  last two quarters have taken about 10 percent of their holdings off of the  table.</p><p>MURPHY:  So when you talk to your members, I'm kind of talking my own book  here because we invest venture capital private equity.  </p><p>So much focus on unicorns right now in the market.  How do your members see  that and do they want to be involved in the private space?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Totally.  The largest shift over the last decade in our  membership is private equity, grown from 10 percent to 24, all-time high.  </p><p>So as real estate is coming down, all-time high to private equity now  exceeding even public equity 23 percent, private equity 24 percent.  </p><p>Why?  Because in venture and in private, you have these scalable businesses  given our technology, that's where the action is, not as passive investors.  </p><p>Our members were the great entrepreneurs who built businesses, so when they  sell their business, what they can do is invest in another business where  they can be on the board or they can actually kick the tires and understand  really what's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does that tell you anything about where we are in terms of  growth, this optimism about the unicorns?  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So what it tells you is when you see real estate coming down  so quickly, that's the biggest sign that those markets are frothy.</p><p>But in total, our members are allocated over 73 percent of public equity,  private equity in real estate, that's a pretty long-term bullish referendum  on the U.S. economy.</p><p>So, I would say long-term optimism about the U.S., short-term, we're in  choppy waters, but still sailing still fine.</p><p>MURPHY:  And I would assume that they're the type A personalities that,  like you said, have built things so they want more control.  </p><p>So being able to invest private and have a little control from a board  level or whatever it may be.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Absolutely.  And if you compare it to, say, the public  equities today, take Apple, or G.M., or Facebook, these are big stories,  but our members have learned that they can't mark -- they can't time the  market</p><p>So, if they overreact to any one of those stocks one way or another,  history is very clear, they can't time the market.  They're better off with  an index fund or a long-term holding.  </p><p>Even taking Apple, which is in bear market territory today, still up for  the year.  </p><p>So, if you're a long-term holder, if you're a 10-year holder, you're still  in holding position.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The -- wanted to ask you, you mentioned Australia being  overheated.  Fed Chairman Jay Powell yesterday said -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was funny.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- they had 27 straight years of growth.  </p><p>If you get 27 straight years of growth, you probably ought to have a sky- high valuation, right?  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  It's a little geriatric in the -- in the cycle right there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a funny comment about Australia.  </p><p>When you look at tech, you mentioned tech stocks.  Microsoft briefly  overtaking Apple -- </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Amazing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as the world's most valuable company yesterday as Apple  faces pressure on the slumping iPhone demand.  </p><p>In terms of this volatility in technology, I know they're not trying to  time the market, how much are they invested within tech versus elsewhere  within equities?</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  So within the public equity exposure, the growth is in index  funds to avoid just this problem, but the largest concentration of specific  stocks is all the FAANGs.  </p><p>And then now you get the turbulent waters.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and -- or Alphabet.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Exactly.  And now NVIDIA seems to have come into the four.  </p><p>But who talked about Microsoft?  All of a sudden, Microsoft came back after  being so moribund.  </p><p>And then you have to look at the specifics, the problems Facebook is  having, members are concerned about that.  </p><p>And Apple, although Apple is rock solid in its balance sheet, you have the  tariff issue that could have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out, though, that investors, if they  watched MORNINGS WITH MARIA and Maria Bartiromo every day, they would know  about the success of Microsoft and what was going on at that company for  years -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- literally.  Your interview with Satya Nadella, your coverage  of Microsoft before that, but also what was going on with Apple and your  interview with Dan Niles -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- well ahead of the selloff in Apple, so you name it, again,  because of the people that you interview on this program, we're giving a  very big window into what these companies are doing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And when Dan joined us, when I spoke with him from San  Francisco, you know, Apple was in this bull market, you know, moment and he  was skeptical.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it was -- he -- his skepticism was born out of the  inventory problem.  </p><p>He said inventories were up 89 percent year over year in the second  quarter, and looking at an economy that is poised to slow down, who is  going to buy a thousand dollar phone particularly in China?  </p><p>And he was right, and Apple has sold-off since he said it, and I -- and I  think Dan Niles is one of the smartest guys within technology, because he  does the backdrop analysis.  </p><p>He's looking for real, specific reasons of why these stocks are moving.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  We see it through a different lens.  Our members in Detroit  are seeing what's happening in the auto industry firsthand.  Our members in  Seattle see this tension between Apple and what's happening with Amazon in  Seattle and what's happening in Microsoft.</p><p>So, when you're on the ground and you're an active investor, you can get  the same kind of -- same kind of lead. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I just want to point out, like, the administration gave  a bit of a bailout, a handout to farmers hurt by the retaliatory tariffs  from china, which we saw in the GDP report yesterday.  </p><p>So, how long does it take for these automakers to come calling and say  \"Where is our handout?\"  Because the President is threatening -- well,  import tariffs on small cars, but threatening to take away at least the  subsidies on General Motors.  </p><p>Which, by the way, started going away shortly.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They got their handouts, didn't they?  The automakers?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, ten years ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, that's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ford did -- Ford did -- </p><p>MURPHY:  -- $7,500 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They got a bailout.  They got a bailout.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- vehicle credit for electric cars.  They want to keep going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they want that $7,500-, that was what I said yesterday, the  7,500-dollar tax credit that you get for buying electric vehicles makes  certainly the Chevy Bolt more attractive.  </p><p>They want an extension, their tax - that tax break for G.M. expires shortly  because they've hit that 200,000 vehicle threshold, so we can talk about  the tariffs.  </p><p>But again, these things are hard to quantify.  Until they start showing up  in layoffs of almost 15,000 individuals -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Sure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's hard to know what the real impact is of how businesses  make decisions about future investment.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But when you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what you're saying is it's a slippery slope.  Farmers want  help, maybe the autos will want it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe somebody else will want it, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Have you seen though the other -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anybody had -- how about pipeline builders?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're all -- anybody who uses steel and aluminum in this  country.  </p><p>And I pointed out yesterday when the President was tweeting about more  tariffs on small car imports, I just said, you know, anybody who says that  the President wants zero tariffs are non, my -- I'll follow him on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Yes.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  You know, the only thing I want to say it's true, it's a  slippery slope.  </p><p>Our members are fervent capitalist, but we wouldn't have an Internet  without government investment.  </p><p>We wouldn't have a space program without government.  </p><p>So, there are critical industries that private industry doesn't support.  </p><p>We can debate it, but the facts are we got an Internet, we have a space  program, and we have some alternative energy project and they all got paid  back to the Energy Department.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's -- </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Notwithstanding Solyndra.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, treasury loss, $11.2 billion on the -- just the General  Motors bailout.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So that didn't get paid back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Not much happened on the Internet before they commercialized it.  </p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Anyway.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael, it's great to get your insights this morning.</p><p>SONNENFELDT:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>Michael Sonnenfeldt joining us there, TIGER 21.  </p><p>Coming up, breaking overnight, officials have raided Deutsche Bank's  headquarters in connection with a money laundering probe.  </p><p>Details coming up right there.</p><p>And then the honor run, one Cardinals player is paying tribute to American  heroes like Pat Tillman and John McCain by putting them on his cleats.</p><p>Back in a minute with that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news this morning, new legal trouble  for Deutsche Bank.  </p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details now.  Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  </p><p>Several offices, including Deutsche Bank's Headquarters being searched by  authorities as part of a money laundering probe.  </p><p>Roughly a hundred and seventy.  That is a lot of prosecutors, police  officers, and tax inspectors are involved in the search of six offices in  and around Frankfurt.  </p><p>So, that suggest the significance of this.  </p><p>German prosecutors allege that two employees, who still work at the bank,  helped clients create offshore accounts and then transfer funds from those  illegal activities.  </p><p>All this investigation was sparked by \"The Panama Papers,\" that was a  massive, massive document leak of millions of pages.  </p><p>Back in 2016, it detailed how wealthy people use tax havens to shield their  money.</p><p>Authorities also claim that Deutsche Bank failed to report the suspicious  accounts, could be used to launder money.  </p><p>Deutsche Bank says it's fully cooperating with this investigation.  </p><p>The stock is down almost five percent ahead of this.  If you look at the  year-to-date chart, it is down almost 50 percent.  </p><p>So the stock is the Wells Fargo to Germany.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Wells Fargo to America, that's its significance in a sense  in Germany.  It was such an icon.  </p><p>And it's had so many troubles between everything that happened in the  financial crisis and the $18 billion in fines and legal fees that they  paid, and now these latest allegations.  </p><p>And on top of all of this, where's the profit?  They're' paying bonuses,  they've increased their bonuses, in fact, to many of their workers, it's a  -- it's a mess.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James, what do you think about this? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think investors, as you said, have had this question  about, what is their business model?  This has been kind of the most  troubled of the giant banks in a lot of ways lately.  </p><p>But, obviously, it deserves the presumption of innocence, but investors  hoping this is not the business model, but disturbing news certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look how the stock has fallen.  Is this a takeover candidate at  this point, Mike?  </p><p>MURPHY:  No.  This is something that they've -- for the last 10 years,  they've been defending themselves from one scandal after the next, and  what's breaking this morning.  </p><p>I don't know that anyone expected this, but they've never been able to  right the ship, so to speak, since the financial crisis, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MURPHY:  -- I don't know where it ends for Deutsche Bank, because there are  so many other great stories out there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess it's hard to believe that Germany would allow somebody  else, a foreigner to acquire Deutsche Bank.</p><p>MURPHY:  Oh, for sure.  I mean -- and I mean that and I don't know why a  foreigner would want to -- because by buying Deutsche Bank, you're buying  all the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The problems.  </p><p>MURPHY:  -- potential issues that are there as well.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Regulators are breathing down their back right now, especially  with these money laundering allegations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll watch that.  </p><p>Obviously, it's going to be a busy day.  </p><p>The stock is down about five percent right now.  And Deutsche Bank, we're  watching that.  </p><p>Let's take a short break.  </p><p>When we come back, Facebook and the data problem.  New court document show  that the social media giant considered selling user data.  </p><p>That's the fallout, and we will tell you about it.  </p><p>Then 'tis the season to be saucy, Taco Bell rolls out their brand new  Christmas apparel line based on their hot sauce packets, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Facebook under fire, internal emails show that the social media giant  considered doing something it said it never would.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's pretty fascinating,  Maria.  </p><p>These emails that were seized by British lawmakers suggest that Facebook  once considered selling users data even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised  not to do that.  </p><p>According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the emails also indicate Facebook  employees discussed pushing some advertisers to spend more in return for  increased access to users' information.  </p><p>At a congressional hearing back in April, Zuckerberg said that he opposed  selling that data.  Take a look at shares of Facebook, they're lower in the  premarket.  </p><p>Maria, of course, can have more on this and reining in big tech when she  interviews Tennessee's incoming Senator, Marsha Blackburn, that's going to  be in the 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time hour.  </p><p>Well, there is a change coming at the top of Unilever, the maker of Dove  soap and Hellmann's Mayonnaise.  </p><p>Alan Jope, who is currently the President of the company's beauty and  personal care division is going to take over for Paul Polman, who's going  to step down January 1st.  </p><p>Polman did lead Unilever for 10 years.  Unilever, of course, is working to  adjust the changes and consumer takes.</p><p>Shares of Unilever, little changed in the premarket.  </p><p>Well, Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi have reaffirmed their commitment to  their alliance.  </p><p>The companies issued a joint statement, saying they remain fully committed  to that three-way deal.  </p><p>The alliance sold more than ten million vehicles last year.  </p><p>But, of course, Nissan and Mitsubishi did out Carlos Ghosn as their  Chairman for alleged financial misconduct.  </p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\" says that Nissan's investigation also has revealed  $80 million in deferred pay forgone.  </p><p>Share of Nissan, Maria, down 14 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Lot to discuss in that story, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there's a lot to discuss because we continue to see  Carlos Ghosn sitting in a jail in Tokyo and - or in -- outside of Tokyo,  and we still don't have any official charges from the --from the Tokyo  government, from the Japanese government.  </p><p>I don't understand this.  I mean I questioned this on Twitter the other  day, James, because what kind of a judicial system throws you in detention  and then they decide what to charge you with.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.  And I think a lot of people looking at this are a little bit  shocked, because, again, this is not Communist China, this is Japan, this  is a modern industrialized democracy.  </p><p>And yet as you said, thrown in jail, not able to consult with a lawyer  before getting interrogated -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- not being able to have your lawyer present getting  interrogated.  </p><p>And this is a guy who achieved a lot of great results for that company.   And we're not getting -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was icon in Japan at one point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So we're now -- and, you know, he -- we'll see.  Maybe  they've really got the goods on them, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  We'll see.  But -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is this just a question of deferred compensation and whether  it was -- whether it was adequately disclosed or not -- I -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or is this political?  We know that within the Nissan ranks,  they were upset that they were about to be either acquired or merged with  in this alliance with a French company, Renault, that was much weaker than  Nissan.  </p><p>Now Nissan's the larger company, the more successful.  </p><p>So there was this movement going on, Mike, within Nissan to take him down.</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.  And you just hope that this isn't just some political  or go after one person, because it just -- it's like a scene from a movie  right now.  </p><p>But if he's guilty, he should be charged.  And if not, she should be let  go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget about Greg Kelly, the number two guy.  </p><p>His number two is also in jail.  He's an American citizen, these are the  only two people that are in jail for this deferred compensation problem.  </p><p>Where was the CFO as \"The Journal\" wrote about earlier this week, where was  the board?</p><p>So I just have a big problem with what they have done to Carlos Ghosn,  because I'm not -- I'm not buying it, I don't see the charges coming out of  the government there.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what about there -- what is the U.S. government doing about  the American Citizen that's being held under a standard that would -- is --  would not see light of day here in the United States in terms of being  essentially to what you said in terms of the judicial system in Japan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Put in jail and then the charges are being weighed as he  sits in a -- in a jail cell.  </p><p>We'll keep watching that.  </p><p>Coming up, the tariff effect, it is real.  </p><p>Volvo has canceled their multibillion dollar IPO and it is slowing hiring  at American plants, we will take a look at the fallout there.</p><p>And giving away, Patagonia is using money from President Trump's tax  savings plan, but it is not going to their employees, we will tell you  where it is going coming up, back in a moment right here. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, November 29th,  your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures showing the markets will pull back, this morning, at the opening of  trading.  Dow Industrials down 72 points right now, S&amp;P 500 is down 9, and  the NASDAQ down 40 points, that's two-thirds of one percent, lower, that  after a powerful rally yesterday.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, gave the economy a thumbs up,  yesterday, in his 12:00 p.m. speech, it sent the market, shooting higher.   The Dow, in fact, erasing the November decline, finishing higher on the  session, by better than 600 points.  Now, the Dow is in positive territory  for 2018, with that huge rally of better than 2-1/2 percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we are not -- we are seeing some follow through  there, in European indices, up 43 points, the CAC Quarante up 30 points  right now, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 30 points, that's about a  quarter percent higher, right now.</p><p>Markets were mixed, overnight, in Asia, meanwhile, Japan did well up a  third of a percent, but the Hang Seng and the Shanghai, under pressure,  overnight.</p><p>Trade troubles hitting the automakers, Volvo is cancelling its IPO.  It is  announcing a cutback and hiring plans, as well, all over increased tariffs  from China.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting out that downsizing at General Motors  may justify new tariffs.  We'll tell you what the President has to say  about that, as we break it all down.</p><p>Then, this, giving it away, Patagonia, deciding not to give its millions of  dollars in tax cut savings, back to employees, why, we will tell you where  they decided to send that money.</p><p>Then, honoring a hero, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald,  pays tribute to the late senator John McCain, with a special pair of  cleats, the details, coming up.</p><p>And it is a Taco Bell Christmas.  The fast food chain celebrates its own  line of holiday clothing based on sauce packets, yes, we will tell you  about that, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  tensions are simmering, President Trump headed to Buenos Aires for the G20  summit, this morning, where he is expected to sit down with the President  of China, Xi Jinping, for a crucial dinner, discussing the potential of a  trade truce.</p><p>The administration floating the idea that a deal can be achieved, but also  additional tariffs should the two companies not strike an agreement,  joining me right now, is the Former Undersecretary of State for Economic  Growth, Energy and the Environment, Bob Hormats, Bob, it's good to see you  this morning.</p><p>BOB HORMATS, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE:  Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  What could come out of this  meeting, in Argentina?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, hopefully, some kind of deal that's sufficient to stop the  escalation in tariffs, which are harmful to China, but also harmful to the  U.S., a lot of American companies are uncomfortable with this trade war  with China, and the fact that it could get worse.</p><p>The probability, though, is that they are not going to have a breakthrough,  because to have a breakthrough, a lot of work needs to be done, there has  to be agreement on principles, neither of those have occurred at this  point, so the best they can do is develop a process for moving forward with  some broad outlines of objectives that both leaders support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of these -- one of the reasons for these tariffs against  China, the President says, is because of China's behavior, the fact that it  is stealing intellectual property.  It is forcing the transfer of  technology.</p><p>It is not opening its markets to foreign companies the way the rest of the  world would like.  And yet, there is another impact of these tariffs, look  at the toll on automakers, as you mentioned.  Volvo is slowing down hiring  in its new assembly plans in Charleston, South Carolina, we learned, this  morning.</p><p>It's citing the increased tariffs from the trade fight with China.  The  company also said it's calling off plans for an IPO, potentially where $30  billion as result of this dispute, follows General Motors plans to cut  14,000 jobs, shut down 5 U.S. factories next year.  The President is now  saying that G.M. closures may actually justify the auto tariffs.</p><p>So, how much longer can this go and how damaging will this be, do you  think, to companies that are getting, sort of, caught up in this fight?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, it's going to be even more damaging if the President  follows through and at the end of year, early next year, raises the tariffs  from 10 percent to 25 percent, and adds a whole new swaff of items to the  tariff list.</p><p>And the reason is, it does certainly hurt China, but it does hurt us  because of the interdependence and relationship.  We get a lot of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do, Bob?  I mean, you know the  issues about the -- about the intellectual property.</p><p>HORMATS:  Yes, I spent 10 days in China intellectual property, when I was  in government, intellectual property issues, questions of partnership,  subsidies, they all come up.  There have been negotiations on them.</p><p>I think what's needed is, for the two presidents to agree that if they are  going to move ahead in this relationship, they've got to take a much more  determined view to get changes that are acceptable and level the playing  field between foreign companies and Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  or could this --</p><p>HORMATS:  I think the Chinese understand something has to be done.  I just  think that the tariff escalation is probably so harmful to both sides that  it's unlikely to be the way of getting real progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you say, the Chinese understand something needs to be done.   What does that mean, though, I mean, we're talking about dictator for life,  in President Xi?</p><p>HORMATS:  I give you one example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HORMATS:  I gave keynote speech at the Shenzhen Technology (INAUDIBLE)  high-tech products from China and all around the world.</p><p>Even the foreign companies that represented there, said the Chinese are  developing intellectual property of their own, innovative stuff of -- on  many levels in China, so they -- their entrepreneurs now have an interest  in protecting their intellectual property, just as, of course, our  companies do.</p><p>So, I think there's a greater chance now of getting some agreement on  intellectual property protection that there might not have been five years  ago when the Chinese were not developing their own intellectual property.   That's an area where, I think, they're (INAUDIBLE) overlap some  convergence, also subsidies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very good point.</p><p>HORMATS:  The Chinese are trying to cut back on subsidies.  Their big  spending -- even though the reserves are substantial, their spending is  substantial, as well.  I think reducing subsidies in their interest and, of  course, in the interest of avoiding unfair competition, would be something  they might decide that they can do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, there's some room here.  There's room for upside potential  at this meeting, isn't there?</p><p>HORMATS:  There is.  And I think that it's not that if they're going to  have a breakthrough in either or these or other items.  But if they  establish a process, whereby the leaders ask for their experts to sit  together and work for, say, six months and report back to them, on two or  three or four items, it won't be a whole list of the kind United States has  proposed to try.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  But two or three items of particular significance that might be  the way out of it and avoid further escalation of tariffs, which as you  correctly point out, is going to be harmful, just because these economies  are so interdependent.</p><p>And one point for Americans to bear in mind, most of the tariffs we've  imposed so far, are intermediate goods, products that are components for  American companies, which squeezes American companies to the next realm, if  their new items added.  They'll be on consumer goods, like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the iPhone.</p><p>HORMATS:  Exactly.  And those -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why, Apple has been trading down.</p><p>HORMATS:  Exactly, they're 10 percent or 25 percent that virtually goes  right to the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's a potential, I think, I hear you saying, of a big  rally, if we get any upside potential out of this, maybe markets get a  relief rally -- </p><p>HORMATS:  I think they will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  if we see something -- </p><p>HORMATS:  For two reasons, one, they'll make progress or hopefully make  progress on certain subsidy issues or other issues.  And second, if it  works or if it's the right kind of deal, can avoid further escalation, so  both would be market movers on the positive side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to note that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,  Mohammed bin Salman, MBS, also arriving in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit,  amid the outrage, over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  I want to get your  take on how he is going to be treated.  I recently spoke with Prince Al- Waleed bin Talal, about this incident, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A month ago, a brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, where his body  was dismembered, is Mohammed bin Salman for real, or is he lying to us  about this modernization plan?</p><p>PRINCE AL-WALEED BIN TALAL, MEMBER OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY:  As for the  Jamal Khashoggi incident, you know, you have to understand, Jamal was not  only my friend.  He was working with me.  And his last job in Saudi Arabia,  it was me and then Arab Channel.</p><p>And I like to give through you my condolences, again, to his family, to his  wife, ex-wife, and to his children, and to his family, because Jamal was a  reformer, he was in no position at all and what took place in that Saudi  consulate was clearly horrific, despicable and tragic and I believe that  Saudi Arabia is going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>But please, you have to give us some time until the investigation is done  and made public by the government of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, Bob, it's hard to know if Prince Al-Waleed was  talking the party lines for Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince,  trying to give back in his good graces.  We know that Al-Waleed was jailed  by MBS, and then he came out, or if, in fact, he is being honest in terms  of saying, well, let's see what the investigation shows.</p><p>Your reaction to the Crown Prince's attendance and what the U.S. should do  now in terms of its relationship with the Saudis?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, I think the problem the U.S. and other countries have is,  first of all, they're appalled at what happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we all are.</p><p>HORMATS:  There's no question about that, and for good reason.  The second  question, though, is they, a lot of these countries need Saudi oil, we  don't really depend so much on Saudi oil, a lot of the other countries in  the G20, do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  Third, they have opportunities to sell more things to Saudi  Arabia, so their abhorrence at this event, is tempered by the fact that  they have real economic interest, and the fact is that some of them also,  want to work with the Saudis for strategic reasons in the gulf.  So, they  have to work this balance -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, but we know that Iran --</p><p>HORMATS:  that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Iran is the problem.  The Saudis have been a partner of the  United States not just for oil but against Iran, so can the U.S. walk away?</p><p>HORMATS:  U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS:  U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was what I was getting at.  But you mentioned oil.  Take a  look at crowd oil now, below $50.00 yesterday, sitting right at $50.00,  we're back below $50.00 this morning, first time in over a year, Bob, that  we're seeing below $5.000, ahead of this OPEC meeting, which is happening  next week.</p><p>Is this telling us something about the global economy, that things have  weakened, is that why oil is selling off or is this more about oversupply?   What do you think?</p><p>HORMATS:  It's both.  It's a weakening of the global economy, not a  dramatic one, but a moderate one.  And it's also a supply factor, and that  goes to another Saudi point.  Again, as much as we're appalled by what  happened, the Saudis are the key members of OPEC.</p><p>So, if there's going to be a tightening of production, it's going to have  to be led by Saudi Arabia.  They have the most excess capacity and  therefore, they would have to reduce output to help push prices up, if  that's the objective of oil producers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you expect that to happen?</p><p>HORMATS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think oil -- I mean, what's your take on oil?  If  it goes much lower than this, you're going to have a problem with the Shell  producers, as well, aren't you?</p><p>HORMATS:  Well, see, this is the other part where the Saudis have had two  objectives here.  They don't want the price of oil to fall too much because  they depend on it.  On the other hand, a couple of years ago, the Saudis  had a view, if they keep the prices down, because some of these Shell  producers, in the U.S., and also (INAUDIBLE) have a lot of leverage. </p><p>They will push some of them out of the market or force them to cut back on  productions.  So, again, Saudi strategy plays a key role in that, as well,  even though we're not so dependent on their oil.  It's a global price and  they have the biggest impact of anyone on that global price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, do you think with the slowdown on the horizon,  economic slowdown, the Fed, obviously, yesterday, talked about how great  things are going, but markets have been worried.</p><p>HORMATS:  I think the slowdown is modest, I don't think it's a plunge.  I  do think escalation of a trade war does slow the world economy down, not  just for the United States and China, but a lot of other countries depend,  for instance, in East Asia -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  on sales to China, if their economy slows, and it's slowing for  other reasons, a bit, not a lot.  But trade war would make it a lot slower.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has a big impact.</p><p>HORMATS:  And Asia gets impacted and that affects their finances because  they have a lot of debt, so they have to earn money to pay off their debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm feeling coupled, coupling, remember that?</p><p>HORMATS:  There is coupling.  It's an interdependent world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS:  Once you do one thing, it affects a lot of other things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HORMATS:  And sometimes, people don't think through the secondary effects.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is great to see you this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>HORMATS:  Pleasure to be with you, Maria, as always.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Always a pleasure to get your insights, Bob Hormats.  Tune in  tomorrow on FOX Business, Liz Claman will be in Argentina.  She's anchoring  Countdown to the Closing Bell, live, from the G20 summit, in Argentina.   She will be in Buenos Aires, beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, tomorrow, so  join Liz for her special coverage.</p><p>But first, President Trump just tweeted this, he wants to talk about G.M.   He says, General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other  companies are doing.  Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over  the country.  Auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including BMW,  which just announced a major new plant.  The USA is booming, writes the  President, this morning.</p><p>We will take a short break.  When we come back, running with the heroes,  the Cardinals, Larry Fitzgerald's touching tribute to Pat Tillman and John  McCain, showing up on his cleats, we'll tell you more about that, coming  up.</p><p>And then, a spicy Christmas, that's for sure, Taco Bell rolls out a holiday  apparel line, featuring sweaters, blankets, even onesies, back in a minute</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As you saw, markets are pulling back this  morning after that 600-plus-point rally yesterday.  We are expecting a  lower opening this morning for the broader averages.  Stormy Daniels  calling out her attorney, Michael Avenatti.  Cheryl Casone with this story  and headlines, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  In an interview with The Daily Beast,  Daniels claims that Avenatti filed a defamation lawsuit against President  Trump without her permission.  Last month, the federal judge threw out that  lawsuit and ordered Daniels to pay Trump's legal fees, which are estimated  to be $350,000.  Daniels also said she had no idea Avenatti started a  second crowd-funding site for her legal expenses.  Avenatti says, he's  always been with Daniels and says he started the fund-raising to cover his  legal fees.  Because most of the money so far has gone to her security.  </p><p>Well, outdoor gear company, Patagonia, donating the $1o million it saved  from President Trump's tax cuts to non-profit environmental groups.   Patagonia says, the donation is an addition to one percent of sales it  gives to environmental groups every year.  The new GOP tax law cut  corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, you may remember.   Patagonia CEO called Trump's tax cuts \"irresponsible\" for taking away from  environmental services.  </p><p>Well, Taco Bell waste no time getting into the Christmas spirit.  The  company rolling out festive sweaters, they've also got blankets.  Take a  look at all of these onesies that look like Taco Bell hot sauce packets,  because who doesn't need that?  But the clothing and other gifts don't come  as cheap as Taco Bell food.  Sweaters are $59.00 each.  The onesie, Maria,  $78.00.  Shares of Taco Bell's parent, Yum! Brands, up nine percent so far  this year.  I dare somebody on the panel to wear that one day on  television.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, somebody with six kids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MURPHY:  I'm in.  Set me up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need the onesie --</p><p>MURPHY:  I'm on for the onesie.  I don't know if $78.00 is actually  expensive for a onesie or if that's -- I don't know about the onesie mark.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not cheap.  You need the onesie to hide -- that you're fat  from eating at Taco Bell all the time.  And I say that from personal  experience, Nachos BellGrande every day and I was at least 40 pounds  heavier than I am right now.  So, there you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nacho Grande every day?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nacho -- yes, Nachos BellGrande and a beer, that was college.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE).  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come  back, a hero's honor; the Cardinal's Larry Fitzgerald pays tribute to Pat  Tillman and John McCain with some eye-catching cleats next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Here's a change, NFL ratings are up; Jared Max,  why are ratings turning around here?  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Maybe, Maria, good  morning, it's record scoring, more legalized gambling.  You know, some  betters will say, I'm only interested to watch if I have action on the  game.  Oh, and have you noticed, we have not been talking about players  kneeling for the national anthem, maybe some who were turned away are  coming back.  </p><p>Let's take a look at the numbers -- keep in mind, this is strictly Nielsen  T.V. rating not streaming.  Average audience for games this season at 15.8  million, five percent higher than last year's average, but still noticeably  behind 2016 and 2015.  Expect good numbers tonight on Fox, 8:20 Eastern.   First place teams: Cowboys 6-5, tied with Washington to top the NFC East,  host the 10-1 Saints, New Orleans, has won 10 in a row. And what we'll  notice tonight, the Cowboys wearing the alternate white color rush  uniforms; Saints will be in all black.  Teams don't have to wear the color  rush on Thursdays as they did in the past but the Cowboys elected to do so.  </p><p>And hey, fashion goes hand-in-hand this week, week 13 of NFL, is my cause  for my cleats' week -- an initiative began by Larry Fitzgerald around 500  players set to show case their cleats for charitable foundations.  Now, the  cleats that the players are going to be wearing, Arizona Cardinals' Larry  Fitzgerald wears these to honors the late Pat Tillman, who joined the army  after 9/11, died in friendly fire in 2004.  Camouflage design, we see  Tillman's face, his foundation provides scholarships to veterans and their  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY FITZGERALD, FOOTBALL PLAYER, ARIZONA CARDINALS:  Every game day in  Arizona, we remember Pat Tillman's sacrifice, his legacy lives on through  the Pat Tillman foundation.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Larry Fitzgerald's cleats also honor his old friend, the late Senator  John McCain, you recall Fitzgerald spoke at McCain's memorial service.   Megan McCain writing on Twitter: \"This is so special -- thank you, Larry  Fitzgerald, my father would have loved this.  Thank you for your continued  love and friendship for my father and for the amazing hero, Pat Tillman.   Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very nice.  Thank you, Jared.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And we should really focus, if the NFL wants their ratings going  up, they should focus on guys like Larry Fitzgerald and things like this  that they're doing because it's an awesome story.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and look at the reaction that you get when you actually  see the guys playing football.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not focused on politics.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's the great American game and you're right, once the off-the- field stuff is not the focus, people want to watch.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MURPHY:  52-51 scores help also.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared's sports reports on Fox News 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115.   Still ahead, the A.I. mini car; Amazon's new venture into self-driving  cars, wait until you see this.  It's powered by artificial intelligence,  right here, next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

What a day yesterday. We are looking at a follow through this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone. Happy Thursday. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it Thursday, November 29th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are pulling back this morning after that huge rally yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow Industrials now down 81 points. We are following through on what led the market higher yesterday. It was a major rally on the street. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now in positive territory for this month.</p><p>Stocks rallied on the comment -- this comment from Fed Chairman Jay Powell, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the range of estimates of that level that would be neutral for the economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And with that, the markets shut up 600 points in Europe. This morning, there is some follow through.</p><p>The markets are higher across the board.</p><p>FT-100 up 45 points right now, two-thirds of one percent, CAC Quarante in Paris also up two-thirds of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany up a fraction this morning, 21 points higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances. Hong Kong and China were lower, but Japan was higher by a fraction, as was the Korean KOSPI Index.</p><p>Deutsche Bank has been raided. Prosecutors alleging that the bank helped clients create tax havens and launder money.</p><p>What it means for the already struggling bank coming up.</p><p>And a new tariff threat, President Trump warning of new charges on vehicles following the G.M. layoffs.</p><p>Plus Volvo is slowing hiring plans here in the U.S. because of those tariffs. The fallout coming up this morning.</p><p>Honoring our heroes, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, pays tribute to Pat Tillman and Senator John McCain on his feet.</p><p>A closer look at his special cleats for Sunday's big game, that's coming up.</p><p>And it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas at Taco Bell. The fast- food giant unveiling a line of themed clothes, from socks to sweaters, even onesies.</p><p>We will tell you about it. All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO/Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: Good morning. I'll wear the onesie on T.V.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Taco Bell clothing --</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- here we come. Big move yesterday in the markets, huh?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: It is a big move, and the oil dipping blow, 50 bucks a barrel, suggests the argument Mr. Powell was making has been bolstered this moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure has. And yesterday, I was -- I was at The New York Economic Club --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- and everyone was waiting, will Jay Powell make comments about the interest rate story.</p><p>He did a lot about financial stability --</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. .</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in his speech. It wasn't until he said, \"Look, we're still at low levels,\" which we all knew and yet the market saw that as a reason to run up, Mike.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think, really, the main thing that they got was six week ago, he said that, \"We're nowhere near neutral on rates.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: A long way.</p><p>FREEMAN: Which is why there was a long --</p><p>MCDOWELL: A long way was --</p><p>FREEMAN: Sorry, a long way.</p><p>And now he's saying we're a lot closes to that, which implies there'll be less rate hikes, which the market likes, that's why he saw the rally yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that was the change in --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That one word usually tells it, right?</p><p>FREEMAN: I've --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page --</p><p>FREEMAN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- James Freeman, where you work, don't know if you had your hands in this, says that this is a welcome rethink.</p><p>But as \"The Journal\" does point out that we have a market, a global market, and a world that is grappling with global slowing growth, bad trade policy that's deterring investment, and a fed that is also still gradually reducing this unprecedented bond portfolio.</p><p>And we have no way of knowing what the knock-on effects of that are or will be, so this is a very welcome, at least, reasonable approach to hiking short-term interest rates.</p><p>I paraphrase.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thank you. And just the editorial also adds those Vice Chairman -- Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida comments from earlier in the week saying the fact that you've got a lot of people working doesn't automatically lead to inflation.</p><p>That's a -- that's a welcome sign from the fed.</p><p>Personally, I kind of like going a bit higher. I don't think the fed funds rate ought to be equal to the rate of inflation.</p><p>But again, this oil news this morning, if you want to be dovish, if you want to say inflation is very restrained, you have a better case today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you sure do. We're going to check markets this morning.</p><p>Take a look at oil, sitting right at $50.00 a barrel right now, what a selloff in the last month and a half.</p><p>Then another half a percent this morning with light sweet crude at $50.02 a barrel.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is the Chairman of UBS, Axel Weber is with us this morning in an exclusive interview talking about markets and investing capital today.</p><p>The CEO of Calamos Investments, John Koudounis, is joining us as well.</p><p>Almost looking at the backdrop for stocks.</p><p>Patron Spirits Founder, John Paul Mitchell Co-Founder, John Paul DeJoria is here as well.</p><p>Along with Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Subcommittee Chairman, Sean Duffy.</p><p>Plus Tennessee Senator Elect, Marsha Blackburn with us.</p><p>A lot to talk about with the Senator Elect, so stay with us. We got a big three hours coming up.</p><p>We kick it off right here with this top story, and that is the stock market comeback. Check out these numbers, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ surged yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell's comments on interest rates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL: Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the range of estimates of that level that would be neutral for the economy.</p><p>That is neither speeding up nor slowing up growth.</p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private sector economists are forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation remaining near two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is TIGER 21 Chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt.</p><p>Michael, it is good to see you. Thank so much for joining us.</p><p>MICHAEL SONNENFELDT, CHAIRMAN, TIGER 21: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How's the sentiment in terms of your members?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: I -- our members are trying to have the discipline that when the market went down 600, they didn't overreact and when it goes up 600, but clearly interest rates and tariffs are the story of the day.</p><p>Are the tariffs really hurting the economy and what's going to happen with the exploding deficit and will we get some infrastructure? These are the bigger stories they are dealing with across the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they impacting things, the tariffs right now?</p><p>I mean look we've news this morning in terms of companies making moves in the auto sector as a result of these tariffs.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. There's no question that auto, for sure, particularly with the news around G.M. and what's going on, tariffs are having a huge impact on the auto industry.</p><p>We have members in our Detroit group who are clearly worried because with the closings of G.M. that has an impact, real estate prices are probably still too high.</p><p>That group is waiting for prices to come down and they've taken some real estate off the table in the last quarter.</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm trying to get a sense of how you think your members, investors generally might react to any news we get out of this weekend's G20 meeting.</p><p>Obviously both the U.S. and the Chinese side have kind of downplayed hopes for a solution to the trade dispute, but what if at the dinner Xi Jinping and Donald Trump solve it?</p><p>What if we have an agreement or maybe a framework to get to an agreement?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Sure. So I would say that that would be a very important news, but when our members meet in groups every month, there are a load of struggling like what's the really important news and what's going to happen.</p><p>And they try to have a All-Weather portfolio, so when I was talking to a member recently, he was saying -- it was an interesting thing, he's shorting hundred-year bonds.</p><p>Why? Because if interest rates come up a little, those bonds are going to be a great stabilizer as they fall.</p><p>The Australian markets way overheated, American real estate somewhat overheated sector by sector, so our members in the last quarter took -- last two quarters have taken about 10 percent of their holdings off of the table.</p><p>MURPHY: So when you talk to your members, I'm kind of talking my own book here because we invest venture capital private equity.</p><p>So much focus on unicorns right now in the market. How do your members see that and do they want to be involved in the private space?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Totally. The largest shift over the last decade in our membership is private equity, grown from 10 percent to 24, all-time high.</p><p>So as real estate is coming down, all-time high to private equity now exceeding even public equity 23 percent, private equity 24 percent.</p><p>Why? Because in venture and in private, you have these scalable businesses given our technology, that's where the action is, not as passive investors.</p><p>Our members were the great entrepreneurs who built businesses, so when they sell their business, what they can do is invest in another business where they can be on the board or they can actually kick the tires and understand really what's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does that tell you anything about where we are in terms of growth, this optimism about the unicorns?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: So what it tells you is when you see real estate coming down so quickly, that's the biggest sign that those markets are frothy.</p><p>But in total, our members are allocated over 73 percent of public equity, private equity in real estate, that's a pretty long-term bullish referendum on the U.S. economy.</p><p>So, I would say long-term optimism about the U.S., short-term, we're in choppy waters, but still sailing still fine.</p><p>MURPHY: And I would assume that they're the type A personalities that, like you said, have built things so they want more control.</p><p>So being able to invest private and have a little control from a board level or whatever it may be.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Absolutely. And if you compare it to, say, the public equities today, take Apple, or G.M., or Facebook, these are big stories, but our members have learned that they can't mark -- they can't time the market</p><p>So, if they overreact to any one of those stocks one way or another, history is very clear, they can't time the market. They're better off with an index fund or a long-term holding.</p><p>Even taking Apple, which is in bear market territory today, still up for the year.</p><p>So, if you're a long-term holder, if you're a 10-year holder, you're still in holding position.</p><p>FREEMAN: The -- wanted to ask you, you mentioned Australia being overheated. Fed Chairman Jay Powell yesterday said --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was funny.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- they had 27 straight years of growth.</p><p>If you get 27 straight years of growth, you probably ought to have a sky- high valuation, right?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: It's a little geriatric in the -- in the cycle right there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was a funny comment about Australia.</p><p>When you look at tech, you mentioned tech stocks. Microsoft briefly overtaking Apple --</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- as the world's most valuable company yesterday as Apple faces pressure on the slumping iPhone demand.</p><p>In terms of this volatility in technology, I know they're not trying to time the market, how much are they invested within tech versus elsewhere within equities?</p><p>SONNENFELDT: So within the public equity exposure, the growth is in index funds to avoid just this problem, but the largest concentration of specific stocks is all the FAANGs.</p><p>And then now you get the turbulent waters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and -- or Alphabet.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Exactly. And now NVIDIA seems to have come into the four.</p><p>But who talked about Microsoft? All of a sudden, Microsoft came back after being so moribund.</p><p>And then you have to look at the specifics, the problems Facebook is having, members are concerned about that.</p><p>And Apple, although Apple is rock solid in its balance sheet, you have the tariff issue that could have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to point out, though, that investors, if they watched MORNINGS WITH MARIA and Maria Bartiromo every day, they would know about the success of Microsoft and what was going on at that company for years --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- literally. Your interview with Satya Nadella, your coverage of Microsoft before that, but also what was going on with Apple and your interview with Dan Niles --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- well ahead of the selloff in Apple, so you name it, again, because of the people that you interview on this program, we're giving a very big window into what these companies are doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And when Dan joined us, when I spoke with him from San Francisco, you know, Apple was in this bull market, you know, moment and he was skeptical.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it was -- he -- his skepticism was born out of the inventory problem.</p><p>He said inventories were up 89 percent year over year in the second quarter, and looking at an economy that is poised to slow down, who is going to buy a thousand dollar phone particularly in China?</p><p>And he was right, and Apple has sold-off since he said it, and I -- and I think Dan Niles is one of the smartest guys within technology, because he does the backdrop analysis.</p><p>He's looking for real, specific reasons of why these stocks are moving.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: We see it through a different lens. Our members in Detroit are seeing what's happening in the auto industry firsthand. Our members in Seattle see this tension between Apple and what's happening with Amazon in Seattle and what's happening in Microsoft.</p><p>So, when you're on the ground and you're an active investor, you can get the same kind of -- same kind of lead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. I just want to point out, like, the administration gave a bit of a bailout, a handout to farmers hurt by the retaliatory tariffs from china, which we saw in the GDP report yesterday.</p><p>So, how long does it take for these automakers to come calling and say \"Where is our handout?\" Because the President is threatening -- well, import tariffs on small cars, but threatening to take away at least the subsidies on General Motors.</p><p>Which, by the way, started going away shortly.</p><p>MURPHY: They got their handouts, didn't they? The automakers?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, ten years ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But --</p><p>MURPHY: Well, that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ford did -- Ford did --</p><p>MURPHY: -- $7,500 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They got a bailout. They got a bailout.</p><p>MURPHY: -- vehicle credit for electric cars. They want to keep going.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they want that $7,500-, that was what I said yesterday, the 7,500-dollar tax credit that you get for buying electric vehicles makes certainly the Chevy Bolt more attractive.</p><p>They want an extension, their tax - that tax break for G.M. expires shortly because they've hit that 200,000 vehicle threshold, so we can talk about the tariffs.</p><p>But again, these things are hard to quantify. Until they start showing up in layoffs of almost 15,000 individuals --</p><p>MURPHY: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- it's hard to know what the real impact is of how businesses make decisions about future investment.</p><p>FREEMAN: But when you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what you're saying is it's a slippery slope. Farmers want help, maybe the autos will want it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe somebody else will want it, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Have you seen though the other --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Anybody had -- how about pipeline builders?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're all -- anybody who uses steel and aluminum in this country.</p><p>And I pointed out yesterday when the President was tweeting about more tariffs on small car imports, I just said, you know, anybody who says that the President wants zero tariffs are non, my -- I'll follow him on Twitter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. Yes.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: You know, the only thing I want to say it's true, it's a slippery slope.</p><p>Our members are fervent capitalist, but we wouldn't have an Internet without government investment.</p><p>We wouldn't have a space program without government.</p><p>So, there are critical industries that private industry doesn't support.</p><p>We can debate it, but the facts are we got an Internet, we have a space program, and we have some alternative energy project and they all got paid back to the Energy Department.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's --</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Notwithstanding Solyndra.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, treasury loss, $11.2 billion on the -- just the General Motors bailout.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that didn't get paid back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Not much happened on the Internet before they commercialized it.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michael, it's great to get your insights this morning.</p><p>SONNENFELDT: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>Michael Sonnenfeldt joining us there, TIGER 21.</p><p>Coming up, breaking overnight, officials have raided Deutsche Bank's headquarters in connection with a money laundering probe.</p><p>Details coming up right there.</p><p>And then the honor run, one Cardinals player is paying tribute to American heroes like Pat Tillman and John McCain by putting them on his cleats.</p><p>Back in a minute with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning, new legal trouble for Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details now. Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>Several offices, including Deutsche Bank's Headquarters being searched by authorities as part of a money laundering probe.</p><p>Roughly a hundred and seventy. That is a lot of prosecutors, police officers, and tax inspectors are involved in the search of six offices in and around Frankfurt.</p><p>So, that suggest the significance of this.</p><p>German prosecutors allege that two employees, who still work at the bank, helped clients create offshore accounts and then transfer funds from those illegal activities.</p><p>All this investigation was sparked by \"The Panama Papers,\" that was a massive, massive document leak of millions of pages.</p><p>Back in 2016, it detailed how wealthy people use tax havens to shield their money.</p><p>Authorities also claim that Deutsche Bank failed to report the suspicious accounts, could be used to launder money.</p><p>Deutsche Bank says it's fully cooperating with this investigation.</p><p>The stock is down almost five percent ahead of this. If you look at the year-to-date chart, it is down almost 50 percent.</p><p>So the stock is the Wells Fargo to Germany.</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh.</p><p>SIMONETTI: The Wells Fargo to America, that's its significance in a sense in Germany. It was such an icon.</p><p>And it's had so many troubles between everything that happened in the financial crisis and the $18 billion in fines and legal fees that they paid, and now these latest allegations.</p><p>And on top of all of this, where's the profit? They're' paying bonuses, they've increased their bonuses, in fact, to many of their workers, it's a -- it's a mess.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: James, what do you think about this?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think investors, as you said, have had this question about, what is their business model? This has been kind of the most troubled of the giant banks in a lot of ways lately.</p><p>But, obviously, it deserves the presumption of innocence, but investors hoping this is not the business model, but disturbing news certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look how the stock has fallen. Is this a takeover candidate at this point, Mike?</p><p>MURPHY: No. This is something that they've -- for the last 10 years, they've been defending themselves from one scandal after the next, and what's breaking this morning.</p><p>I don't know that anyone expected this, but they've never been able to right the ship, so to speak, since the financial crisis, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MURPHY: -- I don't know where it ends for Deutsche Bank, because there are so many other great stories out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess it's hard to believe that Germany would allow somebody else, a foreigner to acquire Deutsche Bank.</p><p>MURPHY: Oh, for sure. I mean -- and I mean that and I don't know why a foreigner would want to -- because by buying Deutsche Bank, you're buying all the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The problems.</p><p>MURPHY: -- potential issues that are there as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Regulators are breathing down their back right now, especially with these money laundering allegations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll watch that.</p><p>Obviously, it's going to be a busy day.</p><p>The stock is down about five percent right now. And Deutsche Bank, we're watching that.</p><p>Let's take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, Facebook and the data problem. New court document show that the social media giant considered selling user data.</p><p>That's the fallout, and we will tell you about it.</p><p>Then 'tis the season to be saucy, Taco Bell rolls out their brand new Christmas apparel line based on their hot sauce packets, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Facebook under fire, internal emails show that the social media giant considered doing something it said it never would.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It's pretty fascinating, Maria.</p><p>These emails that were seized by British lawmakers suggest that Facebook once considered selling users data even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised not to do that.</p><p>According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the emails also indicate Facebook employees discussed pushing some advertisers to spend more in return for increased access to users' information.</p><p>At a congressional hearing back in April, Zuckerberg said that he opposed selling that data. Take a look at shares of Facebook, they're lower in the premarket.</p><p>Maria, of course, can have more on this and reining in big tech when she interviews Tennessee's incoming Senator, Marsha Blackburn, that's going to be in the 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time hour.</p><p>Well, there is a change coming at the top of Unilever, the maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's Mayonnaise.</p><p>Alan Jope, who is currently the President of the company's beauty and personal care division is going to take over for Paul Polman, who's going to step down January 1st.</p><p>Polman did lead Unilever for 10 years. Unilever, of course, is working to adjust the changes and consumer takes.</p><p>Shares of Unilever, little changed in the premarket.</p><p>Well, Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi have reaffirmed their commitment to their alliance.</p><p>The companies issued a joint statement, saying they remain fully committed to that three-way deal.</p><p>The alliance sold more than ten million vehicles last year.</p><p>But, of course, Nissan and Mitsubishi did out Carlos Ghosn as their Chairman for alleged financial misconduct.</p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\" says that Nissan's investigation also has revealed $80 million in deferred pay forgone.</p><p>Share of Nissan, Maria, down 14 percent so far this year.</p><p>Lot to discuss in that story, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there's a lot to discuss because we continue to see Carlos Ghosn sitting in a jail in Tokyo and - or in -- outside of Tokyo, and we still don't have any official charges from the --from the Tokyo government, from the Japanese government.</p><p>I don't understand this. I mean I questioned this on Twitter the other day, James, because what kind of a judicial system throws you in detention and then they decide what to charge you with.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. And I think a lot of people looking at this are a little bit shocked, because, again, this is not Communist China, this is Japan, this is a modern industrialized democracy.</p><p>And yet as you said, thrown in jail, not able to consult with a lawyer before getting interrogated --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- not being able to have your lawyer present getting interrogated.</p><p>And this is a guy who achieved a lot of great results for that company. And we're not getting --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He was icon in Japan at one point.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. So we're now -- and, you know, he -- we'll see. Maybe they've really got the goods on them, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. We'll see. But --</p><p>FREEMAN: -- is this just a question of deferred compensation and whether it was -- whether it was adequately disclosed or not -- I --</p><p>MURPHY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or is this political? We know that within the Nissan ranks, they were upset that they were about to be either acquired or merged with in this alliance with a French company, Renault, that was much weaker than Nissan.</p><p>Now Nissan's the larger company, the more successful.</p><p>So there was this movement going on, Mike, within Nissan to take him down.</p><p>MURPHY: For sure. And you just hope that this isn't just some political or go after one person, because it just -- it's like a scene from a movie right now.</p><p>But if he's guilty, he should be charged. And if not, she should be let go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And don't forget about Greg Kelly, the number two guy.</p><p>His number two is also in jail. He's an American citizen, these are the only two people that are in jail for this deferred compensation problem.</p><p>Where was the CFO as \"The Journal\" wrote about earlier this week, where was the board?</p><p>So I just have a big problem with what they have done to Carlos Ghosn, because I'm not -- I'm not buying it, I don't see the charges coming out of the government there.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And what about there -- what is the U.S. government doing about the American Citizen that's being held under a standard that would -- is -- would not see light of day here in the United States in terms of being essentially to what you said in terms of the judicial system in Japan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Put in jail and then the charges are being weighed as he sits in a -- in a jail cell.</p><p>We'll keep watching that.</p><p>Coming up, the tariff effect, it is real.</p><p>Volvo has canceled their multibillion dollar IPO and it is slowing hiring at American plants, we will take a look at the fallout there.</p><p>And giving away, Patagonia is using money from President Trump's tax savings plan, but it is not going to their employees, we will tell you where it is going coming up, back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, November 29th, your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures showing the markets will pull back, this morning, at the opening of trading. Dow Industrials down 72 points right now, S&amp;P 500 is down 9, and the NASDAQ down 40 points, that's two-thirds of one percent, lower, that after a powerful rally yesterday.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, gave the economy a thumbs up, yesterday, in his 12:00 p.m. speech, it sent the market, shooting higher. The Dow, in fact, erasing the November decline, finishing higher on the session, by better than 600 points. Now, the Dow is in positive territory for 2018, with that huge rally of better than 2-1/2 percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we are not -- we are seeing some follow through there, in European indices, up 43 points, the CAC Quarante up 30 points right now, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 30 points, that's about a quarter percent higher, right now.</p><p>Markets were mixed, overnight, in Asia, meanwhile, Japan did well up a third of a percent, but the Hang Seng and the Shanghai, under pressure, overnight.</p><p>Trade troubles hitting the automakers, Volvo is cancelling its IPO. It is announcing a cutback and hiring plans, as well, all over increased tariffs from China.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting out that downsizing at General Motors may justify new tariffs. We'll tell you what the President has to say about that, as we break it all down.</p><p>Then, this, giving it away, Patagonia, deciding not to give its millions of dollars in tax cut savings, back to employees, why, we will tell you where they decided to send that money.</p><p>Then, honoring a hero, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, pays tribute to the late senator John McCain, with a special pair of cleats, the details, coming up.</p><p>And it is a Taco Bell Christmas. The fast food chain celebrates its own line of holiday clothing based on sauce packets, yes, we will tell you about that, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour, tensions are simmering, President Trump headed to Buenos Aires for the G20 summit, this morning, where he is expected to sit down with the President of China, Xi Jinping, for a crucial dinner, discussing the potential of a trade truce.</p><p>The administration floating the idea that a deal can be achieved, but also additional tariffs should the two companies not strike an agreement, joining me right now, is the Former Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Bob Hormats, Bob, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>BOB HORMATS, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE: Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. What could come out of this meeting, in Argentina?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, hopefully, some kind of deal that's sufficient to stop the escalation in tariffs, which are harmful to China, but also harmful to the U.S., a lot of American companies are uncomfortable with this trade war with China, and the fact that it could get worse.</p><p>The probability, though, is that they are not going to have a breakthrough, because to have a breakthrough, a lot of work needs to be done, there has to be agreement on principles, neither of those have occurred at this point, so the best they can do is develop a process for moving forward with some broad outlines of objectives that both leaders support.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One of these -- one of the reasons for these tariffs against China, the President says, is because of China's behavior, the fact that it is stealing intellectual property. It is forcing the transfer of technology.</p><p>It is not opening its markets to foreign companies the way the rest of the world would like. And yet, there is another impact of these tariffs, look at the toll on automakers, as you mentioned. Volvo is slowing down hiring in its new assembly plans in Charleston, South Carolina, we learned, this morning.</p><p>It's citing the increased tariffs from the trade fight with China. The company also said it's calling off plans for an IPO, potentially where $30 billion as result of this dispute, follows General Motors plans to cut 14,000 jobs, shut down 5 U.S. factories next year. The President is now saying that G.M. closures may actually justify the auto tariffs.</p><p>So, how much longer can this go and how damaging will this be, do you think, to companies that are getting, sort of, caught up in this fight?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, it's going to be even more damaging if the President follows through and at the end of year, early next year, raises the tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent, and adds a whole new swaff of items to the tariff list.</p><p>And the reason is, it does certainly hurt China, but it does hurt us because of the interdependence and relationship. We get a lot of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what should the President do, Bob? I mean, you know the issues about the -- about the intellectual property.</p><p>HORMATS: Yes, I spent 10 days in China intellectual property, when I was in government, intellectual property issues, questions of partnership, subsidies, they all come up. There have been negotiations on them.</p><p>I think what's needed is, for the two presidents to agree that if they are going to move ahead in this relationship, they've got to take a much more determined view to get changes that are acceptable and level the playing field between foreign companies and Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: or could this --</p><p>HORMATS: I think the Chinese understand something has to be done. I just think that the tariff escalation is probably so harmful to both sides that it's unlikely to be the way of getting real progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you say, the Chinese understand something needs to be done. What does that mean, though, I mean, we're talking about dictator for life, in President Xi?</p><p>HORMATS: I give you one example.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HORMATS: I gave keynote speech at the Shenzhen Technology (INAUDIBLE) high-tech products from China and all around the world.</p><p>Even the foreign companies that represented there, said the Chinese are developing intellectual property of their own, innovative stuff of -- on many levels in China, so they -- their entrepreneurs now have an interest in protecting their intellectual property, just as, of course, our companies do.</p><p>So, I think there's a greater chance now of getting some agreement on intellectual property protection that there might not have been five years ago when the Chinese were not developing their own intellectual property. That's an area where, I think, they're (INAUDIBLE) overlap some convergence, also subsidies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very good point.</p><p>HORMATS: The Chinese are trying to cut back on subsidies. Their big spending -- even though the reserves are substantial, their spending is substantial, as well. I think reducing subsidies in their interest and, of course, in the interest of avoiding unfair competition, would be something they might decide that they can do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, there's some room here. There's room for upside potential at this meeting, isn't there?</p><p>HORMATS: There is. And I think that it's not that if they're going to have a breakthrough in either or these or other items. But if they establish a process, whereby the leaders ask for their experts to sit together and work for, say, six months and report back to them, on two or three or four items, it won't be a whole list of the kind United States has proposed to try.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HORMATS: But two or three items of particular significance that might be the way out of it and avoid further escalation of tariffs, which as you correctly point out, is going to be harmful, just because these economies are so interdependent.</p><p>And one point for Americans to bear in mind, most of the tariffs we've imposed so far, are intermediate goods, products that are components for American companies, which squeezes American companies to the next realm, if their new items added. They'll be on consumer goods, like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like the iPhone.</p><p>HORMATS: Exactly. And those --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, which is why, Apple has been trading down.</p><p>HORMATS: Exactly, they're 10 percent or 25 percent that virtually goes right to the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's a potential, I think, I hear you saying, of a big rally, if we get any upside potential out of this, maybe markets get a relief rally --</p><p>HORMATS: I think they will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: if we see something --</p><p>HORMATS: For two reasons, one, they'll make progress or hopefully make progress on certain subsidy issues or other issues. And second, if it works or if it's the right kind of deal, can avoid further escalation, so both would be market movers on the positive side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting to note that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, MBS, also arriving in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit, amid the outrage, over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. I want to get your take on how he is going to be treated. I recently spoke with Prince Al- Waleed bin Talal, about this incident, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: A month ago, a brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, where his body was dismembered, is Mohammed bin Salman for real, or is he lying to us about this modernization plan?</p><p>PRINCE AL-WALEED BIN TALAL, MEMBER OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY: As for the Jamal Khashoggi incident, you know, you have to understand, Jamal was not only my friend. He was working with me. And his last job in Saudi Arabia, it was me and then Arab Channel.</p><p>And I like to give through you my condolences, again, to his family, to his wife, ex-wife, and to his children, and to his family, because Jamal was a reformer, he was in no position at all and what took place in that Saudi consulate was clearly horrific, despicable and tragic and I believe that Saudi Arabia is going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>But please, you have to give us some time until the investigation is done and made public by the government of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, Bob, it's hard to know if Prince Al-Waleed was talking the party lines for Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince, trying to give back in his good graces. We know that Al-Waleed was jailed by MBS, and then he came out, or if, in fact, he is being honest in terms of saying, well, let's see what the investigation shows.</p><p>Your reaction to the Crown Prince's attendance and what the U.S. should do now in terms of its relationship with the Saudis?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, I think the problem the U.S. and other countries have is, first of all, they're appalled at what happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we all are.</p><p>HORMATS: There's no question about that, and for good reason. The second question, though, is they, a lot of these countries need Saudi oil, we don't really depend so much on Saudi oil, a lot of the other countries in the G20, do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HORMATS: Third, they have opportunities to sell more things to Saudi Arabia, so their abhorrence at this event, is tempered by the fact that they have real economic interest, and the fact is that some of them also, want to work with the Saudis for strategic reasons in the gulf. So, they have to work this balance --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, but we know that Iran --</p><p>HORMATS: that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Iran is the problem. The Saudis have been a partner of the United States not just for oil but against Iran, so can the U.S. walk away?</p><p>HORMATS: U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS: U.S. cannot walk away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was what I was getting at. But you mentioned oil. Take a look at crowd oil now, below $50.00 yesterday, sitting right at $50.00, we're back below $50.00 this morning, first time in over a year, Bob, that we're seeing below $5.000, ahead of this OPEC meeting, which is happening next week.</p><p>Is this telling us something about the global economy, that things have weakened, is that why oil is selling off or is this more about oversupply? What do you think?</p><p>HORMATS: It's both. It's a weakening of the global economy, not a dramatic one, but a moderate one. And it's also a supply factor, and that goes to another Saudi point. Again, as much as we're appalled by what happened, the Saudis are the key members of OPEC.</p><p>So, if there's going to be a tightening of production, it's going to have to be led by Saudi Arabia. They have the most excess capacity and therefore, they would have to reduce output to help push prices up, if that's the objective of oil producers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you expect that to happen?</p><p>HORMATS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think oil -- I mean, what's your take on oil? If it goes much lower than this, you're going to have a problem with the Shell producers, as well, aren't you?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, see, this is the other part where the Saudis have had two objectives here. They don't want the price of oil to fall too much because they depend on it. On the other hand, a couple of years ago, the Saudis had a view, if they keep the prices down, because some of these Shell producers, in the U.S., and also (INAUDIBLE) have a lot of leverage.</p><p>They will push some of them out of the market or force them to cut back on productions. So, again, Saudi strategy plays a key role in that, as well, even though we're not so dependent on their oil. It's a global price and they have the biggest impact of anyone on that global price.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, do you think with the slowdown on the horizon, economic slowdown, the Fed, obviously, yesterday, talked about how great things are going, but markets have been worried.</p><p>HORMATS: I think the slowdown is modest, I don't think it's a plunge. I do think escalation of a trade war does slow the world economy down, not just for the United States and China, but a lot of other countries depend, for instance, in East Asia --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HORMATS: on sales to China, if their economy slows, and it's slowing for other reasons, a bit, not a lot. But trade war would make it a lot slower.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Has a big impact.</p><p>HORMATS: And Asia gets impacted and that affects their finances because they have a lot of debt, so they have to earn money to pay off their debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm feeling coupled, coupling, remember that?</p><p>HORMATS: There is coupling. It's an interdependent world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>HORMATS: Once you do one thing, it affects a lot of other things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HORMATS: And sometimes, people don't think through the secondary effects.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is great to see you this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>HORMATS: Pleasure to be with you, Maria, as always. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Always a pleasure to get your insights, Bob Hormats. Tune in tomorrow on FOX Business, Liz Claman will be in Argentina. She's anchoring Countdown to the Closing Bell, live, from the G20 summit, in Argentina. She will be in Buenos Aires, beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, tomorrow, so join Liz for her special coverage.</p><p>But first, President Trump just tweeted this, he wants to talk about G.M. He says, General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing. Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. Auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including BMW, which just announced a major new plant. The USA is booming, writes the President, this morning.</p><p>We will take a short break. When we come back, running with the heroes, the Cardinals, Larry Fitzgerald's touching tribute to Pat Tillman and John McCain, showing up on his cleats, we'll tell you more about that, coming up.</p><p>And then, a spicy Christmas, that's for sure, Taco Bell rolls out a holiday apparel line, featuring sweaters, blankets, even onesies, back in a minute</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. As you saw, markets are pulling back this morning after that 600-plus-point rally yesterday. We are expecting a lower opening this morning for the broader averages. Stormy Daniels calling out her attorney, Michael Avenatti. Cheryl Casone with this story and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Maria. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Daniels claims that Avenatti filed a defamation lawsuit against President Trump without her permission. Last month, the federal judge threw out that lawsuit and ordered Daniels to pay Trump's legal fees, which are estimated to be $350,000. Daniels also said she had no idea Avenatti started a second crowd-funding site for her legal expenses. Avenatti says, he's always been with Daniels and says he started the fund-raising to cover his legal fees. Because most of the money so far has gone to her security.</p><p>Well, outdoor gear company, Patagonia, donating the $1o million it saved from President Trump's tax cuts to non-profit environmental groups. Patagonia says, the donation is an addition to one percent of sales it gives to environmental groups every year. The new GOP tax law cut corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, you may remember. Patagonia CEO called Trump's tax cuts \"irresponsible\" for taking away from environmental services.</p><p>Well, Taco Bell waste no time getting into the Christmas spirit. The company rolling out festive sweaters, they've also got blankets. Take a look at all of these onesies that look like Taco Bell hot sauce packets, because who doesn't need that? But the clothing and other gifts don't come as cheap as Taco Bell food. Sweaters are $59.00 each. The onesie, Maria, $78.00. Shares of Taco Bell's parent, Yum! Brands, up nine percent so far this year. I dare somebody on the panel to wear that one day on television.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, somebody with six kids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MURPHY: I'm in. Set me up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You need the onesie --</p><p>MURPHY: I'm on for the onesie. I don't know if $78.00 is actually expensive for a onesie or if that's -- I don't know about the onesie mark.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not cheap. You need the onesie to hide -- that you're fat from eating at Taco Bell all the time. And I say that from personal experience, Nachos BellGrande every day and I was at least 40 pounds heavier than I am right now. So, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nacho Grande every day?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nacho -- yes, Nachos BellGrande and a beer, that was college.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE). All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, a hero's honor; the Cardinal's Larry Fitzgerald pays tribute to Pat Tillman and John McCain with some eye-catching cleats next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Here's a change, NFL ratings are up; Jared Max, why are ratings turning around here?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Maybe, Maria, good morning, it's record scoring, more legalized gambling. You know, some betters will say, I'm only interested to watch if I have action on the game. Oh, and have you noticed, we have not been talking about players kneeling for the national anthem, maybe some who were turned away are coming back.</p><p>Let's take a look at the numbers -- keep in mind, this is strictly Nielsen T.V. rating not streaming. Average audience for games this season at 15.8 million, five percent higher than last year's average, but still noticeably behind 2016 and 2015. Expect good numbers tonight on Fox, 8:20 Eastern. First place teams: Cowboys 6-5, tied with Washington to top the NFC East, host the 10-1 Saints, New Orleans, has won 10 in a row. And what we'll notice tonight, the Cowboys wearing the alternate white color rush uniforms; Saints will be in all black. Teams don't have to wear the color rush on Thursdays as they did in the past but the Cowboys elected to do so.</p><p>And hey, fashion goes hand-in-hand this week, week 13 of NFL, is my cause for my cleats' week -- an initiative began by Larry Fitzgerald around 500 players set to show case their cleats for charitable foundations. Now, the cleats that the players are going to be wearing, Arizona Cardinals' Larry Fitzgerald wears these to honors the late Pat Tillman, who joined the army after 9/11, died in friendly fire in 2004. Camouflage design, we see Tillman's face, his foundation provides scholarships to veterans and their families.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY FITZGERALD, FOOTBALL PLAYER, ARIZONA CARDINALS: Every game day in Arizona, we remember Pat Tillman's sacrifice, his legacy lives on through the Pat Tillman foundation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Larry Fitzgerald's cleats also honor his old friend, the late Senator John McCain, you recall Fitzgerald spoke at McCain's memorial service. Megan McCain writing on Twitter: \"This is so special -- thank you, Larry Fitzgerald, my father would have loved this. Thank you for your continued love and friendship for my father and for the amazing hero, Pat Tillman. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's very nice. Thank you, Jared.</p><p>MURPHY: And we should really focus, if the NFL wants their ratings going up, they should focus on guys like Larry Fitzgerald and things like this that they're doing because it's an awesome story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and look at the reaction that you get when you actually see the guys playing football.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And not focused on politics.</p><p>FREEMAN: It's the great American game and you're right, once the off-the- field stuff is not the focus, people want to watch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jared, thank you.</p><p>MURPHY: 52-51 scores help also.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jared's sports reports on Fox News 24/7 or Sirius Radio XM 115. Still ahead, the A.I. mini car; Amazon's new venture into self-driving cars, wait until you see this. It's powered by artificial intelligence, right here, next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

That is almost one-third less than the previous day's new cases. However, reports from outside China suggest that this may be due more to changes in China's way of counting. China's National Health Commission said last week that it would no longer count new cases as confirmed until patients started showing symptoms of the disease. China's own studies suggest that people can remain asymptomatic for up to 24 days after catching the virus.</p><p>Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq again closed at record high levels Tuesday, posting gains in six of the last seven trading sessions and having their best months since June.</p><p>The large-cap tech companies, which have been behind a lot of the recent gains, will be in focus Wednesday following the announcement of a regulatory probe into previous deals by these firms. The move raised fears over a more aggressive regulatory crackdown on big tech.</p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) is also expected to be in the spotlight after the aircraft maker reported late Tuesday that it received no new orders for commercial jets in January. By contrast, its major rival Airbus (PA:AIR) received 274 orders.</p><p>Elsewhere, the U.S. earnings season may be coming to an end, but there are still some well-known names reporting.</p><p>Shares in<br/><br/>Lyft<br/><br/>(NASDAQ:LYFT) traded over 4% lower after hours despite reporting late Tuesday more than $1 billion in quarterly revenue. However, the ride-hailing company didn't move up its estimates for making a profit, a disappointment in the light of Uber's hopes of becoming profitable at an underlying level by the end of this year.</p><p>Shares in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) slumped 25% after announcing late Tuesday that same-store sales declined in December and January. The company, whose stock is heavily shorted, said it was facing inventory challenges and issues attracting customers to its stores.</p><p>CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations. These numbers may have impressed, but investors in CVS, as well as other stocks tied to healthcare, will be keeping an eye on developments in the Democratic primaries. This is especially with respect to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won in New Hampshire on Tuesday and is running on a platform of single-payer health care.</p><p>Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports quarterly results after the bell Wednesday. The networking giant is expected to report a profit of 76 cents per share on revenue of about $12 billion, according to analysts' forecasts compiled by Investing.com.</p><p>The economic calendar is pretty bare Wednesday, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will be back on Capitol Hill for the second half of his semiannual Congressional testimony.</p><p>Powell will start speaking to the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), after testifying before the House Financial Services committee Tuesday.</p><p>Elsewhere, the oil market has pushed higher Wednesday, rebounding a touch after recent losses. The U.S. government cut its forecast for world oil demand this year by 300,000 barrels a day, due to the virus outbreak, while the latest OPEC monthly report followed suit by cutting its forecast by 230,000 barrels a day..</p><p>The Energy Information Administration will report the latest weekly figures for U.S. oil supplies at 10:30 AM (15:30 GMT). Analysts are expecting the EIA to report a rise in inventories of about 3 million barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.</p><p>Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that according to its measure crude stockpiles rose by 6 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 7.</p><p>AT 07:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $50.77 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.2% to $55.20. Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,569.85/oz while EUR/USD traded at 1.0923, up 0.1%.</p><p><br/>Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.<br/>Read more News on Investing.com and download the new Investing.com apps for Android and iOS!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOREN-167037729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOREN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y68-SVX1-F11P-X3XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399231</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fusion Media Limited Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

More than three quarters of the stocks in the S&amp;#38;P 500 were dropping, and the index was down 0.1%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. Stocks sank more in France, Germany and elsewhere after the European Union's executive arm said this year's recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic will be deeper than forecast. It also said next year's expected rebound could be weaker than expected. </p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 176 points, or 0.7%, at 26,109, and stocks in Asia also fell following the big rally that swept markets worldwide on Monday.  Big technology stocks were an outlier, though, with Microsoft, Apple and other titans pushing higher. Even though most stocks in the S&amp;#38;P 500 were lower, the tech titans' huge size gives them more sway over the index's direction, helping it momentarily erase all of its loss of 0.6% from earlier in the morning.  They also helped lift the Nasdaq composite by 0.3%, extending its record set a day earlier. The U.S. stock market has been churning over the last month, with big daily moves up and down keeping it roughly in place. It's been a small-scale version of the market's movements since the start of the year, when a nearly 34% plunge on worries about the pandemic-caused recession quickly gave way to a tremendous rally that brought the S&amp;#38;P 500 nearly back to its record level.  Pulling markets higher on one end are reports showing budding improvements in the economy. The job market, retail sales and other economic indicators are all still well below where they were before the pandemic struck. But they've stopped plummeting and have begun to grow again as governments relax restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  That's combined with unprecedented amounts of aid from central banks and governments around the world to prop up markets. It also helped send the S&amp;#38;P 500 up 1.6% on Monday, following up on a 4% rise the prior week, which itself helped cap the best decade for the index since 1998. (Ad) In a form NS 43-101, two energy sector legends have told federal regulators that they may have found one of the world's biggest lithium discoveries - a massive 7 million tons near Tonopah, Nevada, worth around $70 billion. But pulling markets lower on the other end are worries that the optimism is overdone. The pandemic isn't going away, with infection levels worsening across wide swaths of the U.S. South and West, among other global hotspots. The concern is that could keep households and businesses nervous and scare them away from spending. In the worst-case scenario, it could force governments to bring back some of the restrictions that sent the economy into its sudden recession.  Such worries spilled through markets Tuesday after the European Commission unveiled its more dour economic forecasts for 2020 and 2021.  'The road to recovery is still paved with uncertainty,' EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters in Brussels. 'This is mostly linked to the epidemiological uncertainty.' The commission said the joint economy of the 27 nations in the European Union will shrink 8.3% this year, before growing 5.8% in 2021. In the previous forecasts released in May, it had forecast the economy would contract about 7.5% this year and bounce back 6% next year. Underscoring the fragility, a separate report showed that industrial production in Germany rebounded by less than economists expected in May, and remains far below levels from before the pandemic caused factories to close. Germany's DAX lost 1.1%, while France's CAC 40 fell 0.9%. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 1.6%.  In Asia, Japan's Nikei 225 fell 0.4%, the Kospi in South Korea dropped 1.1% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 1.4%.  In the U.S. market, airlines and stocks of other companies that most need the economy to get closer to normal had the sharpest losses. United Airlines lost 6.2%, American Airlines slipped 5.8% and mall-owner Simon Property Group dropped 3.7%.  Energy stocks fell 1.7% for the largest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;#38;P 500. They've swung sharply with expectations for the economy's health and demand for oil. Devon Energy lost 5.1%, and National Oilwell Varo lost 4%. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 0.1% to $40.60 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.1% to $43.16 per barrel. On the winning end were the big tech-oriented companies that have been dominating the market for years. Investors have continued to pile into companies they believe are able to grow almost regardless of the economy and whether people are locked in quarantines. Microsoft rose 1.7%, Apple gained 1.1% and Google's parent company Alphabet added 1.1%.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Monday. It tends to move with investors' expectations for the economy and inflation.  ___ AP Writers Yuri Kageyama and Samuel Petrequin contributed.
