A sharp drop in M&amp;A investment drove most of the decline. During H1\u201920, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion* of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H2\u201919), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.    Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world \u2013 and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H1\u201920, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter \u2013 and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.    Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H1\u201920 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H1\u201920, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.    \u201c The Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring. The Indonesia-based platform provider, which also has a digital payment offering, attracted funding from tech giants Facebook, PayPal, Google and Tencent,\u201d said Ian Pollari, Global Fintech Co-leader, KPMG International.    \u201c The intermingling of big tech platform providers and fintech is only expected to grow as big techs work globally to extend their market reach and value propositions \u2013 particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.\u201d     2020 Key Highlights     Global fintech investment is well behind 2019\u2019s total investment of $150.4 billion. At mid-year, total fintech investment globally is $25.6 billion.  The Americas accounted for the largest share of total fintech investment at mid-year, with $12.9 billion investment. ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1\u201920, while EMEA saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment.  The Americas and EMEA are currently on track to see a new record annual high of VC investment in fintech. At the end of H1\u201920, the Americas had attracted $9.3 billion in VC investment, Asia had attracted $6.7 billion, and EMEA had attracted $4 billion.  Corporate VC participating investment remained very strong, accounting for $12.2 billion in fintech investment globally. The US saw a record in VC deal value with corporate participation well over $2.4 billion in Q1 2020; the following quarter nearly matched that same amount.  M&amp;A activity dropped in all regions of the world \u2013 a sharp decline due to the mega M&amp;A activity seen during 2018 and 2019. During H1\u201920, global M&amp;A deals accounted for $4 billion globally, compared to $85.7 billion in H2\u201919.  Global investment in cybersecurity flew past 2019\u2019s record high of $592.3 million, reaching $870.8 million.     US sees lion\u2019s share of fintech investment in Americas  The Americas saw a steep decline in fintech funding, with $12.9 billion of investment in H1\u201920 compared to $43.3 billion in H2\u201920. Plummeting M&amp;A investment was responsible for the decline as VC investment in the region was on record pace \u2013 with $9.3 billion raised by the end of H1\u201920. The US accounted for the vast majority of both total fintech investment in the Americas ($11.9 billion) and VC investment ($8.6 billion) \u2013 with large deals including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending, an $850 million raise by Stripe, the $700 million acquisition of RDC, and a $700 million raise by Chime.    The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).     Challenger banks raise big VC rounds in Europe  Total fintech investment in EMEA declined significantly, given the lack of mega M&amp;A deals. During H1\u201920, the region saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. VC investment in fintech remained strong in H1\u201920, accounting for US$4 billion in investment.    During H1\u201920, challenger banks attracted five of the 10 largest deals in EMEA, including Germany-based N26 ($570 million), UK-based Revolut ($500 million), Sweden-based Klarna ($200 million), UK-based Starling Bank ($123 million), and France-based Qonto (US$116 million).     Southeast Asia becomes hotspot for fintech activity  ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1\u201920, led by the US$3 billion funding round by Indonesia-based Gojek, an $886 million raise by Gojek\u2019s main competitor \u2013 Singapore-based Grab, and a $398 million raise by India-based Navi Technologies. Fintech investment in ASPAC was quite diverse from a regional perspective this quarter. In addition to Indonesia, Singapore and India, Japan (Paidy: $251 million), South Korean (KSNET: $237 million), and Australia (Airwallex: $160 million, Judo Bank: $147 million) also saw large fintech deals. Fintech investment in China remained suppressed, falling to a multi-quarter low in Q2\u201920.    Government regulatory efforts were a very strong trend in ASPAC. During H2\u201920, Australia re-opened submissions to its Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology in order to understand how COVID-19 has affected the fintech sector, while Singapore introduced a licensing program for digital asset exchanges and platforms and Hong Kong (SAR) introduced an \u2018opt-in\u2019 licensing program for digital assets exchanges.     Corporate fintech investment robust in face of COVID-19  Corporate investment in fintech remained very strong in H1\u201920, accounting for $12.2 billion in investment across participating deals globally. The US was particularly notable as it saw a record high of over $2.4 billion in corporate investment in Q1\u201920 \u2013 a number almost matched in Q2\u201920. Corporate investment is expected to remain very strong heading into H2\u201920, in part due to the strategic nature of investments driven by corporates making investments in digital channels and products in order to serve their customers better in the COVID-19 era.     Accelerated digital trends will shape fintech\u2019s future  COVID-19 will remain key driver of change for fintech investment heading into H2\u201920 given the strong acceleration of digital trends \u2013 such as the use of contactless payments and the demand for and use of digital service models. The ongoing acceleration of digital trends will drive fintech investment not only in direct fintech solutions, but also in related enabling technologies \u2013 such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention and digital identity management. Platform businesses will also continue to be a hot ticket for investors, particularly in less mature jurisdictions.    \u201c Over the remainder of 2020, we will likely see investors continuing to focus on late stage deals and safe bets given the current uncertainty. This will likely create challenges for less mature fintechs who could find themselves running out of cash and struggling to raise additional funding,\u201d said Anton Ruddenklau, Global Fintech Co-Leader, KPMG International.    \u201c In H2\u201920, there will likely be an increasing number of opportunistic investments by corporates and PE firms look for good deals.\u201d    *All figures referenced are in USD.

At the end of H1\u201920, the Americas had attracted $9.3 billion in VC investment, Asia had attracted $6.7 billion, and EMEA had attracted $4 billion. Corporate VC participating investment remained very strong, accounting for $12.2 billion in fintech investment globally. The US saw a record in VC deal value with corporate participation well over $2.4 billion in Q1 2020; the following quarter nearly matched that same amount. M&amp;A activity dropped in all regions of the world \u2013 a sharp decline due to the mega M&amp;A activity seen during 2018 and 2019. During H1\u201920, global M&amp;A deals accounted for $4 billion globally, compared to $85.7 billion in H2\u201919. Global investment in cybersecurity flew past 2019\u2019s record high of $592.3 million, reaching $870.8 million.  US sees lion\u2019s share of fintech investment in Americas   The Americas saw a steep decline in fintech funding, with $12.9 billion of investment in H1\u201920 compared to $43.3 billion in H2\u201920. Plummeting M&amp;A investment was responsible for the decline as VC investment in the region was on record pace \u2013 with $9.3 billion raised by the end of H1\u201920. The US accounted for the vast majority of both total fintech investment in the Americas ($11.9 billion) and VC investment ($8.6 billion) \u2013 with large deals including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending, an $850 million raise by Stripe, the $700 million acquisition of RDC, and a $700 million raise by Chime.   The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).   Challenger banks raise big VC rounds in Europe   Total fintech investment in EMEA declined significantly, given the lack of mega M&amp;A deals. During H1\u201920, the region saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. VC investment in fintech remained strong in H1\u201920, accounting for US$4 billion in investment.   During H1\u201920, challenger banks attracted five of the 10 largest deals in EMEA, including Germany-based N26 ($570 million), UK-based Revolut ($500 million), Sweden-based Klarna ($200 million), UK-based Starling Bank ($123 million), and France-based Qonto (US$116 million).   Southeast Asia becomes hotspot for fintech activity   ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1\u201920, led by the US$3 billion funding round by Indonesia-based Gojek, an $886 million raise by Gojek\u2019s main competitor \u2013 Singapore-based Grab, and a $398 million raise by India-based Navi Technologies. Fintech investment in ASPAC was quite diverse from a regional perspective this quarter. In addition to Indonesia, Singapore and India, Japan (Paidy: $251 million), South Korean (KSNET: $237 million), and Australia (Airwallex: $160 million, Judo Bank: $147 million) also saw large fintech deals. Fintech investment in China remained suppressed, falling to a multi-quarter low in Q2\u201920.   Government regulatory efforts were a very strong trend in ASPAC. During H2\u201920, Australia re-opened submissions to its Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology in order to understand how COVID-19 has affected the fintech sector, while Singapore introduced a licensing program for digital asset exchanges and platforms and Hong Kong (SAR) introduced an \u2018opt-in\u2019 licensing program for digital assets exchanges.   Corporate fintech investment robust in face of COVID-19   Corporate investment in fintech remained very strong in H1\u201920, accounting for $12.2 billion in investment across participating deals globally. The US was particularly notable as it saw a record high of over $2.4 billion in corporate investment in Q1\u201920 \u2013 a number almost matched in Q2\u201920. Corporate investment is expected to remain very strong heading into H2\u201920, in part due to the strategic nature of investments driven by corporates making investments in digital channels and products in order to serve their customers better in the COVID-19 era.   Accelerated digital trends will shape fintech\u2019s future    COVID-19 will remain key driver of change for fintech investment heading into H2\u201920 given the strong acceleration of digital trends \u2013 such as the use of contactless payments and the demand for and use of digital service models. The ongoing acceleration of digital trends will drive fintech investment not only in direct fintech solutions, but also in related enabling technologies \u2013 such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention and digital identity management. Platform businesses will also continue to be a hot ticket for investors, particularly in less mature jurisdictions.   \u201cOver the remainder of 2020, we will likely see investors continuing to focus on late stage deals and safe bets given the current uncertainty. This will likely create challenges for less mature fintechs who could find themselves running out of cash and struggling to raise additional funding,\u201d said Anton Ruddenklau, Global Fintech Co-Leader, KPMG International.   \u201cIn H2\u201920, there will likely be an increasing number of opportunistic investments by corporates and PE firms look for good deals.\u201d   *All figures referenced are in USD.

A sharp drop in M&amp;A investment drove most of the decline. During H1\u201920, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion* of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H2\u201919), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.   Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world \u2013 and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H1\u201920, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter \u2013 and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.   Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H1\u201920 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H1\u201920, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.   \u201cThe Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring. The Indonesia-based platform provider, which also has a digital payment offering, attracted funding from tech giants Facebook, PayPal, Google and Tencent,\u201d said Ian Pollari, Global Fintech Co-leader, KPMG International.   \u201cThe intermingling of big tech platform providers and fintech is only expected to grow as big techs work globally to extend their market reach and value propositions \u2013 particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.\u201d    2020 Key Highlights  Global fintech investment is well behind 2019\u2019s total investment of $150.4 billion. At mid-year, total fintech investment globally is $25.6 billion. The Americas accounted for the largest share of total fintech investment at mid-year, with $12.9 billion investment. ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1\u201920, while EMEA saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. The Americas and EMEA are currently on track to see a new record annual high of VC investment in fintech. At the end of H1\u201920, the Americas had attracted $9.3 billion in VC investment, Asia had attracted $6.7 billion, and EMEA had attracted $4 billion. Corporate VC participating investment remained very strong, accounting for $12.2 billion in fintech investment globally.

The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).

A sharp drop in M&amp;A investment drove most of the decline. During H120, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion* of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H219), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.   Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world \u201c and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H120, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter \u201c and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.   Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H120 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H120, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.   The Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring. The Indonesia-based platform provider, which also has a digital payment offering, attracted funding from tech giants Facebook, PayPal, Google and Tencent, said Ian Pollari, Global Fintech Co-leader, KPMG International.   The intermingling of big tech platform providers and fintech is only expected to grow as big techs work globally to extend their market reach and value propositions \u201c particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.    2020 Key Highlights  Global fintech investment is well behind 2019s total investment of $150.4 billion. At mid-year, total fintech investment globally is $25.6 billion. The Americas accounted for the largest share of total fintech investment at mid-year, with $12.9 billion investment. ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H120, while EMEA saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. The Americas and EMEA are currently on track to see a new record annual high of VC investment in fintech. At the end of H120, the Americas had attracted $9.3 billion in VC investment, Asia had attracted $6.7 billion, and EMEA had attracted $4 billion. Corporate VC participating investment remained very strong, accounting for $12.2 billion in fintech investment globally. The US saw a record in VC deal value with corporate participation well over $2.4 billion in Q1 2020; the following quarter nearly matched that same amount. M&amp;A activity dropped in all regions of the world \u201c a sharp decline due to the mega M&amp;A activity seen during 2018 and 2019. During H120, global M&amp;A deals accounted for $4 billion globally, compared to $85.7 billion in H219. Global investment in cybersecurity flew past 2019s record high of $592.3 million, reaching $870.8 million.   US sees lions share of fintech investment in Americas The Americas saw a steep decline in fintech funding, with $12.9 billion of investment in H120 compared to $43.3 billion in H220. Plummeting M&amp;A investment was responsible for the decline as VC investment in the region was on record pace \u201c with $9.3 billion raised by the end of H120. The US accounted for the vast majority of both total fintech investment in the Americas ($11.9 billion) and VC investment ($8.6 billion) \u201c with large deals including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending, an $850 million raise by Stripe, the $700 million acquisition of RDC, and a $700 million raise by Chime.   The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).    Challenger banks raise big VC rounds in Europe Total fintech investment in EMEA declined significantly, given the lack of mega M&amp;A deals. During H120, the region saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. VC investment in fintech remained strong in H120, accounting for US$4 billion in investment.   During H120, challenger banks attracted five of the 10 largest deals in EMEA, including Germany-based N26 ($570 million), UK-based Revolut ($500 million), Sweden-based Klarna ($200 million), UK-based Starling Bank ($123 million), and France-based Qonto (US$116 million).    Southeast Asia becomes hotspot for fintech activity ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H120, led by the US$3 billion funding round by Indonesia-based Gojek, an $886 million raise by Gojeks main competitor \u201c Singapore-based Grab, and a $398 million raise by India-based Navi Technologies. Fintech investment in ASPAC was quite diverse from a regional perspective this quarter. In addition to Indonesia, Singapore and India, Japan (Paidy: $251 million), South Korean (KSNET: $237 million), and Australia (Airwallex: $160 million, Judo Bank: $147 million) also saw large fintech deals. Fintech investment in China remained suppressed, falling to a multi-quarter low in Q220.   Government regulatory efforts were a very strong trend in ASPAC. During H220, Australia re-opened submissions to its Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology in order to understand how COVID-19 has affected the fintech sector, while Singapore introduced a licensing program for digital asset exchanges and platforms and Hong Kong (SAR) introduced an \u02dcopt-in licensing program for digital assets exchanges.    Corporate fintech investment robust in face of COVID-19 Corporate investment in fintech remained very strong in H120, accounting for $12.2 billion in investment across participating deals globally. The US was particularly notable as it saw a record high of over $2.4 billion in corporate investment in Q120 \u201c a number almost matched in Q220. Corporate investment is expected to remain very strong heading into H220, in part due to the strategic nature of investments driven by corporates making investments in digital channels and products in order to serve their customers better in the COVID-19 era.    Accelerated digital trends will shape fintechs future COVID-19 will remain key driver of change for fintech investment heading into H220 given the strong acceleration of digital trends \u201c such as the use of contactless payments and the demand for and use of digital service models. The ongoing acceleration of digital trends will drive fintech investment not only in direct fintech solutions, but also in related enabling technologies \u201c such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention and digital identity management. Platform businesses will also continue to be a hot ticket for investors, particularly in less mature jurisdictions.   Over the remainder of 2020, we will likely see investors continuing to focus on late stage deals and safe bets given the current uncertainty. This will likely create challenges for less mature fintechs who could find themselves running out of cash and struggling to raise additional funding, said Anton Ruddenklau, Global Fintech Co-Leader, KPMG International.   In H220, there will likely be an increasing number of opportunistic investments by corporates and PE firms look for good deals.   *All figures referenced are in USD.

Among them, Fred Wilson expects some kind of reckoning in Big Tech[1]. Brianne Kimmel, managing director of Work Life Ventures, predicts more celebrities will break into angel investing. And others contemplate whether Silicon Valley is really over[2]. These are some of their predictions. Click here for more BI Prime stories[3]. For venture capitalists, publishing a list of tech predictions is a New Year's tradition as time-honored as popping a bottle of champagne and kissing at midnight. 2019 did not disappoint. </p><p>Investors from Fred Wilson to Brianne Kimmel shared their write-ups with their throngs of Twitter followers. The listicle is so prevalent that after famed venture capitalist Hunter Walk wrote a snarky tweet[4] about publishing his own predictions post \u2014 with no intention of writing such a list \u2014 a number of people responded in earnest last week. The Homebrew founder had poked fun at the investors who write their predictions with their portfolio in mind. We read the tech predictions lists and pulled our top picks here.The seed round has two typesSemil Shah[5], an early-stage investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners, who also invests out of his own firm, Haystack, expects the flow of capital to continue pumping up deal sizes in the new year.Shah wrote on his blog:[6] \"The public markets are soaring. Private markets are bigger than ever. There is so much dry powder alone in the Bay Area (well over $50B contractually committed to funds), it's hard to see that just drying up overnight. In my role as an early-stage investor, I can't worry about what will happen in public markets, and there is so much capital in the private markets, it means that 2020 is setup to just be a continuation of what 2019 was \u2014 and that means a bifurcation of seed rounds, with some seed rounds being very competitive pre-product Series A rounds, and other rounds being smaller, more on the fringe, perhaps out of the Bay Area. The entire seed market is wholly different from when I sent the first Haystack wire in March 2013, and with every fund comes a new game to learn to play.\"A possible reckoning in Big TechThe rise of tech monopolies was one of the biggest tech trends of the last decade, said Fred Wilson[7], a venture capitalist who was among the first to recognize the promise of social media and profit from it. Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google grabbed the top position in their markets, and they used their power to amass huge amounts of data and control the most popular methods of communication. Wilson did not speculate on how Big Tech might falter, but he wrote: [8]\"What society does about this situation stands as the most important issue in tech at the start of the 2020s.\"Celebrities break into investingBrianne Kimmel[9], a former Zendesk executive who raised her own fund in 2019, says \"Hollywood angels\" are part of the future of early-stage investing. Celebrities will put their own financial resources into startups, as Serena Williams, Will Smith, and Karlie Kloss have already done, as well as join institutional firms as limited partners, she predicts.She predicts that celebrity-investors will defend their deals on Instagram, TikTok, and other social media apps. Kimmel wrote in her newsletter: [10]\"In the same way vaudeville performers seamlessly transitioned to the film industry with larger crowds and bigger salaries, celebrities will continue to have outsized distribution advantages on any new creative platform and create a high barrier to entry for new creators.\"Investors bet big on Gen ZThe start of a new decade means that some venture capitalists are eager to find the products and services that cater to a new group of consumers: Gen Z. Several investors told Business Insider's Megan Hernbroth[11] that they expect to spend more on consumer startups in 2020 because of the rising purchasing power of the younger generations. The group's comfort with e-commerce and fluency with the latest technology trends make for a promising market opportunity. Caitlin Strandberg, a principal at Lerer Hippeau,[12] told Hernbroth: \"On the consumer side, we'll see more products and services that appeal to the Gen Z sentiments around authenticity, empowerment, inclusion and self-expression. This is a new consumer who is resourceful in learning about the brands and businesses they choose to support with their purchases.\"Fintech gets a new challenger Financial technology startups will face new competition in consumer brands, Kleiner Perkins investor Monica Desai Weiss[13] told Forbes. As the incumbents wrestle for customers, brands that already have large online followings will add financial technology as a feature. Desai Weiss told Forbes' Jeff Kauflin:[14] \"People you go to for other products and services will use fintech to make their product or service easier. Some people call this embedded finance[15]. You're seeing that with Uber and SmileDirectClub doing it for their teeth aligners. The natural way to do this is with features like flexible payments and insurance. Over time, I think it will go broader than that and will come from brands that you love. Brands like Glossier, Fortnite or Nike that have real loyalty with consumers will start to become bigger players because they have this natural entry point. A challenger bank or a new fintech must build that from scratch in an incredibly difficult world of customer acquisition.\"The great startup migrationThe soaring cost of living[16] in the San Francisco Bay Area has made it harder for startups to hire and keep people in their ranks. The result is the slow migration of startups into tech hubs that were previously overlooked, said David Blumberg[17], managing partner of Blumberg Capital. Blumberg wrote on his blog:[18] \"This past year, we've seen growth of hiring hubs beyond the pricey, competitive, and congested Silicon Valley in welcoming venues around the world. In 2020, we anticipate tech hub expansion across the U.S., in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, among others. This is partly due to business-friendly environments (e.g. lower taxes and less regulation), lower housing prices and engineering graduates from local universities.\" The future of work is remoteThe same pressures forcing companies to open offices beyond the valley will also encourage startups to allow remote work, said Talia Goldberg[19], a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. The sprawl will drive demand for new enterprise software solutions that enable workers to get stuff done and connect with their teams from anywhere in the country. Goldberg wrote on Bessemer's blog:[20] \"Eliminating geography as a constraint to talent is a game-changer for businesses. Now that most knowledge workers can communicate and collaborate remotely, going to work is more of a state of being than a destination. Workplaces of the future will rely on new software and systems that reimagine team architectures and habits and reinvent operations to serve a global and distributed workforce.\"'Greentech' makes a comeback2019 was the year that climate change became part of the cultural psyche. At least one tech investor is betting that sustainability becomes a broad investment theme in 2020 as a result. Barry Eggers[21], a founding partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, said there's no shortage of opportunities in the \"greentech\" sector, from cleaning up the world's oceans to creating a food system for a growing population. Eggers wrote on Lightspeed's blog: [22]\"While 'cleantech' investing had mixed success during the mid-2000s, 'greentech' investing during the 2020s will have the advantage of more efficient business models and heightened consumer awareness, interest, and urgency.\"NOW WATCH: Tech that died this decade[23]See Also: The legendary Andreessen Horowitz partner who worked on its Facebook and Airbnb deals shares his best advice for entrepreneurs trying to strike it big in Silicon Valley[24]Silicon Valley startup valuations are so out of control, these 2 investors moved to New York City to avoid the 'bidding wars' for big deals[25]WeWork and other top startups were cut down to size in 2019. This VC thinks 30% of the more than 400 other unicorns will soon see their valuations slashed too.[26] SEE ALSO:Venture capitalists reveal the startups that changed everything in the last decade[27]

What they're saying: 'I think [government regulation] is the greatest impediment to the creation of smaller companies and to moving fast,' said Sequoia Capital's Michael Moritz, echoing a familiar anti-government refrain from Silicon Valley. He later pointed the finger at \"the school classrooms of America\" for lagging behind China's educational achievements. </p><p>\"We're killing the future technologists of the United States.\" VCs also argued that because they tend to invest in 'the next thing,\" big tech incumbents aren't a deterrent for their business. 'Would you invest in PC operating systems today? Would you invest in microprocessors today? Would you invest in combustion automobiles today? No, you wouldn't if you're a good investor,' said Ram Shriram, an early investor in Google and one of its current directors. Similarly, Moritz pointed out that companies like Google and Nvidia didn't set out to take on incumbents like Microsoft and Intel. But, but, but: Some disagreed. 'I've seen dozens of startups wanting to do something to compete with Linkedin but that's so hard to do \u2014 incredibly strong network effects to overcome,' said Switch Ventures partner Paul Arnold. Early Facebook backer Roger McNamee argued that 'the business models of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft and of the venture firms may not be optimal for the economy as a whole.' Between the lines: Many worried about the impact that increased M...egulation could have on incentives for everyone involved.

The question isn't whether we can digitize something, but whether we should.\"</p><p>Here are four key tech trends from this year's CES that TV executives should keep an eye on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">#1 Mobile Still Rules</emphasis></p><p>With programmers and operators racing to m more content available on multiple platforms, s trends of video-enabled consumer electronics devices have become the lifeblood of app and digital content strategies.</p><p>Here, much of the CES news fell into familiar patterns. Global CE sales remain virtually flat, up 1% in 2014 to $1.02 trillion. Mobile devices continue to dominate, with smartphones and tablets estimated to account for nearly half of all worldwide CE sales (46%) in 2015, up from 22% in 2011.</p><p>Growing penetration of mobile devices has prompted Magna Global to raise its mobile video ad forecast from only $600 million in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015 and $7 billion by 2018. Overall, Magna Global is predicting that online video advertising will jump from $3.8 billion in 2014 to $5.4 billion this year and $15.2 billion in 2018.</p><p>As the mobile market approaches saturation- millennials age 18-34 now are more likely to have a smartphone (88%) than a pay-TV subscription (83%) according to a survey by Frank N. Magid Associates-there was also increased discussion of smart TVs and other connected devices at this year's show.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">#2 Back to the TV</emphasis></p><p>After several years of low profits and sluggish sales, TV sets are making a comeback, with global set sales expected to hit 251 million in 2015, up from 242 million in 2012. \"We are at the beginning of another upgrade cycle in the U.S.,\" said Steve Koenig, director of industry analysis at the CEA, who notes that aging HD sets and newer 4K sets are boosting demand.</p><p>In the U.S., about 1.3 million ultra-HD (UHD) sets were sold in 2014, with the CEA predicting that some 4 million 4K sets should ship in 2015 and another 10 million in 2016.</p><p>\"I think 2016 will be the real infection point [for 4K],\" Koenig said.</p><p>Notable new developments are also occurring in image quality. LG, Sharp, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony and other major manufacturers all announced new sets with greatly improved high dynamic range, which provides much better blacks and wider color gamut for more realistic color on their 4K sets.</p><p>To help drive adoption of higher-quality pictures, Netflix announced partnerships with both LG and Sony to stream 4K content with higher dynamic range to UHD TVs. \"It's not just about more pixels,\" said Netflix chief streaming and partnership offcer Greg Peters, who stressed the notable improvements of high-dynamic range.</p><p>Of course, these enhancements will also increase the bandwidth requirements for streaming UHD content. They will also put more pressure on producers to begin shooting with 4K cameras, which tend to offer higher dynamic range and better color, even if they are still delivering shows in HD.</p><p>Netfix's Peters also stressed that improvements in TVs were \"not just about picture quality.\" Peters highlighted Net-f ix's work with CE players on connected TVs to improve the user experience. The CEA estimates that sales of smart TVs or TVs with a built-in Internet connection in the U.S. should hit 19.9 million in 2015, up from 16.9 million in 2014.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"smartphones\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>With smartphones currently accounting for the largest percentage of consumer electronics sales, LG rolled out a new version of its curved smartphone, the G Flex2.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"tvsets\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>Google's second attempt to push into television sets seems to be working, with Sharp announcing that Android TV will be built into some of its 4K TV sets.</p><p>As more TVs get connected to the Internet, Magna Global estimates the number of homes that get their video primarily from an over-the-top provider will rise from 7.3 million in 2014 to around 15.9 million in 2018, which will in turn boost revenue for OTT video providers.</p><p>Subscription video-on-demand is enjoying a similar upsurge. Consultancy/research firm PwC predicts that the SVOD business will grow from $3.9 billion in 2014 to $10.1 billion in 2018. The Digital Entertainment Group, a consortium of dozens of entertainment content distributors ranging from smaller indies to major studios, announced during CES that SVOD revenue for its members jumped 26% in 2014.</p><p>Another ray of hope, the DEG added, is electronic sell-through (EST), a.k.a., digital downloads, which posted a 30% year-over-year revenue gain. While digital platforms such as iTunes are signif cant EST vendors, multichannel video programming distributors are increasingly turning their attentions there. Matthew Strauss, senior VP and GM of video services at Comcast Cable, accepted a DEG award saluting Comcast as Digital Retailer of the Year at a CES reception. The company's top corporate execs, he said, \"were all incredibly committed to the idea that we needed to launch our EST service. It has exceeded all of our expectations.\"</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"sharp\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>Sharp was one of a number of manufacturers at CES that announced signifi cant improvements in TV display technologies for their 4K sets; Dish broke new ground at the show with the unveiling of a $20-per-month Internet video package of cable channels that includes ESPN.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">#3 Over-the-Top Hype</emphasis></p><p>Over-the-top video has been one of the hottest topics this year, with every major CE manufacturer announcing some sort of expansion of the streaming services and apps available on their TV sets.</p><p>While Sony touted (but released no further details about) its Internet video service PlayStation Vue, Dish launched both a 4K streaming set-top box and unveiled Sling T V.</p><p>The long-awaited Internet video offering will be priced at $20/month for about a dozen cable channels, including ESPN, and content from Maker Studios. But it does not include broadcasters. And some programmers privately grumbled about the modest price point.</p><p>\"We have never been satisf ed with the status quo,\" said Dish's Clayton, who stressed that the new service is designed for the 18-to-34 set. \"This is a market segment that pay-TV is missing. We see a great opportunity with this group and do not believe that providing them Sling TV will cannibalize our core business.\"</p><p>How well that idea will pan out or how quickly others will follow is open to question, though DirecTV has already launched a streaming service for Hispanic viewers.</p><p>Tim Hanlon, founder and CEO of investment advisory f rm Vertere Group, cautions that broadcasters aren't immune from the impact of OTT. \"You see Tribune coming out of bankruptcy, making gargantuan projections for jumps for carriage fees,\" Hanlon said. \"But I don't know if that is the right model. Where will that revenue come from [if consumers are resisting higher-priced packages], and what will replace it if you have cord-cutting?\"</p><p>Success could also have unpleasant consequences for OTT players and their subscribers. Several executives noted that prices for programming for Netf ix could rise if usage shifts dramatically to OTT content and traditional channels start losing revenue from the pay-TV business. \"Today you have Netf ix for $9.99 a month, but they might have to look at a different price model and perhaps bring in their own bundling or advertising,\" Jeff Clark, head of video platforms and monetization at Google, said during a CES session on Internet video.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">#4 The Next Little Thing</emphasis></p><p>Once again, there were no clear answers to the question of what will emerge as the next big tech revolution.

Homes are also getting smarter, with appliances and security systems connecting with each other and the Internet, a trend Syfy has seized on in a venture with Philips centered on the company's Hue lighting system.

And in the coming years, IoT could have a major impact on improving the current, much-criticized measurement systems.</p><p>For example, smart watches and connected TVs with built-in content recognition technology could track what is being watched in and out of the home, though such systems would create privacy and security issues.</p><p>\"Companies that start out digital-only have a huge resource in data that they can use to better reach consumers,\" said Lisa Hsia, executive VP of digital at NBCUni-versal's Bravo and Oxygen Media. \"But TV doesn't have that. We're still burdened by archaic measurement systems that do not measure content across platforms.\" &amp; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dade Hayes contributed to this report.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRCABL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRCABL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F2H-0JN1-JBPF-94BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241806</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Broadcasting and Cable</publicationName><volume>Vol. CXLV</volume><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>January 12, 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Sony CEO <person><nameText>Kazuo Hirai </nameText></person>began his company's product announcements by claiming PlayStation Vue service would reinvent television. And Samsung rolled out a new streaming virtual reality service that includes an original show from one of the producers of The Walking Dead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elsewhere, manufacturers including Sony and Sharp announced new TV sets using Google's Android TV platform, Netflixpromoted new 4K streaming initiatives and several TV makers were showing off sets with the Roku operating system that allows users to easily access hundreds of streaming apps. And CES itself debuted the \"C Space\" sub-conference track, giving NBCUniversal, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, Twitter and other digital branding players a dedicated (and disarmingly posh) showcase apart from the maddening Las Vegas Convention Center crowds.</p><p>It isn't clear how many of these efforts will become viable businesses in 2015. But in an era of relatively flat consumer electronics (CE) spending, alliances between content and technology players were part of the growing trend of more consumer-focused innovation.</p><p>\"For a long time, people came to CES to see what is possible,\" said Shawn Dubravac, chief economist at the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). \"Now I think they come to see what kind of innovation will be meaningful to consumers. The question isn't whether we can digitize something, but whether we should.\"</p><p>Here are four key tech trends from this year's CES that TV executives should keep an eye on.</p><p>#1 Mobile Still Rules</p><p>With programmers and operators racing to make more content available on multiple platforms, sales trends of video-enabled consumer electronics devices have become the lifeblood of app and digital content strategies.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>Here, much of the CES news fell into familiar patterns. Global CE sales remain virtually flat, up 1% in 2014 to $1.02 trillion. Mobile devices continue to dominate, with smartphones and tablets estimated to account for nearly half of all worldwide CE sales (46%) in 2015, up from 22% in 2011.</p><p>Growing penetration of mobile devices has prompted Magna Global to raise its mobile video ad forecast from only $600 million in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015 and $7 billion by 2018. Overall, Magna Global is predicting that online video advertising will jump from $3.8 billion in 2014 to $5.4 billion this year and $15.2 billion in 2018.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>As the mobile market approaches saturation--millennials age 18-34 now are more likely to have a smartphone (88%) than a pay-TV subscription (83%) according to a survey by Frank N. Magid Associates--there was also increased discussion of smart TVs and other connected devices at this year's show.</p><p>#2 Back to the TV</p><p>After several years of low profits and sluggish sales, TV sets are making a comeback, with global set sales expected to hit 251 million in 2015, up from 242 million in 2012. \"We are at the beginning of another upgrade cycle in the U.S.,\" said Steve Koenig, director of industry analysis at the CEA, who notes that aging HD sets and newer 4K sets are boosting demand.</p><p>In the U.S., about 1.3 million ultra-HD (UHD) sets were sold in 2014, with the CEA predicting that some 4 million 4K sets should ship in 2015 and another 10 million in 2016.</p><p>\"I think 2016 will be the real inflection point [for 4K],\" Koenig said.</p><p>Notable new developments are also occurring in image quality. LG, Sharp, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony and other major manufacturers all announced new sets with greatly improved high dynamic range, which provides much better blacks and wider color gamut for more realistic color on their 4K sets.</p><p>To help drive adoption of higher-quality pictures, Netflixannounced partnerships with both LG and Sony to stream 4K content with higher dynamic range to UHD TVs. \"It's not just about more pixels,\" said Netflixchief streaming and partnership officer Greg Peters, who stressed the notable improvements of high-dynamic range.</p><p>Of course, these enhancements will also increase the bandwidth requirements for streaming UHD content. They will also put more pressure on producers to begin shooting with 4K cameras, which tend to offer higher dynamic range and better color, even if they are still delivering shows in HD.</p><p>Netflix's Peters also stressed that improvements in TVs were \"not just about picture quality.\" Peters highlighted Netflix's work with CE players on connected TVs to improve the user experience.</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>The CEA estimates that sales of smart TVs or TVs with a builtin Internet connection in the U.S. should hit 19.9 million in 2015, up from 16.9 million in 2014.</p><p>As more TVs get connected to the Internet, Magna Global estimates the number of homes that get their video primarily from an over-the-top provider will rise from 7.3 million in 2014 to around 15.9 million in 2018, which will in turn boost revenue for OTT video providers.</p><p>Subscription video-on-demand is enjoying a similar upsurge. Consultancy/research firm PwC predicts that the SVOD business will grow from $3.9 billion in 2014 to $10.1 billion in 2018. The Digital Entertainment Group, a consortium of dozens of entertainment content distributors ranging from smaller indies to major studios, announced during CES that SVOD revenue for its members jumped 26% in 2014.</p><p>Another ray of hope, the DEG added, is electronic sell-through (EST), a.k.a., digital downloads, which posted a 30% year-over-year revenue gain. While digital platforms such as iTunes are significant EST vendors, multichannel video programming distributors are increasingly turning their attentions there. Matthew Strauss, senior VP and GM of video services at Comcast Cable, accepted a DEG award saluting Comcast as Digital Retailer of the Year at a CES reception.

It has exceeded all of our expectations.\"</p><p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p><p>#3 Over-the-Top Hype</p><p>Over-the-top video has been one of the hottest topics this year, with every major CE manufacturer announcing some sort of expansion of the streaming services and apps available on their TV sets.</p><p>While Sony touted (but released no further details about) its Internet video service PlayStation Vue, Dish launched both a 4K streaming set-top box and unveiled Sling TV.</p><p>The long-awaited Internet video offering will be priced at $20/month for about a dozen cable channels, including ESPN, and content from Maker Studios. But it does not include broadcasters. And some programmers privately grumbled about the modest price point.</p><p>\"We have never been satisfied with the status quo,\" said Dish's Clayton, who stressed that the new service is designed for the 18-to-34 set. \"This is a market segment that pay-TV is missing. We see a great opportunity with this group and do not believe that providing them Sling TV will cannibalize our core business.\"</p><p>How well that idea will pan out or how quickly others will follow is open to question, though DirecTV has already launched a streaming service for Hispanic viewers.</p><p>Tim Hanlon, founder and CEO of investment advisory firmVertere Group, cautions that broadcasters aren't immune from the impact of OTT. \"You see Tribune coming out of bankruptcy, making gargantuan projections for jumps for carriage fees,\" Hanlon said. \"But I don't know if that is the right model. Where will that revenue come from [if consumers are resisting higher-priced packages], and what will replace it if you have cord-cutting?\"</p><p>Success could also have unpleasant consequences for OTT players and their subscribers. Several executives noted that prices for programming for Netflixcould rise if usage shifts dramatically to OTT content and traditional channels start losing revenue from the pay-TV business. \"Today you have Netflixfor $9.99 a month, but they might have to look at a different price model and perhaps bring in their own bundling or advertising,\" Jeff Clark, head of video platforms and monetization at Google, said during a CES session on Internet video.</p><p>#4 The Next Little Thing</p><p>Once again, there were no clear answers to the question of what will emerge as the next big tech revolution.

Federal regulators have agreed to let some major studios use drones to make movies, and the CEA estimates that by 2018, sales of consumer drones could hit $1 billion in revenue.</p><p>Smart watches also seem to be taking off; the CEA estimates as many as 10.8 million will ship worldwide in 2015. Homes are also getting smarter, with appliances and security systems connecting with each other and the Internet, a trend Syfy has seized on in a venture with Philips centered on the company's Hue lighting system. Following a partnership on last summer's Sharknado 2, the companies were at CES to promote a Hue scheme for the upcoming debut of the series 12 Monkeys. Lights in the viewer's home flash and turn colors based on the soundtrack and onscreen action.</p><p>The leading candidate for the next big thing at this year's CES was the Internet of Things, or IoT. All the major CE manufacturers spent considerable time outlining their strategies, and Samsung Electronics CEO Boo-Keun Yoon devoted his entire keynote to the subject. \"IoT is not science fiction any more, it is science fact,\" he proclaimed. \"The age of IoT has already started.\"</p><p>With the cost of putting sensors and Internet connections into everyday devices plummeting, there is little doubt that the idea of linking them all together into networks that can harvest data for a variety of purposes will open up a host of opportunities.</p><p>Cable operators and telcos that now provide broadband connections into the home are already beefing up their offerings for smart homes. And in the coming years, IoT could have a major impact on improving the current, much-criticized measurement systems.</p><p>For example, smart watches and connected TVs with built-in content recognition technology could track what is being watched in and out of the home, though such systems would create privacy and security issues.</p><p>\"Companies that start out digital-only have a huge resource in data that they can use to better reach consumers,\" said Lisa Hsia, executive VP of digital at NBCUniversal's Bravo and Oxygen Media. \"But TV doesn't have that. We're still burdened by archaic measurement systems that do not measure content across platforms.\"</p><p>WHY THIS MATTERS</p><p>Profitability remains tricky, but TV and video players flooded CES, hungrier than ever for new models.</p><p>Dade Hayes contributed to this report.</p><p>AND TREND #5: THE OS WARS</p><p>To learn about the industry's push to standardize and streamline the process of delivering streaming video, go to broadcastingcable.com/Jan12.</p><p>George Winslow</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:winslowbc@gmail.com\">winslowbc@gmail.com</email> | @GeorgeWinslow</p><table><title>NORTH AMERICAN</title><subtitle>CE SPENDING</subtitle><subtitle>Smartphones and tablets accounted</subtitle><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"320\"/><colspec align=\"center\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"24\"/><tbody><row><entry>for 39% of all consumer electronics</entry></row><row><entry>spending in 2014</entry></row><row><entry>Smartphones</entry><entry>31%</entry></row><row><entry>Mobile PCs</entry><entry>15%</entry></row><row><entry>LCD TVs</entry><entry>11%</entry></row><row><entry>Tablets</entry><entry>8%</entry></row><row><entry>Desktop PCs</entry><entry>9%</entry></row><row><entry>Other</entry><entry>26%</entry></row><row><entry>Source: Consumer Electronics Association</entry></row><row><entry>Note: Table made from pie chart.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDSTBL-8827418</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">8827418 WTB</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F4S-52C1-JBHC-S00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">221994</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Broadcasting &amp;

Nydia Velazquez:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Nydia M. Velazquez (D-NY) and Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) have written to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury as head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), encouraging the Council to consider designating the three leading cloud-based computing storage providers for the financial industry as systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The letter follows last month's data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation, which exposed the personal information of approximately 106 million Capital One credit card customers and applicants. The personal data of millions of Americans that Capital One was storing was being hosted in a cloud provided by Amazon Web Services, and was breached by a former Amazon employee. This recent incident raises new and serious questions about banks and financial companies' dependence on cloud services, profoundly worrying lawmakers about the data economy's risks to public safety and financial stability.</p><p>\"I was appalled to learn that millions of hard-working Americans' personal data had been compromised. Banks and financial institutions' increasing reliance on cloud service providers for their data storage needs increases the risk these systems pose to the safety and stability of our nation's financial system,\" said Velazquez. \"I am proud to partner with Rep. Porter to ensure the data integrity of our financial institutions is maintained.\"</p><p>\"Too often we are trying to solve yesterday's problems tomorrow, instead of making policy that prevents tomorrow's problems from happening in the first place,\" said Porter. \"As our financial system increasingly relies on cloud computing and other forms of technology, we need to ensure the proper 21st century safeguards are in place to prevent another financial crisis.\"</p><p>The letter calls on the FSOC to consider designating Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as SIFMUs under the Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. A SIFMU designation would subject the tech firms to enhanced oversight by the Federal Reserve to ensure a cloud failure of a leading financial institution would not create a catastrophic risk to the nation's financial system.</p><p>A .pdf of the letter is online here and the full text is below.</p><p>August 22, 2019</p><p>The Honorable Steven T. Mnuchin</p><p>Secretary</p><p>U.S. Department of the Treasury</p><p>1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.</p><p>Washington, D.C. 20220</p><p>Secretary Mnuchin:</p><p>We write to request that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC or the Council) convene a meeting and consider designating the three leading providers of cloud-based storage systems for the financial industry: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloudas systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p>Last month's data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation (Capital One) was the most recent in a string of incidences demonstrating the dangerous breadth of banks' and financial institutions' increasing reliance on cloud computingand the reach of Amazon Web Services in particular. While it has been determined that an error by Capital One enabled the breach, the incident raises new and serious questions about banks' and financial institutions' dependence on cloud services for their data needsand the risks these systems pose to the safety and stability of the financial system.</p><p>Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to promote stability in the financial system, in part by granting the FSOC the ability to conduct enhanced oversight of Financial Market Utilities (FMUs). Per the Federal Reserve: \"In cases where, among other things, a failure or a disruption to the functioning of an FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system, the FMU may be designated as systemically important.\" Title VIII authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to, among other powers, conduct examinations of, take enforcement action against, and prescribe risk management standards for entities designated as systemically important FMUs, or SIFMUs.[1]</p><p>According to the FSOC, it must consider the following four factors when analyzing the appropriateness of a SIFMU designation: \"(1) the aggregate monetary value of transactions processed by the FMU; (2) the aggregate exposure of the FMU to its counterparties; (3) the relationship, interdependencies, or other interactions of the FMU with other FMUs or payment, clearing, or settlement activities; and (4) the effect that the failure of or a disruption to the FMU would have on critical markets, financial institutions, or the broader financial system.\"[2] Though there are operational differences between cloud service providers and the eight existing SIFMUs, cloud services have become an essential element of our modern financial system and should be overseen commensurately.</p><p>First, though the cloud service providers at issue may not process monetary transactions directly, their operational stability underpins an increasing share of banks' central functions. For example, Bank of America Corporation intends to deliver 80 percent of its technological functions on virtual platforms and with public cloud infrastructure \"within the next several years.\"[3] According to its Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Azure \"continues to see strong cloud adoption from the financial services industry, with more than 80 percent of the world's largest banks and more than 75 percent of the global systemically important financial institutions using Azure.\"[4] HSBC's Chief Information Officer expressed similar sentiments at Google's 2017 Next conference: \"Apart from having the $2.4 trillion of assets on the balance sheet, we also have at the core of the company a massive asset in our data, and what's been happening in the last two to three years is a massive growth in the size of our data assets.\" HBSC uses Google Cloud; the volume of data held at the time of the conference was over 100 petabytesor 100 million gigabytes.[5]</p><p>As data becomes increasingly monetized, hackers become more sophisticated, and firms put more data on servers or the cloud, these breaches are getting more severe. There have been over 9,000 data breaches made public since 2005, which have exposed over 11 billion records in the United States alone.[6] In 2005, 1.4 million credit card numbers and the names on those accounts, held by DSW Shoe Warehouse, were breachedthe first time a breach compromised over a million records. In 2017, the Equifax breach exposed the personally identifiable information of 148 million people.[7] First reported in July of this year, a data breach at Capital One, which relies on Amazon Web Services for its data storage, compromised over 100 million Capital One customer accounts and credit card applications.[8] Though cloud service providers may not process monetary transactions like other SIFMUs, these firms provide the world's biggest banks with the technological foundation necessary to link to one another and other financial and commercial market participants, thereby helping to enable monetary and commercial transactions while simultaneously maintaining their clientele's most sensitive information and associated assets.</p><p>With regard to the second factor, though there is no direct financial exposure if the cloud fails, the counterparty exposure in the form of a failure to provide the cloud serviceand the operational losses that stem from that failurecould be significant.</p><p>Third, the volatility of public confidence in cloud services and the necessity of data integrity to maintaining that confidence is common to all cloud service providers. A data breach or other disruptive event that shakes public perception of the trustworthiness of the cloud could discourage consumers from using cloud-reliant banks and potentially spur a bank run. Should any cloud service provider fail, public mistrust of the service would not be limited to that one company. Particularly given the rapid speed of technological development, enforcing appropriate safeguards is critical to maintaining continued public acceptance of the cloud.</p><p>Fourth, the effect of a disruption to a cloud services provider on the broader financial system could be catastrophic. According to a 2016 report by McKinsey, 100 percent of financial institutions use cloud services in some capacity.[9] In addition to financial institutions, our government has come to rely on Amazon Web Services for a massive share of its data storage needs: the Department of Defense holds a $10 billion cloud computing contract with Amazon Web Services, and NASA and the state of Arizona are also clients of AWS.[10] An Amazon Web Services cloud failure in particular would debilitate major swaths of the financial industry, basic government functions, and our national security.</p><p>It is important to note that not all four factors are weighted equally. According to the FSOC in its 2011 Rule describing the criteria the Council would consider in designating SIFMUs, \"the two critical determinations for an FMU designation are: (1) Whether the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU now or in the future could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets (the ''First Determination''); and (2) Whether the spread of such liquidity or credit problems among financial institutions or markets could threaten the stability of the financial system of the United States (the ''Second Determination'').\"[11]</p><p>While not all banks have made public their cloud service providers, among major financial institutions, Capital One and Liberty Mutual use Amazon Web Services,[12] Bank of America uses Microsoft Azure,[13] and HSBC uses Google Cloud.[14] Fifty-seven percent of the cloud services market is cornered by those three providers: in the first quarter of this year, Amazon Web Services controlled 33 percent of the market, Microsoft Azure 16 percent, and Google Cloud 8 percent.[15] Given the technical nature of computing services, a firm like Bank of America would not be able to quickly transfer its cloud services to Amazon Web Services, should Microsoft Azure fail. In the interim, while the cloud was nonfunctional, the bank would be unable to perform up to 80 percent of its technological functionspotentially creating significant liquidity disruptions.[16] A lack of substitutability for the services provided by these very few firms creates systemic risk; a disruption at any major cloud computing platform would cause widespread and immediate harm and compromise the stability of the market.</p><p>Additionally, cloud services are not currently subject to an appropriate and enforced regulatory regime. In April, Federal Reserve examiners assessed an Amazon.com facility in Virginia,[17] using their limited power under the Bank Service Company Act to oversee nonbank vendors that provide the software to run banks' deposit and loan platforms.[18] \"Chaperoned by an Amazon employee, they were allowed to review certain documents on Amazon laptops, but not allowed to take anything with them.\"[19] The perfunctory review of a handful of Amazon-selected documents over the course of a few hours, on-site, is not meaningful oversight. Without a dedicated regulatory regime proportional and tailored to their very unique structure and risks, cloud computing companies will continue to evade supervision.</p><p>Our concerns are shared by the world's major financial market regulators. In February of this year, the Financial Stability Boardan international body comprised of the G-20's central banks and supervisorsnoted that Big Tech is invading the financial sector and could upend the stability of the market.[20] In April, top European Union financial regulators issued a report in which they advocated for legislation to monitor cloud computing services that are central to financial institutions. The supervisors highlighted the vulnerabilities implicit in the financial industry's heavy reliance on third parties and noted that their concerns are \"especially acute with regard to cloud services.\"[21]</p><p>Given the serious and far-reaching risks inherent in our reliance on a handful of cloud service providers to maintain the basic functioning of our economy, we ask that you consider designating as SIFMUs the country's largest cloud service providers, including but not limited to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Please respond by September 15th with a description of the FSOC's plan to consider these designations. If the Council will not evaluate the appropriateness of using its authority under 12 U.S.C. 5463 to regulate cloud computing providers, please respond with your reasoning.</p><p>Signed,</p><p># #

Velazquez has issued the following news release:</p><p>Rep. Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez (D-NY) and Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) have written to the Secretary of the U.S Treasury as head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), encouraging the Council to consider designating the three leading cloud-based computing storage providers for the financial industry as systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p>The letter follows last month\u2019s data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation, which exposed the personal information of approximately 106 million Capital One credit card customers and applicants. The personal data of millions of Americans that Capital One was storing was being hosted in a cloud provided by Amazon Web Services, and was breached by a former Amazon employee. This recent incident raises new and serious questions about banks and financial companies\u2019 dependence on cloud services, profoundly worrying lawmakers about the data economy\u2019s risks to public safety and financial stability.</p><p>\u201cI was appalled to learn that millions of hard-working Americans\u2019 personal data had been compromised. Banks and financial institutions\u2019 increasing reliance on cloud service providers for their data storage needs increases the risk these systems pose to the safety and stability of our nation\u2019s financial system,\u201d said Vel\u00e1zquez. \u201cI am proud to partner with Rep. Porter to ensure the data integrity of our financial institutions is maintained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo often we are trying to solve yesterday\u2019s problems tomorrow, instead of making policy that prevents tomorrow\u2019s problems from happening in the first place,\u201d said Porter. \u201cAs our financial system increasingly relies on cloud computing and other forms of technology, we need to ensure the proper 21st century safeguards are in place to prevent another financial crisis.\u201d</p><p>The letter calls on the FSOC to consider designating Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as SIFMUs under the Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. A SIFMU designation would subject the tech firms to enhanced oversight by the Federal Reserve to ensure a cloud failure of a leading financial institution would not create a catastrophic risk to the nation\u2019s financial system.</p><p>A .pdf of the letter is online here and the full text is below.</p><p>August 22, 2019</p><p>The Honorable Steven T. Mnuchin</p><p>Secretary</p><p>U.S Department of the Treasury</p><p>1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W</p><p>Washington, D.C 20220</p><p>Secretary Mnuchin:</p><p>We write to request that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC or the Council) convene a meeting and consider designating the three leading providers of cloud-based storage systems for the financial industry: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud\u2014as systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p>Last month\u2019s data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation (Capital One) was the most recent in a string of incidences demonstrating the dangerous breadth of banks\u2019 and financial institutions\u2019 increasing reliance on cloud computing\u2014and the reach of Amazon Web Services in particular. While it has been determined that an error by Capital One enabled the breach, the incident raises new and serious questions about banks\u2019 and financial institutions\u2019 dependence on cloud services for their data needs\u2014and the risks these systems pose to the safety and stability of the financial system.</p><p>Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to promote stability in the financial system, in part by granting the FSOC the ability to conduct enhanced oversight of Financial Market Utilities (FMUs). Per the Federal Reserve: \u201cIn cases where, among other things, a failure or a disruption to the functioning of an FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the U.S financial system, the FMU may be designated as systemically important.\u201d Title VIII authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to, among other powers, conduct examinations of, take enforcement action against, and prescribe risk management standards for entities designated as systemically important FMUs, or SIFMUs.[1]</p><p>According to the FSOC, it must consider the following four factors when analyzing the appropriateness of a SIFMU designation: \u201c(1) the aggregate monetary value of transactions processed by the FMU; (2) the aggregate exposure of the FMU to its counterparties; (3) the relationship, interdependencies, or other interactions of the FMU with other FMUs or payment, clearing, or settlement activities; and (4) the effect that the failure of or a disruption to the FMU would have on critical markets, financial institutions, or the broader financial system.\u201d[2] Though there are operational differences between cloud service providers and the eight existing SIFMUs, cloud services have become an essential element of our modern financial system and should be overseen commensurately.</p><p>First, though the cloud service providers at issue may not process monetary transactions directly, their operational stability underpins an increasing share of banks\u2019 central functions. For example, Bank of America Corporation intends to deliver 80 percent of its technological functions on virtual platforms and with public cloud infrastructure \u201cwithin the next several years.\u201d[3] According to its Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Azure \u201ccontinues to see strong cloud adoption from the financial services industry, with more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s largest banks and more than 75 percent of the global systemically important financial institutions using Azure.\u201d[4] HSBC\u2019s Chief Information Officer expressed similar sentiments at Google\u2019s 2017 Next conference: \u201cApart from having the $2.4 trillion of assets on the balance sheet, we also have at the core of the company a massive asset in our data, and what\u2019s been happening in the last two to three years is a massive growth in the size of our data assets.\u201d HBSC uses Google Cloud; the volume of data held at the time of the conference was over 100 petabytes\u2014or 100 million gigabytes.[5]</p><p>As data becomes increasingly monetized, hackers become more sophisticated, and firms put more data on servers or the cloud, these breaches are getting more severe. There have been over 9,000 data breaches made public since 2005, which have exposed over 11 billion records in the United States alone.[6] In 2005, 1.4 million credit card numbers and the names on those accounts, held by DSW Shoe Warehouse, were breached\u2014the first time a breach compromised over a million records. In 2017, the Equifax breach exposed the personally identifiable information of 148 million people.[7] First reported in July of this year, a data breach at Capital One, which relies on Amazon Web Services for its data storage, compromised over 100 million Capital One customer accounts and credit card applications.[8] Though cloud service providers may not process monetary transactions like other SIFMUs, these firms provide the world\u2019s biggest banks with the technological foundation necessary to link to one another and other financial and commercial market participants, thereby helping to enable monetary and commercial transactions while simultaneously maintaining their clientele\u2019s most sensitive information and associated assets.</p><p>With regard to the second factor, though there is no direct financial exposure if the cloud fails, the counterparty exposure in the form of a failure to provide the cloud service\u2014and the operational losses that stem from that failure\u2014could be significant.</p><p>Third, the volatility of public confidence in cloud services and the necessity of data integrity to maintaining that confidence is common to all cloud service providers. A data breach or other disruptive event that shakes public perception of the trustworthiness of the cloud could discourage consumers from using cloud-reliant banks and potentially spur a bank run. Should any cloud service provider fail, public mistrust of the service would not be limited to that one company. Particularly given the rapid speed of technological development, enforcing appropriate safeguards is critical to maintaining continued public acceptance of the cloud.</p><p>Fourth, the effect of a disruption to a cloud services provider on the broader financial system could be catastrophic. According to a 2016 report by McKinsey, 100 percent of financial institutions use cloud services in some capacity.[9] In addition to financial institutions, our government has come to rely on Amazon Web Services for a massive share of its data storage needs: the Department of Defense holds a $10 billion cloud computing contract with Amazon Web Services, and NASA and the state of Arizona are also clients of AWS.[10] An Amazon Web Services cloud failure in particular would debilitate major swaths of the financial industry, basic government functions, and our national security.</p><p>It is important to note that not all four factors are weighted equally. According to the FSOC in its 2011 Rule describing the criteria the Council would consider in designating SIFMUs, \u201cthe two critical determinations for an FMU designation are: (1) Whether the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU now or in the future could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets (the \u2018\u2018First Determination\u2019\u2019); and (2) Whether the spread of such liquidity or credit problems among financial institutions or markets could threaten the stability of the financial system of the United States (the \u2018\u2018Second Determination\u2019\u2019).\u201d[11]</p><p>While not all banks have made public their cloud service providers, among major financial institutions, Capital One and Liberty Mutual use Amazon Web Services,[12] Bank of America uses Microsoft Azure,[13] and HSBC uses Google Cloud.[14] Fifty-seven percent of the cloud services market is cornered by those three providers: in the first quarter of this year, Amazon Web Services controlled 33 percent of the market, Microsoft Azure 16 percent, and Google Cloud 8 percent.[15] Given the technical nature of computing services, a firm like Bank of America would not be able to quickly transfer its cloud services to Amazon Web Services, should Microsoft Azure fail. In the interim, while the cloud was nonfunctional, the bank would be unable to perform up to 80 percent of its technological functions\u2014potentially creating significant liquidity disruptions.[16] A lack of substitutability for the services provided by these very few firms creates systemic risk; a disruption at any major cloud computing platform would cause widespread and immediate harm and compromise the stability of the market.</p><p>Additionally, cloud services are not currently subject to an appropriate and enforced regulatory regime. In April, Federal Reserve examiners assessed an Amazon.com facility in Virginia,[17] using their limited power under the Bank Service Company Act to oversee nonbank vendors that provide the software to run banks\u2019 deposit and loan platforms.[18] \u201cChaperoned by an Amazon employee, they were allowed to review certain documents on Amazon laptops, but not allowed to take anything with them.\u201d[19] The perfunctory review of a handful of Amazon-selected documents over the course of a few hours, on-site, is not meaningful oversight. Without a dedicated regulatory regime proportional and tailored to their very unique structure and risks, cloud computing companies will continue to evade supervision.</p><p>Our concerns are shared by the world\u2019s major financial market regulators. In February of this year, the Financial Stability Board\u2014an international body comprised of the G-20\u2019s central banks and supervisors\u2014noted that Big Tech is invading the financial sector and could upend the stability of the market.[20] In April, top European Union financial regulators issued a report in which they advocated for legislation to monitor cloud computing services that are central to financial institutions. The supervisors highlighted the vulnerabilities implicit in the financial industry\u2019s heavy reliance on third parties and noted that their concerns are \u201cespecially acute with regard to cloud services.\u201d[21]</p><p>Given the serious and far-reaching risks inherent in our reliance on a handful of cloud service providers to maintain the basic functioning of our economy, we ask that you consider designating as SIFMUs the country\u2019s largest cloud service providers, including but not limited to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Please respond by September 15th with a description of the FSOC\u2019s plan to consider these designations. If the Council will not evaluate the appropriateness of using its authority under 12 U.S.C \u00a7 5463 to regulate cloud computing providers, please respond with your reasoning.</p><p>Signed,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2337309I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX6-3CJ1-JDG9-Y2FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 26, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Katie Porter (D-CA) have written to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury as head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), encouraging the Council to consider designating the three leading cloud-based computing storage providers for the financial industry as systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The letter follows last month's data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation, which exposed the personal information of approximately 106 million Capital One credit card customers and applicants. The personal data of millions of Americans that Capital One was storing was being hosted in a cloud provided by Amazon Web Services, and was breached by a former Amazon employee. This recent incident raises new and serious questions about banks and financial companies' dependence on cloud services, profoundly worrying lawmakers about the data economy's risks to public safety and financial stability.</p><p>\"I was appalled to learn that millions of hard-working Americans' personal data had been compromised. Banks and financial institutions' increasing reliance on cloud service providers for their data storage needs increases the risk these systems pose to the safety and stability of our nation's financial system,\" said Velazquez. \"I am proud to partner with Rep. Porter to ensure the data integrity of our financial institutions is maintained.\"</p><p>\"Too often we are trying to solve yesterday's problems tomorrow, instead of making policy that prevents tomorrow's problems from happening in the first place,\" said Porter. \"As our financial system increasingly relies on cloud computing and other forms of technology, we need to ensure the proper 21st century safeguards are in place to prevent another financial crisis.\"</p><p>The letter calls on the FSOC to consider designating Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as SIFMUs under the Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. A SIFMU designation would subject the tech firms to enhanced oversight by the Federal Reserve to ensure a cloud failure of a leading financial institution would not create a catastrophic risk to the nation's financial system.</p><p>A .pdf of the letter is online here <url normalizedValue=\"https://velazquez.house.gov/sites/velazquez.house.gov/files/FSOC%20cloud%20.pdf\">https://velazquez.house.gov/sites/velazquez.house.gov/files/FSOC%20cloud%20.pdf</url> and the full text is below.</p><p>August 22, 2019</p><p>The Honorable Steven T. Mnuchin</p><p>Secretary</p><p>U.S. Department of the Treasury</p><p>1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.</p><p>Washington, D.C. 20220</p><p>Secretary Mnuchin:</p><p>We write to request that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC or the Council) convene a meeting and consider designating the three leading providers of cloud-based storage systems for the financial industry: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud--as systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs).</p><p>Last month's data breach at Capital One Financial Corporation (Capital One) was the most recent in a string of incidences demonstrating the dangerous breadth of banks' and financial institutions' increasing reliance on cloud computing--and the reach of Amazon Web Services in particular. While it has been determined that an error by Capital One enabled the breach, the incident raises new and serious questions about banks' and financial institutions' dependence on cloud services for their data needs--and the risks these systems pose to the safety and stability of the financial system.</p><p>Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to promote stability in the financial system, in part by granting the FSOC the ability to conduct enhanced oversight of Financial Market Utilities (FMUs). Per the Federal Reserve: \"In cases where, among other things, a failure or a disruption to the functioning of an FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system, the FMU may be designated as systemically important.\" Title VIII authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to, among other powers, conduct examinations of, take enforcement action against, and prescribe risk management standards for entities designated as systemically important FMUs, or SIFMUs.[1]</p><p>According to the FSOC, it must consider the following four factors when analyzing the appropriateness of a SIFMU designation: \"(1) the aggregate monetary value of transactions processed by the FMU; (2) the aggregate exposure of the FMU to its counterparties; (3) the relationship, interdependencies, or other interactions of the FMU with other FMUs or payment, clearing, or settlement activities; and (4) the effect that the failure of or a disruption to the FMU would have on critical markets, financial institutions, or the broader financial system.\"[2] Though there are operational differences between cloud service providers and the eight existing SIFMUs, cloud services have become an essential element of our modern financial system and should be overseen commensurately.</p><p>First, though the cloud service providers at issue may not process monetary transactions directly, their operational stability underpins an increasing share of banks' central functions. For example, Bank of America Corporation intends to deliver 80 percent of its technological functions on virtual platforms and with public cloud infrastructure \"within the next several years.\"[3] According to its Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Azure \"continues to see strong cloud adoption from the financial services industry, with more than 80 percent of the world's largest banks and more than 75 percent of the global systemically important financial institutions using Azure.\"[4] HSBC's Chief Information Officer expressed similar sentiments at Google's 2017 Next conference: \"Apart from having the $2.4 trillion of assets on the balance sheet, we also have at the core of the company a massive asset in our data, and what's been happening in the last two to three years is a massive growth in the size of our data assets.\" HBSC uses Google Cloud; the volume of data held at the time of the conference was over 100 petabytes--or 100 million gigabytes.[5]</p><p>As data becomes increasingly monetized, hackers become more sophisticated, and firms put more data on servers or the cloud, these breaches are getting more severe. There have been over 9,000 data breaches made public since 2005, which have exposed over 11 billion records in the United States alone.[6] In 2005, 1.4 million credit card numbers and the names on those accounts, held by DSW Shoe Warehouse, were breached--the first time a breach compromised over a million records. In 2017, the Equifax breach exposed the personally identifiable information of 148 million people.[7] First reported in July of this year, a data breach at Capital One, which relies on Amazon Web Services for its data storage, compromised over 100 million Capital One customer accounts and credit card applications.[8] Though cloud service providers may not process monetary transactions like other SIFMUs, these firms provide the world's biggest banks with the technological foundation necessary to link to one another and other financial and commercial market participants, thereby helping to enable monetary and commercial transactions while simultaneously maintaining their clientele's most sensitive information and associated assets.</p><p>With regard to the second factor, though there is no direct financial exposure if the cloud fails, the counterparty exposure in the form of a failure to provide the cloud service--and the operational losses that stem from that failure--could be significant.</p><p>Third, the volatility of public confidence in cloud services and the necessity of data integrity to maintaining that confidence is common to all cloud service providers. A data breach or other disruptive event that shakes public perception of the trustworthiness of the cloud could discourage consumers from using cloud-reliant banks and potentially spur a bank run. Should any cloud service provider fail, public mistrust of the service would not be limited to that one company. Particularly given the rapid speed of technological development, enforcing appropriate safeguards is critical to maintaining continued public acceptance of the cloud.</p><p>Fourth, the effect of a disruption to a cloud services provider on the broader financial system could be catastrophic. According to a 2016 report by McKinsey, 100 percent of financial institutions use cloud services in some capacity.[9] In addition to financial institutions, our government has come to rely on Amazon Web Services for a massive share of its data storage needs: the Department of Defense holds a $10 billion cloud computing contract with Amazon Web Services, and NASA and the state of Arizona are also clients of AWS.[10] An Amazon Web Services cloud failure in particular would debilitate major swaths of the financial industry, basic government functions, and our national security.</p><p>It is important to note that not all four factors are weighted equally. According to the FSOC in its 2011 Rule describing the criteria the Council would consider in designating SIFMUs, \"the two critical determinations for an FMU designation are: (1) Whether the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU now or in the future could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets (the ''First Determination''); and (2) Whether the spread of such liquidity or credit problems among financial institutions or markets could threaten the stability of the financial system of the United States (the ''Second Determination'').\"[11]</p><p>While not all banks have made public their cloud service providers, among major financial institutions, Capital One and Liberty Mutual use Amazon Web Services,[12] Bank of America uses Microsoft Azure,[13] and HSBC uses Google Cloud.[14] Fifty-seven percent of the cloud services market is cornered by those three providers: in the first quarter of this year, Amazon Web Services controlled 33 percent of the market, Microsoft Azure 16 percent, and Google Cloud 8 percent.[15] Given the technical nature of computing services, a firm like Bank of America would not be able to quickly transfer its cloud services to Amazon Web Services, should Microsoft Azure fail. In the interim, while the cloud was nonfunctional, the bank would be unable to perform up to 80 percent of its technological functions--potentially creating significant liquidity disruptions.[16] A lack of substitutability for the services provided by these very few firms creates systemic risk; a disruption at any major cloud computing platform would cause widespread and immediate harm and compromise the stability of the market.</p><p>Additionally, cloud services are not currently subject to an appropriate and enforced regulatory regime. In April, Federal Reserve examiners assessed an Amazon.com facility in Virginia,[17] using their limited power under the Bank Service Company Act to oversee nonbank vendors that provide the software to run banks' deposit and loan platforms.[18] \"Chaperoned by an Amazon employee, they were allowed to review certain documents on Amazon laptops, but not allowed to take anything with them.\"[19] The perfunctory review of a handful of Amazon-selected documents over the course of a few hours, on-site, is not meaningful oversight. Without a dedicated regulatory regime proportional and tailored to their very unique structure and risks, cloud computing companies will continue to evade supervision.</p><p>Our concerns are shared by the world's major financial market regulators. In February of this year, the Financial Stability Board--an international body comprised of the G-20's central banks and supervisors--noted that Big Tech is invading the financial sector and could upend the stability of the market.[20] In April, top European Union financial regulators issued a report in which they advocated for legislation to monitor cloud computing services that are central to financial institutions. The supervisors highlighted the vulnerabilities implicit in the financial industry's heavy reliance on third parties and noted that their concerns are \"especially acute with regard to cloud services.\"[21]</p><p>Given the serious and far-reaching risks inherent in our reliance on a handful of cloud service providers to maintain the basic functioning of our economy, we ask that you consider designating as SIFMUs the country's largest cloud service providers, including but not limited to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Please respond by September 15th with a description of the FSOC's plan to consider these designations. If the Council will not evaluate the appropriateness of using its authority under 12 U.S.C. [Sec.] 5463 to regulate cloud computing providers, please respond with your reasoning.</p><p>Signed,</p><p>[1] \"Designated Financial Market Utilities: Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act,\" Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/title-viii-dfa.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/title-viii-dfa.htm</url></p><p>[2] Dodd-Frank Act section 804(a)(2); 12 U.S.C.

I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live from London for you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin the program in a nation hoping for change but bracing for violence. Massive street protests are expected to get under way in the coming hours across Venezuela. The opposition leader, Juan Guaido, called for the protests that started last week to continue today in an effort to push President Nicolas Maduro from power. Guaido has declared himself interim president to the country but says he wants a transitional government and fresh elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Maduro meanwhile told Russian state news he is willing to meet with the opposition, but he's ruled out new elections until 2025. Maduro himself was re-elected last year but the United States and more than a dozen other countries do not recognize his presidency as legitimate. Now, we have multiple reporters covering this story for you. Journalist Stefano Pozzebon is in Caracas where the protests are about to start. Good to see you. CNN's Nick Payton Walsh also in neighboring Columbia. Nick spent the past week undercover in Venezuela with members of the opposition. We also have CNN's Fred Pleitgen. Fred's in Moscow. And Russia has, of course, has been President Maduro's closest ally through all of this.</p><p>So Stefano, let's come to you first, the epicenter of all of this in the Venezuelan capital. Protests have been called for today. What's the mood in the capital right now?</p><p>STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: OK, they're doing it right now.</p><p>JONES: I think we are having a few technical problems speaking to Stefano, he is obviously in Caracas, in the Venezuelan capital at the moment. Nick Peyton Walsh is in neighboring Columbia for us. He has, as I just said in the introduction, he has spent the last week undercover in Venezuela as well. And Nick, question to you, there have been a number of moves now by Venezuelan state institutions to clamp down on the self-declared interim- president, Juan Guaido, the opposition leader. And this all comes at a time when international allies have come to his aid as well. What are the current restrictions on Mr. Guaido?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he's been told by the Attorney General of Venezuela that his bank account is frozen, he can't leave the country. They say they are investigating him, but I got to point out here, they stopped short of calling for his arrest. Remember this is a man who has sworn himself in, in front of a crowd of hundreds of thousands under what he says is the appropriate legislation as the interim president of the country. He could have a more basic challenge to the power of the Maduro government. But they did try just over a week or so ago to arrest him, but he was quickly released. In fact the Maduro government saying the whole thing had been a misunderstanding and I think that shows you really the contradiction here, on Guaido, clearly enjoys a lot of popular support and we'll see on the streets moving forward exactly how that translates into protest size this afternoon.</p><p>But he has an enormous impediment inside the country. Just a reality check here. He isn't running the country. He doesn't his hands on the levers of power at this point. He has a lot of people supporting him. But he can't get money in, obviously, his bank accounts have been frozen. He does have access to some of the Venezuelan state assets that the U.S. have frozen, they deemed him the person with the power over that money. And that could have a massive impact down the line, as the Maduro government begins to run out of cash, and therefore can no longer buy the loyalty of the elite around it. But they still control the borders, the army, the police, the state institutions, so he has a lot of international support.</p><p>He's just tweeted his appreciation to Donald Trump today. Who said that the Maduro government was willing to talk to the opposition. That's not new. That's been the case for a number of weeks. But also advised Americans not to travel to Venezuela. Well, I should also say that it's been State Department advice for quite some time.</p><p>But were reaching a moment here where I think we'll learn in the next few days exactly what the next steps are. Juan Guaido is trying to act like he is an alternative government. Practically, I think that's incredibly difficult. But the basic challenge is for ordinary Venezuelans on the streets, what really, I think is fueling these protest. You saw Stefano there, you know, simple mobile phone connections almost impossible in some areas. It does get worse when it comes to try to feed yourself, there's hyperinflation. So we talk about this in terms of geopolitics, of Washington support for Guaido, and Moscow's undying support for the Maduro government.</p><p>And people standing on the streets there today, the real question is, what am I going to eat tonight -- Hannah.</p><p>JONES: Yes, Nick thanks very much. Standby for us. You were just talking there about the telecommunications problems within Venezuela at the moment.</p><p>[10:05:00] We are going to try and re-establish that connection with Stefano Pozzebon, who's standing for us in Caracas right now. Stefano, if you can hear me, just explain the mood right now in the Venezuelan capital.</p><p>POZZEBON: Well, the mood here in Caracas is from one side, there's a lot of expectations about today's protest, about next Saturday's protest, about what is happening in the country. The first time in years that the opposition has a clear path, and real shot at in taking Maduro out of power and taking Maduro out of government. But at the same time, there is a lot of worrying here in Caracas because of what happened yesterday, with oil sanctions against the giant oil company here in Venezuela, PDVSA.</p><p>Today, we were out on the street, and we filmed with scores of cars trying to fill up their tank, as long as they can. Because the feeling is that next week, they may not even be able to fill up the tank. And it is country where you have difficulty of feeding yourself, you have difficulty finding medicines, and yet, with yet another difficulties in terms of transportation, finding petrol will become even more, even more difficult. And will add to further pressure on Nicolas Maduro to open a negotiating table and to try a way out of the stalemate. Back to you.</p><p>JONES: Stefano, thanks very much indeed. And for talking through those telecommunications problems.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen is standing by for us in Moscow now. Russia, of course, is a big player in what is going none Venezuela. And we know, Fred, that Nicolas Maduro, the current president at least on Venezuela has very much turned to Russia and its state media as well to be its sort of mouthpiece. And just explain for our viewers then what is Russia's vested interest in Venezuela right now?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they have a massive vested interest, Hannah. They have big economic relations with the Maduro government, certainly some oil deals very much going on. So the Russians really very much in the corner of Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Also if you look back to late last year, the Russians even flew two strategic bombers to Venezuela, and want to expand military cooperation as well. There is a lot of contact between Vladimir Putin and Nicolas Maduro. And the Russians have stated again and again that they are firmly in his corner. Now they even say, Vladimir Putin has said in the past that they believe that the protests that have been going on in Venezuela have been induced from the outside. Obviously, them very much blaming the United States. Nicolas Maduro in that interview that he gave today to RIA -- one of the state-run news agencies here in Russia -- essentially saying the same thing. Let's listen in to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We have Russia's full support at every level. And we welcome it gladly. And very gratefully. What did I ask President Putin? To stay in permanent contact.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN: So there you have Nicolas Maduro talking about the fact that he has those close relation, that close relationship with Vladimir Putin. Also I think quite interesting to see the video of that interview, the informal setting that it happened in. Obviously, him just sitting there at his desk. Interesting also from that interview -- at least the part that he gave to RIA -- was that he also said that he believed that President Trump was trying to kill him. And he said that he was trying to do that in conjunction with the authorities of the neighboring country of Columbia. And that he blamed President Trump and said they would be accountable if something happens to him.</p><p>So certainly, you can see the stakes are very high. And one of the things that we see here in Moscow is that the Russians, just very, very much in the corner of Nicolas Maduro, being very critical of the United States. And even saying that they believe that what is happening right now is happening there, because the U.S. is essentially meddling in Venezuelan affairs -- Hannah.</p><p>JONES: Fred, thanks very much. Let's get back to Nick Payton Walsh who is in Columbia for us. Nick has spent the last week or so undercover in Venezuela as well.</p><p>Nick, from your perspective, now that we hear all this talk that perhaps Maduro might be willing to hold negotiations with the opposition, there are still mutterings of foreign intervention, military or otherwise. How do you see this playing out, particularly if we see the people, protests on the street today?</p><p>WALSH: I don't know about the negotiations, he said we do that. The charge d'affaires representing the Venezuelan opposition, recognized by the U.S. administration in Washington said, they are not interested in Maduro. But Maduro's caveat is, I'm not having new elections, I'm still the president essentially.</p><p>The one key thing here is, who's president is not really up for discussion. So I think we can park the idea of a negotiated settlement to some degree to one side. So the question really is when does the clock that's ticking, clearly in Nicolas Maduro's head tier telling him he is running out of money. Now we don't see a sign of that immediately but it's essential for him keeping a grip on the military. The generals there seem to have their subordinates under control, or certainly fearful of an uprising at this point. And also, the elite around him too. When that runs out, he's really in trouble.</p><p>The other question is what happens on the streets right now.</p><p>[10:10:00] Now the protests we saw on the 23rd of January, they were peaceful, frankly. They were polite. They were angry, yes, but turned up for a few hours, expressed their support of Juan Guaido. Watched him swear himself in, Swear in fact, alongside him symbolically too. But they went home after a few hours.</p><p>Do they stay out longer today? Do they match the size and crowd? I have to say there's always a risk of violence or bloodshed or even crushes when it comes to these number of people, without crowd control in an area like that. Everybody will be hoping to avoid that today. And I should point out, we saw no attempt by the Maduro government last week, to be violent towards the peaceful massive protesters that were listening to Juan Guaido swear himself in.</p><p>The clashes occurred at the edge of the protest near a military base where some youthful protests threw stones and a sort of standoff has been going on frankly for months now. So we have to wait and see how these protests play out, the numbers on the street. And also, too, you're going to be calculating if you're a Maduro supporter --</p><p>JONES: And it looks like we have just lost our connection there to Nick. Nick's in Columbia for us. But my thanks to awful our team, to Fred, Nick, and Stefano as well.</p><p>Let's move on now to a different story. And a crisis over a rather different kind. The U.K. is facing its own chaotic cross-roads, as it asks what is the next step for Brexit. For its part, Parliament is backing a new plan by Prime Minister Theresa May to return to Brussels to get concessions on her divorce agreement. But Europe's leaders maintain it is a done deal and cannot be renegotiated or even reopened.</p><p>Before she even faces Brussels, Mrs. May is set to meet with the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn this hour. She'll also telephone European Council President Donald Tusk and, of course, her Irish counterpart as well, to discuss the crucial sticking point of the Irish backstop.</p><p>Now, let's get over to two of the major hubs in this Brexit debate, Phil Black is live on Downing Street for us here in London. Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels, which is of course the de facto heart of the European Union.</p><p>Phil, to you first. It was a win of sorts at least for the Prime Minister last night. She says she is going to go back to Brussels with alternative arrangements to the backstop. Has she been able to give at least Parliament today any clarity on what those alternative arrangements might be?</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You would have to say not really, Hannah. I think as you say, this refers to the backstop. The hypothetical but potentially indefinite sharing of regulation, customs notably in the future, between Britain and Europe, to prevent a hard border on the Irish border in the future. So what we've heard today, from government, is talk about a time limit on those arrangements, or perhaps a mechanism so that Britain can pull out of them unilaterally or the possibility that technology can somehow be used to be sure there is never any hard border infrastructure there.</p><p>All of this has been talked about before. All of this has been rejected by the EU previously. There is also talk about a new compromise that been hashed out by opposing wings of the ruling Conservative Party. But the early indications from Europe are that it's not a starter.</p><p>So today in Parliament, the opposition leader, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, pushed the Prime Minister on how the quest for vague alternative arrangements could change the deal, could result in a deal that is suitable to everyone. Here is a little of what the Prime Minister said in Parliament today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: What has been absolutely clear, is my contacts with European leaders, is that they want a deal. What this House voted for last night is to leave the European Union with a deal. But it also crucially showed what it will take to see support in this House for a deal in the future. I think the plan that was set out last night shows that we can obtain a substantial and sustainable majority in this House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLACK: So you heard the Prime Minister there essentially saying that last night's vote on this amendment to find alternative arrangements to the backstop is essentially Parliament saying to her, saying to Europe, this is what we need to pass a withdrawal agreement. That is true. But you have to say only to a point. Because while the current backstop arrangements are widely hated within the Conservative Party and others, they are hated to varying degrees. So short of stripping out that entire section of the withdrawal agreement, you have to think it is unlikely that she can come up with an arrangement that can satisfy all of the people that majority that voted in favor of that amendment last night.</p><p>And the other point of course is that the backstop arrangement, as it pertains to the Irish border is, not the only thing in the withdrawal agreement that people don't like. It's not the only potential deal breaker. So those could cost her votes and ultimately a majority of support on any potential withdrawal agreement as well. She said she's got a mandate to go back to Brussels now. But if you look at this from pretty much every angle, it really does look like a mandate to try and achieve the impossible -- Hannah.</p><p>JONES: Phil, thanks very much. Let's go over to Erin. Erin is standing by for us in Brussels now. Erin, it does seem that renegotiations have sort of begun in earnest, even if not formally. They've begun in terms of conversations over the phone and like.</p><p>[10:15:00] And plans for travel to go and meet each other and talk once more. Given that, does that suggest that there is at least some wiggle room from the EU on this?</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Hannah, I was just on the phone with an EU official, who told me he was left scratching his head at what played out in Westminster yesterday. They want clarity from the United Kingdom, specifically what Theresa May means, in terms of this amendment, seeking alternative arrangements. What sort of arrangements would possibly help this situation? And that's why I think the phone calls that are scheduled for later today between Prime Minister May, and Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, as well as the Irish Taoiseach, are critical. They're going to be looking to her for a detailed plan, how she intends fix this situation.</p><p>In the meantime, we're hearing once again from EU leaders and officials rallying around Dublin and we heard from the Leo Varadkar, of the Irish Taoiseach, earlier today, say that the withdrawal agreement is not open for negotiation. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEO VARADKAR, IRISH PRIME MINISTER: As President Tusk said yesterday, we are not offering renegotiation and renegotiation is not on the table. There is no plan to organize an emergency summons to change any changes to the guidelines. Nor is there any pressure to hold one. I do not know what those alternative arrangements are. And we've been down that track before. And I don't believe that such alternative arrangements exist.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: And I was speaking to a senior EU official prior to the vote, and he was telling me that it was his belief that the withdrawal agreement was not open for renegotiation. But he said that that doesn't mean some other solution could be found.</p><p>The problem here is, is that Theresa May took the Brady Amendment which was vague in wording and explicitly said before the House of Commons that she wants the withdrawal agreement reopened. That she wants to revisit the issue of the backstop, which is a crimson red line, said time and time again, for the EU. So it's really unclear at this point where she goes from here. She has few options.</p><p>JONES: She certainly does. And I guess, you know, the main point being as well, that even if she does secure an opening over the withdrawal agreement, it may not be just the backstop that is open for renegotiation, the EU might have something else up its sleeve as well. We have to leave it there. My thanks to you both, to Erin and to Phil. Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>All right, still to come on the program, trade talks between the United States and China have now resumed. But charges files against Chinese tech giant, Huawei, are hanging over these crucial meetings. We are covering the story from opposite sides of the world coming up next.</p><p>[10:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: You are watching CNN. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you. Welcome back.</p><p>Now, to the United States where escalating tensions are threatening critical trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Beijing's top trade negotiator is in Washington for two days of high stakes meetings with a deadline to reach a trade agreement just over a month away. Now, if a deal isn't reached, there is a risk the U.S. will impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.</p><p>But criminal charges brought by the United States against Chinese tech giant, Huawei, will surely cloud discussions between the two nations. And now the U.S. has requested at the extradition of the company's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, from Canada, for allegedly helping Huawei dodge Iran sanctions. CNN's Cristina Alesci joins us from the New York Stock Exchange. But first of all let go over to our Matt Rivers. And Matt's live for us in Beijing with the Chinese perspective on all of this. Matt, first of all, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says that the Huawei criminal case is a separate issue. But how big a factor does the Chinese think it is to the trade negotiations happening in Washington today?</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I mean there's no doubt that this is going to be a topic of discussion. I mean you have President Trump last month, in an interview with \"Reuters\" actually admitting that the Meng Wanzhou case, the Huawei case, could absolutely have something to do with the negotiations overall. It could be used as some sort of leverage for the United States. He's openly said that. And so you know or at least can expect, it's extremely likely that this case is going to have something to do with these negotiations.</p><p>One thing that is very interesting, though, Hannah, is China's initial response to the indictments that the United States levied against Huawei. Really what they did was repeat denials against wrongdoing -- of denials of wrongdoing that the United States has already accused Huawei of, and they didn't take it any further. They didn't increase the rhetoric, they didn't make it any more heated. And I think you can look at that and say they did that because they don't want the Huawei case to scuttle these trade talks. Yes, it's going to be a discussion, but so far it doesn't appear that the Chinese are going to let that completely throw off any prospect of a trade deal.</p><p>JONES: OK, Cristina is standing by for us now at the New York Stock Exchange . And the clock is ticking for these trade talks already, just a month to go to try and get some kind of deal and avoid these further tariffs. What impacts have the tariffs had so far on what is essentially a global slowdown? How are the markets reacting?</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well one respected research firm estimates that if this does go on, if the trade war does go on, then global growth could dip below 2 percent. Which would be an enormously negative impact, which would have an enormously impact on the market.</p><p>Look, the administration, the Trump administration will try and spin that and say it's going to impact China more than it impacts the U.S., but as time goes on that, is less true. We are seeing signs that in fact large companies like industrial equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar, for example, is taking a hit because of tariffs. We had tech darling, Apple warned that tariffs are also causing trouble for it to be able to generate the kind of revenue that they have historically generated, especially in China.</p><p>So these are little data points that show that pressure on the U.S. is ramping up. And what's different now than what was true a few months ago, is that Trump does want a deal done. Now, whether or not they can reach an agreement that will satisfy the trade hawks in the administration is still yet to be seen. There are still big issues like forced technology transfer, and nontariff barriers, that have nothing to do with the trade imbalance, that need to be addressed.</p><p>JONES: Yes, and Christina, I said earlier that you were at the Stock Exchange, you're obviously in our New York bureau, my apologies for that. Who has the most leverage at the moment, going into these trade talks? Is it China or the U.S.? And what would each have to concede in order to try and deescalate this?</p><p>ALESCI: Well, going into this meeting a few months ago, it did seem like the U.S. had a little bit more leverage, because our economy was strong, jobs obviously, our unemployment rate was very low. And the Chinese economy was showing signs of weakness, the Chinese government had to step in, and take some measures to prevent further fallout.</p><p>[10:25:00] But now, as time goes on, the both sides are going to feel the pain and I'm not sure that either side has a tremendous amount of leverage over the other one. What it'll take is essentially the hawks in the administration, Peter Navarro, and to a certain extent Robert Lighthizer, who is the U.S. trade representative, to really soften their approach and sort of move in the direction of the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who has been pushing for a deal to come together. But the two sides, even within the administration, remain far apart. So that is the biggest challenge right now to trade talks.</p><p>JONES: Matt Rivers, still standing by for us in Beijing. Matt, the backdrop to all of this and has sort of raised tensions between the U.S. and China is that now we're hearing Chinese counter-intelligence is potentially the biggest challenge to the United States. How is that kind of rhetoric being received where you are in Beijing?</p><p>RIVERS: Well, I mean they always deny that. But the fact of the matter is that most objective analysis would suggest that the United States is absolutely right, when they say that. That companies like Huawei and other big tech giants are absolutely beholden to Beijing. I mean there are Communist Party members that sit on the board of almost every private major company in China. I mean it is absolutely true. I think you could argue, that these companies have to answer to Beijing.</p><p>So when the United States does what they did for a company like Huawei, for example, they're basically setting precedent. Say to the Chinese companies, that want to do what they've done, or what they accuse Huawei of doing, which is stealing intellectual property, flouting international law but at least at this point the United States is not going to stand for that. And I think that you have a lot of people who might disagree with the Trump administration in a lot of other ways, who might disagree with tariffs. You might disagree with not using international support to counter the Chinese. But I think for the first time, in a long time, you're seeing a U.S. administration really back up some of these claims that have been complaints against Chinese company for a very long time. The Justice Department really taking the kind of concrete steps that we haven't really seen before, and if that continues, that will fundamentally change the way that Chinese companies interact with the United States.</p><p>JONES: Matt Rivers in Beijing, Cristina Alesci in New York, thank you.</p><p>Live from London, this is CONNECT THE WORLD. Still to come on the program, President Trump pushes back against his own intelligence chief assessments on ISIS, Iran, and North Korea. And then, a popular general turned politician, formally kicks off his campaign to unseat the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. A lot more on that after this break.</p><p>[10:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: You're watching CNN. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London. Welcome back to you.</p><p>And an update now on our top story and the crisis in Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump called the opposition leader Juan Guaido today and he reiterated his support for the self-declared interim president. Antigovernment protests are expected in the Venezuelan capital Caracas in the coming hours. Mr. Guaido tweeted he appreciates the U.S. President's support.</p><p>Now, meantime, the U.S. President Donald Trump is firing back today at his own intelligence chief, suggesting they should perhaps, quote, go back to school. He's been tweeting up something of a storm. On the defensive after his director of national intelligence, and other top officials, contradicted his assessment of security threats from ISIS, to Iran, to North Korea. Here is just one example.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN COATS, U.S. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: We currently assess that North Korea will seek to retain its WMD capabilities and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities because its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Well, as you'd imagine, that is not sitting well with Mr. Trump. Let's bring in our senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns, for more on all of this. So there is clearly a gap then, Joe, between Donald Trump and his intelligence chief. How big is that gap though and how dangerous could it be?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That's anybody's question and anybody's answer, I think. But I can tell you this, there's always been an antagonistic relationship, if you will, Hannah, between this administration and the intelligence community, almost from the very start. And the news is now, that two years along, it hasn't gotten any better.</p><p>The intelligence chiefs on Capitol Hill delivering what is known as the worldwide threat assessment, showing a lot of daylight between themselves and the President of the United States on a variety of issues. You had just one example there. I think there is another very striking example in the views of ISIS. The intelligence chiefs say that in their view, ISIS is looking to reconstitute, still has thousands and thousands of fighters. The President has said at one time, that ISIS has been defeated, in fact, and some of his people in his administration have said that publicly as well.</p><p>The President taking to Twitter this morning, essentially offering his own rebuttal, if you will, saying the caliphate will soon be destroyed. There's one point in the President's tweets where he's almost resorted to personal attack. And that is, he tweets the intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive, when it comes to the dangers of Iran, they are wrong. That's important, because the intelligence chiefs have assessed that Iran at the current time is not taking the steps necessary to build a nuclear weapon.</p><p>So what does all this mean? It's important to our allies, and it's important to foreign diplomats around the world, because there is this continuing view that the United States has an often inconsistent or even contradictory message about hot spots around the world. This is just one example of why -- Hannah.</p><p>JONES: And Joe, another pressing domestic battle ground for the President is of course the ongoing talks over this border wall and funding.</p><p>[10:35:00] And whether there will be another government shutdown. More talks potentially today.</p><p>JOHNS: Right. More talks today on Capitol Hill. This is a conference committee. Pretty rare these days. Between Democrats and Republicans, seeking to come up with some type of a border security agreement that they can live with and the President might sign. The President himself tweeting to those conference committee member, telling them essentially that if they are not considering a wall or a border barrier, they are wasting their time. Important there, because they have until February 15 to come up with another agreement, or there's potential danger of yet another government shutdown after the longest in American history -- Hannah.</p><p>JONES: Joe Johns, live for us there outside the White House. Thanks very much, Joe.</p><p>We turn our attention now to Israel, where a retired general is finally breaking his silence, spelling out his plan to take on Benjamin Netanyahu. A former army chief, Benny Gantz, could be the Prime Minister's toughest rival in upcoming elections. He formally launching his campaign on Tuesday night, positioning himself as the new broom that would sweep out corruption. Gantz also accused the current administration of encouraging, quote, incitement, subversion and hatred. Now Mr. Netanyahu's party is slamming Gantz as a weak leftist but the record may show otherwise. Let's bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann to explain it all for us. Oren, first of all, exactly is Benny Gantz, and what are his prospects, his legitimate chances of actually defeating Netanyahu?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well one political analyst called Benny Gantz the flavor of the election. Saying he was now the big name here, to take on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He is famous for having been the IDF, the Israeli military chief of staff -- the former chief of staff, that is, through two wars with Gaza, 2012 and 2014. And that certainly carries with it -- especially in Israel -- a certain amount of security credibility. Giving him an ability to attack Benjamin Netanyahu who has always positioned himself as Mr. Security.</p><p>And on that note, at his big election kickoff on Tuesday night, Gantz was joined by a former IDF chief of staff -- another one that is -- as well as a former defense minister who has recently joined his party trying to boost his security credibility. And it looks to be on that point that Netanyahu will try to take on the current Mr. Security, that is Netanyahu.</p><p>What kind of chances does he have now? Look, it's difficult to tell. In some of the preliminary polls that have come out -- that have come out -- he's gotten a nice little bump in his numbers perhaps at the expense of the centrist or leftist parties. We'll see if that holds. He still falls quite a ways behind Netanyahu himself and it is Netanyahu that has defines politics right now. So, we'll see how the election shape the over the coming months. But as of right now, this is a very brief glance, it is Gantz that appears to be the number one competitor here.</p><p>JONES: And he's been branded a leftist by Netanyahu and Netanyahu's party and supporters. Is he, though, a leftist? And what could his victory mean, if we suddenly saw an Israeli Prime Minister who was left or center left, at least? What could that mean for Israeli politics and regional security in general?</p><p>LIEBERMANN: So historically Israeli right and left have been defined on one's position on a peace process, one's positions of making concessions to Palestinians in a peace process. Given that, listen part of what Gantz said in his introductory campaign kickoff speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENNY GANTZ, FORMER IDF CHIEF (through translator): Israel will not be deprived of its status as a strong Jewish and democratic state. We will strengthen the settlement blocks in the Golan Heights from which we will never retreat. The Jordan Valley will remain our eastern security border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIEBERMANN: He also talked about a united Jerusalem remaining Israel's capital. In addition you heard him talk about strengthening the settlement blocks, hanging on to the Golan Heights, a security presence in the Jordan Valley. This is certainly not the talk of a leftist. This would have been defined of somebody who is on the right quite recently in Israeli politics. But ostensibly what defines right from left in Israeli politics these days is whether you support Netanyahu or not. If you do, you're on the right. If you oppose him in any way, his coalition, his backers will brand you as a leftist. What would it mean for Israeli politics if Gantz wins? Well it could be a dramatic shift of policy or not. If you actually look at where Netanyahu stands on most of the issues and where Gantz stands, there is not that much of a different. A lot of the question is, Netanyahu himself and will he continue if he is indicted, Gantz's answer was, he would not support an indicted Prime Minister.</p><p>JONES: All right, Oren, live for us there in Jerusalem, thanks very much indeed.</p><p>And now the odds that Britain will drop out of the European Union without a deal by March 29 are hovering currently around three to one. And no group is taking the possibility of no deal more seriously than British businesses. The director -- director general, rather, of the Confederation of British Industry says firms might soon accelerate their no-deal planning after events in Parliament last night.</p><p>[10:40:00] When only two of seven amendments to Theresa May's Brexit plan were actually voted through. Meaning she will head back to Brussels in an attempt at seeking a renegotiation with the EU.</p><p>Now, most European markets are slightly higher today, suggesting those votes in Parliament that we saw last night, investors have fared and trade talks, of course, between China and the U.S. -- that we were telling you about earlier. That's all firmly on their minds today. And the pound has been recovering after falling sharply against the dollar on news that Theresa May will attempt to reopen the withdrawal talks. And you can see at the moment, currently down again. Now Vicky Pryce is an economist at the Center for Economic and Business Research and former chief economic adviser to the British government's business department. As you can see, she joins me now. Vicky, good to see you. We know that businesses like certainty. Given what we saw last night, is the business community feeling any more certain about Theresa May's prospects at renegotiating this deal?</p><p>VICKY PRYCE, ECONOMIST, CENTER FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS RESEARCH: I would say the opposite. There has been uncertainty for the last two and a half years. And the interesting thing is if you look at what is going on with the economy, in 2018, we've had a number of quarters of falling investment, business investment going down. We've had manufacturing, despite the fall in the pound, not doing well at all. We have had many months of declines in manufacturing output. Business optimism is at the lowest it has been for years. And the same thing is the case with the consumer, despite full employment.</p><p>So there had been hope that there would be some certainty a month ago when first the Parliament looked and then wasn't allowed to vote on the withdrawal agreement. Which businesses actually backed, because they wanted at least some certainty and at least the customs union. Therefore a while to come, and the transition period, that would be good. But of course, that was all shattered after the Parliament voted it down very decisively. Now, with last night, who knows what the end game is likely to be. So businesses are not very happy at all.</p><p>JONES: You are talking about the transdisciplinary period as well. One of the things that emerged over the last sort of 48 hours or so, is a plan C. This idea that if we get to March 29 and there is no-deal, that somehow, the EU would let us still remain in a transitory period so that we don't sort of fall off a cliff edge that everybody's been talking about. Do you think the EU is being boxed into a corner so much now, that they might agree to that, given the fact that they would essentially get a lot of money from the U.K. to stay in that transition period?</p><p>PRYCE: Well the EU has already put in place procedures which will allow us to give us a certain number of concession, certainly if there is no-deal, so that things could continue to operate for a while. But they made it very clear, this is only temporary. That includes the financial sector, which could carry on and operate for a while. But then at some point they will no longer have the passport to be able to work properly across. So it depends really what type of transition period we're talking about. The normal transition period, which had been negotiated before, we would certainly have at least two years, if not longer, of everything staying the same. And there would be time to prepare.</p><p>But of course, we're still won't know what the final trade negotiations will be and so uncertainty will continue. So businesses haven't been happy generally and they are --feel like voting with their feet. We've already seen a number of firms relocating their headquarters. A number of them also looking to get closer to the supply chains in the continent so it doesn't have problems with the border. And it is actually probably one of the worst times to make any investment decision in the U.K. right now.</p><p>JONES: The other thing that businesses are good at is striking deals, negotiating. It must be infuriating for the business community to be looking at politicians when we're talking about economic trade deals and the like, and transactional deals going forward. But having said that, has Theresa May put herself -- or has Parliament now put our Prime Minister in a stronger negotiating position when she goes back to Brussels?</p><p>PRYCE: I don't think so at all. What she has done is she has basically ripped apart the two and a half years of negotiations that have been taking place, where they finally came to some agreement on the Northern Ireland border, this backstop. Which actually was not bad for business. Not a very good deal but not for business because it kept us in the customs union for quite some time to come and maybe forever. And now she is going back again to say, we'll so sick of these British people all I mean this woman is an economist and given if I could probably understand your is probably making some really important points but I can't understand her first of all. All of the things we've done in the last two and a half years, and we threw them out and can you do something about it and change. It's a very, very crucial point which is either withdrawal deal. Of course, there is a Political Declaration attached to it, and that is one that can be amended, words can come, and say all sorts of things. But there is no certainty that anything in there is actually going to be a total amendment and we will end up with that at the end of the day.</p><p>JONES: All right, Vicky Pryce, thank you very much indeed. Vicky is the economist at the Center for Economic and Business Research. Thank you for your analysis on all things Brexit. We appreciate it.</p><p>Now, live from London, this is CONNECT THE WORLD. Still to come on the program, we take you to the perfect place for some winter comfort food. A noodle restaurant in northern Japan that encourages you to eat and eat some more.</p><p>JONES: This is CNN. And this is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. Welcome back.</p><p>Now all this week we are exploring the winter landscapes of northern Japan. In the next part of the series \"DESTINATION TOHOKU\", we visit a Japanese noodle restaurant that's giving a new meaning to the phrase \"all you can eat.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Imagine a restaurant where overeating is actually encouraged. Here, in the capital, it is not only a reality, it is a tradition. This is Iwate's capital is not only a reality, it's a tradition. This is Azumaya, a 111-year-old noodle shop in the city of Morioka. There is only one specialty here, wanko soba.</p><p>AKIHITO BABA, OWNER, AZUMAYA (through translator): Wanko soba, the small portions of soba noodles that are served one after the another. It's the traditional food of Iwate, served on special occasions or celebrations, and when we welcome outside guests.</p><p>WEIR: What began as a show of hospitality, encouraging guests to eat as much as possible, has morphed into an all-out soba noodle binge. Diners devour the small bowls. A waitress pours the next mouthful. Then repeat. Until either you stand up, or you're too full to go on. Patrons stack empty bowls like badges of honor. 100 here. 200 there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (through translator): Two years ago, I ate 222 bowls. But after I ate, I still had room to eat more.</p><p>WEIR: And that's not even half the current record, 570 bowls. This young woman, Naoko Obaru, weighing just 50 kilograms is hungry to beat it.</p><p>NAOKO OBARU, COMPETITIVE EATER (through translator): After eating a lot, I get a similar feeling to a runner's high. I feel happy and enjoy it.</p><p>WEIR: The waitress cheers her on saying, more, more. In the back, the kitchen races to keep up.</p><p>While there's four noodle shops go through over four tons of buck wheat flour each month. On this day, Obaru puts down the lid to say enough, at 300 bowls. No new records at this wanko soba shop for now. But there's always another meal tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES: I don't know what to make of that. Live from London, this is CONNECT THE WORLD.</p><p>Coming up, nearly three quarters of the U.S. population, that's more than 200 million people, are facing some very trying days ahead indeed. As they endure one of the coldest winter blasts in decades. We are live in Chicago, next, this hour.</p><p>[10:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: Welcome back to CNN and to CONNECT THE WORLD with me Hannah Vaughan Jones live from London.</p><p>Now in the United States, the coldest air in a generation is sinking south and the worst is still to come. Much of America is getting blasted by the polar vortex, as temperatures in some areas will plummet to colder than Antarctica. Thousands of flights have already been canceled. It is so cold, the U.S. postal service is out of action in parts of ten states. Let's get over to our Ryan Young. Ryan is in the frozen city of Chicago, the epicenter of the extreme cold, in the U.S. Ryan, it's not just dangerously cold, it is almost life-threateningly cold at the moment. How are you bearing up?</p><p>RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Look, we're trying to work together as a team here, my photographer, Leonel Mendez, and my producer, we're all kind of together trying to make sure we stay warm between these hits.</p><p>But really when you start talking about this, you talk about the dangerous cold and the wind whipping through, this really has a life-changing kind of implications for the entire city. In fact they have warming centers throughout the city. They canceled school today. And when you think about this, this is the Chicago River. So many people travel to Chicago to see this site, and when you look at it, it looks like an Iceland, you know what I'm saying? And in fact, my mouth is starting to freeze up a little bit. But we've been out here all morning long.</p><p>The whole idea though as they talk about just how cold it is, we know we've hit record temperatures and we wanted to show you something. My producer is passing me this hot water right here. Hold the mike for me, Bill. There we go. This is hot water and were going to throw it up in the air and show you what happens next. So hold on, watch this. You can see, it's freezing basically right there, right in front of us, that's how cold it is.</p><p>We've been talking to people who are commuting all day. They say they're trying their best to try to stay as warm as possible. When you think about this, schools are closed, a lot of businesses are closed as well because they didn't want their employees dealing with this severe cold. I will tell you, toes, nose, fingers, that's where we really field these cold temperatures, and especially the lungs, they actually say try not to breathe in too heavily because your lungs can freeze in temperatures like this.</p><p>JONES: Yes, you know, I will never complain again about the cold in London from what we're seeing for you, Ryan. And a question for those people who aren't so fortunate to have, you know, a fire, the central heating, and the like, and the warmth around them, what does the city have in terms of, what plans does have it, for those people who are potentially, I don't know, homeless or of course just out in the cold?</p><p>YOUNG: Look, that's a great question. Especially in this downtown area. There's a lot of people who use downtown as their homeless shelter. We see a lot of them on the way to work in the morning. The city has been trying to help those people. There are also people who are sort of stuck in the middle, right, and so they've been using their stoves to heat their homes.</p><p>[10:55:00] They're really trying to encourage those people to do go to one of the 24 heating centers throughout the city so they can come in and get warm, and not do something dangerous like try to start a fire or do something inside the house like using a stove and leaving it open or having old heating sources, to kind of heat their bodies. I mean honestly, this is one of those days where we talk about getting in and out of the car very quickly. This is one the days where you start to feel the pain of the cold after about ten minutes of being outside.</p><p>JONES: Ryan, we urge you, I urge you to get inside right now. And wrap up warm as long as you can before you actually have to do another hit with CNN. Ryan Young there for us in Chicago. You can see from what Ryan was just displaying with that cup of hot water, throwing it up into the air, and turns straight to ice. And of course, the river, astonishing pictures there, Ryan. Thank you very much indeed. And as I said, go inside, go into a car, go somewhere, just don't be outside.</p><p>And I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones, live in London. That was CONNECT THE WORLD.

Hey, Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, Dana.</p><p>Sometimes I feel man slapped but it's OK.</p><p>President Trump says the worst may be yet to come for Venezuela's embattled and disputed government.</p><p>Democrats are proposing big changes for the U.S. Supreme Court, the Electoral College, and the nation's voting age.</p><p>And we take you for an exclusive look at the front lines in Syria as U.S.-backed forces engage ISIS in the terror group's last stand.</p><p>This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>Good evening.  I'm Bret Baier.  We're coming to you live tonight from the White House where I will talk with one of the president's top economic advisors in just a few minutes.</p><p>We begin though with President Trump saying all options are still on the table in the effort to remove Venezuela's disputed president and his socialist government.  The American leader saying here in the rose garden even stronger sanctions may be coming.  He spoke with reporters this afternoon alongside the visiting Brazilian president.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts was there.  Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.   And a lovely afternoon in the rose garden it was.</p><p>So far the effort to oust Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro has been unsuccessful.  There had been some cracks in his regime but so far none big enough to wedge him out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS:  Venezuela was Topic A in President Trump's first meeting with the new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.  President Trump indicating he has no idea when Nicolas Maduro may step down if ever.</p><p>TRUMP:  I'm not being told any specific time but we really haven't done the really tough sanctions yet, we can do the tough sanctions and all options are open.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Brazil shares a border with Venezuela and has been assisting the U.S. in getting humanitarian aid to Venezuelans fleeing economic collapse.  Bolsonaro indicated he may allow U.S. troops to base out of Brazil if the need for military action arises.</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Brazil would be more than willing and ready to fulfill this mission and take freedom and democracy to that country.</p><p>ROBERTS:  In welcoming Bolsonaro to the White House President Trump was almost looking in the mirror.  Bolsonaro is known as the Trump of the Tropics.  He has the same views as the President on immigration, uses Twitter as a megaphone --</p><p>BOLSONARO:  fake news.</p><p>ROBERTS:  -- and decries fake news.</p><p>TRUMP:  we're going to have a fantastic working relationship.  We have many views that are similar.</p><p>ROBERTS:  Bolsonaro also represents a break from a long line of anti-U.S. leaders promising a new relationship with America on everything from trade to energy to military cooperation.  President Trump is happy to embrace the change.</p><p>TRUMP:  I also intend to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally or even possibly, if you start thinking about it, may be a NATO ally which will greatly advance security and cooperation between our countries.</p><p>ROBERTS:  In the Oval Office prior to their joint press appearance, President Trump was asked about his weekend Twitter feud with Meghan McCain after President Trump ripped her father for giving the FBI the unverified Steele dossier.</p><p>The President was unapologetic pointing to McCain's vote against repealing and replacing Obamacare.</p><p>TRUMP:  So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up.  I think that's disgraceful.  I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.</p><p>ROBERTS:  President Trump also weighed in on Twitter and Facebook today after his director of social media was temporarily blocked on Facebook and Republican Congressman Devin Nunes filed a $250 million lawsuit against Twitter.</p><p>TRUMP:  It seems to be if they're conservative. If they're Republicans, if they are in a certain group, that is discrimination, a big discrimination.  I do think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS:  President Trump also used Bolsonaro's visit to take a swing at the emerging socialist movement in the Democratic Party here.  Bolsonaro won the presidency in Brazil by campaigning against the socialist corruption that had led to Brazil's economic decline.  President Trump repeated his mantra that the U.S. economy is stronger than ever and that the last thing we need is socialism -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Thanks -- John.</p><p>Let's get some insight on the U.S. economy and the President's big plans from the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, Kevin Hassett.  Kevin -- thanks for being here.</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  It's good to be here.</p><p>BAIER:  Your overview first of all this report just out, you seem kind of ecstatic but --</p><p>M1:  Yes.  I'm always ecstatic.</p><p>BAIER:  -- behind that.</p><p>M1:  Right.  Well, I think that basically what we've done is we published a book with 700 pages that documents President Trump's policies are working, that the economy has gone from the new normal of low growth to the old normal of 3 percent growth, that it's doing it precisely because the policies are working the way economists think they should.</p><p>So we said a year ago in the fall that capital spending would working, the economy has gone from a new normal of low growth to the old normal of 3 percent growth and it's doing it precisely because the policies are working the way economists think they should.</p><p>And so we said a year ago in the fall that capitol spending would boom and that factories have come back to America.  We documented that that is happening in the data.</p><p>We said when the factories would come back, that people would be hired more and so unemployment rate went down to historic lows for just about every category rate -- democratic category.  And we said that wages would grow a lot because the people at the factories would be competing for workers and we see that as well.</p><p>And the most striking thing on that, you know, I promise not to filibuster is the bottom 10 percent of Americans saw wage growth last year of 6.5 percent.</p><p>BAIER:  JPMorgan in their forecast for 2019 said this.  \"Significant U.S. economic outperformance is unlikely to persist through 2019 as the sugar rush of the fiscal stimulus wanes.\"</p><p>M1:  Yes.  So a lot of people said that we wouldn't have a sugar rush and now they're calling it a sugar rush, but it's not a sugar rush.  So a sugar rush again  --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>M1:  People should we are having a sugar rush but it's not a sugar rush.  People should go to a Disney.  It's even like a that admits that sugar does that to you.  But in any case if we ate at twinkie and a bunch of twinkies and spent all our money on twinkies.   The next would bad and we wouldn't have any money and we'd be sorry when we did that.</p><p>What happened now is that we didn't, you know eat Twinkies.  We took vitamins and we made the economy stronger exercise and it's stronger from now on.</p><p>And so people built more factories last year, that made the GDP go up because they're buying machines. This year though, factories are turning on and they're going to make output and that's going to make GDP go up again.  So it's the opposite of a sugar rush.</p><p>BAIER:  For the folks who are critical about the next steps -- like what are the next steps this administration will take to try to push that growth forward?</p><p>MILLER:  Well, I think the first thing is that we just have to like hold the line here.  There are a lot of people who want repeal this policies that in the economic report we demonstrate worked.</p><p>But then the next thing is that there's a lot of stuff that we could do without Congress in the deregulation states, we have a whole chapter documenting the big impact on the economy -- positive impact of deregulation.  And then there are other things that we could do that require legislation that we hope to infrastructure spending.</p><p>America's infrastructure is decaying a lot and we can fix that.  And historically those kind of fixes have happen on a bipartisan basis.</p><p>BAIER:  \"Wall Street Journal\" pointing out that some of the tax cuts expire.  They have a timeline on them.  They said the 2017 tax law also created temporary incentives for alcohol producers and businesses that provide family leave, both of which expire this year.</p><p>So by including revenue from expected scheduled explorations in the budget the administration sets fiscal targets in such a way that either it has to support those tax increases happening as scheduled or find replacement revenue.  So which one will you do?</p><p>M1:  Right.  Well, in our budget, we basically assume that almost all the tax cuts are permanent and that's the way we do the math.</p><p>And so I don't know what this guy is saying but that's the way we do the math in our budget.  President Trump has a whole bunch of policy objectives including things like infrastructure spending, making tax cuts permanent, getting more people into the work force by adding work requirements to some of the welfare programs.</p><p>And all of those policies are in the baseline of our assumptions in the economic report.  And so if you say well, that's a rosy scenario you're saying that maybe there's going to be 3 percent growth over the next decade.</p><p>You know, I agree that it's an optimistic scenario because it's a scenario where President Trump's policies are enacted into law.  If they're not enacted into law if people obstruct our ability to engage in these positive policies and for sure growth will fall short.</p><p>BAIER:  The President is heading to Ohio.  Sherrod Brown, the senator from Ohio has this suggestion about cars. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO:  -- last week.  So I've been talking to the President about this.  He finally he woke up and acted like he wants to do something.</p><p>He should be going to Congress and say pass past the American Cars and American Jobs Act.  Briefly, it works this way.  You buy a car listed of 100 vehicles made, mostly in the United States.  You buy one of those, you get a $3500 off rebate at the dealership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  So in other words, protect U.S. automakers by giving them this rebate, something that you guys would look at?</p><p>M1:  You know, I haven't spoken with the President about that specific proposal but he has been fighting and fighting and fighting since he's been here for auto workers, to move auto plants from other countries to the U.S.</p><p>And so I think the specific thing that Senator Brown, who I have a great deal of admiration for, is mentioning that there's a GM plant that's closing in Ohio that the two of them have been talking about.</p><p>I think that GM has very idiosyncratic problems.

A lot of, you know -- Ford is expanding and a lot of foreign manufacturers are moving production to the U.S</p><p>And so I think that, you know, we certainly want to save that plant but I think that there are idiosyncratic problems for GM.  They'll require a massive new bill.

More is best, reforming who can serve and for how long.  Among the proposals: rotating justices on and off the bench from the lower appellate courts and term limits for currently life tenured federal judges.</p><p>SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Term limits for Supreme Court justices might be one thing, it gives every president the ability to choose three.

There were initially six members of the high court, then five, then seven, then nine, down to eight, ten for a while, back down to eight before finally settling on nine a century and a half ago.</p><p>FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will appoint Justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the Congress.</p><p>BREAM:  Franklin Roosevelt's audacious court packing plan in the 1930s to add up to six justices met with widespread public and political condemnation and was soon abandoned.  It's no secret the other two branches have long chafed at high court rulings limiting presidential and congressional power.</p><p>So to change the decision, the thinking goes change the deciders with more choices a new Democratic president could quickly offset the current 5-4 conservative majority.</p><p>TRUMP:  We would have no interest in that whatsoever.  It will never happen.  It won't happen. I guarantee you it won't happen for six years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So help me God.</p><p>BREAM:  Some court watchers think the current Democratic expansion tease has little chance of success.</p><p>ILYA SYAPIRO, CATO INSTITUTE:  Something this controversial could be bad for the Democrats indeed in the 2020 election.

They clearly established a relationship today, before today, and in the Rose Garden talked to reporters.  Their main conversation, we are told, behind closed doors here at the White House was about Venezuela, and the president addressed a question about why it's taking so long for the disputed president, Maduro, to give up power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm not being told any specific time.  They have been there a long time, between him and his predecessor.  At some point I would imagine things will change.  But we really haven't done the really tough sanctions yet.  We can do the tough sanctions, and all options are open, so we may be doing that.  But we haven't done the toughest of sanctions, as you know.  We've done, I would say, right down the middle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Byron, your thoughts on this meeting and this exchange between the Brazilian president and President Trump.</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  I think the president may have adlibbed a little bit about making Brazil a full NATO ally because late this afternoon, three or four hours after this press conference, John Bolton, the national security advisor, tweeted that we are proud to make Brazil a major non-NATO ally.  But other than that, really, Venezuela was the big deal, and the president made it clear that he felt there was a lot more that the United States could do, because the question really was, what you have been doing isn't working.  Maduro is still there, what are you going to do?  And he really made it clear that he feels there's a lot more the United States can still do.</p><p>BAIER:  Amy?</p><p>AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\":  Right.  And the question is, what is on the table for what the White House can still do, what the U.S. can still do, whether it is sanctions or whether there is more on the table is really unclear at this point.</p><p>I do think the fact the president spent time with someone who sees eye to eye with him on the way in which the world works, in the way in which they see government working or not working, the idea that there is fake news, this was a chance for the president to show that he has allies around the world who are willing to stand side-by-side with him in a part of the world that continues to be very difficult.</p><p>BAIER:  Yes, and what was interesting is they talked a lot about space and the prospect of launching U.S. spacecraft in the future, Matthew, from Brazil, that possibly countering China's getting into Latin America with a deal with Argentina.</p><p>MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\":  That's right, an important statement for one of the most interesting and most important relationships I think in the world today, Bret.  And Bolsonaro, following Trump's lead, they both represent a new model of leadership for democracies, and that is they are both nationalists, they're both anti-elitist, they're both socially conservative, and you can tell by Bolsonaro's rhetoric that his voters are very similar to many of Trump's voters in what they care about and what they believe.</p><p>And they are also capitalists.  And so socialism became an issue in this press conference as well.  Trump once again framing the 2020 debate in terms of socialism versus capitalism.  This is an argument that Bolsonaro can understand as well as Trump.</p><p>BAIER:  And the press conference in the Rose Garden, it's kind of a two and two for reporters from both sides.  The president was asked about social media and the efforts that he had talked about previously about banning conservatives.  There is this lawsuit by Representative Devin Nunes against Twitter.  There are other complaints against Facebook and others.  Here's his answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will tell you, there is collusion with respect to that, because something has to be going on.  And when you get to the back scene, back office statements made by executives of the various companies and you see the level of, in many cases, hatred they have for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election, it's very, very fair to say that we have to do something about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  That's a follow-up to a tweet, Amy, where he tweeted out \"Facebook, Google, and Twitter, not to mention the corrupt media, are sooo on the side of the radical left Democrats.  But fear not, we will win anyway, just like we did before! #MAGA.\" The issue of social media and these big tech giants seems to be an issue for both sides.</p><p>WALTER:  I was just going to say that, Bret.  For once you now see the president and Democrats, including very liberal Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, agreeing on the monopolization of power by these big tech organizations.  You already had a lot of Democrats upset with what they saw was a hands-off approach by Facebook, by Google to Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Elizabeth Warren now out saying we need to break up these big tech companies.  And this was the place, Silicon Valley continues to be a place where a lot of Democratic fundraising comes from, where a lot of the Democratic operatives come from, and yet it no longer has that same shine, shininess, to Democrats, at least Democratic presidential candidates, as it once did.</p><p>BAIER:  And Byron, on the flipside for Republicans who are usually against regulations, it seems like there is a growing chorus about doing something about tech giants.</p><p>YORK:  There is, and this is really odd.  Obviously, this a president who loves Twitter, it's been extremely important in his campaign and his presidency.  I think he once said it was like buying \"The New York Times\" without any debt.  It was just a great way to communicate with voters.  But he actually supports this Devin Nunes lawsuit.  The reaction on the left has been to laugh at the Nunes lawsuit, but a lot of conservatives do believe that some of the big social media companies use algorithms and other technical ways to suppress some of their ideas.  And I think the Nunes lawsuit, maybe its biggest benefit would be to try to shake some information loose about whether that actually happens or not.</p><p>BAIER:  All right, panel, stand by.  Next up, Democratic presidential contenders want to make some big changes to the country, but do you?  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE, (D) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE:  What if there were five justices selected by Democrats, five justices selected by Republicans, and those 10 then pick five more justices independent of those who chose the first 10.  I think that's an idea we should explore.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's not just about throwing more justices on the court.  What I think we need to do is some kind of structural reform that makes the court less political.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election, they want to try doing it in a different way.  Now, we would have no interest in that whatsoever.  It will never happen.  It won't happen, I guarantee it won't happen for six years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP).</p><p>BAIER:  President Trump in the Rose Garden here at the White House answering a question about increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court.  It is a talking point now for a number of candidates as you look at the list here.  Several of them are now talking openly on the campaign trail about Supreme Court reform, as it's called.  They talk about it differently, but all say adding more justices in one way or another is something they would consider or want to do.  But \"The Washington Post\" has a piece about Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat from Colorado considering getting in the race, \"slammed his head on the table four times when I asked him what he thought about other Democratic presidential contenders embracing the idea of expanding the Supreme Court.  Having seen up close just how cynical and how vicious the Tea Party guys and the Freedom Caucus guys and Mitch McConnell had been, the last thing I want to do is be those guys, he said during an interview at a coffee shop.\"</p><p>We'll start there with the 2020.  Back with the panel.  Amy, is this catching on?</p><p>WALTER:  It is really fascinating, Bret, how much process has become part of the Democratic debate within the Democratic presidential candidates, within that field.  It's not just the Supreme Court.  It's also getting rid of the Electoral College, which is gaining a lot of steam.  A number of candidates, including Elizabeth Warren last night, coming out in favor of abolishing of the Electoral College.  Getting what of the filibuster, something the president talks a lot about.  There are a lot of liberal Democrats who believe that's the only way if a Democrat becomes president to see a progressive agenda come through.  You have to get rid of the filibuster.  Adding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states.</p><p>The feeling overall from a lot of Democrats, not just activists, but now people who are running for president is feeling that for years Democrats have played by the rules, Republicans haven't.  And they have lost opportunities where Republicans have taken them, and they pointed specifically, of course, to Merrick Garland and the decision not to hold hearings on Merrick Garland.  They say we know Michelle Obama told us in the 2016 campaign when they go low, we go high.  Well, maybe going high isn't working anymore.  So let's not do it.</p><p>BAIER:  Matthew, you look at all of these things.  You look at abolishing the Electoral College.  You look at adding more Supreme Court justices.  You look at reducing the voting age to 16.  They all fit obviously a beneficial to Democrats in voting overall.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  That's right.  And the Democratic argument isn't with any single one of these things.  It's not only with the Electoral College, it's not only with the 26th Amendment, it's not only with the state of the Supreme Court, it's not only with equal representation of small states in the United States Senate.  The Democratic argument, Bret, is with the Constitution of the United States of America.</p><p>And the argument is because the left cannot win its arguments when they present them publicly.  So in order to win, they need to change the structure.  You heard Mayor Buttigieg right there say, the structural change necessary.  What structure are they changing?  They are changing the Constitution of the United States whose structure is there to preserve individual liberty.  Barack Obama said he was audacious.  This is audacity.</p><p>BAIER:  Byron, Elizabeth Warren made that case about the Electoral College last night, we played the soundbite earlier, saying that every vote needs to count.  But Lindsey Graham makes the opposite in a tweet, saying \"The desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically.\"  And the focus being on the big states that have the most population, and the Iowas and New Hampshires and even the middle of the country would get less say, really.</p><p>YORK:  Yes, what they'd really plan to do is the end run around the Electoral College.  They realize they can't change the constitution, so there is a plan that if enough states whose electoral votes total 270 agreed to give their electors to whoever won the popular vote, then that would do it.  They're not there yet, so this is not really close to happening.</p><p>But it would change our politics completely.  Candidates would spend a lot of time trying to run up the score in California.  Democrats would, Republicans would try to do the same in Texas.  The Electoral College requires a majority of delegates.  A popular election would just require a winner.  There doesn't have to be two political parties, there could be a lot of different candidates and a plurality candidate could win.  Playing with our constitutional order is a really dangerous thing.</p><p>BAIER:  Amy, just to get back to what you said at the beginning, the process being such a focus.  As one candidate talks about it, it seems like they all start to talk about it.  And when you have the over/under being 20 voices talking about the same process things, does that hurt Democrats on the trail?</p><p>WALTER:  I think they are meeting the activists where they are and the base where the base is.  And again, I'm sure all of us here around the table have been in and around politics long enough that we have heard arguments both for and against the Electoral College for a long time, but it never really made its way up to the people that were running for president or potentially could be president.  Now it's actually getting a hearing.  It's unclear about how long that's going to stay there.</p><p>One other interesting point, though.  The debate over the Electoral College isn't new, and it's not always on one side of the other.  Back in 2004, 54 percent of Republicans wanted to get rid of the Electoral College, wanted to see a popular vote winner.  And now, says Gallup, that number is down to 19 percent.</p><p>BAIER:  We'll follow it.  Maybe we'll get to some substance on policy, too.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks, panel.  When we come back, a special surprise for a karate kid.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  A gorgeous night here at the White House.  Finally tonight, a surprise for one karate kid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Daddy?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Staff Sergeant Rob Cesternino surprised his nine-year-old son Luca during martial arts class Monday at Lebanon, Tennessee.  He was wearing a blindfold.  He didn't think his dad would be home until the following week.  Rob and Luca were both given honorary belts at karate class, and that is just an awesome moment. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  I could play those all day long.  That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT.  Fair, balanced and unafraid.  \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha starts right now.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2194266251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPY-H751-JBHT-D2CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Hey, Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, Dana.</p><p>Sometimes I feel man slapped but it's OK.</p><p>President Trump says the worst may be yet to come for Venezuela's embattled and disputed government.</p><p>Democrats are proposing big changes for the U.S. Supreme Court, the Electoral College, and the nation's voting age.</p><p>And we take you for an exclusive look at the front lines in Syria as U.S.- backed forces engage ISIS in the terror group's last stand.</p><p>This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. We're coming to you live tonight from the White House where I will talk with one of the president's top economic advisors in just a few minutes.</p><p>We begin though with President Trump saying all options are still on the table in the effort to remove Venezuela's disputed president and his socialist government. The American leader saying here in the rose garden even stronger sanctions may be coming. He spoke with reporters this afternoon alongside the visiting Brazilian president.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts was there. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret. And a lovely afternoon in the rose garden it was.</p><p>So far the effort to oust Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro has been unsuccessful. There had been some cracks in his regime but so far none big enough to wedge him out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: Venezuela was Topic A in President Trump's first meeting with the new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. President Trump indicating he has no idea when Nicolas Maduro may step down if ever.</p><p>TRUMP: I'm not being told any specific time but we really haven't done the really tough sanctions yet, we can do the tough sanctions and all options are open.</p><p>ROBERTS: Brazil shares a border with Venezuela and has been assisting the U.S. in getting humanitarian aid to Venezuelans fleeing economic collapse. Bolsonaro indicated he may allow U.S. troops to base out of Brazil if the need for military action arises.</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Brazil would be more than willing and ready to fulfill this mission and take freedom and democracy to that country.</p><p>ROBERTS: In welcoming Bolsonaro to the White House President Trump was almost looking in the mirror. Bolsonaro is known as the Trump of the Tropics. He has the same views as the President on immigration, uses Twitter as a megaphone --</p><p>BOLSONARO: fake news.</p><p>ROBERTS: -- and decries fake news.</p><p>TRUMP: we're going to have a fantastic working relationship. We have many views that are similar.</p><p>ROBERTS: Bolsonaro also represents a break from a long line of anti-U.S. leaders promising a new relationship with America on everything from trade to energy to military cooperation. President Trump is happy to embrace the change.</p><p>TRUMP: I also intend to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally or even possibly, if you start thinking about it, may be a NATO ally which will greatly advance security and cooperation between our countries.</p><p>ROBERTS: In the Oval Office prior to their joint press appearance, President Trump was asked about his weekend Twitter feud with Meghan McCain after President Trump ripped her father for giving the FBI the unverified Steele dossier.</p><p>The President was unapologetic pointing to McCain's vote against repealing and replacing Obamacare.</p><p>TRUMP: So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up. I think that's disgraceful. I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump also weighed in on Twitter and Facebook today after his director of social media was temporarily blocked on Facebook and Republican Congressman Devin Nunes filed a $250 million lawsuit against Twitter.</p><p>TRUMP: It seems to be if they're conservative. If they're Republicans, if they are in a certain group, that is discrimination, a big discrimination. I do think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump also used Bolsonaro's visit to take a swing at the emerging socialist movement in the Democratic Party here. Bolsonaro won the presidency in Brazil by campaigning against the socialist corruption that had led to Brazil's economic decline. President Trump repeated his mantra that the U.S. economy is stronger than ever and that the last thing we need is socialism -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Thanks -- John.</p><p>Let's get some insight on the U.S. economy and the President's big plans from the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, Kevin Hassett. Kevin -- thanks for being here.</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: It's good to be here.</p><p>BAIER: Your overview first of all this report just out, you seem kind of ecstatic but --</p><p>M1: Yes. I'm always ecstatic.</p><p>BAIER: -- behind that.</p><p>M1: Right. Well, I think that basically what we've done is we published a book with 700 pages that documents President Trump's policies are working, that the economy has gone from the new normal of low growth to the old normal of 3 percent growth, that it's doing it precisely because the policies are working the way economists think they should.</p><p>So we said a year ago in the fall that capital spending would working, the economy has gone from a new normal of low growth to the old normal of 3 percent growth and it's doing it precisely because the policies are working the way economists think they should.</p><p>And so we said a year ago in the fall that capitol spending would boom and that factories have come back to America. We documented that that is happening in the data.</p><p>We said when the factories would come back, that people would be hired more and so unemployment rate went down to historic lows for just about every category rate -- democratic category. And we said that wages would grow a lot because the people at the factories would be competing for workers and we see that as well.</p><p>And the most striking thing on that, you know, I promise not to filibuster is the bottom 10 percent of Americans saw wage growth last year of 6.5 percent.</p><p>BAIER: JPMorgan in their forecast for 2019 said this. \"Significant U.S. economic outperformance is unlikely to persist through 2019 as the sugar rush of the fiscal stimulus wanes.\"</p><p>M1: Yes. So a lot of people said that we wouldn't have a sugar rush and now they're calling it a sugar rush, but it's not a sugar rush. So a sugar rush again --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>M1: People should we are having a sugar rush but it's not a sugar rush. People should go to a Disney. It's even like a that admits that sugar does that to you. But in any case if we ate at twinkie and a bunch of twinkies and spent all our money on twinkies. The next would bad and we wouldn't have any money and we'd be sorry when we did that.</p><p>What happened now is that we didn't, you know eat Twinkies. We took vitamins and we made the economy stronger exercise and it's stronger from now on.</p><p>And so people built more factories last year, that made the GDP go up because they're buying machines. This year though, factories are turning on and they're going to make output and that's going to make GDP go up again. So it's the opposite of a sugar rush.</p><p>BAIER: For the folks who are critical about the next steps -- like what are the next steps this administration will take to try to push that growth forward?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I think the first thing is that we just have to like hold the line here. There are a lot of people who want repeal this policies that in the economic report we demonstrate worked.</p><p>But then the next thing is that there's a lot of stuff that we could do without Congress in the deregulation states, we have a whole chapter documenting the big impact on the economy -- positive impact of deregulation. And then there are other things that we could do that require legislation that we hope to infrastructure spending.</p><p>America's infrastructure is decaying a lot and we can fix that. And historically those kind of fixes have happen on a bipartisan basis.</p><p>BAIER: \"Wall Street Journal\" pointing out that some of the tax cuts expire. They have a timeline on them. They said the 2017 tax law also created temporary incentives for alcohol producers and businesses that provide family leave, both of which expire this year.</p><p>So by including revenue from expected scheduled explorations in the budget the administration sets fiscal targets in such a way that either it has to support those tax increases happening as scheduled or find replacement revenue. So which one will you do?</p><p>M1: Right. Well, in our budget, we basically assume that almost all the tax cuts are permanent and that's the way we do the math.</p><p>And so I don't know what this guy is saying but that's the way we do the math in our budget. President Trump has a whole bunch of policy objectives including things like infrastructure spending, making tax cuts permanent, getting more people into the work force by adding work requirements to some of the welfare programs.</p><p>And all of those policies are in the baseline of our assumptions in the economic report. And so if you say well, that's a rosy scenario you're saying that maybe there's going to be 3 percent growth over the next decade.</p><p>You know, I agree that it's an optimistic scenario because it's a scenario where President Trump's policies are enacted into law. If they're not enacted into law if people obstruct our ability to engage in these positive policies and for sure growth will fall short.</p><p>BAIER: The President is heading to Ohio. Sherrod Brown, the senator from Ohio has this suggestion about cars. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: -- last week. So I've been talking to the President about this. He finally he woke up and acted like he wants to do something.</p><p>He should be going to Congress and say pass past the American Cars and American Jobs Act. Briefly, it works this way. You buy a car listed of 100 vehicles made, mostly in the United States. You buy one of those, you get a $3500 off rebate at the dealership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: So in other words, protect U.S. automakers by giving them this rebate, something that you guys would look at?</p><p>M1: You know, I haven't spoken with the President about that specific proposal but he has been fighting and fighting and fighting since he's been here for auto workers, to move auto plants from other countries to the U.S.</p><p>And so I think the specific thing that Senator Brown, who I have a great deal of admiration for, is mentioning that there's a GM plant that's closing in Ohio that the two of them have been talking about.</p><p>I think that GM has very idiosyncratic problems. Most of the auto makers are doing great, they are expanding. A lot of, you know -- Ford is expanding and a lot of foreign manufacturers are moving production to the U.S</p><p>And so I think that, you know, we certainly want to save that plant but I think that there are idiosyncratic problems for GM. They'll require a massive new bill. President Trump has been fighting for automakers all across the board, the trade deals or the tax cuts, everything else.</p><p>BAIER: The trade deals are a big factor in how this economy looks. And you are optimistic.</p><p>M1: Yes. Yes. That's right. And Ambassador Lighthizer is continuing the talks with Secretary Mnuchin and, you know, I think, you know, I have set a couple times on the air that we are at the point where you don't want the groom to see the bride.</p><p>But you know, it's really hard to negotiate a trade deal. It's a lot of hard work and there's a lot of legalese that has to be worked out correctly and I think Ambassador Lighthizer is the guy that can lead that effort to (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BAIER: An optimistic Kevin Hassett. Kevin -- thanks a lot.</p><p>M1: Thanks.</p><p>BAIER: I appreciate the time.</p><p>M1: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BAIER: In \"America's Election Headquarters\" tonight, an effort by some Democrats running for president to expand the U.S. Supreme Court, an issue that lingered on the political rim for decades has suddenly and surprisingly become a hot campaign topic on the trail.</p><p>Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon Bream takes a look at trying to radically change the rules for choosing our unelected justices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All the options are on the table.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: Some White House wannabes are talking up a judicial redo, an effort to tap into lingering progressive anger over President Trump's two nominees for the high court -- Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>WARREN: When it swings back around to us what are we going to do?</p><p>BREAM: The solution FOR many Democrats? More is best, reforming who can serve and for how long. Among the proposals: rotating justices on and off the bench from the lower appellate courts and term limits for currently life tenured federal judges.</p><p>SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Term limits for Supreme Court justices might be one thing, it gives every president the ability to choose three.

There were initially six members of the high court, then five, then seven, then nine, down to eight, ten for a while, back down to eight before finally settling on nine a century and a half ago.</p><p>FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will appoint Justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the Congress.</p><p>BREAM: Franklin Roosevelt's audacious court packing plan in the 1930s to add up to six justices met with widespread public and political condemnation and was soon abandoned. It's no secret the other two branches have long chafed at high court rulings limiting presidential and congressional power.</p><p>So to change the decision, the thinking goes change the deciders with more choices a new Democratic president could quickly offset the current 5-4 conservative majority.</p><p>TRUMP: We would have no interest in that whatsoever. It will never happen. It won't happen. I guarantee you it won't happen for six years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So help me God.</p><p>BREAM: Some court watchers think the current Democratic expansion tease has little chance of success.</p><p>ILYA SYAPIRO, CATO INSTITUTE: Something this controversial could be bad for the Democrats indeed in the 2020 election.

They clearly established a relationship today, before today, and in the Rose Garden talked to reporters. Their main conversation, we are told, behind closed doors here at the White House was about Venezuela, and the president addressed a question about why it's taking so long for the disputed president, Maduro, to give up power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm not being told any specific time. They have been there a long time, between him and his predecessor. At some point I would imagine things will change. But we really haven't done the really tough sanctions yet. We can do the tough sanctions, and all options are open, so we may be doing that. But we haven't done the toughest of sanctions, as you know. We've done, I would say, right down the middle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Byron, your thoughts on this meeting and this exchange between the Brazilian president and President Trump.</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think the president may have adlibbed a little bit about making Brazil a full NATO ally because late this afternoon, three or four hours after this press conference, John Bolton, the national security advisor, tweeted that we are proud to make Brazil a major non-NATO ally. But other than that, really, Venezuela was the big deal, and the president made it clear that he felt there was a lot more that the United States could do, because the question really was, what you have been doing isn't working. Maduro is still there, what are you going to do? And he really made it clear that he feels there's a lot more the United States can still do.</p><p>BAIER: Amy?</p><p>AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": Right. And the question is, what is on the table for what the White House can still do, what the U.S. can still do, whether it is sanctions or whether there is more on the table is really unclear at this point.</p><p>I do think the fact the president spent time with someone who sees eye to eye with him on the way in which the world works, in the way in which they see government working or not working, the idea that there is fake news, this was a chance for the president to show that he has allies around the world who are willing to stand side-by-side with him in a part of the world that continues to be very difficult.</p><p>BAIER: Yes, and what was interesting is they talked a lot about space and the prospect of launching U.S. spacecraft in the future, Matthew, from Brazil, that possibly countering China's getting into Latin America with a deal with Argentina.</p><p>MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\": That's right, an important statement for one of the most interesting and most important relationships I think in the world today, Bret. And Bolsonaro, following Trump's lead, they both represent a new model of leadership for democracies, and that is they are both nationalists, they're both anti- elitist, they're both socially conservative, and you can tell by Bolsonaro's rhetoric that his voters are very similar to many of Trump's voters in what they care about and what they believe.</p><p>And they are also capitalists. And so socialism became an issue in this press conference as well. Trump once again framing the 2020 debate in terms of socialism versus capitalism. This is an argument that Bolsonaro can understand as well as Trump.</p><p>BAIER: And the press conference in the Rose Garden, it's kind of a two and two for reporters from both sides. The president was asked about social media and the efforts that he had talked about previously about banning conservatives. There is this lawsuit by Representative Devin Nunes against Twitter. There are other complaints against Facebook and others. Here's his answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will tell you, there is collusion with respect to that, because something has to be going on. And when you get to the back scene, back office statements made by executives of the various companies and you see the level of, in many cases, hatred they have for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election, it's very, very fair to say that we have to do something about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: That's a follow-up to a tweet, Amy, where he tweeted out \"Facebook, Google, and Twitter, not to mention the corrupt media, are sooo on the side of the radical left Democrats. But fear not, we will win anyway, just like we did before! #MAGA.\" The issue of social media and these big tech giants seems to be an issue for both sides.</p><p>WALTER: I was just going to say that, Bret. For once you now see the president and Democrats, including very liberal Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, agreeing on the monopolization of power by these big tech organizations. You already had a lot of Democrats upset with what they saw was a hands-off approach by Facebook, by Google to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Elizabeth Warren now out saying we need to break up these big tech companies. And this was the place, Silicon Valley continues to be a place where a lot of Democratic fundraising comes from, where a lot of the Democratic operatives come from, and yet it no longer has that same shine, shininess, to Democrats, at least Democratic presidential candidates, as it once did.</p><p>BAIER: And Byron, on the flipside for Republicans who are usually against regulations, it seems like there is a growing chorus about doing something about tech giants.</p><p>YORK: There is, and this is really odd. Obviously, this a president who loves Twitter, it's been extremely important in his campaign and his presidency. I think he once said it was like buying \"The New York Times\" without any debt. It was just a great way to communicate with voters. But he actually supports this Devin Nunes lawsuit. The reaction on the left has been to laugh at the Nunes lawsuit, but a lot of conservatives do believe that some of the big social media companies use algorithms and other technical ways to suppress some of their ideas. And I think the Nunes lawsuit, maybe its biggest benefit would be to try to shake some information loose about whether that actually happens or not.</p><p>BAIER: All right, panel, stand by. Next up, Democratic presidential contenders want to make some big changes to the country, but do you? Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE, (D) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE: What if there were five justices selected by Democrats, five justices selected by Republicans, and those 10 then pick five more justices independent of those who chose the first 10. I think that's an idea we should explore.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not just about throwing more justices on the court. What I think we need to do is some kind of structural reform that makes the court less political.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election, they want to try doing it in a different way. Now, we would have no interest in that whatsoever. It will never happen. It won't happen, I guarantee it won't happen for six years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP).</p><p>BAIER: President Trump in the Rose Garden here at the White House answering a question about increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court. It is a talking point now for a number of candidates as you look at the list here. Several of them are now talking openly on the campaign trail about Supreme Court reform, as it's called. They talk about it differently, but all say adding more justices in one way or another is something they would consider or want to do. But \"The Washington Post\" has a piece about Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat from Colorado considering getting in the race, \"slammed his head on the table four times when I asked him what he thought about other Democratic presidential contenders embracing the idea of expanding the Supreme Court. Having seen up close just how cynical and how vicious the Tea Party guys and the Freedom Caucus guys and Mitch McConnell had been, the last thing I want to do is be those guys, he said during an interview at a coffee shop.\"</p><p>We'll start there with the 2020. Back with the panel. Amy, is this catching on?</p><p>WALTER: It is really fascinating, Bret, how much process has become part of the Democratic debate within the Democratic presidential candidates, within that field. It's not just the Supreme Court. It's also getting rid of the Electoral College, which is gaining a lot of steam. A number of candidates, including Elizabeth Warren last night, coming out in favor of abolishing of the Electoral College. Getting what of the filibuster, something the president talks a lot about. There are a lot of liberal Democrats who believe that's the only way if a Democrat becomes president to see a progressive agenda come through. You have to get rid of the filibuster. Adding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states.</p><p>The feeling overall from a lot of Democrats, not just activists, but now people who are running for president is feeling that for years Democrats have played by the rules, Republicans haven't. And they have lost opportunities where Republicans have taken them, and they pointed specifically, of course, to Merrick Garland and the decision not to hold hearings on Merrick Garland. They say we know Michelle Obama told us in the 2016 campaign when they go low, we go high. Well, maybe going high isn't working anymore. So let's not do it.</p><p>BAIER: Matthew, you look at all of these things. You look at abolishing the Electoral College. You look at adding more Supreme Court justices. You look at reducing the voting age to 16. They all fit obviously a beneficial to Democrats in voting overall.</p><p>CONTINETTI: That's right. And the Democratic argument isn't with any single one of these things. It's not only with the Electoral College, it's not only with the 26th Amendment, it's not only with the state of the Supreme Court, it's not only with equal representation of small states in the United States Senate. The Democratic argument, Bret, is with the Constitution of the United States of America.</p><p>And the argument is because the left cannot win its arguments when they present them publicly. So in order to win, they need to change the structure. You heard Mayor Buttigieg right there say, the structural change necessary. What structure are they changing? They are changing the Constitution of the United States whose structure is there to preserve individual liberty. Barack Obama said he was audacious. This is audacity.</p><p>BAIER: Byron, Elizabeth Warren made that case about the Electoral College last night, we played the soundbite earlier, saying that every vote needs to count. But Lindsey Graham makes the opposite in a tweet, saying \"The desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically.\" And the focus being on the big states that have the most population, and the Iowas and New Hampshires and even the middle of the country would get less say, really.</p><p>YORK: Yes, what they'd really plan to do is the end run around the Electoral College. They realize they can't change the constitution, so there is a plan that if enough states whose electoral votes total 270 agreed to give their electors to whoever won the popular vote, then that would do it. They're not there yet, so this is not really close to happening.</p><p>But it would change our politics completely. Candidates would spend a lot of time trying to run up the score in California. Democrats would, Republicans would try to do the same in Texas. The Electoral College requires a majority of delegates. A popular election would just require a winner. There doesn't have to be two political parties, there could be a lot of different candidates and a plurality candidate could win. Playing with our constitutional order is a really dangerous thing.</p><p>BAIER: Amy, just to get back to what you said at the beginning, the process being such a focus. As one candidate talks about it, it seems like they all start to talk about it. And when you have the over/under being 20 voices talking about the same process things, does that hurt Democrats on the trail?</p><p>WALTER: I think they are meeting the activists where they are and the base where the base is. And again, I'm sure all of us here around the table have been in and around politics long enough that we have heard arguments both for and against the Electoral College for a long time, but it never really made its way up to the people that were running for president or potentially could be president. Now it's actually getting a hearing. It's unclear about how long that's going to stay there.</p><p>One other interesting point, though. The debate over the Electoral College isn't new, and it's not always on one side of the other. Back in 2004, 54 percent of Republicans wanted to get rid of the Electoral College, wanted to see a popular vote winner. And now, says Gallup, that number is down to 19 percent.</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow it. Maybe we'll get to some substance on policy, too. Thank you, guys. Thanks, panel. When we come back, a special surprise for a karate kid.</p><p>BAIER: A gorgeous night here at the White House. Finally tonight, a surprise for one karate kid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Daddy?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Staff Sergeant Rob Cesternino surprised his nine-year-old son Luca during martial arts class Monday at Lebanon, Tennessee. He was wearing a blindfold. He didn't think his dad would be home until the following week. Rob and Luca were both given honorary belts at karate class, and that is just an awesome moment. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. I could play those all day long. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019031901cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP2-JWV1-DXH2-6217-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7371\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law Enforcement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Electoral College</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDc1ODBFQkRGMTgxNDU1RkI0ODNDQTAyNDk0QzBEMjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkU1RUMwMTVEOUNENERDRUE1QjJBRkYyMUIwRTk3RUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

President Trump is happy to embrace the change.</p><p>TRUMP:  I also intend to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally or even possibly, if you start thinking about it, may be a NATO ally which will greatly advance security and cooperation between our countries.</p><p>ROBERTS:  In the Oval Office prior to their joint press appearance, President Trump was asked about his weekend Twitter feud with Meghan McCain after President Trump ripped her father for giving the FBI the unverified Steele dossier.</p><p>The President was unapologetic pointing to McCain's vote against repealing and replacing Obamacare.</p><p>TRUMP:  So he campaigned, he told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace and then for some reason, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up.  I think that's disgraceful.  I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.</p><p>ROBERTS:  President Trump also weighed in on Twitter and Facebook today after his director of social media was temporarily blocked on Facebook and Republican Congressman Devin Nunes filed a $250 million lawsuit against Twitter.</p><p>TRUMP:  It seems to be if they're conservative. If they're Republicans, if they are in a certain group, that is discrimination, a big discrimination.  I do think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS:  President Trump also used Bolsonaro's visit to take a swing at the emerging socialist movement in the Democratic Party here.  Bolsonaro won the presidency in Brazil by campaigning against the socialist corruption that had led to Brazil's economic decline.  President Trump repeated his mantra that the U.S. economy is stronger than ever and that the last thing we need is socialism -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Thanks -- John.</p><p>Let's get some insight on the U.S. economy and the President's big plans from the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, Kevin Hassett.  Kevin -- thanks for being here.</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS:  It's good to be here.</p><p>BAIER:  Your overview first of all this report just out, you seem kind of ecstatic but --</p><p>M1:  Yes.  I'm always ecstatic.</p><p>BAIER:  -- behind that.</p><p>M1:  Right.  Well, I think that basically what we've done is we published a book with 700 pages that documents President Trump's policies are working, that the economy has gone from the new normal of low growth to the old normal of 3 percent growth, that it's doing it precisely because the policies are working the way economists think they should.</p><p>So we said a year ago in the fall that capital spending would working, the economy has gone from a new normal of low growth to the old normal of 3 percent growth and it's doing it precisely because the policies are working the way economists think they should.</p><p>And so we said a year ago in the fall that capitol spending would boom and that factories have come back to America.  We documented that that is happening in the data.</p><p>We said when the factories would come back, that people would be hired more and so unemployment rate went down to historic lows for just about every category rate -- democratic category.  And we said that wages would grow a lot because the people at the factories would be competing for workers and we see that as well.</p><p>And the most striking thing on that, you know, I promise not to filibuster is the bottom 10 percent of Americans saw wage growth last year of 6.5 percent.</p><p>BAIER:  JPMorgan in their forecast for 2019 said this.  \"Significant U.S. economic outperformance is unlikely to persist through 2019 as the sugar rush of the fiscal stimulus wanes.\"</p><p>M1:  Yes.  So a lot of people said that we wouldn't have a sugar rush and now they're calling it a sugar rush, but it's not a sugar rush.  So a sugar rush again  --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>M1:  People should we are having a sugar rush but it's not a sugar rush.  People should go to a Disney.  It's even like a that admits that sugar does that to you.  But in any case if we ate at twinkie and a bunch of twinkies and spent all our money on twinkies.   The next would bad and we wouldn't have any money and we'd be sorry when we did that.</p><p>What happened now is that we didn't, you know eat Twinkies.  We took vitamins and we made the economy stronger exercise and it's stronger from now on.</p><p>And so people built more factories last year, that made the GDP go up because they're buying machines. This year though, factories are turning on and they're going to make output and that's going to make GDP go up again.  So it's the opposite of a sugar rush.</p><p>BAIER:  For the folks who are critical about the next steps -- like what are the next steps this administration will take to try to push that growth forward?</p><p>MILLER:  Well, I think the first thing is that we just have to like hold the line here.  There are a lot of people who want repeal this policies that in the economic report we demonstrate worked.</p><p>But then the next thing is that there's a lot of stuff that we could do without Congress in the deregulation states, we have a whole chapter documenting the big impact on the economy -- positive impact of deregulation.  And then there are other things that we could do that require legislation that we hope to infrastructure spending.</p><p>America's infrastructure is decaying a lot and we can fix that.  And historically those kind of fixes have happen on a bipartisan basis.</p><p>BAIER:  \"Wall Street Journal\" pointing out that some of the tax cuts expire.  They have a timeline on them.  They said the 2017 tax law also created temporary incentives for alcohol producers and businesses that provide family leave, both of which expire this year.</p><p>So by including revenue from expected scheduled explorations in the budget the administration sets fiscal targets in such a way that either it has to support those tax increases happening as scheduled or find replacement revenue.  So which one will you do?</p><p>M1:  Right.  Well, in our budget, we basically assume that almost all the tax cuts are permanent and that's the way we do the math.</p><p>And so I don't know what this guy is saying but that's the way we do the math in our budget.  President Trump has a whole bunch of policy objectives including things like infrastructure spending, making tax cuts permanent, getting more people into the work force by adding work requirements to some of the welfare programs.</p><p>And all of those policies are in the baseline of our assumptions in the economic report.  And so if you say well, that's a rosy scenario you're saying that maybe there's going to be 3 percent growth over the next decade.</p><p>You know, I agree that it's an optimistic scenario because it's a scenario where President Trump's policies are enacted into law.  If they're not enacted into law if people obstruct our ability to engage in these positive policies and for sure growth will fall short.</p><p>BAIER:  The President is heading to Ohio.  Sherrod Brown, the senator from Ohio has this suggestion about cars. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO:  -- last week.  So I've been talking to the President about this.  He finally he woke up and acted like he wants to do something.</p><p>He should be going to Congress and say pass past the American Cars and American Jobs Act.  Briefly, it works this way.  You buy a car listed of 100 vehicles made, mostly in the United States.  You buy one of those, you get a $3500 off rebate at the dealership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  So in other words, protect U.S. automakers by giving them this rebate, something that you guys would look at?</p><p>M1:  You know, I haven't spoken with the President about that specific proposal but he has been fighting and fighting and fighting since he's been here for auto workers, to move auto plants from other countries to the U.S.</p><p>And so I think the specific thing that Senator Brown, who I have a great deal of admiration for, is mentioning that there's a GM plant that's closing in Ohio that the two of them have been talking about.</p><p>I think that GM has very idiosyncratic problems.  Most of the auto makers are doing great, they are expanding.  A lot of, you know -- Ford is expanding and a lot of foreign manufacturers are moving production to the U.S</p><p>And so I think that, you know, we certainly want to save that plant but I think that there are idiosyncratic problems for GM.  They'll require a massive new bill.  President Trump has been fighting for automakers all across the board, the trade deals or the tax cuts, everything else.</p><p>BAIER:  The trade deals are a big factor in how this economy looks.  And you are optimistic.</p><p>M1:  Yes.  Yes.  That's right.  And Ambassador Lighthizer is continuing the talks with Secretary Mnuchin and, you know, I think, you know, I have set a couple times on the air that we are at the point where you don't want the groom to see the bride.</p><p>But you know, it's really hard to negotiate a trade deal.  It's a lot of hard work and there's a lot of legalese that has to be worked out correctly and I think Ambassador Lighthizer is the guy that can lead that effort to (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BAIER:  An optimistic Kevin Hassett.  Kevin -- thanks a lot.</p><p>M1:  Thanks.</p><p>BAIER:  I appreciate the time.</p><p>M1: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BAIER:  In \"America's Election Headquarters\" tonight, an effort by some Democrats running for president to expand the U.S. Supreme Court, an issue that lingered on the political rim for decades has suddenly and surprisingly become a hot campaign topic on the trail.</p><p>Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon Bream takes a look at trying to radically change the rules for choosing our unelected justices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  All the options are on the table.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT:  Some White House wannabes are talking up a judicial redo, an effort to tap into lingering progressive anger over President Trump's two nominees for the high court -- Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>WARREN:  When it swings back around to us what are we going to do?</p><p>BREAM:  The solution FOR many Democrats?  More is best, reforming who can serve and for how long.  Among the proposals: rotating justices on and off the bench from the lower appellate courts and term limits for currently life tenured federal judges.</p><p>SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Term limits for Supreme Court justices might be one thing, it gives every president the ability to choose three.  We have people holding onto those seats in ways that I don't think is necessarily healthy.</p><p>BREAM:  South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has his own plan.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), SOUTH BEND, INDIANA:  One idea that I think is interesting is you have 15 members but only ten of them are appointed in the political fashion, five of them can only be seated by a unanimous agreement of the other ten.</p><p>BREAM:  The constitution does not establish a set number of justices -- that's up to Congress.  There were initially six members of the high court, then five, then seven, then nine, down to eight, ten for a while, back down to eight before finally settling on nine a century and a half ago.</p><p>FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will appoint Justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the Congress.</p><p>BREAM:  Franklin Roosevelt's audacious court packing plan in the 1930s to add up to six justices met with widespread public and political condemnation and was soon abandoned.  It's no secret the other two branches have long chafed at high court rulings limiting presidential and congressional power.</p><p>So to change the decision, the thinking goes change the deciders with more choices a new Democratic president could quickly offset the current 5-4 conservative majority.</p><p>TRUMP:  We would have no interest in that whatsoever.  It will never happen.  It won't happen. I guarantee you it won't happen for six years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So help me God.</p><p>BREAM:  Some court watchers think the current Democratic expansion tease has little chance of success.</p><p>ILYA SYAPIRO, CATO INSTITUTE:  Something this controversial could be bad for the Democrats indeed in the 2020 election.  If you start adding justices for purely partisan motives, that can't help but divide the country even further.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  There are prominent Democrats on the Hill cautioning their colleagues in the 2020 pack not to waste time on what they are calling a fool's errand with regards to radically making over the high court.</p><p>And while they may be split, Republicans aren't.

We had the biggest election turnout since 1966 last year.  If the idea here is to make it more likely we have a higher turnout.  It seems to me that's happening.</p><p>EMANUEL:  And other Republicans countered Democrats are pushing it because they're convinced it would benefit them.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  They think more of those individuals are going to vote Democrat.  They think it helps them, just like they think allowing noncitizens will help them.

They have been there a long time, between him and his predecessor.  At some point I would imagine things will change.  But we really haven't done the really tough sanctions yet.

But other than that, really, Venezuela was the big deal, and the president made it clear that he felt there was a lot more that the United States could do, because the question really was, what you have been doing isn't working.  Maduro is still there, what are you going to do?  And he really made it clear that he feels there's a lot more the United States can still do.</p><p>BAIER:  Amy?</p><p>AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\":  Right.  And the question is, what is on the table for what the White House can still do, what the U.S. can still do, whether it is sanctions or whether there is more on the table is really unclear at this point.</p><p>I do think the fact the president spent time with someone who sees eye to eye with him on the way in which the world works, in the way in which they see government working or not working, the idea that there is fake news, this was a chance for the president to show that he has allies around the world who are willing to stand side-by-side with him in a part of the world that continues to be very difficult.</p><p>BAIER:  Yes, and what was interesting is they talked a lot about space and the prospect of launching U.S. spacecraft in the future, Matthew, from Brazil, that possibly countering China's getting into Latin America with a deal with Argentina.</p><p>MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\":  That's right, an important statement for one of the most interesting and most important relationships I think in the world today, Bret.  And Bolsonaro, following Trump's lead, they both represent a new model of leadership for democracies, and that is they are both nationalists, they're both anti-elitist, they're both socially conservative, and you can tell by Bolsonaro's rhetoric that his voters are very similar to many of Trump's voters in what they care about and what they believe.</p><p>And they are also capitalists.

And when you get to the back scene, back office statements made by executives of the various companies and you see the level of, in many cases, hatred they have for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election, it's very, very fair to say that we have to do something about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  That's a follow-up to a tweet, Amy, where he tweeted out \"Facebook, Google, and Twitter, not to mention the corrupt media, are sooo on the side of the radical left Democrats.  But fear not, we will win anyway, just like we did before! #MAGA.\" The issue of social media and these big tech giants seems to be an issue for both sides.</p><p>WALTER:  I was just going to say that, Bret.  For once you now see the president and Democrats, including very liberal Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, agreeing on the monopolization of power by these big tech organizations.  You already had a lot of Democrats upset with what they saw was a hands-off approach by Facebook, by Google to Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Elizabeth Warren now out saying we need to break up these big tech companies.  And this was the place, Silicon Valley continues to be a place where a lot of Democratic fundraising comes from, where a lot of the Democratic operatives come from, and yet it no longer has that same shine, shininess, to Democrats, at least Democratic presidential candidates, as it once did.</p><p>BAIER:  And Byron, on the flipside for Republicans who are usually against regulations, it seems like there is a growing chorus about doing something about tech giants.</p><p>YORK:  There is, and this is really odd.  Obviously, this a president who loves Twitter, it's been extremely important in his campaign and his presidency.  I think he once said it was like buying \"The New York Times\" without any debt.  It was just a great way to communicate with voters.  But he actually supports this Devin Nunes lawsuit.  The reaction on the left has been to laugh at the Nunes lawsuit, but a lot of conservatives do believe that some of the big social media companies use algorithms and other technical ways to suppress some of their ideas.  And I think the Nunes lawsuit, maybe its biggest benefit would be to try to shake some information loose about whether that actually happens or not.</p><p>BAIER:  All right, panel, stand by.  Next up, Democratic presidential contenders want to make some big changes to the country, but do you?  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE, (D) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE:  What if there were five justices selected by Democrats, five justices selected by Republicans, and those 10 then pick five more justices independent of those who chose the first 10.  I think that's an idea we should explore.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's not just about throwing more justices on the court.  What I think we need to do is some kind of structural reform that makes the court less political.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election, they want to try doing it in a different way.  Now, we would have no interest in that whatsoever.  It will never happen.  It won't happen, I guarantee it won't happen for six years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP).</p><p>BAIER:  President Trump in the Rose Garden here at the White House answering a question about increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court.  It is a talking point now for a number of candidates as you look at the list here.  Several of them are now talking openly on the campaign trail about Supreme Court reform, as it's called.  They talk about it differently, but all say adding more justices in one way or another is something they would consider or want to do.  But \"The Washington Post\" has a piece about Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat from Colorado considering getting in the race, \"slammed his head on the table four times when I asked him what he thought about other Democratic presidential contenders embracing the idea of expanding the Supreme Court.  Having seen up close just how cynical and how vicious the Tea Party guys and the Freedom Caucus guys and Mitch McConnell had been, the last thing I want to do is be those guys, he said during an interview at a coffee shop.\"</p><p>We'll start there with the 2020.  Back with the panel.  Amy, is this catching on?</p><p>WALTER:  It is really fascinating, Bret, how much process has become part of the Democratic debate within the Democratic presidential candidates, within that field.  It's not just the Supreme Court.  It's also getting rid of the Electoral College, which is gaining a lot of steam.  A number of candidates, including Elizabeth Warren last night, coming out in favor of abolishing of the Electoral College.  Getting what of the filibuster, something the president talks a lot about.  There are a lot of liberal Democrats who believe that's the only way if a Democrat becomes president to see a progressive agenda come through.  You have to get rid of the filibuster.  Adding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states.</p><p>The feeling overall from a lot of Democrats, not just activists, but now people who are running for president is feeling that for years Democrats have played by the rules, Republicans haven't.  And they have lost opportunities where Republicans have taken them, and they pointed specifically, of course, to Merrick Garland and the decision not to hold hearings on Merrick Garland.  They say we know Michelle Obama told us in the 2016 campaign when they go low, we go high.  Well, maybe going high isn't working anymore.  So let's not do it.</p><p>BAIER:  Matthew, you look at all of these things.  You look at abolishing the Electoral College.  You look at adding more Supreme Court justices.  You look at reducing the voting age to 16.  They all fit obviously a beneficial to Democrats in voting overall.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  That's right.  And the Democratic argument isn't with any single one of these things.  It's not only with the Electoral College, it's not only with the 26th Amendment, it's not only with the state of the Supreme Court, it's not only with equal representation of small states in the United States Senate.  The Democratic argument, Bret, is with the Constitution of the United States of America.</p><p>And the argument is because the left cannot win its arguments when they present them publicly.  So in order to win, they need to change the structure.  You heard Mayor Buttigieg right there say, the structural change necessary.  What structure are they changing?  They are changing the Constitution of the United States whose structure is there to preserve individual liberty.  Barack Obama said he was audacious.  This is audacity.</p><p>BAIER:  Byron, Elizabeth Warren made that case about the Electoral College last night, we played the soundbite earlier, saying that every vote needs to count.  But Lindsey Graham makes the opposite in a tweet, saying \"The desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically.\"  And the focus being on the big states that have the most population, and the Iowas and New Hampshires and even the middle of the country would get less say, really.</p><p>YORK:  Yes, what they'd really plan to do is the end run around the Electoral College.  They realize they can't change the constitution, so there is a plan that if enough states whose electoral votes total 270 agreed to give their electors to whoever won the popular vote, then that would do it.  They're not there yet, so this is not really close to happening.</p><p>But it would change our politics completely.  Candidates would spend a lot of time trying to run up the score in California.  Democrats would, Republicans would try to do the same in Texas.  The Electoral College requires a majority of delegates.  A popular election would just require a winner.  There doesn't have to be two political parties, there could be a lot of different candidates and a plurality candidate could win.  Playing with our constitutional order is a really dangerous thing.</p><p>BAIER:  Amy, just to get back to what you said at the beginning, the process being such a focus.  As one candidate talks about it, it seems like they all start to talk about it.  And when you have the over/under being 20 voices talking about the same process things, does that hurt Democrats on the trail?</p><p>WALTER:  I think they are meeting the activists where they are and the base where the base is.  And again, I'm sure all of us here around the table have been in and around politics long enough that we have heard arguments both for and against the Electoral College for a long time, but it never really made its way up to the people that were running for president or potentially could be president.  Now it's actually getting a hearing.  It's unclear about how long that's going to stay there.</p><p>One other interesting point, though.  The debate over the Electoral College isn't new, and it's not always on one side of the other.  Back in 2004, 54 percent of Republicans wanted to get rid of the Electoral College, wanted to see a popular vote winner.  And now, says Gallup, that number is down to 19 percent.</p><p>BAIER:  We'll follow it.  Maybe we'll get to some substance on policy, too.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks, panel.  When we come back, a special surprise for a karate kid.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  A gorgeous night here at the White House.  Finally tonight, a surprise for one karate kid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Daddy?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Staff Sergeant Rob Cesternino surprised his nine-year-old son Luca during martial arts class Monday at Lebanon, Tennessee.  He was wearing a blindfold.  He didn't think his dad would be home until the following week.  Rob and Luca were both given honorary belts at karate class, and that is just an awesome moment. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  I could play those all day long.  That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT.  Fair, balanced and unafraid.  \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha starts right now.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2194263842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPY-H751-JBHT-D2C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Making the announcement, National Security Advisor John Bolton spark talk of an even bigger threat because this yellow notepad there have the words 5,000 troops to Colombia scrolled and exposed for all to see.</p><p>In an address, President Maduro lashed out at President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (THROUGH TRANSLATOR):  I make Donald Trump responsible for any violence that might happen in Venezuela.  You will be the one responsible, Mr. President Donald Trump.  Responsible for this policy of regime change in Venezuela and the blood that could flow in Venezuela will be the blood that will be on your hands.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, backs Maduro.  He calls the U.S. sanctions illegal.  While the U.S.-backed interim president, Juan Guaido, praised them for protecting Venezuelan assets.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, SELF-DECLARED INTERIM VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  For a very long time, Marudor's regime stole this money, an estimated $4 billion which is four times Venezuela's GDP and losses.  This would protect assets so that they can be used towards Venezuelans and to attend to the humanitarian emergency that is at the center of our policies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  There is a massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela right now.  So, the United Nations says more than 40 Venezuelans have been killed in the recent unrest and 850 have been arrested.</p><p>But what happens if there is a violent crackdown.  Joining me now is Senator Bob Menendez, his the Democratic senator from New Jersey, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p><p>Senator Menendez, welcome to the program.</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D-NJ:  Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let's start first with this -- the sanctions.  You heard what President Maduro said and it is par for the course.  The Venezuelans from Chavez and even beyond have always used as they're calling card the threat that the United States is engineering, a coup and they're constantly blaming the U.S.  What do you make of the effect of these sanctions?  What will they do?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, I think the sanctions, which I support, I wrote the first sanctions against the Maduro regime back in 2014, and we've seen a growing bipartisan support for using diplomatic and economic and political efforts to try to bring democracy back to Venezuela.  I think the world largely recognizes that Maduro is not a legitimate president.</p><p>And so, the sanctions, at the end of the day, create a real challenge to the Maduro regime, particularly the ones that were just announced against PDVSA, the state oil company.  So, I think they are very significant.</p><p>And listen, as it relates to Maduro's comments about the -- I heard the clip that you ran about the blood is going to be on the hands of the United States, the blood that has already been shed by Venezuelans peacefully trying to create change in their country has all been at Maduro's hands and those of his leadership.  So, I think that's a hollow statement to make.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let's switch now to this talk.  I mean, I asked, leading into you, what happens if, what happens if the army turns against the people.  What do you know now?  What sort of intelligence do you have?  Do you have any confidence of where the army stands?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, I think it's very telling that Maduro has not had his army and security forces arrest Juan Guaido, the interim president of Venezuela, under their constitution, which by the way, is a constitution created under former Venezuelan President Chavez.  So, it's their own constitution that they've invoked to claim the right to be an interim president as a result of false elections.</p><p>So, I think the fact that he has not called upon security forces to arrest Guaido, which he has done to others in the past is very telling, he doesn't want to risk it.  And the reality is, the generals may be living very well because they're part of the kleptomatic government that Maduro.  But -- and the corrupt government that he runs.</p><p>But the average soldier, they're suffering like the Venezuelan people are.  And I think in that respect, I think it is highly unlikely they will turn their guns against their brothers and sisters.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, let's just play a quick clip, one of our reporters talked to a couple of those lower rank soldiers who were defected to neighboring Colombia.  Here's what here's what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLOS GUILLEN MARTINEZ, VENEZUELA ARMY DEFECTOR (through translator):  As Venezuelan soldiers, we're making a request to the U.S., he says, to support us, in logistical terms with communication, with weapons so we can realize Venezuelan freedom.</p><p>JOSUE HIDALGO AZUAJE, VENEZUELA ARMY DEFECTOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR):  We're not saying we need only U.S. support but also from Brazil, Colombia, Peru, all brother countries that are against this dictatorship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They show me the WhatsApp groups plotting rebellion they hope to reach thousands of soldiers but they also rejected any possible military intervention by U.S. forces themselves.</p><p>AZUAJE:  We don't want a foreign government invading our country, he says.  If we need an incursion, it has to be Venezuelan soldiers who really want to free Venezuela.  Now, we're unifying military groups working towards freedom to create a really big one that can be decisive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Senator, I know you speak fluent Spanish, obviously, you could hear them in their own language and you could hear the translation, they were very, very clear, no U.S. intervention but yes, please, U.S. military support and help and logistics.</p><p>Do you think that there -- well, where do you stand on this?  Because as I said, also, you know, John Bolton, National Security Adviser, sparked a whole load of questions with that yellow notepad and 5,000 troops to Colombia.  What do you know about what's going on in that regard?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, I don't know anything specifically in that regard as it relates to any potential military movement.  It would be a huge mistake and I oppose military -- any form of military intervention in Venezuela.  It would undermine the very effort of the democratic movement in Venezuela and the credibility of that democratic movement.  The freedom of Venezuela will come through the hands of Venezuelans not to the intervention of the United States or any other nation.</p><p>But I think it's critically important that the 20 or so countries, including many from the Western Hemisphere who have traditionally shied away from speaking about human rights and democracy, violations in their neighboring country, have risen their voice in this regard, and I think that's a powerful message.  And joined not only by their words but hopefully for their actions in terms of economic consequences, I think the Venezuelan people can restore democracy in their nation.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let's just stay on this military intervention for a moment.  You know, President Trump himself, at the very beginning of his administration, raise sort of questions with various tweets about this.  And in response to questions about the famous Bolton notepads, again, the administration said all options are on the table.  Are you concerned that there is some move afoot amongst, let's say, people in the White House to potentially introduce U.S. military force to Venezuela?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, you know, it's interesting because that would be counter to everything else the president's inclinations are.  You know, drawing troops from Syria at a time that that's a challenge, supposedly he is paired to announce withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to some degree.  So, his predilection seems to be to move American involvement abroad away and back at home, this would be totally counter to that.</p><p>Now, whether it is a bluff, although I don't think you have a bluff with our military, or whether it is just to keep all the options open to suggest that all the options are open.  But in reality, I cannot envision the United States and I strongly would oppose the United States seeking to intervene militarily in Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But you could imagine U.S. troops going to friendly countries like Colombia, next door, to support, could you?  I mean, could that be what's afoot potentially?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  I don't think that the Colombians or any of Venezuela's neighbors will want to seek its military engagement in Venezuela.  They have been doing a tremendous service in dealing with the humanitarian crisis and the flows of Venezuelans fleeing Venezuela.  I think that as we ratchet up the sanctions, you know, sales to the United States from Venezuela about $28 million a day, those monies should be used to actually help the humanitarian relief that is necessary to help the Venezuelan people as they seek to restore democracy in their country.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Why is it then -- you brought it up, that President Trump to, you know, tailback or rather scale back military interventions overseas.  What do you think it's -- it is why he has decided to get so active in this regard, I know it's in the hemisphere, but immediately recognizing, as we know, almost sort of planning, you know, with Juan Guaido and with who is president of the National Assembly and immediately sort of recognizing and getting other countries to do so as well?  Why is that in in President Trump's interest?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, obviously, I'm sure that he has heard the voices of many, including many Venezuelan Americans who reside, for example, in Florida and who have experienced firsthand the flight and the necessity to become refugees in the United States about what's happening under Chavez.  I think that there is a hemispheric recognition that Chavez is driving one of the nations in the Western Hemisphere that should have among the greatest wealth into a humanitarian catastrophe.  And I think as someone who worries about refugee flows, as we have seen, I think the last thing he wants to see is another set of refugee flows this time from Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I know you meant Chavez's successor Maduro.  But let me let me ask you this, the United States, of course, ever since the late 1800 with the invasion of Mexico, it has a record, you know, 10 arms long of intervention in Latin America.  And, of course, all the people who oppose this recognition in Venezuela keep pointing to that.</p><p>And what do you say to people like Russia or the others or people in the hemisphere itself who say, you know, \"What business do the United States have getting involved in here.  Look at their record on our continent\"?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, first of all, I never rely on the Russians to talk about our national interest or observance of international law or human rights and democracy.  Their record is dismal, they keep violating international law.  So, they're certainly not the -- my litmus test.</p><p>As it relates to other countries in the hemisphere, I would say that the Democratic Charter of the OAS, which all countries of the hemisphere have signed onto should be the guiding principle.  And it is that Democratic Charter of the OAS that we are largely following in terms of the actions that we are taking.</p><p>And so, what I do rejoice into someone who has spent a lot of time in Western Hemisphere foreign policy is that we now see a series of nations, Western Hemisphere nations, Latin American nations, leading as well in calling for Maduro to step down and recognizing Juan Guaido as the actual provisional president of Venezuela.</p><p>That's something that we would not have seen many years ago.  It's a turn for the better in terms of promotion of democracy and human rights of the hemisphere.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, you mention all the oil and how much the Venezuelan sell to the United States.  With these sanctions, do you think they will keep selling and do you also believe, is it the generals or aid general who is in charge of the state oil company?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, certainly, I believe that they will need an outlet, you know, refineries in the United States are doing a lot of this work.  So, I think that they will continue to sale and they will have a need to do so.  They will need time to try to divert their sales and to find other markets and refineries to be able to do that.  So, that that cannot be turned on a dime.</p><p>Now, one of the reasons that the general should start rethinking the reality is because their pathway to the type of money they have received through Maduro is less likely to be realized now, and I think that may affect their thinking as well.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, just to go back to the oil question and John Bolton, he was on \"Fox Business\" recently and he basically specifically cited the oil and the economic benefit that it could bring to the United States.  He basically said, \"It'll make a big difference to the U.S. economically if we could have American oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in Venezuela.  Also, it would be good for the people of Venezuela.\"</p><p>So, he said it would be a win-win situation.  So, that might be.  But do you -- have you heard from the administration whether there is a plan B if things don't turn out the way you hope, if I do holds onto power, if he appoints somebody else who's equally unpalatable or in the worst-case scenario, if there is a violent crackdown?  What is the plan B as far as you know?</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Well, I'm not sure what is the plan B.  On the economic side, I believe the administration believes that both the production in the United States of oil and global oil supplies would not be affected by the situation in Venezuela.</p><p>As it relates to if Maduro steps down and appoints someone who is not only unpalatable but illegal, you know, at the end of the day, if you follow the constitution, the Venezuelan constitution, the only democratically elected person at this point in Venezuela is Juan Guaido as the president the National Assembly and those members of the National Assembly.  And so, outside of that, they would be violating their own constitution.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  All right.  Senator Bob Menendez, thank you so much for joining us from Capitol Hill.</p><p>MENENDEZ:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>And, of course, full disclosure, Senator Menendez's daughter, Alicia Menendez, is a contributer to this program.</p><p>Now, we get the Venezuelan side of the story.  And I am joined by Francisco Sucre.  He is a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly and a supporter of the Assembly president, Juan Guaido.  In fact, tomorrow, Mr. Sucre is off to Brussels to get the E.U. to formally recognized Guaido as interim Venezuelan president.</p><p>Francisco Sucre, welcome from Madrid.</p><p>You heard --</p><p>FRANCISCO SUCRE, MEMBER, VENEZUELAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY:  Thank you.  Thank you for this interview, the possibility.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  No, it's OK.  I interrupted you.  But you heard Senator Bob Menendez, a very powerful member of the United States Senate, fully backing your president, certainly, the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido.</p><p>We were talking about, you know, you trying to get more recognition for him.  What are you going to be doing in Brussels tomorrow?</p><p>SUCRE:  Yes.  At this point, already more than 25 countries has recognized Mr. Guaido as the president of Venezuela, the interim president.  We hope that the European Union who is going to do the same.  Already, Germany, Spain, France, many countries of the European Union has said that Juan Guaido is the president.</p><p>We have to remember the reading of this crisis.  (INAUDIBLE) the election that we have last year, the presidential election, we had a fraudulent presidential election.  And out of that, Mr. Maduro wants to be in power for six more years.</p><p>When we had this legal election, the European Union, all the Latin American countries, the U.S., Canada, all the -- all of the democratic world said that that election was a fraudulent election.  So, at this point, we are conducting a very fierce struggle for recovering democracy, the constitutional law, the constitutional rule in Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Let me just ask you this then, because the constitutional point that you're following by taking this move says that now, the interim president, Juan Guaido, has to call new elections within 30 days of making that move.  Is that even possible?  Will you be able to actually abide by that part of the constitutional provision?</p><p>SUCRE:  No, no.  That seat, at this point, is not possible in Venezuela.  They Article 333 of National Constitution of Venezuela clearly says that we have to -- every citizen of Venezuela with authority or not has the responsibility of, you know, work to restore the constitutional rule.</p><p>At this point, we don't have institutions in Venezuela that can go ahead without election.  First, we have to choose a new electoral council.  The one that we have right now is some electoral council that is full of political members of Maduro's party.</p><p>So, we have first to call elections, to have a very independent -- as the constitution says, independent body that can conduct those elections.  So, we have to bring back that constitutional rule in order to apply the Article 233 that says that in 30 days we have to convene elections.  But at this point, we can't do that because we don't have institutions to do that.  So, that's why from the National Assembly we have a clear road for the next on days.</p><p>First, we have to aim to bring an end to the false (ph) operation of Mr. Maduro.  Second, we have to have transitional government.  The transitional government is that one that is going to conduct those elections once we have a new independent power in Venezuela.  And then, we have to convey those three elections.  Three elections like --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  OK.</p><p>SUCRE:  -- Mexico have in the past, Brazil, et cetera.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  OK.  So, let me ask you this then, a lot of this is going to depend on, I assume, cooperation from Maduro and the government.  Right now you have one country two presidents, and he's claiming that he's still president and that it will be on your head and on the U.S.'s head if there is any violence or any trouble in the country.</p><p>What is the state of discussion between Juan Guaido and President Maduro or between Juan Guaido and the leader of the Venezuela Armed Forces?</p><p>SUCRE:  So, first, in Venezuela, we don't have two presidents.  We have one president and Maduro who is claiming to be a president.</p><p>And regarding the armed forces, at this point, Christiane, Maduro only has that support, that's the only support that Maduro has at this point.  We approve of the National Assembly a law, a new law, last week for -- to convey all the civilians and the military officers to turn away from the dictatorship and hand -- give their hands to the democracy and the respect of the human rights.</p><p>So, that law is to guarantee immunity and to apply guaranties for those military officers that work with us in order to restore democracy.  At this point, Mr. Maduro has all the responsibility of what's going on in Venezuela.</p><p>I heard what Maduro last day (INAUDIBLE), I think, blaming the U.S. for any violent thing that can happen Venezuela.  But the only responsibility of the violence in Venezuela is going to be from Maduro.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  OK.  So, Senator Menendez said that he found it interesting and very indicative that Maduro has not ordered the arrest of Juan Guaido, as you know better than I do, many opposition leaders have been arrested, but Juan Guaido remains free.  There are -- he is calling Guaido for more street protests tomorrow.</p><p>Again, are you concerned that the head of the armed forces who say they will die to protect their country, are you concerned that there might be a military crackdown?</p><p>SUCRE:  But they are minority.  You know, the high-ranking officials, of course, they are supporting Maduro at this point because they are, you know, involved in this crime economy that we have in Venezuela.  But the -- maybe on the lower ranks of the armed force are with at the democracy.  And we are sure that in the next weeks, days, there is going to be a breakdown in the channel of -- inside the --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Chain of command?</p><p>SUCRE:  -- military of Venezuela.  They are going to have to choose, they have to choose between the constitution, democracy, the wellbeing of the Venezuelan people.  As you know, half of the world knows, we are facing the worst humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, more than 3.5 million Venezuelans have left the country, you know, because of the economic devastation that we have in Venezuela.  Our economy is in rings right now.</p><p>So, in order to have --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  OK.</p><p>SUCRE:  -- (INAUDIBLE) in the hemisphere, we have to restore democracy in Venezuela.  That's why all the countries, Latin American countries, the U.S., Canada, all the countries are working with us in order to restore democray in Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  OK.  Mr. Sucre, the noise behind you is very, very loud.  There's a taxi driver protest in Madrid but we're listening to very, very close.</p><p>SUCRE:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But I want to answer me very, very quickly.  If Maduro stays, what is your plan B if he does not give up power and do you favor a U.S. military intervention?</p><p>SUCRE:  Listen, our plan B is keep fighting.  Keep fighting because we have a responsibility with Venezuelans, we as citizens of this country have this responsibility and we are going to keep fighting.</p><p>And regarding the military intervention, you know, you said in the interview that the U.S. already said all options are under the table.  When you were talking about national security for every country, even my country, Venezuela, of course, all options always are under the table.</p><p>But if that happens, if this extreme situation happens, the only one responsible for that will be Mr. Maduro.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I see you're keeping all options on the table too.  Francisco Sucre, thank you very much indeed for joining us.</p><p>Now, amid the Venezuela showdown, at home, the showdown between the president and Congress ended in the government reopening without any money for President Trump's border wall.  A move many have hailed as a success for the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi early in her new leadership.</p><p>Now, she held the president's State of the Union address as her trump card, so to speak.  It was supposed to be delivered tonight.  Instead, Pelosi has now invited him to address the nation next Tuesday.</p><p>To break down this tussle at the top in Washington, I'm joined by the former vice president of the Trump Organization, Barbara Res, and the former Republican congresswoman, Mia Love.</p><p>Welcome to both of you.  Thank you for joining us.</p><p>I think everybody took a look at what was going on in Washington.  Unbelievable that it took more than 35 days for this to be resolved and that it was, in the words of some observers, a 5-foot-2 liberal congresswoman from California who simply outplayed the president of the United States.</p><p>Barbara Res, what did you think when you saw this power game happening and unfolding in Washington?  You know President Trump very, very well.</p><p>BARBARA RES, FORMER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION:  I thought probably was very angry at what happened.  But I felt that he totally underestimated Pelosi and he totally did not know how the how the system works.  He did not know -- I don't think he's even convinced as of yet that the power of the Congress is equal to the power of the president.</p><p>And because of that, I think he thought he could ride over Pelosi and the Congress and I thought -- I think he thought he could ride over her because she was a woman.  So, he made those two mistakes and they came back to haunt him.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Before I ask Congressman Mia Love, you know, you say because she was woman.  But I mean, I'm talking to you, you were promoted to the top, top ranks of this organization, you became vice president of the organization.  He has been quoted as saying and you quote him as saying that, \"One good woman is better than 10 men.\"  You know, what happened in the interim?  How do we underestimate this strong woman?</p><p>RES:  Well, because he basically believes that one good -- many good women are as good as men but overall, men are better than women, and that was a promise of it, men are better than women but one good woman is better than 10 good men.</p><p>And in his mind, he is superior to all women and -- well, he superior to everyone but that sense, the fact that he promoted me and gave me a job and everything, I always knew my place when it came to him.  I fought with him and, you know, spoke back to him and everything, which is not what they do now.  But certainly, he always thought I'm smarter than Barbara (ph).</p><p>And I think that he did have a lot of strong women and prefer to have strong women because he did not feel there was a competition, that it was basically known that he was superior to them by nature of his gender.  And so, where he had more weak people on the male side, his women were very strong and feisty and they stood up to everyone but not him.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It's really fascinating.  Congresswoman Mia Love, I know that Nancy Pelosi is not a member of your party, she's not a house speaker.  But how did you -- you know, how did you take this sort of showdown?</p><p>MIA LOVE, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN:  Well, I can tell you that both sides actually gained some pretty big mistakes.  And I can tell you the president, from the very beginning, when it comes to the campaign trail, saying that he was going to build a wall and Mexico was going to pay for it, I mean, that was certainly not the approach that he should have taken.  He should have just gone in and talked about the importance of border security and started making his case for border security from that point on.</p><p>You can see there are a lot of even Democrats that are supportive of border security, determining of what kind, how that's done is completely different.  The other mistake that he made was to sit down with Chuck Schumer and say, \"Well, I will own this shutdown if you do not give me border security.\"  All of a sudden, myself and all of my other colleagues were like, \"Whoa, wait a minute, what's going on here?  Nobody wants to own a shutdown.\"  So that was the other mistake he made.</p><p>The last mistake that he made was to betray a lot of the GOP members that stood strong and talked about the importance of border security, didn't vote for a bill that didn't have anything that included the border wall or border security, and he still opened up government and allowed that to go without any concessions.  And he also, I would say, betrayed the 800,000 people that went without a paycheck for absolutely nothing.</p><p>Now, Nancy Pelosi, on the other hand, Speaker Pelosi has a couple of things that she has to look out for also.  She has to make sure that she keeps the promises she made.  She told the American people, \"Open up government first and then I will negotiate border security.\"  So that is something that she has to look at.</p><p>The other thing -- the other mistake I think that she made which is a grave mistake is not getting immigration reform out of this.  Now, people are looking to her in terms of TPS, temporary protected status, people who are working who have families here.</p><p>They're actually due to leave the country.  The president is saying you've got to go.  So there are people that are waiting for her to help them.  They -- I mean they're here, they're helping, they're contributing, and there are people that are waiting for a pathway to citizenship.</p><p>There are people that are on -- that are DACA recipients, that life is unpredictable for them.  So she has got some work to do.  She is the speaker of the House and you cannot just be a speaker of the House and completely resist and do nothing.  You've got to be able to show that you can get something done.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  All right.</p><p>LOVE:  I think that there are some issues there that she's going to have to come to grips with.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  I'm going to come back to you on that in a moment.  I want to ask Barbara, though, again, from knowing him and all of the stuff you just told us.  You know, the president calls himself the dealmaker of the century.  This is one of the things that people looked at when they elected him and people have looked at throughout the world in the two years of his presidency.</p><p>Can he make a deal with China?  Can he make a better deal with Iran?  Can he make a deal with North Korea?</p><p>I mean it's not that hopeful if he cannot make a deal with the speaker of the House and -- well, some people have said folds or caves with, as Mia Love said, you know, not a penny or not a commitment for what he wanted most.  What happened to the dealmaker?</p><p>RES:  Well, I think that he can -- first of all, I don't think he admits that he caved.  And I think that he is trying to promote this idea that he is the person who came to the -- you know, rose to the occasion and got the shutdown finished.  And, you know, that he understands that there will be a de-own, he will make it.</p><p>And he is rattling the sword very mightily right now talking about shutting down again which he's not going to do and everyone knows he's not.  And then he's talking about doing the emergency declaration and taking funds away from the military.</p><p>So he is keeping that persona going which I think is forced on his part.  But he's not really quite willing to admit that he is not the negotiator.  Well, he'll never admit it.</p><p>And to be honest with you, there's no history of that.  There's no documentation that says Donald Trump is a great dealmaker.  He's made good deals.  He's made bad deals.  He's caved more often than I can tell you.</p><p>And Tony Schwartz created the name Art of the Deal and made that -- created that persona that Trump ran with.  But it's not really true.  He's not a great dealmaker.  He's a good dealmaker as other -- many other people are.</p><p>Pelosi is a better dealmaker.  And by the way, I'm not worried about her committing to reforming the immigration.  I think that that has been on the table even with Trump's latest offer.  She can fold that in.  So Pelosi knows what she's doing and Trump doesn't in this stage.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It's really fascinating.  Mia Love, I just want to ask you because, you know, you walked away.  I mean again, you're Republican but you walked away from the president over the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.  And he then said this about you when you lost in these midterms.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Mia Love gave me no love and she lost.  Too bad.  Sorry about that, Mia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  What did you learn from your president through that comment?</p><p>LOVE:  Well, like I said, it's-- to me, I didn't know why he said it.  But the only thing I can think of is the fact that, you know, these things are transactional.</p><p>To me, we were doing our job.  I had a prisoner that was from my state, in my district, that was stuck in Venezuela.  And you can see [13:35:00] all of the issues that are happening.  If he were in Venezuela right now, I don't think that he would be alive.</p><p>So, you know, I felt like the president was, in that form, was saying that he was doing it and he was expecting something in return.  I said thank you.  I did whatever I could.</p><p>But on the main aspect of this, I just want to say that I don't follow a person with a letter behind their name.  I follow a set of principles. I follow a platform.</p><p>And I think that one of the things that we are -- we need to do, if the Republican Party is going to continue to survive, we need to make sure that we're holding everyone accountable to that, including the president.  And I can also say that I've been a Republican a lot longer than the president has.</p><p>So I just want him to know that that's not my job, is not to just walk into lockstep.  The American people deserve Washington that works for them, not Washington that works for the White House.  And if we can return back to those principles and get back to the government for people, then I think that this country will see some major differences in this country.</p><p>And one more thing I want to say is we've consolidated way too much power in the White House.  And this is why we're dealing with all of this.  They should not be negotiating with the president.</p><p>People should get together in the House and in the Senate.  The leader should get together, draft their own deal, and then let the president either sign it or veto it.  If he wants something different, people shouldn't be holding votes back in the Senate or in the House waiting for the president -- waiting for the president's OK to sign it.  They should just send it to him and stop giving him so much power because that's not the way the government was set up.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You know I do want to just play this snippet that many people have seen.  But it's about the issues and that is when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were in the White House around this shutdown.  But particularly in light of what you're saying, about the need for a bipartisan compromise, particularly on immigration, let's just play this soundbite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER:  I think the American people recognize that we must keep the government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown.  You have a --</p><p>TRUMP:  Did you say \"Trump\"?</p><p>PELOSI:  You have the White House.</p><p>TRUMP:  I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now and I understand that and I fully understand that.  We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.</p><p>PELOSI:  Mr. President --</p><p>TRUMP:  But we have to have border security.</p><p>PELOSI:  Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So I mean she's laying her cards on the table there.  She's saying \"Look, I just won.  Don't characterize me as being in hoc to anything else.\"  But Barbara, I mean you follow all this as well.  Do you think that it is going to be possible to come to some kind of resolution on what everybody wants?  And that is a proper immigration reform bill.  Do you think that this might lead to that with the strength of the House right now, United House as you saw Nancy Pelosi commanded and with the necessity, I guess for the Republicans to see that the president didn't win in this round?</p><p>RES:  I do think that there is a potential resolution out there.  And I totally agree that the negotiation on these bills should be between the two Houses with the president making his desires known, which is always what is -- what happens and that's proper.</p><p>But I think that Nancy Pelosi is not going to give him money for a wall.  So he's going to have to decide and, you know, influence his people that he will not accept anything and sign in a bill into law that does not include a wall.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  OK.</p><p>RES:  And I don't think that that will work.  I think at the end of the day, he should backtrack, say, \"All I ever wanted was border security, that's what they're giving me.  Maybe imply that there could be wall money in there or that the wall could come in, and make a graceful exit.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  OK.</p><p>RES:  That's what I hope will happen.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I have to give one word to Mia Love, just one.  Do you think that, you know, there can be, after all of this, some kind of bipartisan immigration reform put back on his desk?</p><p>LOVE:  I hope so.  I really do.  I think there can be.  I think that he could actually get the $5.7.  We've already lost $3 billion just in the shutdown.  There is half the wall there.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  All right.</p><p>LOVE:  So I think that there is something that should.  You know, we can come out of this.  But out of that, like I said, there are some great things.  I'm a daughter of parents who immigrated to this country.  Great -- immigration reform is long out due.</p><p>I think that there is something that both of them can get out of this.  And mainly, the American people will win.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And on that note --</p><p>LOVE:  But if they continue to do that, then no one will win.</p><p>[13:40:00] AMANPOUR:  Yes, the American people to win, that would be a good thing.</p><p>Mia Love, Barbara Res, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>And now we turn from Washington to Wall Street continuing our conversation with the bestselling author and \"New York Times\" financial columnist, Andrew Ross Sorkin.</p><p>In part one of his discussion with our Walter Isaacson, among other things, Sorkin talked about how mass shootings could be prevented by monitoring credit cards.  Now, he's looking at the state of the financial food chain beginning with the backlash against globalization.</p><p>WALTER ISAACSON, CONTRIBUTOR:  Were we wrong to think that free trade would benefit everybody?</p><p>ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK TIMES:  I think we were -- I don't think that globalization in the whole is a bad idea.  I think that we misunderstood its benefits and misunderstood then the allocation of how those benefits would get allocated.</p><p>And therefore, then you have to rethink a little bit of the system.  And then that goes to taxes and goes to where people are domicile.  I mean there are lots of ways to get at this, to \"fix it\".  The scary part is I don't think there is a fix, a true fix that gets you back to this 1950, '60s American Dream Leave it to Beaver idea anytime soon.</p><p>ISAACSON:  But Trump then said tariffs and stricter trade deals will do it.  Do you think there's some truth to that?</p><p>SORKIN:  Look, I actually don't disagree that we have had an unfair trade practice with China, especially when it comes to IP and other things for a very long time and that there's some interest in trying to fix that.  The question, of course, is how do you fix it?  What's the approach more than just let's fix it?  And it doesn't matter how we do it.</p><p>So I think there are real issues that you would like to solve to some degree.  But the other piece of this is it's not that, you know, Nike or Apple is going to somehow leave China immediately and somehow bring all their manufacturing back to the United States.  You know, Brooks Sneakers is now looking to Vietnam.  They're going to go to -- still going to go to the lowest cost provider, it's just may not be China.</p><p>And so when -- and when you don't think about the world in a multilateral way, if you only think about it in a bilateral way, I think you miss the other pieces of the puzzle.  So it's not so clear to me that somehow we're going to bring all of these jobs back here.  And I do think that the transition cost and expense of this battle is real.</p><p>ISAACSON:  What's happening with Apple in China?  And do you think it's a symptom of something larger, either for Apple or for the tech industry globally?</p><p>SORKIN:  Well, I think Apple and Tim Cook made a bet, a real bet on China and a real bet on the relationship between the U.S. and China on a long-term basis when they really effectively built their entire supply chain in China.  And not only their supply chain there but an expectation that they were going to able to sell their product there.</p><p>They clearly have now come out publicly and said that they're missing their earnings estimates in part because of sales problems in China.  And Apple product is a very -- it's as American as apple pie.  I mean it's become an iconic American piece.</p><p>And it's unclear if you are Chinese today whether you -- whether that's a good thing.  In the same way, by the way, then the United States, I'm not so sure people would be running around buying Huawei phones here.  So there's sort of distinction.</p><p>So there's that as a real issue.  And then on top of that, Apple, I think has another conundrum which it faces which is just the great and top, you know so much about, which is innovation.  And what -- how do you innovate?  And how many great ideas does any one company or individual really have?</p><p>You know, we're now at a point where instead of upgrading your phone every two years, it's going to push to three.  Maybe it will ultimately push to four.  They've made a lot of money every time we upgrade.  What do you do about that?</p><p>Is there the next iPad or the next -- you know, what's the next thing is this car, you know, all these things?  And we haven't seen that sort of step change innovation out of that company.</p><p>ISAACSON:  What's the next --</p><p>SORKIN:  So I think it's a combination of all of those issues.</p><p>ISAACSON:  What's the next innovation you would want?</p><p>SORKIN:  I think all of us probably relate to health and biotech ultimately.  I think what they're doing with the watch, I have an Apple watch, I wear it, with EKG I think is interesting.  I actually think, by the way, that may actually turn out to be a big piece of all this.</p><p>But what do I want?  What I -- I want Siri to understand me.</p><p>ISAACSON:  Yes, voice recognition.  That would be an amazing thing if it really worked.</p><p>SORKIN:  What I can't figure out is why I can't say to a phone, \"Hey, get in touch with Walter.  We want to set up lunch\", and then it just figures it out it.  It has your calendars, my calendar, it should just be able to do that.</p><p>It seems to me preposterous that we are in this day and age and -- of great technology and [13:45:00] that still requires a lot of handiwork.</p><p>ISAACSON:  And I remember the old days covering voice recognition, 20, 30 years ago.  They said it's just around the corner, it doesn't fully work.  Let me ask you about the disparity in compensation of CEOs versus workers.  That seems to have grown and grown and grown.  Why is that and is that part of the problem our country is facing too?</p><p>SORKIN:  I think it's a problem in so far as it creates a schism in this country.  It creates a psychological schism among the haves and the have nots in this idea that there's this greater sense of inequality than ever before.  So that part is real.</p><p>You ask why?  Part of it is that I would argue, when you -- when most companies hire an employee, it is a market-based idea, right?  I'm going to hire you.  I'm thinking to myself, what is the least amount of money I can pay you to come to this job and be happy and stay here?  But I probably don't want to pay you much more than that if I could avoid it, right?</p><p>I'm not sure that that's actually the approach that boards take when they are hiring CEO or trying to keep a CEO.  It is based on a remarkable sort of netherworld of consultants and advisers and other people who keep comping or creating comparables of how much one person is being paid, and comparing them to the other person.  Well, this person is getting paid this and this other person, she gets paid this.</p><p>Should they?  I mean these are real questions.  And I hate to say it but I think there's an old boys' club.  Hopefully, some more girls and women will be a part of that club.  By the way, I think in terms of pay, there's still a remarkable pay disparity.</p><p>Because one of the other problems is, yes, when an employer tries to hire a person and they say I want to pay them basically as much as the market will bear but probably not much more.  If women start a lower rate than men, how are they supposed to bring those wages up?  How are they supposed to level things out?</p><p>ISAACSON:  You know our country seems to be being torn apart politically and in every other way.  Is -- and you almost fear that capitalism itself is in the crossfire--</p><p>SORKIN:  Oh, absolutely.</p><p>ISAACSON:  -- between left and far right.</p><p>SORKIN:  A hundred percent.</p><p>ISAACSON:  What can capitalism and capitalists do to totally reform that concept of capitalism to make sure it survives another hundred years?</p><p>SORKIN:  Well, look, I do think that the idea of capitalism is under fire.  But the issue to me is about what capitalism is.  And you know, it's -- just the word capitalism has become almost religious for certain people.</p><p>On both sides of this aisle, capitalism, I would argue has done wonderful things on a global basis and brought so many people out of poverty.  The numbers are staggering.</p><p>And yet if somebody in China or Africa has been a great beneficiary of capitalism, it is arguable also that there are certain people in developing countries who are not experiencing that in the same way.  And so they look at that and they go, \"That's not me.\"</p><p>I think that we have to redefine some of this a little bit.  It goes back to these profits.  It goes back to this idea of purpose.  It goes back to this idea of creating some kind of stability and less anxiety.</p><p>But I think that's about politics.  I think it's about -- I think business has a role to play but I think it really requires leadership across the board to get any of these things to happen.</p><p>ISAACSON:  Does Elizabeth Warren or Casio-Cortez, are they on to something?</p><p>SORKIN:  It's a great question.  You know, I think that they -- there are ideas within what AOC is saying these days and ideas within what Elizabeth Warren is saying that do make some sense.  I think that for others, they're so extreme that they're not going to be taken seriously.</p><p>Look, anti-trust law in the United States has effectively been diminished over the last 30 or 40 years.  There's less competition.  You look at the biggest companies in this country and they're bigger than they've ever been.</p><p>Talk about too big to fail.  Too big to manage, by the way, is a whole other issue.  So I think there are real things that you could do to solve some of this.  But I don't think anyone of them individually -- you know, I think a tax rate -- a marginal tax rate at 70 or 80 percent for the very wealthy I think is a hard one to get past.  So I think -- but I think there's a -- I think there's lots of different levers and it would have to be holistic, holistic is tough.</p><p>ISAACSON:  And you talk about anti-trust.  With this big tech backlash, should we have let Facebook buy Instagram, take over WhatsApp and grow?  And is there an argument that Facebook, Google, Amazon have now spread [13:50:00] into so many different industries that they're suppressing competition and there's got to be more anti-trust enforcement?</p><p>SORKIN:  So here's the great conundrum.  The great conundrum is that in this day and age of technology, scale matters.  By the way, you can toast Microsoft early on.  Scale matters.  You want integrated products.  As a consumer, you enjoy products that all work together.  I think that actually matters.</p><p>And then in the age of AI and machine learning, data is the new oil, right?  So the people who are going to have the most success with AI and innovation on that front need lots of data running through to be able to test out their systems.</p><p>So there's an argument that you want three or four major players in the sort of Pepsi-Coke like battle.  But there's also an argument to be made that the kid in their garage who built some of the last great innovations in technologies doesn't stand a chance anymore.  Because they won't have the same type of access to that pipeline of data, that oil, anymore.</p><p>And so I'm very nixed about sort of where that lands and what kinds of controls you want to put on these companies.  You know, if you said to me, how do you break up Google tomorrow?  It's not like you can just, you know, write it down in a piece of paper and say this goes over here and this goes over here and this goes over here in this goes over here.</p><p>So it's -- unlike Apple -- I'm sorry unlike AT&amp;T with the Baby Bells, you -- they were -- it was very breakupable.  It was very --</p><p>ISAACSON:  Well, the cloud (CROSSTALK) was Microsoft.</p><p>SORKIN:  Right.</p><p>ISAACSON:  You just mentioned Microsoft.  But you also said it's really good when people bundles a project --</p><p>SORKIN:  It is.</p><p>ISAACSON:  -- products because they work together better.  But what happened in the Microsoft case over the years, was they were barred from bundling the browser into the operating system, barred from bundling search into the operation.  And thus, Google gets to be born in the garage.</p><p>SORKIN:  Born, yes.</p><p>ISAACSON:  Are we losing that now?</p><p>SORKIN:  I think there's probably an element that we are losing that now.  And look, the question -- but again, the question is how do you do it.  I mean that's the -- that's where I come down is how do you do it?</p><p>Is Amazon too big?  Amazon on an actual per business is very small.  Whole Foods, everyone was worried about Whole Foods.  Whole Foods is very small, small relative to other supermarkets.  Books, they have huge, huge -- I mean that's where they probably have the monopoly.</p><p>But everything else is actually tiny.  But the collective, does that change it?  And so these are the issues I think we're all grappling with.</p><p>ISAACSON:  But one of the ways to address it is the notion that if you have dominance, you can't use that to leverage --</p><p>SORKIN:  Exactly.</p><p>ISAACSON:  -- into another feel.</p><p>SORKIN:  Right.</p><p>ISAACSON:  And that's what's been happening with say Facebook.</p><p>SORKIN:  A hundred percent.  But the question is, are you leveraging just the fact that you've made all of this money and therefore you have a lot of money to go buy other things?  Or you're actually leveraging -- for example, one of the things I worry about with Amazon is Amazon has so much information about the shopper, that they are now starting to create their own products to compete with the products that are on their own platform.</p><p>You know, by the way, Walmart and Costco have done that forever.  They've had white label.  Approximate, this feels like it may be at a different level.  I don't know.  But these are the issues that I think we need to focus on and talk about and debate.  And one of the things I worry about is that there's not enough conversation about it.</p><p>ISAACSON:  Are we due for another financial crisis and are we ready for it?</p><p>SORKIN:  So Jamie Diamond was called in 2000, in the middle of financial crisis, by his daughter I believe then was in high school and said, \"Daddy, what's a financial crisis?\"  And he said back to her, \"Something that happens every seven or eight years.\"</p><p>ISAACSON:  I'm looking at my watch.</p><p>SORKIN:  Yes, look at your watch.  If he's right, we're way overdue.  Do I think we will have another crisis of some sort?  Absolutely.  Will it look like what happened in 2008?  In my mind, absolutely not.</p><p>It could be better but, by the way, it also could be worse.  The one thing that I feel like was the lesson for me in the financial crisis and in writing Too Big to Fail is that every financial crisis is really a function with one thing.  It's debt.  It's leverage in the system.</p><p>You can have all the bad actors you want doing all the bad things you could imagine, whether it's credit rating agencies being conflicted or bankers being greedy regulators not minding the store or you name it.  But in the west, there's leverage in the system.  It doesn't matter.</p><p>And so you say to yourself, OK, where's the leverage now?  Well, there's corporate leverage.  That's real.  I don't think we have it in the banking system so much.  But where is the real debt?  Where's the real leverage?</p><p>When I wrote Too Big to Fail, we used to use that phrase in the context of banks.  Today, we use it in the context of countries.  And when you talk about the relationships between countries, the fact that China, for example, owns so much of our debt, [13:55:00] that's where all of this gets really interesting.  Interesting in a bad way, I hate to say.</p><p>ISAACSON:  And so what should we do?</p><p>SORKIN:  To me, the long-term thing that we need to fix way beyond the corporate system, but the corporate system is obviously a huge piece of it because it pays the taxes and creates real revenue for the country, is we need to somehow fix the larger debt problem in the United States at a country level.  But that's a hard one.</p><p>ISAACSON:  Andrew, thank you for being with us.</p><p>SORKIN:  Thank you, Walter.  Appreciate it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And on that note, that is it for now.

Democratic Senator Bob Menendez joins me, as well as a key ally of the new leader, Juan Guaido.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, Nancy Pelosi one, President Donald Trump zero, how the speaker of the House outplayed the president in this round. Former Republican Congresswoman, Mia Love, and one-time Vice President of the Trump Organization, Barbara Res join me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, financial guru, Andrew Ross Sorkin, tells us we're overdue for a financial crisis.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>Venezuela is firing back after the United States imposed tough sanctions, $18 billion worth on the state oil company. Making the announcement, National Security Advisor John Bolton spark talk of an even bigger threat because this yellow notepad there have the words 5,000 troops to Colombia scrolled and exposed for all to see.</p><p>In an address, President Maduro lashed out at President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): I make Donald Trump responsible for any violence that might happen in Venezuela. You will be the one responsible, Mr. President Donald Trump. Responsible for this policy of regime change in Venezuela and the blood that could flow in Venezuela will be the blood that will be on your hands.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, backs Maduro. He calls the U.S. sanctions illegal. While the U.S.-backed interim president, Juan Guaido, praised them for protecting Venezuelan assets. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, SELF-DECLARED INTERIM VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator): For a very long time, Marudor's regime stole this money, an estimated $4 billion which is four times Venezuela's GDP and losses. This would protect assets so that they can be used towards Venezuelans and to attend to the humanitarian emergency that is at the center of our policies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: There is a massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela right now. So, the United Nations says more than 40 Venezuelans have been killed in the recent unrest and 850 have been arrested.</p><p>But what happens if there is a violent crackdown. Joining me now is Senator Bob Menendez, his the Democratic senator from New Jersey, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p><p>Senator Menendez, welcome to the program.</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D-NJ: Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's start first with this -- the sanctions. You heard what President Maduro said and it is par for the course. The Venezuelans from Chavez and even beyond have always used as they're calling card the threat that the United States is engineering, a coup and they're constantly blaming the U.S. What do you make of the effect of these sanctions? What will they do?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, I think the sanctions, which I support, I wrote the first sanctions against the Maduro regime back in 2014, and we've seen a growing bipartisan support for using diplomatic and economic and political efforts to try to bring democracy back to Venezuela. I think the world largely recognizes that Maduro is not a legitimate president.</p><p>And so, the sanctions, at the end of the day, create a real challenge to the Maduro regime, particularly the ones that were just announced against PDVSA, the state oil company. So, I think they are very significant.</p><p>And listen, as it relates to Maduro's comments about the -- I heard the clip that you ran about the blood is going to be on the hands of the United States, the blood that has already been shed by Venezuelans peacefully trying to create change in their country has all been at Maduro's hands and those of his leadership. So, I think that's a hollow statement to make.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's switch now to this talk. I mean, I asked, leading into you, what happens if, what happens if the army turns against the people. What do you know now? What sort of intelligence do you have? Do you have any confidence of where the army stands?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, I think it's very telling that Maduro has not had his army and security forces arrest Juan Guaido, the interim president of Venezuela, under their constitution, which by the way, is a constitution created under former Venezuelan President Chavez. So, it's their own constitution that they've invoked to claim the right to be an interim president as a result of false elections.</p><p>So, I think the fact that he has not called upon security forces to arrest Guaido, which he has done to others in the past is very telling, he doesn't want to risk it. And the reality is, the generals may be living very well because they're part of the kleptomatic government that Maduro. But -- and the corrupt government that he runs.</p><p>But the average soldier, they're suffering like the Venezuelan people are. And I think in that respect, I think it is highly unlikely they will turn their guns against their brothers and sisters.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, let's just play a quick clip, one of our reporters talked to a couple of those lower rank soldiers who were defected to neighboring Colombia. Here's what here's what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLOS GUILLEN MARTINEZ, VENEZUELA ARMY DEFECTOR (through translator): As Venezuelan soldiers, we're making a request to the U.S., he says, to support us, in logistical terms with communication, with weapons so we can realize Venezuelan freedom.</p><p>JOSUE HIDALGO AZUAJE, VENEZUELA ARMY DEFECTOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): We're not saying we need only U.S. support but also from Brazil, Colombia, Peru, all brother countries that are against this dictatorship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They show me the WhatsApp groups plotting rebellion they hope to reach thousands of soldiers but they also rejected any possible military intervention by U.S. forces themselves.</p><p>AZUAJE: We don't want a foreign government invading our country, he says. If we need an incursion, it has to be Venezuelan soldiers who really want to free Venezuela. Now, we're unifying military groups working towards freedom to create a really big one that can be decisive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Senator, I know you speak fluent Spanish, obviously, you could hear them in their own language and you could hear the translation, they were very, very clear, no U.S. intervention but yes, please, U.S. military support and help and logistics.</p><p>Do you think that there -- well, where do you stand on this? Because as I said, also, you know, John Bolton, National Security Adviser, sparked a whole load of questions with that yellow notepad and 5,000 troops to Colombia. What do you know about what's going on in that regard?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, I don't know anything specifically in that regard as it relates to any potential military movement. It would be a huge mistake and I oppose military -- any form of military intervention in Venezuela. It would undermine the very effort of the democratic movement in Venezuela and the credibility of that democratic movement. The freedom of Venezuela will come through the hands of Venezuelans not to the intervention of the United States or any other nation.</p><p>But I think it's critically important that the 20 or so countries, including many from the Western Hemisphere who have traditionally shied away from speaking about human rights and democracy, violations in their neighboring country, have risen their voice in this regard, and I think that's a powerful message. And joined not only by their words but hopefully for their actions in terms of economic consequences, I think the Venezuelan people can restore democracy in their nation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's just stay on this military intervention for a moment. You know, President Trump himself, at the very beginning of his administration, raise sort of questions with various tweets about this. And in response to questions about the famous Bolton notepads, again, the administration said all options are on the table. Are you concerned that there is some move afoot amongst, let's say, people in the White House to potentially introduce U.S. military force to Venezuela?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, you know, it's interesting because that would be counter to everything else the president's inclinations are. You know, drawing troops from Syria at a time that that's a challenge, supposedly he is paired to announce withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to some degree. So, his predilection seems to be to move American involvement abroad away and back at home, this would be totally counter to that.</p><p>Now, whether it is a bluff, although I don't think you have a bluff with our military, or whether it is just to keep all the options open to suggest that all the options are open. But in reality, I cannot envision the United States and I strongly would oppose the United States seeking to intervene militarily in Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But you could imagine U.S. troops going to friendly countries like Colombia, next door, to support, could you? I mean, could that be what's afoot potentially?</p><p>MENENDEZ: I don't think that the Colombians or any of Venezuela's neighbors will want to seek its military engagement in Venezuela. They have been doing a tremendous service in dealing with the humanitarian crisis and the flows of Venezuelans fleeing Venezuela. I think that as we ratchet up the sanctions, you know, sales to the United States from Venezuela about $28 million a day, those monies should be used to actually help the humanitarian relief that is necessary to help the Venezuelan people as they seek to restore democracy in their country.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Why is it then -- you brought it up, that President Trump to, you know, tailback or rather scale back military interventions overseas. What do you think it's -- it is why he has decided to get so active in this regard, I know it's in the hemisphere, but immediately recognizing, as we know, almost sort of planning, you know, with Juan Guaido and with who is president of the National Assembly and immediately sort of recognizing and getting other countries to do so as well? Why is that in in President Trump's interest?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, obviously, I'm sure that he has heard the voices of many, including many Venezuelan Americans who reside, for example, in Florida and who have experienced firsthand the flight and the necessity to become refugees in the United States about what's happening under Chavez. I think that there is a hemispheric recognition that Chavez is driving one of the nations in the Western Hemisphere that should have among the greatest wealth into a humanitarian catastrophe. And I think as someone who worries about refugee flows, as we have seen, I think the last thing he wants to see is another set of refugee flows this time from Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I know you meant Chavez's successor Maduro. But let me let me ask you this, the United States, of course, ever since the late 1800 with the invasion of Mexico, it has a record, you know, 10 arms long of intervention in Latin America. And, of course, all the people who oppose this recognition in Venezuela keep pointing to that.</p><p>And what do you say to people like Russia or the others or people in the hemisphere itself who say, you know, \"What business do the United States have getting involved in here. Look at their record on our continent\"?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, first of all, I never rely on the Russians to talk about our national interest or observance of international law or human rights and democracy. Their record is dismal, they keep violating international law. So, they're certainly not the -- my litmus test.</p><p>As it relates to other countries in the hemisphere, I would say that the Democratic Charter of the OAS, which all countries of the hemisphere have signed onto should be the guiding principle. And it is that Democratic Charter of the OAS that we are largely following in terms of the actions that we are taking.</p><p>And so, what I do rejoice into someone who has spent a lot of time in Western Hemisphere foreign policy is that we now see a series of nations, Western Hemisphere nations, Latin American nations, leading as well in calling for Maduro to step down and recognizing Juan Guaido as the actual provisional president of Venezuela.</p><p>That's something that we would not have seen many years ago. It's a turn for the better in terms of promotion of democracy and human rights of the hemisphere.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, you mention all the oil and how much the Venezuelan sell to the United States. With these sanctions, do you think they will keep selling and do you also believe, is it the generals or aid general who is in charge of the state oil company?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, certainly, I believe that they will need an outlet, you know, refineries in the United States are doing a lot of this work. So, I think that they will continue to sale and they will have a need to do so. They will need time to try to divert their sales and to find other markets and refineries to be able to do that. So, that that cannot be turned on a dime.</p><p>Now, one of the reasons that the general should start rethinking the reality is because their pathway to the type of money they have received through Maduro is less likely to be realized now, and I think that may affect their thinking as well.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, just to go back to the oil question and John Bolton, he was on \"Fox Business\" recently and he basically specifically cited the oil and the economic benefit that it could bring to the United States. He basically said, \"It'll make a big difference to the U.S. economically if we could have American oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in Venezuela. Also, it would be good for the people of Venezuela.\"</p><p>So, he said it would be a win-win situation. So, that might be. But do you -- have you heard from the administration whether there is a plan B if things don't turn out the way you hope, if I do holds onto power, if he appoints somebody else who's equally unpalatable or in the worst-case scenario, if there is a violent crackdown? What is the plan B as far as you know?</p><p>MENENDEZ: Well, I'm not sure what is the plan B. On the economic side, I believe the administration believes that both the production in the United States of oil and global oil supplies would not be affected by the situation in Venezuela.</p><p>As it relates to if Maduro steps down and appoints someone who is not only unpalatable but illegal, you know, at the end of the day, if you follow the constitution, the Venezuelan constitution, the only democratically elected person at this point in Venezuela is Juan Guaido as the president the National Assembly and those members of the National Assembly. And so, outside of that, they would be violating their own constitution.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. Senator Bob Menendez, thank you so much for joining us from Capitol Hill.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>And, of course, full disclosure, Senator Menendez's daughter, Alicia Menendez, is a contributer to this program.</p><p>Now, we get the Venezuelan side of the story. And I am joined by Francisco Sucre. He is a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly and a supporter of the Assembly president, Juan Guaido. In fact, tomorrow, Mr. Sucre is off to Brussels to get the E.U. to formally recognized Guaido as interim Venezuelan president.</p><p>Francisco Sucre, welcome from Madrid.</p><p>You heard --</p><p>FRANCISCO SUCRE, MEMBER, VENEZUELAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY: Thank you. Thank you for this interview, the possibility.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. No, it's OK. I interrupted you. But you heard Senator Bob Menendez, a very powerful member of the United States Senate, fully backing your president, certainly, the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido.</p><p>We were talking about, you know, you trying to get more recognition for him. What are you going to be doing in Brussels tomorrow?</p><p>SUCRE: Yes. At this point, already more than 25 countries has recognized Mr. Guaido as the president of Venezuela, the interim president. We hope that the European Union who is going to do the same. Already, Germany, Spain, France, many countries of the European Union has said that Juan Guaido is the president.</p><p>We have to remember the reading of this crisis. (INAUDIBLE) the election that we have last year, the presidential election, we had a fraudulent presidential election. And out of that, Mr. Maduro wants to be in power for six more years.</p><p>When we had this legal election, the European Union, all the Latin American countries, the U.S., Canada, all the -- all of the democratic world said that that election was a fraudulent election. So, at this point, we are conducting a very fierce struggle for recovering democracy, the constitutional law, the constitutional rule in Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let me just ask you this then, because the constitutional point that you're following by taking this move says that now, the interim president, Juan Guaido, has to call new elections within 30 days of making that move. Is that even possible? Will you be able to actually abide by that part of the constitutional provision?</p><p>SUCRE: No, no. That seat, at this point, is not possible in Venezuela. They Article 333 of National Constitution of Venezuela clearly says that we have to -- every citizen of Venezuela with authority or not has the responsibility of, you know, work to restore the constitutional rule.</p><p>At this point, we don't have institutions in Venezuela that can go ahead without election. First, we have to choose a new electoral council. The one that we have right now is some electoral council that is full of political members of Maduro's party.</p><p>So, we have first to call elections, to have a very independent -- as the constitution says, independent body that can conduct those elections. So, we have to bring back that constitutional rule in order to apply the Article 233 that says that in 30 days we have to convene elections. But at this point, we can't do that because we don't have institutions to do that. So, that's why from the National Assembly we have a clear road for the next on days.</p><p>First, we have to aim to bring an end to the false (ph) operation of Mr. Maduro. Second, we have to have transitional government. The transitional government is that one that is going to conduct those elections once we have a new independent power in Venezuela. And then, we have to convey those three elections. Three elections like --</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>SUCRE: -- Mexico have in the past, Brazil, et cetera.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. So, let me ask you this then, a lot of this is going to depend on, I assume, cooperation from Maduro and the government. Right now you have one country two presidents, and he's claiming that he's still president and that it will be on your head and on the U.S.'s head if there is any violence or any trouble in the country.</p><p>What is the state of discussion between Juan Guaido and President Maduro or between Juan Guaido and the leader of the Venezuela Armed Forces?</p><p>SUCRE: So, first, in Venezuela, we don't have two presidents. We have one president and Maduro who is claiming to be a president.</p><p>And regarding the armed forces, at this point, Christiane, Maduro only has that support, that's the only support that Maduro has at this point. We approve of the National Assembly a law, a new law, last week for -- to convey all the civilians and the military officers to turn away from the dictatorship and hand -- give their hands to the democracy and the respect of the human rights.</p><p>So, that law is to guarantee immunity and to apply guaranties for those military officers that work with us in order to restore democracy. At this point, Mr. Maduro has all the responsibility of what's going on in Venezuela.</p><p>I heard what Maduro last day (INAUDIBLE), I think, blaming the U.S. for any violent thing that can happen Venezuela. But the only responsibility of the violence in Venezuela is going to be from Maduro.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. So, Senator Menendez said that he found it interesting and very indicative that Maduro has not ordered the arrest of Juan Guaido, as you know better than I do, many opposition leaders have been arrested, but Juan Guaido remains free. There are -- he is calling Guaido for more street protests tomorrow.</p><p>Again, are you concerned that the head of the armed forces who say they will die to protect their country, are you concerned that there might be a military crackdown?</p><p>SUCRE: But they are minority. You know, the high-ranking officials, of course, they are supporting Maduro at this point because they are, you know, involved in this crime economy that we have in Venezuela. But the -- maybe on the lower ranks of the armed force are with at the democracy. And we are sure that in the next weeks, days, there is going to be a breakdown in the channel of -- inside the --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Chain of command?</p><p>SUCRE: -- military of Venezuela. They are going to have to choose, they have to choose between the constitution, democracy, the wellbeing of the Venezuelan people. As you know, half of the world knows, we are facing the worst humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, more than 3.5 million Venezuelans have left the country, you know, because of the economic devastation that we have in Venezuela. Our economy is in rings right now.</p><p>So, in order to have --</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>SUCRE: -- (INAUDIBLE) in the hemisphere, we have to restore democracy in Venezuela. That's why all the countries, Latin American countries, the U.S., Canada, all the countries are working with us in order to restore democray in Venezuela.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. Mr. Sucre, the noise behind you is very, very loud. There's a taxi driver protest in Madrid but we're listening to very, very close.</p><p>SUCRE: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But I want to answer me very, very quickly. If Maduro stays, what is your plan B if he does not give up power and do you favor a U.S. military intervention?</p><p>SUCRE: Listen, our plan B is keep fighting. Keep fighting because we have a responsibility with Venezuelans, we as citizens of this country have this responsibility and we are going to keep fighting.</p><p>And regarding the military intervention, you know, you said in the interview that the U.S. already said all options are under the table. When you were talking about national security for every country, even my country, Venezuela, of course, all options always are under the table.</p><p>But if that happens, if this extreme situation happens, the only one responsible for that will be Mr. Maduro.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I see you're keeping all options on the table too. Francisco Sucre, thank you very much indeed for joining us.</p><p>Now, amid the Venezuela showdown, at home, the showdown between the president and Congress ended in the government reopening without any money for President Trump's border wall. A move many have hailed as a success for the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi early in her new leadership.</p><p>Now, she held the president's State of the Union address as her trump card, so to speak. It was supposed to be delivered tonight. Instead, Pelosi has now invited him to address the nation next Tuesday.</p><p>To break down this tussle at the top in Washington, I'm joined by the former vice president of the Trump Organization, Barbara Res, and the former Republican congresswoman, Mia Love.</p><p>Welcome to both of you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>I think everybody took a look at what was going on in Washington. Unbelievable that it took more than 35 days for this to be resolved and that it was, in the words of some observers, a 5-foot-2 liberal congresswoman from California who simply outplayed the president of the United States.</p><p>Barbara Res, what did you think when you saw this power game happening and unfolding in Washington? You know President Trump very, very well.</p><p>BARBARA RES, FORMER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: I thought probably was very angry at what happened. But I felt that he totally underestimated Pelosi and he totally did not know how the how the system works. He did not know -- I don't think he's even convinced as of yet that the power of the Congress is equal to the power of the president.</p><p>And because of that, I think he thought he could ride over Pelosi and the Congress and I thought -- I think he thought he could ride over her because she was a woman. So, he made those two mistakes and they came back to haunt him.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Before I ask Congressman Mia Love, you know, you say because she was woman. But I mean, I'm talking to you, you were promoted to the top, top ranks of this organization, you became vice president of the organization. He has been quoted as saying and you quote him as saying that, \"One good woman is better than 10 men.\" You know, what happened in the interim? How do we underestimate this strong woman?</p><p>RES: Well, because he basically believes that one good -- many good women are as good as men but overall, men are better than women, and that was a promise of it, men are better than women but one good woman is better than 10 good men.</p><p>And in his mind, he is superior to all women and -- well, he superior to everyone but that sense, the fact that he promoted me and gave me a job and everything, I always knew my place when it came to him. I fought with him and, you know, spoke back to him and everything, which is not what they do now. But certainly, he always thought I'm smarter than Barbara (ph).</p><p>And I think that he did have a lot of strong women and prefer to have strong women because he did not feel there was a competition, that it was basically known that he was superior to them by nature of his gender. And so, where he had more weak people on the male side, his women were very strong and feisty and they stood up to everyone but not him.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's really fascinating. Congresswoman Mia Love, I know that Nancy Pelosi is not a member of your party, she's not a house speaker. But how did you -- you know, how did you take this sort of showdown?</p><p>MIA LOVE, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Well, I can tell you that both sides actually gained some pretty big mistakes. And I can tell you the president, from the very beginning, when it comes to the campaign trail, saying that he was going to build a wall and Mexico was going to pay for it, I mean, that was certainly not the approach that he should have taken. He should have just gone in and talked about the importance of border security and started making his case for border security from that point on.</p><p>You can see there are a lot of even Democrats that are supportive of border security, determining of what kind, how that's done is completely different. The other mistake that he made was to sit down with Chuck Schumer and say, \"Well, I will own this shutdown if you do not give me border security.\" All of a sudden, myself and all of my other colleagues were like, \"Whoa, wait a minute, what's going on here? Nobody wants to own a shutdown.\" So that was the other mistake he made.</p><p>The last mistake that he made was to betray a lot of the GOP members that stood strong and talked about the importance of border security, didn't vote for a bill that didn't have anything that included the border wall or border security, and he still opened up government and allowed that to go without any concessions. And he also, I would say, betrayed the 800,000 people that went without a paycheck for absolutely nothing.</p><p>Now, Nancy Pelosi, on the other hand, Speaker Pelosi has a couple of things that she has to look out for also. She has to make sure that she keeps the promises she made. She told the American people, \"Open up government first and then I will negotiate border security.\" So that is something that she has to look at.</p><p>The other thing -- the other mistake I think that she made which is a grave mistake is not getting immigration reform out of this. Now, people are looking to her in terms of TPS, temporary protected status, people who are working who have families here.</p><p>They're actually due to leave the country. The president is saying you've got to go. So there are people that are waiting for her to help them. They -- I mean they're here, they're helping, they're contributing, and there are people that are waiting for a pathway to citizenship.</p><p>There are people that are on -- that are DACA recipients, that life is unpredictable for them. So she has got some work to do. She is the speaker of the House and you cannot just be a speaker of the House and completely resist and do nothing. You've got to be able to show that you can get something done.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right.</p><p>LOVE: I think that there are some issues there that she's going to have to come to grips with.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. I'm going to come back to you on that in a moment. I want to ask Barbara, though, again, from knowing him and all of the stuff you just told us. You know, the president calls himself the dealmaker of the century. This is one of the things that people looked at when they elected him and people have looked at throughout the world in the two years of his presidency.</p><p>Can he make a deal with China? Can he make a better deal with Iran? Can he make a deal with North Korea?</p><p>I mean it's not that hopeful if he cannot make a deal with the speaker of the House and -- well, some people have said folds or caves with, as Mia Love said, you know, not a penny or not a commitment for what he wanted most. What happened to the dealmaker?</p><p>RES: Well, I think that he can -- first of all, I don't think he admits that he caved. And I think that he is trying to promote this idea that he is the person who came to the -- you know, rose to the occasion and got the shutdown finished. And, you know, that he understands that there will be a de-own, he will make it.</p><p>And he is rattling the sword very mightily right now talking about shutting down again which he's not going to do and everyone knows he's not. And then he's talking about doing the emergency declaration and taking funds away from the military.</p><p>So he is keeping that persona going which I think is forced on his part. But he's not really quite willing to admit that he is not the negotiator. Well, he'll never admit it.</p><p>And to be honest with you, there's no history of that. There's no documentation that says Donald Trump is a great dealmaker. He's made good deals. He's made bad deals. He's caved more often than I can tell you.</p><p>And Tony Schwartz created the name Art of the Deal and made that -- created that persona that Trump ran with. But it's not really true. He's not a great dealmaker. He's a good dealmaker as other -- many other people are.</p><p>Pelosi is a better dealmaker. And by the way, I'm not worried about her committing to reforming the immigration. I think that that has been on the table even with Trump's latest offer. She can fold that in. So Pelosi knows what she's doing and Trump doesn't in this stage.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's really fascinating. Mia Love, I just want to ask you because, you know, you walked away. I mean again, you're Republican but you walked away from the president over the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. And he then said this about you when you lost in these midterms. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mia Love gave me no love and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: What did you learn from your president through that comment?</p><p>LOVE: Well, like I said, it's-- to me, I didn't know why he said it. But the only thing I can think of is the fact that, you know, these things are transactional.</p><p>To me, we were doing our job. I had a prisoner that was from my state, in my district, that was stuck in Venezuela. And you can see [13:35:00] all of the issues that are happening. If he were in Venezuela right now, I don't think that he would be alive.</p><p>So, you know, I felt like the president was, in that form, was saying that he was doing it and he was expecting something in return. I said thank you. I did whatever I could.</p><p>But on the main aspect of this, I just want to say that I don't follow a person with a letter behind their name. I follow a set of principles. I follow a platform.</p><p>And I think that one of the things that we are -- we need to do, if the Republican Party is going to continue to survive, we need to make sure that we're holding everyone accountable to that, including the president. And I can also say that I've been a Republican a lot longer than the president has.</p><p>So I just want him to know that that's not my job, is not to just walk into lockstep. The American people deserve Washington that works for them, not Washington that works for the White House. And if we can return back to those principles and get back to the government for people, then I think that this country will see some major differences in this country.</p><p>And one more thing I want to say is we've consolidated way too much power in the White House. And this is why we're dealing with all of this. They should not be negotiating with the president.</p><p>People should get together in the House and in the Senate. The leader should get together, draft their own deal, and then let the president either sign it or veto it. If he wants something different, people shouldn't be holding votes back in the Senate or in the House waiting for the president -- waiting for the president's OK to sign it. They should just send it to him and stop giving him so much power because that's not the way the government was set up.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know I do want to just play this snippet that many people have seen. But it's about the issues and that is when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were in the White House around this shutdown. But particularly in light of what you're saying, about the need for a bipartisan compromise, particularly on immigration, let's just play this soundbite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: I think the American people recognize that we must keep the government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown. You have a --</p><p>TRUMP: Did you say \"Trump\"?</p><p>PELOSI: You have the White House.</p><p>TRUMP: I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now and I understand that and I fully understand that. We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.</p><p>PELOSI: Mr. President --</p><p>TRUMP: But we have to have border security.</p><p>PELOSI: Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So I mean she's laying her cards on the table there. She's saying \"Look, I just won. Don't characterize me as being in hoc to anything else.\" But Barbara, I mean you follow all this as well. Do you think that it is going to be possible to come to some kind of resolution on what everybody wants? And that is a proper immigration reform bill. Do you think that this might lead to that with the strength of the House right now, United House as you saw Nancy Pelosi commanded and with the necessity, I guess for the Republicans to see that the president didn't win in this round?</p><p>RES: I do think that there is a potential resolution out there. And I totally agree that the negotiation on these bills should be between the two Houses with the president making his desires known, which is always what is -- what happens and that's proper.</p><p>But I think that Nancy Pelosi is not going to give him money for a wall. So he's going to have to decide and, you know, influence his people that he will not accept anything and sign in a bill into law that does not include a wall.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>RES: And I don't think that that will work. I think at the end of the day, he should backtrack, say, \"All I ever wanted was border security, that's what they're giving me. Maybe imply that there could be wall money in there or that the wall could come in, and make a graceful exit.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>RES: That's what I hope will happen.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I have to give one word to Mia Love, just one. Do you think that, you know, there can be, after all of this, some kind of bipartisan immigration reform put back on his desk?</p><p>LOVE: I hope so. I really do. I think there can be. I think that he could actually get the $5.7. We've already lost $3 billion just in the shutdown. There is half the wall there.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right.</p><p>LOVE: So I think that there is something that should. You know, we can come out of this. But out of that, like I said, there are some great things. I'm a daughter of parents who immigrated to this country. Great - - immigration reform is long out due.</p><p>I think that there is something that both of them can get out of this. And mainly, the American people will win.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And on that note --</p><p>LOVE: But if they continue to do that, then no one will win.</p><p>[13:40:00] AMANPOUR: Yes, the American people to win, that would be a good thing.</p><p>Mia Love, Barbara Res, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>And now we turn from Washington to Wall Street continuing our conversation with the bestselling author and \"New York Times\" financial columnist, Andrew Ross Sorkin.</p><p>In part one of his discussion with our Walter Isaacson, among other things, Sorkin talked about how mass shootings could be prevented by monitoring credit cards. Now, he's looking at the state of the financial food chain beginning with the backlash against globalization.</p><p>WALTER ISAACSON, CONTRIBUTOR: Were we wrong to think that free trade would benefit everybody?</p><p>ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK TIMES: I think we were -- I don't think that globalization in the whole is a bad idea. I think that we misunderstood its benefits and misunderstood then the allocation of how those benefits would get allocated.</p><p>And therefore, then you have to rethink a little bit of the system. And then that goes to taxes and goes to where people are domicile. I mean there are lots of ways to get at this, to \"fix it\". The scary part is I don't think there is a fix, a true fix that gets you back to this 1950, '60s American Dream Leave it to Beaver idea anytime soon.</p><p>ISAACSON: But Trump then said tariffs and stricter trade deals will do it. Do you think there's some truth to that?</p><p>SORKIN: Look, I actually don't disagree that we have had an unfair trade practice with China, especially when it comes to IP and other things for a very long time and that there's some interest in trying to fix that. The question, of course, is how do you fix it? What's the approach more than just let's fix it? And it doesn't matter how we do it.</p><p>So I think there are real issues that you would like to solve to some degree. But the other piece of this is it's not that, you know, Nike or Apple is going to somehow leave China immediately and somehow bring all their manufacturing back to the United States. You know, Brooks Sneakers is now looking to Vietnam. They're going to go to -- still going to go to the lowest cost provider, it's just may not be China.</p><p>And so when -- and when you don't think about the world in a multilateral way, if you only think about it in a bilateral way, I think you miss the other pieces of the puzzle. So it's not so clear to me that somehow we're going to bring all of these jobs back here. And I do think that the transition cost and expense of this battle is real.</p><p>ISAACSON: What's happening with Apple in China? And do you think it's a symptom of something larger, either for Apple or for the tech industry globally?</p><p>SORKIN: Well, I think Apple and Tim Cook made a bet, a real bet on China and a real bet on the relationship between the U.S. and China on a long- term basis when they really effectively built their entire supply chain in China. And not only their supply chain there but an expectation that they were going to able to sell their product there.</p><p>They clearly have now come out publicly and said that they're missing their earnings estimates in part because of sales problems in China. And Apple product is a very -- it's as American as apple pie. I mean it's become an iconic American piece.</p><p>And it's unclear if you are Chinese today whether you -- whether that's a good thing. In the same way, by the way, then the United States, I'm not so sure people would be running around buying Huawei phones here. So there's sort of distinction.</p><p>So there's that as a real issue. And then on top of that, Apple, I think has another conundrum which it faces which is just the great and top, you know so much about, which is innovation. And what -- how do you innovate? And how many great ideas does any one company or individual really have?</p><p>You know, we're now at a point where instead of upgrading your phone every two years, it's going to push to three. Maybe it will ultimately push to four. They've made a lot of money every time we upgrade. What do you do about that?</p><p>Is there the next iPad or the next -- you know, what's the next thing is this car, you know, all these things? And we haven't seen that sort of step change innovation out of that company.</p><p>ISAACSON: What's the next --</p><p>SORKIN: So I think it's a combination of all of those issues.</p><p>ISAACSON: What's the next innovation you would want?</p><p>SORKIN: I think all of us probably relate to health and biotech ultimately. I think what they're doing with the watch, I have an Apple watch, I wear it, with EKG I think is interesting. I actually think, by the way, that may actually turn out to be a big piece of all this.</p><p>But what do I want? What I -- I want Siri to understand me.</p><p>ISAACSON: Yes, voice recognition. That would be an amazing thing if it really worked.</p><p>SORKIN: What I can't figure out is why I can't say to a phone, \"Hey, get in touch with Walter. We want to set up lunch\", and then it just figures it out it. It has your calendars, my calendar, it should just be able to do that.</p><p>It seems to me preposterous that we are in this day and age and -- of great technology and [13:45:00] that still requires a lot of handiwork.</p><p>ISAACSON: And I remember the old days covering voice recognition, 20, 30 years ago. They said it's just around the corner, it doesn't fully work. Let me ask you about the disparity in compensation of CEOs versus workers. That seems to have grown and grown and grown. Why is that and is that part of the problem our country is facing too?</p><p>SORKIN: I think it's a problem in so far as it creates a schism in this country. It creates a psychological schism among the haves and the have nots in this idea that there's this greater sense of inequality than ever before. So that part is real.</p><p>You ask why? Part of it is that I would argue, when you -- when most companies hire an employee, it is a market-based idea, right? I'm going to hire you. I'm thinking to myself, what is the least amount of money I can pay you to come to this job and be happy and stay here? But I probably don't want to pay you much more than that if I could avoid it, right?</p><p>I'm not sure that that's actually the approach that boards take when they are hiring CEO or trying to keep a CEO. It is based on a remarkable sort of netherworld of consultants and advisers and other people who keep comping or creating comparables of how much one person is being paid, and comparing them to the other person. Well, this person is getting paid this and this other person, she gets paid this.</p><p>Should they? I mean these are real questions. And I hate to say it but I think there's an old boys' club. Hopefully, some more girls and women will be a part of that club. By the way, I think in terms of pay, there's still a remarkable pay disparity.</p><p>Because one of the other problems is, yes, when an employer tries to hire a person and they say I want to pay them basically as much as the market will bear but probably not much more. If women start a lower rate than men, how are they supposed to bring those wages up? How are they supposed to level things out?</p><p>ISAACSON: You know our country seems to be being torn apart politically and in every other way. Is -- and you almost fear that capitalism itself is in the crossfire--</p><p>SORKIN: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>ISAACSON: -- between left and far right.</p><p>SORKIN: A hundred percent.</p><p>ISAACSON: What can capitalism and capitalists do to totally reform that concept of capitalism to make sure it survives another hundred years?</p><p>SORKIN: Well, look, I do think that the idea of capitalism is under fire. But the issue to me is about what capitalism is. And you know, it's -- just the word capitalism has become almost religious for certain people.</p><p>On both sides of this aisle, capitalism, I would argue has done wonderful things on a global basis and brought so many people out of poverty. The numbers are staggering.</p><p>And yet if somebody in China or Africa has been a great beneficiary of capitalism, it is arguable also that there are certain people in developing countries who are not experiencing that in the same way. And so they look at that and they go, \"That's not me.\"</p><p>I think that we have to redefine some of this a little bit. It goes back to these profits. It goes back to this idea of purpose. It goes back to this idea of creating some kind of stability and less anxiety.</p><p>But I think that's about politics. I think it's about -- I think business has a role to play but I think it really requires leadership across the board to get any of these things to happen.</p><p>ISAACSON: Does Elizabeth Warren or Casio-Cortez, are they on to something?</p><p>SORKIN: It's a great question. You know, I think that they -- there are ideas within what AOC is saying these days and ideas within what Elizabeth Warren is saying that do make some sense. I think that for others, they're so extreme that they're not going to be taken seriously.</p><p>Look, anti-trust law in the United States has effectively been diminished over the last 30 or 40 years. There's less competition. You look at the biggest companies in this country and they're bigger than they've ever been.</p><p>Talk about too big to fail. Too big to manage, by the way, is a whole other issue. So I think there are real things that you could do to solve some of this. But I don't think anyone of them individually -- you know, I think a tax rate -- a marginal tax rate at 70 or 80 percent for the very wealthy I think is a hard one to get past. So I think -- but I think there's a -- I think there's lots of different levers and it would have to be holistic, holistic is tough.</p><p>ISAACSON: And you talk about anti-trust. With this big tech backlash, should we have let Facebook buy Instagram, take over WhatsApp and grow? And is there an argument that Facebook, Google, Amazon have now spread [13:50:00] into so many different industries that they're suppressing competition and there's got to be more anti-trust enforcement?</p><p>SORKIN: So here's the great conundrum. The great conundrum is that in this day and age of technology, scale matters. By the way, you can toast Microsoft early on. Scale matters. You want integrated products. As a consumer, you enjoy products that all work together. I think that actually matters.</p><p>And then in the age of AI and machine learning, data is the new oil, right? So the people who are going to have the most success with AI and innovation on that front need lots of data running through to be able to test out their systems.</p><p>So there's an argument that you want three or four major players in the sort of Pepsi-Coke like battle. But there's also an argument to be made that the kid in their garage who built some of the last great innovations in technologies doesn't stand a chance anymore. Because they won't have the same type of access to that pipeline of data, that oil, anymore.</p><p>And so I'm very nixed about sort of where that lands and what kinds of controls you want to put on these companies. You know, if you said to me, how do you break up Google tomorrow? It's not like you can just, you know, write it down in a piece of paper and say this goes over here and this goes over here and this goes over here in this goes over here.</p><p>So it's -- unlike Apple -- I'm sorry unlike AT&amp;T with the Baby Bells, you - - they were -- it was very breakupable. It was very --</p><p>ISAACSON: Well, the cloud (CROSSTALK) was Microsoft.</p><p>SORKIN: Right.</p><p>ISAACSON: You just mentioned Microsoft. But you also said it's really good when people bundles a project --</p><p>SORKIN: It is.</p><p>ISAACSON: -- products because they work together better. But what happened in the Microsoft case over the years, was they were barred from bundling the browser into the operating system, barred from bundling search into the operation. And thus, Google gets to be born in the garage.</p><p>SORKIN: Born, yes.</p><p>ISAACSON: Are we losing that now?</p><p>SORKIN: I think there's probably an element that we are losing that now. And look, the question -- but again, the question is how do you do it. I mean that's the -- that's where I come down is how do you do it?</p><p>Is Amazon too big? Amazon on an actual per business is very small. Whole Foods, everyone was worried about Whole Foods. Whole Foods is very small, small relative to other supermarkets. Books, they have huge, huge -- I mean that's where they probably have the monopoly.</p><p>But everything else is actually tiny. But the collective, does that change it? And so these are the issues I think we're all grappling with.</p><p>ISAACSON: But one of the ways to address it is the notion that if you have dominance, you can't use that to leverage --</p><p>SORKIN: Exactly.</p><p>ISAACSON: -- into another feel.</p><p>SORKIN: Right.</p><p>ISAACSON: And that's what's been happening with say Facebook.</p><p>SORKIN: A hundred percent. But the question is, are you leveraging just the fact that you've made all of this money and therefore you have a lot of money to go buy other things? Or you're actually leveraging -- for example, one of the things I worry about with Amazon is Amazon has so much information about the shopper, that they are now starting to create their own products to compete with the products that are on their own platform.</p><p>You know, by the way, Walmart and Costco have done that forever. They've had white label. Approximate, this feels like it may be at a different level. I don't know. But these are the issues that I think we need to focus on and talk about and debate. And one of the things I worry about is that there's not enough conversation about it.</p><p>ISAACSON: Are we due for another financial crisis and are we ready for it?</p><p>SORKIN: So Jamie Diamond was called in 2000, in the middle of financial crisis, by his daughter I believe then was in high school and said, \"Daddy, what's a financial crisis?\" And he said back to her, \"Something that happens every seven or eight years.\"</p><p>ISAACSON: I'm looking at my watch.</p><p>SORKIN: Yes, look at your watch. If he's right, we're way overdue. Do I think we will have another crisis of some sort? Absolutely. Will it look like what happened in 2008? In my mind, absolutely not.</p><p>It could be better but, by the way, it also could be worse. The one thing that I feel like was the lesson for me in the financial crisis and in writing Too Big to Fail is that every financial crisis is really a function with one thing. It's debt. It's leverage in the system.</p><p>You can have all the bad actors you want doing all the bad things you could imagine, whether it's credit rating agencies being conflicted or bankers being greedy regulators not minding the store or you name it. But in the west, there's leverage in the system. It doesn't matter.</p><p>And so you say to yourself, OK, where's the leverage now? Well, there's corporate leverage. That's real. I don't think we have it in the banking system so much. But where is the real debt? Where's the real leverage?</p><p>When I wrote Too Big to Fail, we used to use that phrase in the context of banks. Today, we use it in the context of countries. And when you talk about the relationships between countries, the fact that China, for example, owns so much of our debt, [13:55:00] that's where all of this gets really interesting. Interesting in a bad way, I hate to say.</p><p>ISAACSON: And so what should we do?</p><p>SORKIN: To me, the long-term thing that we need to fix way beyond the corporate system, but the corporate system is obviously a huge piece of it because it pays the taxes and creates real revenue for the country, is we need to somehow fix the larger debt problem in the United States at a country level. But that's a hard one.</p><p>ISAACSON: Andrew, thank you for being with us.</p><p>SORKIN: Thank you, Walter. Appreciate it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And on that note, that is it for now.

No translation.\" Cate Ambrose, President and CEO of the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America (LAVCA), makes this clarification before the interview.</p><p><br/>Although LAVCA focuses on Latin American projects and startups, its headquarters are in New York, at 8th Avenue. The reason? Here are managed high-level relationships and contacts between investors who want to put their wallets south of the US. The other place is in Silicon Valley. This nonprofit has nearly 200 members, including investment firms, local fund managers, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and corporate investors, who control assets over $65 billion.<br/>Cate, who is also a commentator on CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, Bloomberg and Fox Business, knows all the recent symbolic cases of Latino startups perfectly well. \"It's an incredibly important time for Latin America's entrepreneurial ecosystem, compared to the beginning of this decade,\" he says.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happened at the beginning of this decade?</emphasis><br/>From 2011 came several US funds that saw in Brazil a new opportunity for startup tech. They wanted to do something similar to what had happened a little earlier in India and China. Sequoia and Redpoint were some examples. The goal was to copy the American model. Many professional cheers and Americans arrived excited by the idea.<br/>Coindice with the creation of Start-Up Chile.<br/>Exactly. Its creation was very relevant, because it began to put Chile on the map of the funds. I must admit that I thought Start-Up Chile wasn't going to work, especially since Chile has a very closed ecosystem. But I was wrong. It was key to creating the entrepreneurial mindset that we are seeing today in Chile.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And why was it so relevant?</emphasis><br/>Basically because he invited entrepreneurs from all over the world. In other words, that sense of competition between local and foreign startups was essential and served as a global example. That, in addition to what was happening in Brazil, laid the eyes of the world on Latin America... until the crisis in Brazil came with the depreciation of its currency and the political crisis.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Then...?</emphasis><br/>Expectations of high startup growth in the region or major acquisitions fell. Especially that of US investors who had put their chips in Latin America. But at the same time something incredible happened: this crisis allowed a whole new generation of entrepreneurs to benefit. However, in 2016 many funds were already quite distressed... until DiDi Chuxing (the Chinese Uber) arrived.<br/>And he bought the Brazilian startup 99 in $1 billion.<br/>Thus, Latin America achieved its first Unicorn since 2017. Since then, an explosion has never seen the entrepreneurial and investor ecosystem in Latin America.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's happened since then?</emphasis><br/>Interest in information about what is happening in the region has grown. Suddenly, big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon began to see Latin America as a global priority.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why?</emphasis><br/>Because in China it is difficult to do business and India - even though it is very large - has many regulatory difficulties. But latin America was also positioned as a region of great user growth.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And how did that refocus LVCA's goal?</emphasis><br/>While our mission was in Venture Capital (VC), the money that was entering Latin America far exceeded what this sector provided. Alsomany Corporate Ventures and other sources of capital have begun to arrive. The industry is growing much more than we thought. Apart from large companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Telef\u00f3nica, others like Visa have also entered.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is your relationship with them?</emphasis><br/>We are being funded by research to build the technological ecosystem in the region. Over the past two years the growth has been incredible. Rappi is a good example. And all of a sudden, Softbank arrives in May this year, announcing that it was going to put $5 billion in the region. That day, the phone here kept ringing.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is that too much money?</emphasis><br/>I honestly believe that Softbank can invest that money in Latin America, better than any stop in Latin America.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why?</emphasis><br/>The nice thing is that that money is coming at an ideal time. First, there is a market opportunity for the size of the region and the consumption of technology on all platforms. Moreover, the lack of capital that occurred for so many years produced a discipline in Brazil and other markets, in thinking very well about profitable businesses from the beginning. In addition, latin America's scalability allows you to grow much more steadily than if you simply got a check for $1 billion.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But there is always risk...</emphasis><br/>Of course. And it can also distort the market. But in general everyone sees it as a positive thing. What I would like to see now, that is more integration of the markets, especially in Mexico.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And how do you see Chile?</emphasis><br/>I love NotCo and the interesting thing from the investment point of view is that that startup breaks with that old-life idea of making a copypaste of what happens in America. In fact, we push a little bit to get startups to think about real and impactful solutions. Entrepreneurs in Chile and Latin America have a lot of that mentality. To create something not just to create it; but because they see it's a real problem. I think that should be Latin America's example for more developed markets.<br/>The Latin future<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ideas there are many, but are Latin American startups ready to think globally?</emphasis><br/>It's a new generation. Most are young, which is very noticeable in the change of mindset. In addition, it is key that there are examples of successful young entrepreneurs.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And as for the Chilean capitals?</emphasis><br/>In Chile there are many family offices that have money, but they don't want to risk much. In fact, they boast of not losing money on their investments. But that's not right! If you haven't lost money, you're not doing your job! It's part of the risk.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What other advantages does Latin America have for the startup ecosystem?</emphasis><br/>Due to volatility cycles, it makes you get used to navigating unstable waters. Argentina is a good example. Either way, Latin America has the opportunity to be a global leader and get Europeans, Africans or Chinese to come to this region to see what is being done and scale to other markets.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In this context, what is the message that was given with Walmart's failed purchase of Cornershop?</emphasis><br/>It's not a bad message. Those things happen. Cornershop remains a very viable and attractive startup. The important thing is that it goes ahead and could be acquired by another group or grow independently.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is the presence of unicorns in Latin America so important?</emphasis><br/>Personally, I don't think so. Global metrics speak of unicorns, but you have to be very cautious, not speculate. Even we stopped talking about unicorns, because it's not a goal at all. Having unicorns is not themetric of success. I think the important thing is to see new business models.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But now that Softbank has entered the region, there should be more unicorns. It's hard to think they're not looking for that.</emphasis><br/>Being a unicorn means a lot of liquidity and growing faster, but more important is to see how far companies like Rappi go and what impact they are having on the consumer, on the economy, job creation, etc. One thing we are following very closely is the human capital to work with.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For example?</emphasis><br/>I have seen how many startups are pushing to hire more women, to invest a lot in training and profits. Sometimes it is more important to have a positive impact on the macro economy and employment than to have a great appreciation only for investors.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What will happen in the near future in the Latin American ecosystem?</emphasis><br/>I think the intersection of Fintech with financial inclusion is coming strong, because there's a lot of money behind this latest concept. Another strong trend is the growth of Corporate Venturing. And finally, I see a lot of growth. Softbank has been like the most visible gorilla. But there are many other funds like Riverwood.

But it still wasn't good enough to beat the public stock markets, which are cheaper, safer, and much more liquid investments.</p><p><br/> Clearly, that's a bad deal for many of the people who supplied money to VCs. But it's much harder to say why VCs have done so poorly in the past decade\u2014or whether things have changed enough to make the next decade a better bet.<br/> The newest data on VC performance comes courtesy of Cambridge Associates[1], an industry insider that analyzes venture firm performance and produces anonymous information about the sector's ups and downs.<br/> That means you can't tell which firms are winning or losing. But you can see how the broader VC sector is performing when compared to public stock market indexes.<br/> In its July report[2], Cambridge Associates wraps up the full-year performance for VC and private equity investments, and it wasn't exactly pretty. The firm's VC index grew 27.2 percent in 2013, the best annual performance in 15 years. VC firms also recorded the second-largest payout for VC investors since 2000.<br/> But that wasn't enough to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite, the Russell 2000, or the SP 500. You actually have to go back 15 years to find VC performance that outperforms the stock markets enough to truly justify the high fees, long-term lockup, and risk of those investments.<br/> So why has VC done so poorly over the past 10 years? It's hard to find a clear answer. But there are some good educated guesses out there.<br/> Anand Sanwal, CEO of VC analysis software company CB Insights[3], says the winner-take-all nature of venture investing[4] means that it can be hard for a broad-based investor to get a good return on their investment. Since the biggest wins go to a handful of firms, even decent wins can be swamped by a long list of underperforming funds.<br/> 'Ultimately, it matters what funds you as an investor are in. And so it's not a bad asset to invest in broadly as when it outperforms, it really outperforms,' Sanwal says. 'Said another way, if you are an LP in Sequoia Capital or Union Square Ventures or Spark Capital, you're probably a pretty happy camper.'<br/>Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner[5] sees it a little differently.<br/> 'The power law property of VC returns has characterized the industry's returns since its earliest days, so is unlikely to be the explanation,' he says. More likely reasons, he says, are slow IPO markets and 'change in the nature of entrepreneurship: changing market structure and regulatory environments meant that it was harder to capture outsized returns as a startup.'<br/> And then here's the simplest explanation of them all: maybe it was just bad luck. 'VC has always been a seven fat years, seven lean years kind of business\u2014this was just a bad series of years,' Lerner says.<br/> At least one prominent venture capitalist is growing weary of discussing the lean years. In a recent series[6] of blog posts[7], Upfront Ventures partner Mark Suster argues that the past 10 years or more of bad performance was a long-term shakeout of the over-investment from the 1999-2000 tech bubble.<br/> Today, there are fewer VC firms. At the same time, the cost of high-tech entrepreneurship has dropped, while the number of connected consumers has skyrocketed, creating fertile ground for big tech industry victories, Suster argues.<br/> 'Looking ahead at the next decade, I am excited by what I believe will be viewed as one of the best and most rational investment periods for venture capital,' he says.<br/> Ashby Monk[8], the executive director of Stanford University's Global Projects Center and a regular columnist[9] on institutional investing issues, says VC funds that successfully navigated the Great Recession deserve credit for pulling out of the worst economic climate in decades.<br/> But Monk is less sympathetic to the idea that the tech bubble at the turn of the century is still a big factor in VC performance. He also tends to agree with the Kauffman Foundation's bombshell 2012 report[10] on venture investing, which said the entrepreneurship-focused foundation was rethinking its strategy after poor VC performance that it says has been indirectly encouraged by limited partners who don't hold venture firms accountable.<br/> 'I don't necessarily buy that we're still dealing with this overhang from 1999. That's a step too far,' Monk says. 'I think the last five years have been fabulous for everybody, and you have seen some big exits\u2014and yet, the returns to the LP's aren't there. So don't tell me this is just a macro thing.'<br/> Comments[11] | Reprints[12] | Share: <url

Go to as many events as you can. Have a huge curiosity. Build up expertise in a particular area.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Besides his former role at Apple, Sculley has also helped launch successful companies such as MetroPCS. He's now investing in several fast-growing companies in South Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's a growing call to tap into more venture capital from local sources, as Florida startups bemoan the lack of in-state investors willing to bank on their innovative ventures. Groups such as the Knight Foundation, Refresh Miami and the Enterprise Development Corp. are attempting to remedy that disconnect by linking local startup companies with the region's wealth.</p><p>\"We still have a lot of untapped wealth here,\" said Brian Breslin, founder of Refresh Miami. \"There's a lot of private wealth sitting around here idle or, at best, invested in real estate.\"</p><p>The good news is that Breslin and others are holding more events and networking opportunities for entrepreneurs. Venture capital investments in South Florida hit a four-year high in 2013, with a good portion going to local projects. The bad news is that only 6 percent of those investments came from Florida.</p><p>\"I think it is generally harder to get capital here, and harder to get it at valuations you would see in Boston or Silicon Valley,\" Sculley said.</p><p>Venture capitalists with a successful track record are rare here, but they do exist. Sculley said building a community that supports innovation is the key.</p><p>\"The people in Silicon Valley may not be any smarter, but they have so many ways to connect with other good ideas and sources of venture capital,\" he said. \"If you have a good idea in Silicon Valley, it's not difficult to get funded. But there are some emerging success stories here, too.\"</p><h>Seeking a good fit</h><p>There are several venture capital funds based in Miami looking for very specific companies to invest in.</p><p>One of them is Antares Capital, which funds new companies that haven't received venture capital yet. It's invested in companies - such as software firm Cellit, Outback Steakhouse and Fort Lauderdale-based SportsLineUSA, the predecessor of CBSSports.com - and currently has more than $50 million under management in its portfolio of venture investments, Chairman Jonathan Kislak said.</p><p>\"It's very difficult to get the attention of a professional investor, no matter where you are,\" he said. \"We see 1,000 ideas a year.\"</p><p>Antares founder Randy Poliner said picking a company to invest in goes beyond the concept. It must meet Antares' criteria of a new company with a strong management team and a solid record of execution.</p><p>\"If it's blocks from our office in Miami, so be it, but that's not our criteria,\" he said.</p><p>Another venture capital firm based in Miami is H.I.G. BioVentures, part of H.I.G. Capital. It has a more narrow focus on health and medical technology. Its newest fund hasn't invested in local companies yet, but Managing Director Michael Wasserman said there are some Florida companies in its proposal pipeline. He said the firm is interested in any worthwhile proposal.</p><p>\"We get a lot of referrals from lawyers and bankers, but we also get a lot of cold calls,\" Wasserman said. \"There are some venture capital firms that won't pay attention unless you have a referral, but we usually take a look.\"</p><h>Venture challenges</h><p>Fort Lauderdale businessman Doug VonAllmen is a South Florida investor who has steered clear of venture capital in favor of private equity deals. His St. Louis-based VonAllmen Capital sold Tampa-based Beauty Alliance, a beauty supply merchant chain, in 2007 for an estimated $260 million.</p><p>\"I've bought companies and grown them, more through private equity,\" VonAllmen said. \"I've done very little venture capital, and I've lost money whenever I did.\"</p><p>When asked what would attract more venture capital to South Florida, VonAllmen said he believes it requires a large community of support.</p><p>\"The successful communities for entrepreneurs have all kinds of support from universities, lawyers and accountants,\" he said. \"People see that their next-door neighbor went out and started a successful company. And they say, 'I'm smarter than him, I can do that.'\"</p><p>VonAllmen said he thinks Florida's lack of a state income tax is a plus because it means lower costs for some executives if they move here. But he believes government regulation is a drag on innovation, and said he supports what Gov. Rick Scott has done to deregulate some industries.</p><h>Building a culture</h><p>Sculley has invested in several South Florida startups, mostly in Palm Beach County. They include tech firms such as Modernizing Medicine, 3Cinteractive and OpenPeak.</p><p>Sculley said he and his network are often out talking to entrepreneurs, and he doesn't generally need cold-call pitches.</p><p>\"We don't have a lot of role models here. Yes, the IBM personal computer was created in Boca Raton, and Citrix Systems is a huge success story,\" he said. \"But in those other big tech markets, they have hundreds of examples like that.\"</p><p>Sculley said he's encountered success in two major areas here: health care technology and mobile software. His latest investment, MDLive, focuses on telehealth services - providing health care via the Internet.</p><p>\"The reason we got involved with MDLive is Randy Parker is a serial entrepreneur,\" Sculley said. \"You have to have a good idea, and you need to have investors who are confident in the team leading the company.\"</p><p>Refresh Miami's Breslin hears regularly from entrepreneurs who would like to connect with big South Florida companies, such as Carnival Corp., to pitch a new concept that might help their company.</p><p>Roger Frizzell, Carnival's senior VP of corporate communications, said the cruise company is open to new ideas from the local startup community. He noted that Arnold Donald, who became Carnival's CEO in 2013, has a successful history as an entrepreneur.</p><h>A rising tide</h><p>Florida's biggest venture event, the Florida Venture Capital Conference, saw a record turnout from investors in 2014, according to President Kevin Burgoyne.</p><p>That success followed a resurgent year for venture investments in the state. So many people are now confident that venture funding is returning in force.</p><p>Shaun Blogg, a partner with accounting firm Marcum LLP in West Palm Beach, said he's seen increased activity in his practice.</p><p>\"We have a lot of capital coming into South Florida from retirees moving here and foreign nationals relocating here,\" Blogg said.</p><p>The transient nature of these wealthy populations means that some recent arrivals may not be aware of opportunities to invest with startup companies located here, Blogg said.</p><p>\"The capital, like the communities here, is still a little disjointed, which is a challenge that Boston and Silicon Valley don't necessarily face,\" he said.</p><p>On a positive note, New York-based Endeavor Global, a global mentoring network, is getting organized in Miami to help local startups connect with wealthy investors around the world.</p><p>Endeavor Miami recently released a survey that shows where the gaps are in the Miami area's network, once again calling out a lack of mentoring and a perceived lack of access to capital.</p><p>\"Connecting entrepreneurs with capital and mentors is what Endeavor does best, so we are in the right place,\" said Laura Mayd\u00f3n, managing director of Endeavor Miami.</p><p>Another key initiative to bring venture capitalists together in Miami is the upcoming eMerge Americas conference, kicked off by Terremark Worldwide founder Manny Medina.</p><p>Diane S\u00e1nchez, CEO of conference host Technology Foundation of the Americas, said South Florida's leading investors and businesspeople are invited.</p><p>\"Part of what we are doing is to find out what excites the region's movers and shakers, get them together and then keep them talking to each other,\" S\u00e1nchez said.</p><h>THE DETAILS: VENTURE CAPITALISTS IN SOUTH FLORIDA</h><p>Antares Capital</p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>Chairman: Jonathan Kislak</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.antarescapital.com\">www.antarescapital.com</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><bodyText><p>Address: 9999 N.E.

Jourov expectedly talked substantially about European values, explaining that the values we defend in our normal (offline) lives should be defended online, also. But that's really as far as she went to even hint at platform regulation, with her whole exchange coming off as a love letter for big tech. </p><p>Jourov romantically explained her experiences in discussions with big tech, saying, 'With the platforms I always had a very strong feeling that we have a common denominator, as for the values, which we do not have to explain to each other; something given. And the words like freedom of speech, freedom as such, access to information, protection of privacy even, didn't need much explanation. It was very relaxing for me as I could kind of rely on the communication which does not include any bad surprises on principle things.' Further in the discussion, Jourov went on to portray the platforms as the champions of democracy. 'Internet and the platforms can be very important player(s) in the countries where we will see increased power of the government, decreased power of the media, shrunk space of the civil society, and all these factors which we don't think belong to healthy democratic system. So we should not only think about how to regulate and whether to regulate, and how to minimise the power of big tech - or tech in general; not only big. But we should think about how to enhance and support the positive role which we see necessary.' It is not, dear Commissioner, the platforms who are the heroes in these societies where democracy has fragmented but the people who champion democratic values on these platforms. The people whose lives are in danger when they speak out. The journalist, activists, and citizens who, tired of the reality they face, take a stand. If you turn platforms into heroes, perhaps then you should consider them as noble publishers, and not just conduits of information. It's not a bad surprise if it happened in the past It's as if she has forgotten the 'bad surprise' of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica days, or that Google has been found to be functioning anticompetitively in a whole range of issues. This is not a matter of fine and collect. This anticompetitive behaviour has been very damaging to European companies and citizens and that is why Jourov's colleagues running the EU's competition authorities intervened. It's not a bad surprise if you know it's coming And if Jourov would like to pretend these 'bad surprises' are a thing of the past, we have only to look at the latest clashes with the platforms: The EU opening two competition cases with Apple and the awaited outcome of the EU's probe on Amazon.  In the US - mounting pressure for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to testify in Congress eventually led to a nod from the company signalling this is going to happen.  Meanwhile, in Europe, instead of asking for accountability, and for Bezos to appear - much like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - in the European Parliament to answer some questions, politicians like Jourov are happy to turn a blind eye. And, to be completely candid - if we were to judge from the treatment of Zuckerberg during his hearing, it became more of a photo-op moment for the Brussels elite, than an opportunity to get real answers on difficult questions. Once the European Commission's decision is out, let's see which (if any) Members of the European Parliament take the lead in calling for Bezos to fly over to provide some answers. If you are not sure why, read The New York Times article, 'When Amazon Flexes Its Power'. We will certainly come back to the issue. And while Ursula von der Leyen's European Commission is not as unified as the days of Jean-Claude Juncker, Jourov's blindness to what is happening around her, and frankly the broader reality is nearly shocking. What about the Digital Services act and the new competition tool, which are looking at the exact issue of harnessing platform power? Is that just not a thing? And no, it's not evil to come close to industry Of course the industry should indeed be interacting with policymakers and politicians. It is necessary to not only hear the industry's position and take into account their data, but also sometimes to come together to cooperate in projects that make the world a better place. And yes there are also political decisions involved about what is communicated about them and in what tone. But in developing these professional, and sometimes personal relationships, politicians and regulators should not lose track of reality. If we want to be fair to Jourov, she was, in accordance with her job description, rather transparent. Meanwhile, paradoxically, it is Phil Hogan who is basically not allowed to speak about trade any more unless several people vet his talking points. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NWEU134296159319488205875776100102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEU-134296</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6073-8F31-F03R-N3SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><timeReceived>6:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>New Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Dans un communiqu\u00e9 publi\u00e9 ce lundi, le g\u00e9ant am\u00e9ricain du mobile affirme avoir donn\u00e9 le coup d'envoi de son service\u00a0\u00ab\u00a05G Home\u00a0\u00bb dans plusieurs villes du pays de l'Oncle Sam. D'apr\u00e8s l'industriel, celui-ci est \u00ab\u00a0officiellement op\u00e9rationnel pour les consommateurs de certaines parties de Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles et Sacramento\u00a0\u00bb. Il ne s'agit pas, pour ces clients estampill\u00e9s \u00ab\u00a0First on 5G\u00a0\u00bb par Verizon, de 5G en mobilit\u00e9, mais bien d'un service Internet \u00e0 tr\u00e8s haut d\u00e9bit \u00e0 la maison, \u00ab\u00a0offrant un acc\u00e8s Wi-Fi ultra-rapide\u00a0\u00bb. Quoi qu'il en soit, le d\u00e9ploiement de ce nouveau r\u00e9seau permet \u00e0 Verizon de clamer haut et fort qu'il est \u00e0 l'initiative du \u00ab\u00a0premier service commercial 5G au monde\u00a0\u00bb. Dans son communiqu\u00e9, Verizon pr\u00e9cise que son objectif a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 de proposer la 5G aux consommateurs\u00a0d\u00e8s que possible. Or, les standards de la 5G sont encore en cours d'\u00e9laboration. Pour lancer son service, Verizon a donc recouru \u00e0 sa propre norme propri\u00e9taire, baptis\u00e9e \u00ab\u00a05G TF\u00a0\u00bb. L'industriel pr\u00e9cise qu'il compte \u00e9tendre\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0rapidement\u00a0\u00bb sa zone de couverture, et proposer sa solution, d\u00e8s que possible, dans de nouvelles villes. </p><p>Une r\u00e9ponse au tandem Sprint-T-Mobile US Reste que le service de Verizon appara\u00eet, finalement, peu r\u00e9volutionnaire. Il ne s'agit, ici, que d'un service Internet fixe bas\u00e9 sur une technologie mobile. Verizon n'est d'ailleurs pas le seul op\u00e9rateur am\u00e9ricain \u00e0 miser sur\u00a0la 5G pour, notamment, concurrencer les c\u00e2blo-op\u00e9rateurs. Ses rivaux Sprint et T-Mobile US, qui veulent se marier, ont clairement fait du d\u00e9ploiement de la 5G - et de son usage pour l'Internet fixe - la pierre angulaire de leur projet. Dans une vid\u00e9o publi\u00e9e au printemps dernier, Marcelo Claure, pr\u00e9sident ex\u00e9cutif de Sprint, a justifi\u00e9 ainsi cette strat\u00e9gie agressive dans l'ultra-haut d\u00e9bit mobile\u00a0:</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Saviez-vous que d'apr\u00e8s les derniers chiffres de la FCC [le gendarme am\u00e9ricain des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, Ndlr], qui datent de 2016, 51% des Am\u00e9ricains n'ont qu'un seul op\u00e9rateur \u00e0 leur disposition pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'Internet fixe\u00a0?, a-t-il lanc\u00e9. Avec notre r\u00e9seau 5G d'envergure nationale, on peut mettre fin \u00e0 cela, apporter une vraie concurrence et baisser les prix partout.\u00a0\u00bb La 5G, un enjeu de leadership \u00e9conomique Sous ce prisme, le nouveau service\u00a0\u00ab\u00a05G Home\u00a0\u00bb de Verizon vise probablement aussi \u00e0 couper l'herbe sous le pied d'un possible nouvel ensemble T-Mobile US-Sprint.</p><p>Lire aussi : T-Mobile-Sprint : le deal qui pourrait chambouler le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain du mobile</p><p>L'initiative t\u00e9moigne \u00e9galement, d'un point de vue plus macro\u00e9conomique, de la volont\u00e9 des \u00c9tats-Unis de damer le pion \u00e0 la Chine. Les deux pays se sont engag\u00e9s dans une course pour d\u00e9ployer au plus vite la 5G. Pour les \u00c9tats-Unis, cette technologie est per\u00e7ue comme vitale pour pr\u00e9server sa domination \u00e9conomique dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir. Aux yeux de Washington, c'est la capacit\u00e9 du pays de l'Oncle Sam \u00e0 lancer tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t des services 4G performants qui a permis aux g\u00e9ants Google, Amazon, Apple et autres Facebook de prosp\u00e9rer et d'\u00e9tendre leurs services \u00e0 l'international.

Dans un communiqu\u00e9 publi\u00e9 ce lundi, le g\u00e9ant am\u00e9ricain du mobile affirme avoir donn\u00e9 le coup d'envoi de son service\u00a0\u00ab\u00a05G Home\u00a0\u00bb dans plusieurs villes du pays de l'Oncle Sam. D'apr\u00e8s l'industriel, celui-ci est \u00ab\u00a0officiellement op\u00e9rationnel pour les consommateurs de certaines parties de Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles et Sacramento\u00a0\u00bb. Il ne s'agit pas, pour ces clients estampill\u00e9s \u00ab\u00a0First on 5G\u00a0\u00bb par Verizon, de 5G en mobilit\u00e9, mais bien d'un service Internet \u00e0 tr\u00e8s haut d\u00e9bit \u00e0 la maison, \u00ab\u00a0offrant un acc\u00e8s Wi-Fi ultra-rapide\u00a0\u00bb. Quoi qu'il en soit, le d\u00e9ploiement de ce nouveau r\u00e9seau permet \u00e0 Verizon de clamer haut et fort qu'il est \u00e0 l'initiative du \u00ab\u00a0premier service commercial 5G au monde\u00a0\u00bb. Dans son communiqu\u00e9, Verizon pr\u00e9cise que son objectif a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 de proposer la 5G aux consommateurs\u00a0d\u00e8s que possible. Or, les standards de la 5G sont encore en cours d'\u00e9laboration. Pour lancer son service, Verizon a donc recouru \u00e0 sa propre norme propri\u00e9taire, baptis\u00e9e \u00ab\u00a05G TF\u00a0\u00bb. L'industriel pr\u00e9cise qu'il compte \u00e9tendre\u00a0\u00ab\u00a0rapidement\u00a0\u00bb sa zone de couverture, et proposer sa solution, d\u00e8s que possible, dans de nouvelles villes. </p><p>Une r\u00e9ponse au tandem Sprint-T-Mobile US Reste que le service de Verizon appara\u00eet, finalement, peu r\u00e9volutionnaire. Il ne s'agit, ici, que d'un service Internet fixe bas\u00e9 sur une technologie mobile. Verizon n'est d'ailleurs pas le seul op\u00e9rateur am\u00e9ricain \u00e0 miser sur\u00a0la 5G pour, notamment, concurrencer les c\u00e2blo-op\u00e9rateurs. Ses rivaux Sprint et T-Mobile US, qui veulent se marier, ont clairement fait du d\u00e9ploiement de la 5G - et de son usage pour l'Internet fixe - la pierre angulaire de leur projet. Dans une vid\u00e9o publi\u00e9e au printemps dernier, Marcelo Claure, pr\u00e9sident ex\u00e9cutif de Sprint, a justifi\u00e9 ainsi cette strat\u00e9gie agressive dans l'ultra-haut d\u00e9bit mobile\u00a0:</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Saviez-vous que d'apr\u00e8s les derniers chiffres de la FCC [le gendarme am\u00e9ricain des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms, Ndlr], qui datent de 2016, 51% des Am\u00e9ricains n'ont qu'un seul op\u00e9rateur \u00e0 leur disposition pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'Internet fixe\u00a0?, a-t-il lanc\u00e9. Avec notre r\u00e9seau 5G d'envergure nationale, on peut mettre fin \u00e0 cela, apporter une vraie concurrence et baisser les prix partout.\u00a0\u00bb La 5G, un enjeu de leadership \u00e9conomique Sous ce prisme, le nouveau service\u00a0\u00ab\u00a05G Home\u00a0\u00bb de Verizon vise probablement aussi \u00e0 couper l'herbe sous le pied d'un possible nouvel ensemble T-Mobile US-Sprint.</p><p>Lire aussi : T-Mobile-Sprint : le deal qui pourrait chambouler le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain du mobile</p><p>L'initiative t\u00e9moigne \u00e9galement, d'un point de vue plus macro\u00e9conomique, de la volont\u00e9 des \u00c9tats-Unis de damer le pion \u00e0 la Chine. Les deux pays se sont engag\u00e9s dans une course pour d\u00e9ployer au plus vite la 5G. Pour les \u00c9tats-Unis, cette technologie est per\u00e7ue comme vitale pour pr\u00e9server sa domination \u00e9conomique dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir. Aux yeux de Washington, c'est la capacit\u00e9 du pays de l'Oncle Sam \u00e0 lancer tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t des services 4G performants qui a permis aux g\u00e9ants Google, Amazon, Apple et autres Facebook de prosp\u00e9rer et d'\u00e9tendre leurs services \u00e0 l'international. La Chine, elle, voit dans la 5G une rampe de lancement pour ses propres \u00ab\u00a0big tech\u00a0\u00bb, et un moyen de rivaliser, \u00e0 terme, avec les cadors am\u00e9ricains du Net.</p><p>Lire aussi : Course \u00e0 la 5G : bras de fer tendu entre les \u00c9tats-Unis et la Chine</p><p>L'offensive de Verizon va, \u00e0 n'en point douter, donner mati\u00e8re \u00e0 r\u00e9flexion \u00e0 l'Union europ\u00e9enne.

Previously, Verizon planned to build its own cloud to compete with Amazon's. This marks yet another would-be competitor to Amazon Web Services, that Amazon has folded into its own ecosystem. Verizon is also going to use Amazon Aurora \u2014 Amazon's competitor to Oracle's flagship databases \u2014 giving the company a big marquee database customer to show off. </p><p>On Tuesday,Amazon announced[1] that Verizon was going to vastly increase its usage of Amazon's cloud. Verizon had been an under-the-radar customer of Amazon Web Services since 2015, but it is now going to move 1,000 of its applications into Amazon's cloud in a very public way. It is also going to be a user of Amazon's database,Aurora. All of this is significant for a number of reasons. For one, it marks how Amazon has taken yet another would-be competitor and brought them into its own orbit. Verizon once had ambitions to be a public cloud provider that competed with Amazon. In 2011, Verizon spent $1.4 billion to buy cloud data center providerTerremark. At the time, the cloud market was young, and every big tech company was scrambling to nab their piece of it.  It didn't really work out. In 2015, Verizon started using Amazon Web Services to power some of its own software. A year later, as Amazon's dominance rose, Verizon's in-house cloud ambitions faded. Verizon quietlyclosed its cloud unit.[2]Last year, it sold its data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion[3], and sold the remnants of its cloud business to IBM[4], with terms undisclosed.  So becoming a \"preferred cloud vendor\" for Verizon is a definitely feather in Amazon's cap. And the announcement that Verizon will use the Amazon Aurora database is significant because it gives Amazon another huge, marquee customer for its fast-growing Oracle competitor. And the list of Aurora is starting to get long and significant. AWS CEO Andy Jassy says that Aurora is the fastest growing service in Amazon's history, with \"tens of thousands\" of customers using it and it grew at about 250% last year. Big-name Aurora customers include ADP, Autodesk andChoice Hotels. Verizon is a standout addition, nonetheless. It isn't clear which type of databases Verizon is moving to AWS Aurora. Back in 2015, Verizon famously had issues with a MongoDB database when a hacker claimed to have stolen [5]the customer data out of it, and was offering to sell that data for $100,000. Other companies who couldn't beat the mighty AWS and later opted to join it, (albeit as partners, not customers), include VMware [6]and Rackspace.[7]NOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos on breaking up and regulating

But that is how it has played out. After Verizon Communications Inc, which owns media brands like Yahoo, AOL and social media site Tumblr, declared its media properties nearly worthless last year with a US$4.6 billion write-down, the division of the U.S. telecoms giant is resurrecting the businesses as an antidote to the cesspool of the internet. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2k5t3WS) \"I want to build something that you'll 100per cent trust,\" Verizon Media Chief Executive Guru Gowrappan said in an interview last month. </p><p>Still, analysts say Verizon Media will be competing with larger rivals who have deeper pockets and have made bigger investments in the areas it is turning its focus to. The restructuring comes as regulators are gearing up to investigate whether U.S. tech giants like Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook have too much power, while several Democratic presidential candidates have gone so far as to call for a breakup of big tech. Verizon Media hopes to avoid the same scrutiny faced by its peers, who struggle to stem fake news and violent videos, by focusing on high quality, professionally produced content and products. The cornerstone of Gowrappan's plan is to diversify Verizon Media's revenue, which mainly comes from advertising. His goal is for revenue to be split evenly among advertising, subscriptions and e-commerce transactions within five years, but subscriptions may take a little longer than planned. The relaunch is happening in stages. The company is rolling out one of the largest redesigns of Yahoo Mail to include new features to better organize email and incorporate shopping. Yahoo Mail had 67 million monthly unique users in June, according to media analytics company Comscore. By this holiday season, prepare to be able to make purchases without leaving Verizon Media's sites, said Gowrappan, formerly the global managing director for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. He explained how users will be able to buy products straight from ads that show up in Yahoo Mail without being redirected to the retailer's website. That concept will be expanded across other Verizon Media sites including the ability to buy products within advertising displays, he said. To court those advertisers and e-commerce partners, Verizon Media needed to clean up its image and present itself as a safe place on the internet. Its news website HuffPost scrubbed its archives of blogs promoting anti-vaccine views. Verizon Media purged its websites of clickbait content and made the controversial decision to ban adult content on Tumblr, which had accounted for 30per cent of the site's traffic, Gowrappan said. Verizon Media still relies on Tumblr for its younger demographic, an area in which Yahoo and AOL struggle, Gowrappan said. But he remains open to selling it down the line if the cleaned-up version fails to connect with users. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Verizon was seeking buyers for Tumblr. Even as it planned to revitalize its businesses, Verizon tested the market for potential buyers of trophy asset Yahoo Finance, which recently launched a premium subscription service, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Verizon ended the search for buyers for Yahoo Finance recently, the sources said, and the Yahoo brand is positioned to become a main driver of Verizon Media's growth plans. Verizon is actively seeking to buy other media properties to bolster its portfolio, one source briefed on the plans said. NO SECOND CHANCES Verizon Media, whose collections of assets were worth a half a trillion dollars at its prime, will have a tough time returning to glory. Take its digital media website AOL, for example, which is \"unlikely to gain muster ever again,\" said Merrill Brown, a media industry veteran and founder of The News Project, a publishing platform aimed at small and mid-sized news organizations. \"I can't think of any brand as big as AOL that has come back.\" The challenge for Verizon Media is to emerge from the shadow of Google and Facebook's dominance of online advertising and contribute more than a pittance in revenue for Verizon. Just 18 months ago, Verizon was more eager to devote time to talking about the media division at analyst days, but that has tapered off in recent months, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst who covers Verizon at New Street Research. \"It's not on that level in their discussions with investors at all, not even close,\" he said. Verizon must commit to buying better-performing media assets if it wants to be successful, but it would risk disappointing investors who prefer it focus on wireless, he added. Focusing on e-commerce and increasing subscription revenue, while considered a fashionable strategy for media businesses right now, also puts it on a collision course with Amazon.com Inc, Brown said. Verizon Media's strategy is generating some confidence from advertisers. A source familiar with the business said Verizon Media doubled the number of large multi-quarter deals it signed with advertisers during the upfront sales period this summer compared to a year ago. Gowrappan said Verizon Media's biggest mistake in the past was operating the individual brands independently, but the brands have since been brought closer together.

Voraussetzung f\u00fcr die Erfolgsgeschichte waren neue technische Rahmenbedingungen. Massive Leistungssteigerungen in der Softwareentwicklung, die Omnipr\u00e4senz des Internets und die Allgegenwart von Smartphones haben es erm\u00f6glicht, Konsumenten immer komfortablere Kundenerlebnisse zu bieten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In einem solchen Kontext k\u00f6nnen Start-ups ihre Vorteile ausspielen. Mit einem frischen Blick von au\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen sie mit neuesten Technologien innovative L\u00f6sungen entwickeln, die so vorher nicht m\u00f6glich waren.</p><p>Was aber machen Unternehmen, deren Angebot das Resultat einer jahrzehntelangen, teilweise sogar Jahrhunderte zur\u00fcckreichenden Entwicklung ist, durch die ein breitgef\u00e4chertes Produktportfolio f\u00fcr differenzierte Zielgruppen entstanden ist? Um relevant zu bleiben, m\u00fcssen sich auch etablierte Unternehmen neuen Technologien \u00f6ffnen und technische Innovationen in ihre Gesch\u00e4ftsprozesse integrieren. Wie stellt sich diese Entwicklung f\u00fcr die Kunden von Banken und Versicherungen dar?</p><p>Einen Schritt voraus</p><p>Bei Amazon erfolgt der Vorgang des Bezahlens an die H\u00e4ndler l\u00e4ngst unsichtbar f\u00fcr Endkunden. Apple hat mitApple Pay das iPhone zum Bezahlmittel gemacht. Google bietet ein digitales Wallet und Facebook einen Token. Warum erh\u00f6hen nicht auch Banken die Geschwindigkeit in Richtung End-to-End-Digitalisierung? Warum digitalisieren sie ihre Prozesse nicht viel schneller?</p><p>Der Hauptgrund ist, dass die Finanzindustrie vor h\u00f6heren H\u00fcrden bei der Digitalisierung steht als manche anderen Industrien, beispielsweise Branchen, aus denen Tech-Riesen hervorgegangen sind. Nehmen wir den Handel beziehungsweise E-Commerce: Ein falsch geliefertes Paar Schuhe kann der Kunde einfach neu bestellen. An die F\u00fchrung seines Bankkontos hingegen oder an die Auszahlung einer Versicherung legt er einen ungleich h\u00f6heren Ma\u00dfstab an. Der Saldo muss jederzeit korrekt sein, und die Ermittlung des Versicherungsanspruchs muss auf Anhieb stimmen.</p><p>Unternehmen wie die GAFA konnten mit einfacheren Produkten ins Endkundengesch\u00e4ft einsteigen und ihre Technologiekompetenz aufbauen, bevor dies f\u00fcr regulierte Institute \u00fcberhaupt ein Thema war. Bemerkenswert ist jedoch auch dieser Punkt: Keiner der Tech-Riesen hat eine Bank gegr\u00fcndet. Das mag jedoch auch an den relativ geringen Margen bei hohem Kapitaleinsatz im prim\u00e4ren Finanzgesch\u00e4ft liegen.</p><p>Hohe Erwartungen</p><p>Banken waren im vergangenen Jahrhundert noch f\u00fchrend bei Technologieinvestments. Ein Meilenstein war der Austausch der Karteikarten am Backend durch moderne Server. (COBOL-Software von damals, aus der Zeit der ersten Mondlandung, wird auf manchen Servern \u00fcbrigens immer noch genutzt.) W\u00e4hrenddessen war am Frontend der Kontaktpunkt mit den Kunden weiterhin die Filiale mit dem pers\u00f6nlichen Ansprechpartner. Bei Versicherungen \u00fcbernahm der Versicherungsvertreter oder -vermittler diese Rolle.</p><p>Mit der rasanten technischen Entwicklung der vergangenen Jahre und Jahrzehnte haben sich die Anspr\u00fcche der Kunden an die Kommunikation mit Banken und Versicherungen jedoch nachhaltig ge\u00e4ndert. Heute erwarten Kunden ein vollumf\u00e4ngliches digitales Angebot. Komfortabel von der Couch aus die Finanzen erledigen wie beim Shopping, lautet die Devise. W\u00e4hrend dieser Wunsch nur allzu gut verst\u00e4ndlich ist, ist seine Verwirklichung mit vielen technischen Herausforderungen verkn\u00fcpft, nicht nur am Frontend, sondern auch am Backend.</p><p>Marken mit Vertrauensvorschuss</p><p>Die Anzeige eines Bankkontos im Browser oder in einer App ist noch verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig einfach. Viele andere Aufgaben hingegen sind komplexer. Kontoer\u00f6ffnung, Versicherungsabschluss, Kreditantrag oder Schadensmeldung beispielsweise ber\u00fchren wesentlich tiefergehende bestehende Prozesse, die oft manuelles Eingreifen erfordern. Aus regulatorischen Gr\u00fcnden muss die Identit\u00e4t des Kunden \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden. Sicherheitsstandards sind zu befolgen, und das allgemeinrechtliche Schriftformerfordernis ist zu beachten. Was folgt daraus f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung der Prozesse?</p><p>Hohe H\u00fcrden</p><p>Damit der Kunde in einer App einen Vorgang starten kann, muss der dadurch aufgerufene Prozess zuvor analysiert, \u00fcberdacht und umgebaut werden. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel einen Versicherungsschaden. F\u00fcr die Schadensbearbeitung unterhalten Versicherungsunternehmen Abteilungen, bei denen Kunden \u00fcber ein Web-Portal oder eine App ihre Briefe, Faxe, E-Mails und Dokumente einreichen. Die eingereichten Dokumente werden je nach Eingangsvariante digital vorsortiert oder gescannt, m\u00fcssen anschlie\u00dfend jedoch gro\u00dfenteils immer noch manuell weiterbearbeitet werden.</p><p>Um die Bearbeitung oder sogar die Entscheidung zu automatisieren, m\u00fcssen alle relevanten Daten strukturiert in digitaler Form vorliegen. Der urspr\u00fcngliche Prozess muss daf\u00fcr auf den Kopf gestellt werden. Nicht mehr der Sachbearbeiter des Versicherungsunternehmens, sondern der Kunde muss die Daten eingeben und \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Das machen Kunden auch, jedoch nur dann, wenn dieser Vorgang einfacher ist, als zum Telefon zu greifen und oder eine E-Mail zu schicken.</p><p>Die H\u00fcrde bei der Umstellung ist also hoch: Nur wenn der Kunde wei\u00df, dass Dateneingabe und \u00dcbermittlung einfach, schnell und fehlerfrei erfolgen, nutzt er den digitalen Kanal. Seine Bereitschaft, dies zu tun, \u00e4ndert sich erfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df bereits dann, wenn er nach der Nutzung eine R\u00fcckfrage von der Versicherung erh\u00e4lt, etwa per E-Mail. In diesem Falle ignoriert er das digitale Angebot beim n\u00e4chsten Mal wahrscheinlich und schickt stattdessen eine E-Mail oder sogar einen Brief.</p><p>Hohes Gut</p><p>Die ersten Produkte sind bereits so digitalisiert, dass Kunden sie in zunehmendem Ma\u00dfe nutzen: Foto\u00fcberweisungen mit Smartphones, Einreichung von Arztrechnungen zur Erstattung und Online-Brokerage unterwegs. In der n\u00e4chsten Phase k\u00f6nnen wir die Digitalisierung komplexerer Vorg\u00e4nge wie Kreditantrag, Immobilienfinanzierung oder Kfz-Schadensabwicklung erwarten.</p><p>Auch in dieser neuen Phase haben viele Banken und Versicherungen einen Vorteil im Vergleich zu gro\u00dfen Tech-Unternehmen: eine Marke mit Vertrauensvorschuss f\u00fcr den eigenen Kompetenzbereich und eine breitgef\u00e4cherte Produktpalette - ein hohes Gut.</p><p>K\u00f6nnen Unternehmen wie die GAFA schneller eine Bank aufbauen, als Banken digitale Kundenerlebnisse entwickeln? Wahrscheinlich nicht. In einem vertikalen Markt eine Marke aufzubauen dauert l\u00e4nger als digitale, kundenfreundliche Prozesse einzuf\u00fchren.</p><p>Mehr zum Thema</p><p>Schneller, preiswerter und bequemer sollen Insurtechs Versicherungen f\u00fcr Kunden machen. Doch nicht alle Versprechen k\u00f6nnen die digitalen Start-ups schon halten. Ein Check in sieben Schritten.

Each of the laws vary in some manner, with some states focusing on narrow privacy issues like biometrics, and other states, like California, pushing more comprehensive regulation that approaches the same scope as the EU\u2019s wide-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Vermont, the state passed the Data Broker Legislation in 2018, which went into effect at the start of 2019. The law generally applies only to data brokers\u2014third-party companies that collect and sell data on consumers\u2014and carves out a large exemption for any type of consumer-facing business, like retailers, or organizations like charity groups.\u00a0 At the time of writing, 143 businesses have registered with Vermont.</p><p>Ryan Kriger, an assistant attorney general for the state, said the idea for the legislation stemmed from both a lack of knowledge about the data broker industry and concerns about consumer protection.</p><p>\u201cWe know very little about this industry and we know very little about these players,\u201d Kriger said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do something that introduces a little more sunlight into this industry, which is notoriously known for its opacity?\u201d</p><p>The law narrowly defines data brokers as businesses that collect and sell data to third parties but don\u2019t have a direct relationship with a consumer. That means publishers, retail brands or tech platforms with direct consumer relationships aren\u2019t beholden to the law; neither are businesses that collect and buy data but don\u2019t sell it. Businesses that buy data but don\u2019t resell that data, like insurance companies, do not qualify as data brokers under Vermont\u2019s law.</p><p>The law also only applies to data brokers that have information on residents of Vermont.</p><p>Data brokers that do qualify under all of these parameters must register with Vermont\u2019s Secretary of State and disclose whether or not they allow consumers to opt out of being a part the data broker\u2019s databases, \u201ccertain sales of data,\u201d or the collection of \u201cbrokered personal information.\u201d If a data broker does not allow consumers to do so, it must say so in the registry.</p><p>Under the law, data brokers must register annually with the state, which includes paying a $100 fee. Additionally, data brokers must adopt the necessary means to keep data safe, and they are required to disclose any data breaches, including how many consumers were affected. Data brokers can\u2019t use data to harass someone, discriminate or obtain data through fraudulent means. Lastly, credit reporting agencies must allow consumers to freeze their credit for free.</p><p>Because of the way Vermont defines data brokers, the state law doesn\u2019t affect large tech platforms like Google or Facebook, nor does it affect big consumer-facing brands. The law also does not apply to publishers that maintain direct relationships with consumers.</p><p>However, some brands that provide data to fuel targeted advertising and marketing, like the database management companies Acxiom (which IPG bought last year) and Oracle, are in Vermont\u2019s registry.</p><p>Kriger said he doesn\u2019t think the new law has had any major effects on businesses in Vermont other than encouraging businesses to adopt new policies like an opt-out clause in their terms. However, he\u2019s heard from some types of companies\u2014such as businesses that provide background checks\u2014about the impact of the bill on their businesses. In those cases,\u00a0 the attorney general\u2019s office tries to help \u201creason their way through the law\u201d without giving legal advice.</p><p>The Office of the Attorney General started thinking about these privacy issues back in 2017 before the massive Equifax breach and Cambridge Analytica scandals. The attorney general\u2019s office intentionally chose to focus narrowly on data brokers to help shed light on how the industry works instead of trying to regulate an \u201centire economy,\u201d Kriger said.</p><p>Kriger said that while it\u2019s relatively easy for consumers not to do business with a consumer-facing brand if they don\u2019t like their policies. there was \u201cno way for the market to correct bad behavior\u201d from data brokers. And unlike in the case of big tech platforms that provide free products or services in exchange for consumer data, data brokers are \u201ccollecting your data for their own profit\u201d without providing additional services, he said.</p><p>Joe Jerome, policy counsel for the privacy and data project at the Center of Democracy and Technology, said the law, which is a \u201cbasic transparency measure,\u201d is a net positive and has already uncovered some bad actors. It also falls into line with many of the recommendations put forth in an FTC report from 2014.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is an industry that despite whatever it says has serious transparency issues,\u201d Jerome said. \u201cVermont should be applauded for bringing this industry into the light.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1065424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY5-1WT1-DYRK-H4FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said recently that Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple should be split up to increase competition. Some experts now say the companies are in for an extended rough period. One money manager explained to Business Insider why he stopped buying those four stocks entirely. With Big Tech squarely in the government's crosshairs, some on Wall Street think that years of pain are coming for social media companies like Facebook[1] and other longtime market favorites like Google[2]. Pressure on such firms has been ratcheted up following Senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren's recent calls to break up Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google[3]. Other candidates are likely to go after the companies as well, leading to new regulations that these experts say could send costs climbing and drive down their profit margins and stock multiples. \"When government regulation starts to look at a sector, it just looks at the biggest ones,\" Michael Antonelli, a market strategist at $130 billion Robert W. Baird Private Wealth Management, told Business Insider by phone.\"These stocks are going to have very, very severe headwinds.\" The current situation in mega-cap tech reminds experts like Antonelli ofthe antitrust issues that Microsoft faced[4]from 1998 to 2001. The software giant was accused by the Department of Justice of holding a monopoly and engaging in anti-competitive practices. A judge initially ruled that Microsoft be broken into two separate entities, and only after a long appeal process did the company finally reach a more palatable settlement. But Microsoft's stock struggled for years, failing to surpass its early-2000 peak until 2016.

It was their dangerous lending and investing behavior that absorbed much of the blame after the economic meltdown. Some big-name bank stocks still haven't fully recovered their losses from that period. Even after the crisis ended, tighter regulations restricted their growth for years. This pessimism carries potentially grave implications for the stocks market. After all, the four giant companies targeted by Warren are among the market's biggest winners over the decadelong bull market[7]. But while Warren is singling them out because of their size and reach, Stifel Nicolaus money manager Chad Morganlander says other tech companies are also in trouble. Morganlander is specifically referring to other social media stocks like Snap[8] and Twitter[9], which he says might struggle as both the government and the general public get more critical of how the companies gather and handle their personal data[10]. \"The consumer backlash as well as regulatory backlash could create intermediate to long term headwinds for many of the social media platforms,\" Morganlander, who oversees a $2.5 billion portfolio, told Business Insider. He said he's avoiding those stocks because investors are projecting years of strong profit margins that may not come to fruition. If new regulations force them to get more active in moderating potentially harmful content, those expectations might become very hard to reach, Morganlander said. Read more: We spoke to 2 veteran economists about how they survived the last 30 years of financial crises \u2014 and they explained why Wall Street millennials are ill-prepared to handle the next one[11] Jessica Melugin[12], associate director of the center for technology and innovation at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, said intervention by the government will frighten potential investors and reduce earnings. Since profit growth[13] has been the foremost driver of stock gains over the past 10 years, that could spell bad news for the overall market. \"Innovating for consumers drives profits in the marketplace,\" she wrote by email. \"When you displace the profit motive with other sociopolitical goals, like helping smaller competitors, innovations for consumers will slow.\" Stepping outside the social media realm, Morganlander also argues thatGoogle and other companies that traffic in user data will also have to make some big adjustments. \"The good old times of gathering personal information and selling it to third parties, I think, is in the latter innings,\" he said. \"Eventually either business is going to make a responsible decision or regulators will make that decision for them.\" Amid the worrying comparisons, Morganlander and Antonelli say investors should consider rotating out of the industry into less scrutinized areas. In fact, they think that might actually be a positive thing for the broader market. \"They face stronger headwinds than restaurants or software or any of these other kinds of places investors can go,\" Antonelli said.NOW WATCH: Elon Musk sent a $100K Tesla Roadster to space a year ago.

The EU competition commissioner, who will be promoted to vice-president of the incoming commission in charge of digital policy, is contemplating a new move against digital market abuse. In future, large internet companies accused of anti-competitive behaviour may find the burden of proof is on them to show their conduct benefits consumers, rather than on authorities to prove harm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What does the commission gain from such a policy change? One obvious answer is speed. Ms Vestager 'is doing it to show we can have smart regulation, meaning that you can be fast enough to act upon market cases that require immediate action', says Francesca Bria, a digital policy adviser to the UN and the commission. 'This makes a lot of sense. If you intervene too late you do not have the tools to enforce your regulation and the problem may have moved somewhere else.'</p><p>The policy would dovetail with Ms Vestager's revival of so-called interim measures to stop alleged market abuse during an investigation. That was a 'very welcome' decision, says Thomas Philippon, a New York University finance professor and author of a book arguing Europe's antitrust policy has overtaken America's. 'There is no presumption that the company is right or wrong, but when there is uncertainty and time is of the essence then it's appropriate for regulators to have this instrument . . . the burden of proof argument is very similar in spirit.'</p><p>Requiring tech companies to show how their behaviour benefits users may have consequences beyond mere speed.</p><p>It could address what Ms Bria calls a 'very strong paradox' - that other industries, such as 'Big Pharma or telecoms or big monopolies', share data with authorities 'for competition inquiries and analysis' whereas 'Big Tech [companies] are sitting on big amounts of data' but resist sharing it.</p><p>Greater access to data that the new policy would facilitate could help regulators examine whether the law is respected in matters beyond market abuse, such as privacy. Privacy and competition 'are very intimately linked,' according to Ms Bria, 'but until now not much has happened because regulators and competition economists do not have the tools or the ability to analyse the situation'.</p><p>Ms Vestager's latest move to take on Big Tech 'fits exactly' a bigger picture of how Europe and the US have taken different regulatory paths since the 1990s, says Mr Philippon. Antitrust ideas that were shared across the Atlantic and 'partly originated from the US' were 'set in stone' in European law and institutions, Mr Philippon says, 'with regulators in charge of upholding these rules and strong enough to resist lobbies . . . The irony is that we [the Europeans] did it because we did not trust each other very much, so we did not want a weak regulator in Brussels that could be swayed by a big country'.</p><p>The US went in the opposite direction. Mr Philippon says there was a 'change in the ideology of antitrust' represented by the 'Chicago School' view that new challengers to established firms would keep monopolists in check. That was true in the 1970s and 1980s, Mr Philippon has found, but is no longer true today. 'Then [there was] a gigantic increase in lobbying and political expenditure . . . It's basically corruption, to not put too fine a point on it.'</p><p>There are worries that European regulation can stifle innovation. But Ms Bria argues that 'if you regulate and also have a vision, and you invest in that vision, then the innovators can dare' take risks. Europe's strong backlash against privacy breaches has fostered the 'biggest ecosystem for distributed ledger technology', such as blockchain networks, she says.

The EU competition commissioner, who will be promoted to vice-president of the incoming commission in charge of digital policy, is contemplating a new move against digital market abuse. In future, large internet companies accused of anti-competitive behaviour may find the burden of proof is on them to show their conduct benefits consumers, rather than on authorities to prove harm.</p><p>What does the commission gain from such a policy change? One obvious answer is speed. Ms Vestager \u201cis doing it to show we can have smart regulation, meaning that you can be fast enough to act upon market cases that require immediate action\u201d, says Francesca Bria, a digital policy adviser to the UN and the commission. \u201cThis makes a lot of sense. If you intervene too late you do not have the tools to enforce your regulation and the problem may have moved somewhere else.\u201d </p><p>The policy would dovetail with Ms Vestager\u2019s revival of so-called interim measures to stop alleged market abuse during an investigation. That was a \u201cvery welcome\u201d decision, says Thomas Philippon, a New York University finance professor and author of a book arguing Europe\u2019s antitrust policy has overtaken America\u2019s. \u201cThere is no presumption that the company is right or wrong, but when there is uncertainty and time is of the essence then it\u2019s appropriate for regulators to have this instrument\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the burden of proof argument is very similar in spirit.\u201d</p><p>Requiring tech companies to show how their behaviour benefits users may have consequences beyond mere speed.</p><p>It could address what Ms Bria calls a \u201cvery strong paradox\u201d \u2014 that other industries, such as \u201cBig Pharma or telecoms or big monopolies\u201d, share data with authorities \u201cfor competition inquiries and analysis\u201d whereas \u201cBig Tech [companies] are sitting on big amounts of data\u201d but resist sharing it.</p><p>Greater access to data that the new policy would facilitate could help regulators examine whether the law is respected in matters beyond market abuse, such as privacy. Privacy and competition \u201care very intimately linked,\u201d according to Ms Bria, \u201cbut until now not much has happened because regulators and competition economists do not have the tools or the ability to analyse the situation\u201d.</p><p>Ms Vestager\u2019s latest move to take on Big Tech \u201cfits exactly\u201d a bigger picture of how Europe and the US have taken different regulatory paths since the 1990s, says Mr Philippon. Antitrust ideas that were shared across the Atlantic and \u201cpartly originated from the US\u201d were \u201cset in stone\u201d in European law and institutions, Mr Philippon says, \u201cwith regulators in charge of upholding these rules and strong enough to resist lobbies\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The irony is that we [the Europeans] did it because we did not trust each other very much, so we did not want a weak regulator in Brussels that could be swayed by a big country\u201d.</p><p>The US went in the opposite direction. Mr Philippon says there was a \u201cchange in the ideology of antitrust\u201d represented by the \u201cChicago School\u201d view that new challengers to established firms would keep monopolists in check. That was true in the 1970s and 1980s, Mr Philippon has found, but is no longer true today. \u201cThen [there was] a gigantic increase in lobbying and political expenditure\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It\u2019s basically corruption, to not put too fine a point on it.\u201d</p><p>There are worries that European regulation can stifle innovation. But Ms Bria argues that \u201cif you regulate and also have a vision, and you invest in that vision, then the innovators can dare\u201d take risks. Europe\u2019s strong backlash against privacy breaches has fostered the \u201cbiggest ecosystem for distributed ledger technology\u201d, such as blockchain networks, she says. \u201cCryptography [technology to keep confidential data secure] could be the next innovation wave\u201d for the same reason.</p><p>Ms Vestager\u2019s aggressive approach \u201cis not just regulation, but our competitive advantage,\u201d Ms Bria says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f4692462fc9211e998fd4d6c20050229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDY-TJW1-DXP9-91YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 4, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Minimum Speeds</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Q3MDgzQUIxOTYwNDE4QTlDOEExQkY2OTE2N0QyOUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzgxNEM2ODkxNDU4NEExOTk4OTUyNjdGODkzRDc4OUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

Vestager also noted that the Commission would have to keep an eye on attempts from large platforms to clamp down on the ability of customers to switch their allegiances over to rival services, a practice known as \"multi-homing.\"</p><p>Vestager's comments came come as she continues to stake her claim for the next President of the European Commission, with a particular attention to competition policy within the digital economy - a subject very much 'in vogue' at the moment.</p><h/><p>Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager made a suggestion at\u00a0the re:publica conference in Berlin:\u00a0\"Access to data has to be redesigned so that newcomers can compete with big tech giants\".\u00a0 In a discussion with EURACTIV, she also drew parallels with a recent complaint by Spotify and similar lawsuits.\u00a0EURACTIV Germany reports.</p><p>Across the Atlantic, US counterparts are stepping up their scrutiny of the larger tech platforms, as congress hones in on the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon with an antitrust investigation amazing \"anti-competitive products\" with the\u00a0Department of Justice moderating investigations into Alphabet's Google and Apple, while the Department of Justice will oversee a probe into Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>In reference to the authority that the tech giants have garnered through their practices, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\u00a0Jerrold Nadler said in a statement that \"there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications.\"</p><p>Antitrust subcommittee ranking member\u00a0Jim Sensenbrenner added that US lawmakers \"must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition.\"</p><p>For the EU's part, Vestager believes that there are areas outside competition policy in which the EU can flex its muscles.</p><p>Referring to the recently adopted\u00a0platform-to-business regulation (P2B), which\u00a0obliges online platforms to be transparent in their business practices when dealing with firms, she said the regulation \"could be a useful model, to tackle other problems which the platform economy creates.\"</p><p>Under the rules, online businesses should justify when they decide to terminate business relations and are required to disclose how businesses are ranked on their platforms. The measures will impact a range of\u00a0platforms that use ranking structures in their user-interfaces, such as Airbnb, the Apple App\u00a0Store, and Booking.com.</p><p>The plans are an example of how the EU may seek to readdress competition imbalances under Vestager's leadership - with more of an emphasis on regulatory reform rather than the distribution of heavy fines for unfair practices.</p><p>\"The power that dominant companies have, to set the rules that govern how our markets work, has to come with a responsibility, too,\" Vestager said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1346896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-R6K1-DYXB-V17W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ALDE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Commission president</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Digital</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>digital economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DigitalSingleMarket</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DSM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Margarethe Vestager</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vestager</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The company has forged a reputation of late for putting its hardware products further out of reach of the masses, while placing its services at the more affordable end of the spectrum. Soon we'll see the debut of its gaming and TV streaming platforms with original content to rival Netflix and Fortnite, as it seeks to combat the global slowdown in smartphone sales by cashing in on the rise of binge-watching. </p><p>But will that be enough to ensure a smooth journey in the years ahead for Apple? Yesterday, Margrethe Vestager, the EU's pitbull in the era of tech powerhouses, was given a second run as chief competition commissioner - except, this time, with superpowers. Now also the vice president for EU digital affairs, she'll have the ability to expand her reach outside of the antitrust arena and into\u2026 well, we're not quite sure yet. Vestager has often complained of rampant problems in the digital sector that go beyond competition; the spread of fake news, issues around corporation tax and a lack of press freedom among them. In a newly-created role with an evolving mandate that some are framing as the EU's \"supercommissioner\", it's safe to say Big Tech should be scared. Known to many as the EU's strongarm on Silicon Valley, Vestager has certainly made a name for herself. She's levied billions of euros of fines against Google, launched a major investigation into Amazon and could soon be probing Facebook's new cryptocurrency Libra. And that's not even factoring in the (EURO)13bn (\u00a311.6bn) in back taxes she ordered Apple to repay to Dublin authorities last year, in an unorthodox approach to state aid law that no one saw coming. US President Donald Trump got so riled at \"the tax lady\" that he petitioned his country's authorities to take a copycat approach - hitting Facebook with a $5bn (\u00a34bn) fine earlier this summer, and a 50-state joint investigation into Google by the attorneys general announced this week. But where does this leave the UK? In a post-Brexit world, Vestager's long reach could set a precedent. However, the Competition and Markets Authority can impose fines only on a company's UK assets, and with a new tech watchdog on the horizon, its place in a digital-dominant world is uncertain. Yet another decision for the government will be how the UK positions itself as regulators and politicians in Brussels and Washington escalate their power battle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-152812199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-5HT1-JCBW-N09S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

Margrethe Vestager said the European Commission would be looking at \"a...</p><p>Europe's antitrust chief warned of possible changes to EU tax law this afternoon after Apple was handed a victory in its historic legal battle over \u20ac13bn (\u00a311.8bn) in alleged state aid.   Margrethe Vestager said the European Commission would be looking at \"aggressive tax planning measures under EU state aid rules to assess whether they result in illegal state aid\".\" enforcement needs to go hand in hand with a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency,\" she said.  Ms Vestager has taken a tough line on Big Tech whilst in her EU post, with the latest court ruling seen as a significant blow to her ambitions.   The case kicked off six years ago when the Commission first launched a probe into tax decisions by member states. In 2016, the Commission issued an order against Apple to pay back \u20ac13bn in taxes to Ireland.At the time, Ms Vestager had claimed that Apple was paying so little tax on its operations in Ireland that it amounted to illegal state aid. The commission alleged that Ireland allowed Apple to pay effectively less than 1pc in corporate taxes through a \"sweetheart tax deal.\"  The order was appealed by both Ireland and Apple, whose boss Tim Cook called it \"total political crap\".   The EU's General Court, Europe's second highest court, has now ruled that it was wrong for the Commission to declare tax rulings had been granted for \"selective economic advantage and, by extension, state aid\".  A spokesman for Apple said: \"We thank the General Court for their time and consideration of the facts. We are pleased they have annulled the Commission\u2019s case.\"   It will also be seen as a victory by Dublin, which has been seeking to protect its low-tax regime that attracts major technology firms including Apple. Around 6,000 Apple staff work in Ireland.   In many cases, multinationals can pay taxes on the bulk of their revenue across the EU's 27 countries in the one EU country where they have their regional headquarters. For Apple and many other big tech companies, that is Ireland.  For small EU countries like Ireland, that helps attract international business and even a small amount of tax revenue is helpful for them.   Irish officials had argued that their tax rules did not violate European or Irish laws and branded the order as \"fundamentally flawed\".This latest defeat for Ms Vestager could weaken or delay pending cases against Ikea's and Nike's deals with the Netherlands, as well as Huhtamaki's agreement with Luxembourg.  Ms Vestager, who has made the tax crackdown a centrepiece of her time in office, saw the same court last year overturn her demand for Starbucks to pay up to \u20ac30m in Dutch back taxes.  Tove Maria Ryding, tax justice coordinator at Eurodad, said: \u201cToday\u2019s court decision illustrates how difficult it is to use EU state aid rules to collect tax. If we had a proper corporate tax system, we wouldn\u2019t need long court cases to find out whether it is legal for multinational corporations to pay less than 1pc in taxes.\"  The EU is expected to appeal the latest decision at the highest court, although the European Commission refused to answer questions on its next move at a press conference for fairer corporate taxation, instead insisting it would make a decision after studying the judgment in more detail. EU officials, however, expressed disappointment on the court ruling, with German MEP Sven Giegold, an influential lawmaker on financial regulation, saying it was a \"bitter setback in the fight against tax dumping in Europe\".  \"This must be a wakeup call for the Commission and Council to step up tax legislation. The EU urgently needs minimum effective tax rates, a common and consolidated corporate tax base, and public tax transparency.\u201d  It comes as tensions between the US and Europe escalate, with Washington just weeks earlier said to have pulled talks with European leaders over new global tax rules.  Previously the EU has blocked the US from helping Apple fight the state aid case, saying it had not shown it had a direct interest in the result.  The Commission's stance on Big Tech is set to be tested again on Thursday, when the EU's top court rules on whether it is illegal for tech firms to be transferring data over to the US.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42605128794</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C7-D5N1-F07F-82RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

In 2016, the Commission issued an order against Apple to pay back (EURO)13bn in taxes to Ireland.</p><p>At the time, Ms Vestager had claimed that Apple was paying so little tax on its operations in Ireland that it amounted to illegal state aid. The commission alleged that Ireland allowed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/17/apple-claims-11bn-eu-fine-defies-reality-common-sense-landmark/\">Apple</url>to pay effectively less than 1pc in corporate taxes through a \"sweetheart tax deal.\"</p><p>The order was appealed by both Ireland and Apple, whose boss Tim Cook called it \"total political crap\". </p><p>The EU's General Court, Europe's second highest court, has now ruled that it was wrong for the Commission to declare tax rulings had been granted for \"selective economic advantage and, by extension, state aid\".</p><p>A spokesman for Apple said: \"We thank the General Court for their time and consideration of the facts. We are pleased they have annulled the Commission's case.\" </p><p>It will also be seen as a victory by Dublin, which has been seeking to protect its low-tax regime that attracts major technology firms including Apple. Around 6,000 Apple staff work in Ireland. </p><p>In many cases, multinationals can pay taxes on the bulk of their revenue across the EU's 27 countries in the one EU country where they have their regional headquarters. For Apple and many other big tech companies, that is Ireland.</p><p>For small EU countries like Ireland, that helps attract international business and even a small amount of tax revenue is helpful for them. </p><p>Irish officials had argued that their tax rules did not violate European or Irish laws and branded the order as \"fundamentally flawed\".</p><p>This latest defeat for Ms <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/09/17/apple-claims-11bn-eu-fine-defies-reality-common-sense-landmark/\">Vestager</url>could weaken or delay pending cases against Ikea's and Nike's deals with the Netherlands, as well as Huhtamaki's agreement with Luxembourg.</p><p>Ms Vestager, who has made the tax crackdown a centrepiece of her time in office, saw the same court last year overturn her demand for Starbucks to pay up to (EURO)30m in Dutch back taxes.</p><p>Tove Maria Ryding, tax justice coordinator at Eurodad, said: \"Today's court decision illustrates how difficult it is to use EU state aid rules to collect tax. If we had a proper corporate tax system, we wouldn't need long court cases to find out whether it is legal for multinational corporations to pay less than 1pc in taxes.\"</p><p>The EU is expected to appeal the latest decision at the highest court, although the European Commission refused to answer questions on its next move at a press conference for fairer corporate taxation, instead insisting it would make a decision after studying the judgment in more detail. </p><p>EU officials, however, expressed disappointment on the court ruling, with German MEP Sven Giegold, an influential lawmaker on financial regulation, saying it was a \"bitter setback in the fight against tax dumping in Europe\".</p><p>\"This must be a wakeup call for the Commission and Council to step up tax legislation. The EU urgently needs minimum effective tax rates, a common and consolidated corporate tax base, and public tax transparency.\"</p><p>It comes as tensions between the US and Europe escalate, with Washington just weeks earlier said to have pulled talks with European leaders over new global tax rules.</p><p>Previously the EU has blocked the US from helping Apple fight the state aid case, saying it had not shown it had a direct interest in the result.</p><p>The Commission's stance on Big Tech is set to be tested again on Thursday, when the EU's top court rules on whether it is illegal for tech firms to be transferring data over to the US. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64442753</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C3-0W31-F021-6068-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><timeReceived>10:11 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, June 4th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning. President Trump's historic U.K. visit, day two. He's meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May right now. And in the next hour they will be holding a joint news conference. We're going to take you there live to London for that news conference at 8:45 a.m.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're watching trade this morning, a lot of focus there. President Trump could face a rebuke from his own party over the tariffs potentially on Mexico as the country considers retaliation. Meanwhile the administration is defending its stance on China as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Joe Biden unveiling his energy platform. The details on that plan that would go well beyond President Obama's policies on energy.</p><p>a bit of a tech wreck going on on Wall Street. We're seeing the stocks bounce from real big losses yesterday. New regulatory concerns putting pressure on major names in the sector. Facebook yesterday down 7.5 percent. The parent of Google, Alphabet down better than 6 percent. The Nasdaq sliding into correction territory in fact.</p><p>We're taking a look at a rebound on Wall Street. This morning stocks are bouncing, take a look. Dow Industrials up right now 106 points, that's one half of 1 percent. The S&amp;P was up 11. And the Nasdaq this morning right now up 31 points after stocks were little changed except for the Nasdaq yesterday.</p><p>Industrial average was up just 4 points at the close yesterday. The S&amp;P was down 7. But the Nasdaq, look at that hit that it took as a result of the weakness in tech, down 120 points yesterday at 4:00 on Wall Street, one and two thirds percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are fractionally better on the morning. The FT100 is up 10 points. The CAC 40 in Paris is up 4 points. And the DAX index in Germany up 95. That's almost 1 percent</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower. As you see, the worst performer was China. Shanghai composite down about 1 percent.</p><p>Brady's trademark fight -- the Patriots' quarterback thinks the phrase \"Tom Terrific\" belongs to him. But one sports franchise well, has other ideas. We have the details coming up on that.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the Wall Street Journal's global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Fox News contributor, columnist at \"The Hill\" Liz Peek. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Nice to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL EOCNOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to hear from Jay Powell at about a five to 10:00 or so this morning, at the conference in Chicago.</p><p>We just had some retail earnings out. There was a miss on Tiffany and it looks Land's End's was better than expected. We saw those on the screen. So very much a bifurcated retail sector continues.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Consumers ought to be doing ok in this environment. Unemployment is very low. Inflation is very low. Incomes are rising, wages are rising.</p><p>PEEK: And sentiment is great.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There's a lot of concern right now about how trade is going to affect the economy. Consumers ought to be a strong point.</p><p>You know, one of the other things I wanted to mention is we have jobs numbers coming out in a few days on Friday. I think that's going to be a big day for the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think we'll see a good number?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I'm looking out for what's happening in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing output has been -- was down a lot in the first quarter and we have to see if that's leading to layoffs. You know, manufacturing had a really good run of hiring. Has that lost its momentum?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The expectation on manufacturing jobs is an addition of 4,000 but the estimates are kind of all over the place, from down 4,000 to up 10,000. The overall expectation for jobs is 185,000 jobs added with the unemployment rate holding at 3.6 percent and most critically the 3.2 percent year over year income growth -- personal income growth.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right. And those would be excellent numbers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: If the numbers hit Wall Street's expectations it would be excellent. With these concerns about manufacturing, you know, you just have to look out for a negative number. Anything in the positive territory is good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- which is why we watch the purchasing managers' index. Even in China was seeing the purchasing managers' index has come in below 50.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Globally manufacturing is being hit by all this trade.</p><p>PEEK: You know, right now, the ISM and the United States is still looking at expansion. The rate of growth has certainly slowed but it's not going backwards -- you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's the lowest level since before President Trump was elected which was a little unnerving.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And if you look at the output numbers that the fed puts out, we had a contraction in manufacturing in three of the first four months of the year. So we have to keep an eye on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean really.</p><p>Coming up this morning, my exclusive interview with the CEO of Walmart, Doug McMillon joining us this morning, give us his take on trade and the impact on business and certainly the customer today, the retail consumer. Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here this morning, along with California Congressman John Garamendi. Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Allen West joining us as well; and Pedego Electric Bikes CEO Don DiCostanzo joining us this morning as well. We're going to check out the electric bikes coming.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it this morning.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour with this top story.</p><p>President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, the President sitting down with British Prime Minister Theresa May for a business breakfast this morning with business leaders. He highlighted the potential for a trade deal with Britain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think we'll have a very, very substantial trade deal. It would be a very fair deal. And I think that this is something that your folks want to do, my folks want to do and we want to do. And we're going to get it done.</p><p>I would just like to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job on behalf of the people of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President's visit being met with backlash, meanwhile. Thousands of protesters taking to the streets of London this morning.</p><p>Joining us right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the CEO of Duff &amp; Phelps Noah Gottdiener. And Noah -- it's great to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>NOAH GOTTDIENER, CEO, DUFF &amp; PHELPS: It's nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to everything going on this morning in London. We're about to hear from the President and the prime minister in news conference at 8:45.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Yes. Well, it's certainly fun to watch. I would say that what we're seeing with Brexit and trade wars is just -- this is just another manifestation of the geopolitical uncertainty and volatility in the world. And business leaders have to figure out how to navigate through that climate, which is something that we do at Duff &amp; Phelps.</p><p>So thinking about how do these things -- how does Brexit, how do trade wars affect the value of your business. Which is something that we advise companies on. Where should they raise money? How much should they raise? Those type of issues are of critical importance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One critical issue is obviously the tariffs and the trade situation where we are. We understand what's happening in terms of China because there are bigger issues there, could be national security issues, not just an economic story.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But putting tariffs on Mexico as a way to get the Mexicans to do something about the border wall, your reaction to that -- the border rather, stopping the migrants from coming in, as well as the impact overall on the economy.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Yes, listen. Again, I would just say it just heightens the level of geopolitical uncertainty. Volatility, that's the world that business leaders are living in right now. Mexico tariffs, no tariffs, who knows what's coming next. And how do you navigate through all that.</p><p>And what I'm advising our clients is to be diversified. To have businesses around the world to be prepared for economic downturn and there's no way of predicting what will come next.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There's a lot of talk this morning about some kind of trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. Now, we have London and New York which are two of the biggest financial centers in the world. Is there something in a trade deal that could particularly benefit the financial sector? You're in the financial sector -- that you're looking for.</p><p>Are you looking for something to come out of these talks that could really help New York and London as financial centers?</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Well, it's interesting. I mean, we just did a study, by the way, on what is the major financial center of the world. And it has flipped from London to New York and will probably flip back. So, you know, hard to say. But you know, New York and London will go back and forth on this and other cities are rising in importance as well.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And how is Shanghai doing in that, you know? So there's all this, you know, fighting between the U.S. and China about economic preeminence. Is Shanghai posing any kind of threat to the U.S. in financials?</p><p>GOTTDIENER: I would say one of the most interesting things that came out of the survey that we conducted was that many respondents said that Hong Kong may take that -- overtake both New York and London in the next five years. And other cities that have come up are shanghai was mentioned but Frankfurt has come up and Dublin which is another very interesting possibility has come up as well. We happen to have quite a few folks in Ireland, in anticipation of the rising importance of Dublin.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to remind people that today is the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre where pro-democracy protesters, students were massacred by the Chinese government.</p><p>PEEK: And Hong King was -- right. By the minute.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I just wanted to remind people when they question why President Trump is finally trying to take on the malfeasance and misbehavior of China, this is the kind of mentality that you are dealing with.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the Chinese will not know anything about that 30-year anniversary. There won't be any information flow whatsoever. They will cut off Google. And Google has operated there with the understanding that their info and their flow of information will be censored.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>HILSENRATH: One of the ideas of 30 years of U.S. policy towards China was that if we engage them economically they would develop, you know, humans rights and democracy and it hasn't happened. And the President is saying well, you know, we have to come up with a new strategy.</p><p>PEEK: I have a question for you.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Sure.</p><p>PEEK: As you have been advising companies and they were looking at the possibility of Brexit, I don't -- I think companies were sort of moving operations to Germany, to France. If there is --</p><p>GOTTDIENER: And Ireland.</p><p>PEEK: -- and Ireland.</p><p>If there is a hard Brexit, if we actually see them tumble out of the E.U., are companies going to be really that much affected? Or are they sort of in a defensive position now to accommodate that?</p><p>GOTTDIENER: I think a lot of companies have been preparing for quite a while for Brexit one way or another, hard or not. So I think it's kind of happened already in anticipation.</p><p>PEEK: So President Trump has gone over there with a very aggressive message, which is I wouldn't pay the E.U. this $49 billion or whatever it is. I would just take the chance and get out of the thing and do a deal. I mean if you were Theresa May or if you were -- forget Theresa May -- if you were the incoming government, would you begin to sort of walk that path?</p><p>GOTTDIENER: I'm not sure -- I'm just not sure the incoming government has much of a choice at this point.</p><p>PEEK: Yes. Perhaps not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In terms of the broad issues that this market is focusing on, it's obviously trade, it's also technology.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Silicon Valley under the microscope. We want to talk about the biggest names in tech, they got slammed yesterday on Wall Street.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at these names down 7 percent, 6 percent amid a regulatory threat. Congress, the Justice Department and the FTC, federal trade commission all setting their sights on the industry's largest companies, Facebook and Google. Your reaction?</p><p>Are we going to see a different regulatory environment these companies face?</p><p>GOTTDIENER: We will, for sure. And I would say that the issues facing big tech are so complex and they include privacy, trade practices, just simply how social media affects our children which we see every day.</p><p>And all these issues are all sort of mixed up together and big tech has managed to actually unify Republicans and Democrats --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: -- against them which is quite an accomplishment if you think about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both want to break up --</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Both, both. So one area that I would comment on is privacy which has been a big area that's come to the floor as a result of big tech. So GDPR has been a big development in Europe and we're going to see some sort of privacy legislation in the United States.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Want to tell everybody what GDPR is?</p><p>GOTTDIENER: It's a legislation regime for ensuring privacy of personal information. And it is extremely onerous. And one of the things that I would point out is the law of unintended consequences.</p><p>So it is very expensive for companies to implement, so small companies will have more trouble implementing some sort of privacy law than big companies and might have sort of the opposite impact that one might expect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting. Completely different than what you saw with the regulatory environment with the banks where the big banks really didn't get much regulatory relief for a long time, still haven't by the way --</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- but the smaller banks actually were benefiting quite a bit.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Right.</p><p>PEEK: But they did get bigger, interestingly -- the big banks, right. So I mean, that's why Zuckerberg I think was always sort of like yes, we welcome regulation because he know that's the smaller companies in the space are going to get clobbered by that. It's sort of an interesting end run-around.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Noah -- it's great to get your insights this morning.</p><p>GOTTDIENER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Noah Gottdiener joining us this morning. Tune in today at 8:45 a.m. when Fox Business is taking you live to London for the President's joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. That's live, don't miss that coming up.</p><p>But first Climate in focus -- 2020 hopeful Joe Biden rolling out a plan to tackle global warming. We're taking a look at that when we come back.</p><p>And then trademark fight -- Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady charging the phrase \"Tom Terrific\" belongs to him. One sports franchise disagreeing this morning. We've got those details right after this.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Joe Biden releases his climate plan.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.</p><p>2020 hopeful Joe Biden presenting a 22-page agenda he says tackles climate change and builds economic opportunity with new green jobs. The former vice president says his goal for the U.S. is zero net emissions by 2050. But it's got a price tag, $1.7 trillion over 10 years.</p><p>Now Biden's campaign says the money will come from undoing tax cuts that were of course, enacted by President Trump.</p><p>All right, everybody. Good news for the whole panel. Have that extra cup of coffee. California state regulators have ruled that coffee does not require a cancer warning. The safety of coffee has been in dispute in the state of California after a judge said that coffee has to carry the warning because of a chemical created during the roasting process.</p><p>Meanwhile you're going to love this. A new study by the British Heart Foundation says drinking up to 25 cups of coffee a day is still safe for the heart until somebody says it's bad for your blood pressure but we'll leave it at that.</p><p>All right. Now Amazon taking a shot at Walmart. Amazon says its free one day delivery has been added to more than 10 million items and it's growing. The announcement just weeks after Walmart announced it was offering next day delivery to online shoppers. But the option only available to 220,000 products in Phoenix, Las Vegas and southern California. Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, joining Maria for an exclusive interview at 8:20 Eastern time this morning.</p><p>And Maria -- those are all your headlines. Have some more coffee. Go for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 25 cups. That's crazy. Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>Biden's plan, Dagen -- what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: They've got to have some plan, right? Everybody has got to have something to say. But will these things -- will these things ever go anywhere? No.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I mean I would say the numbers don't add up. You can't pay for a $1.7 trillion plan by undoing a very small part of the tax cut which is the tax cuts for the wealthy. A lot of those tax cuts went to business, which is helping to spur the economy and middle income households. He's not going to undo the middle income tax cuts. So you can't pay for it just by --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's really the corporate rate that we're talking about which was at 35 percent, now at 21 percent. It's had a real impact on economic growth. Undoing that -- what will that do to the economy?</p><p>PEEK: Can we also just admit that trying to get rid of fossil fuels in any foreseeable future is just an impossibility. We're not even close on, you know, replacing transporting, use of fossil fuels.</p><p>If you look at California, gasoline prices there are is a dollar per gallon more than any other place in the country. They're about to start having rolling black outs again because they have not invested in pipelines and drilling and all the rest of the stuff.</p><p>That's what we're going to see nationwide if any of these very far left candidates are able to impose their green ideals on this country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they're basically telling the American people we're going to eliminate millions of jobs. People who work in the energy business, who work in the oil business, we're getting rid of your jobs. How did that work out for Hillary Clinton when she looked at that coal miner and said we're going to get rid of your job but we'll replace it with something else.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, Natural gas is also a fossil fuel and that's one of the reasons that we are leading the globe in emissions reduction because of our conversion to natural gas. There are plentiful amount of it here and are switching our power plants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do they not understand that -- Dagen? I mean this is such an important point that you make about natural gas. I don't know that the candidates even understand what's going on with natural gas in this country.</p><p>PEEK: And they think by the way, that electric cars don't use any fuel. I mean, they don't know where the electricity is coming from a lot of times. It's coming from fossil fuels. So it is an ignorant -- it's a complex industry. And most of the people talking about it really don't have much understanding about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break, and then trade's impact on business. We're talking to one American bike maker about tariffs ahead. How much that bike will cost you, post tariffs.</p><p>Then Beyonce's roaring debut-- the superstar wowing fans in the Lion King's new trailer. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are looking at global trade this morning.</p><p>Mexico is now considering retaliation as Democrat and Republican officials tell \"Politico\" the President may have to declare a second national emergency to impose those tariffs. Tensions also with China have been flaring up as Beijing issues a travel warning to the United States. The U.S. Treasury is also defending the President's negotiation strategy.</p><p>Bicycles are one industry taking a hit in the ongoing trade impasse. Joining us right now is the CEO of Pedego Electric Bikes. He's the CEO and co-founder -- Don DiCostanzo. Don -- it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>DON DICOSTANZO, CEO, PEDEGO ELECTRIC BIKES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. Well we are going to look at your bike in a second. But first off, tell us about the trade situation and how it's impacting your business, how it's impacted you over the last year.</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Well, a little over a year ago, Europe announced a tariff on electric bikes of 81 percent. So that caused us to look at other locations. And in May of last year I went to Vietnam to explore that as a possibility because there's three places in the world that make electric bikes. One is China, the other it Vietnam and Taiwan in Taipei or Taiwan.</p><p>And so we looked at Vietnam and thought it was a workable solution. So we moved our production there.</p><p>For Europe, we began the process last May. And when the tariffs came in for the U.S., we ended up accelerating our program, moving all of our production from China to Taiwan and Vietnam.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How hard of a transition was it for you to go from producing in China to producing in Vietnam and Taiwan?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Well, the good news is the infrastructure was already in place and a bicycle is just a subtotal of about 50 items on a bill of materials. So we just shifted that production.</p><p>A lot of the components are made -- our motors come from a Japanese company, our batteries come from a Korean company. So everything is globally sourced.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you do any production in China anymore?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: We do not.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Completely not. So there's this question about who pays for tariffs when we impose them. Sometimes the big benefit goes to a country like Vietnam which is kind of caught in the middle.</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Well, that's a very good point. They're the big benefactor of all this. But they already had infrastructure in place to make bicycles so they're going to be a big --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Are your competitors moving there too?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Our bigger competitors can't because there's not enough infrastructure there to do it. And our smaller competitors can't afford it. So we're kind of in a sweet spot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Had you not moved your production, you would have raised prices or did you already raise prices?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: We would have had to raise prices. We were able to mitigate price -- just a slight price increase for some supply chain costs but we only had a very minor price increase.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why not make the bikes in the United States?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: That's a great question. In fact I'm part of a coalition that we're trying to do that. The challenge is that when I started in this business I wanted to make the bikes here in the U.S. and I found out that was impossible because it was 11 percent duty on bringing the parts in and there is no duty on bringing the whole bicycle in. So right away it would have been put me at an 11 percent disadvantage. Add the labor cost here and then my bikes would have not been competitive.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you think tariffs are going to drive production to the United States?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Absolutely, without any question. The whole industry is moving toward that. We're trying to set up, establish manufacturing here of the frames. That's the biggest challenge because the frames are all made offshore. If we can get the frames made here and we're putting a bill forth in Congress to allow that the parts be exempt from many types of tariffs.</p><p>PEEK: Hopefully you're lobbying for exactly that. But then there must be parts manufacturers in the U.S. who wanted those duties imposed, right.</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Very few. Unfortunately the bicycle industry moved to China in the 1990s. It took about 10 years to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why -- because it was so much cheaper?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>DICOSTANZO: The labor costs. The people who tried to stay here went bankrupt. Schwinn went bankrupt because they tried to continue to make the bikes here and they weren't competitive. So everything evolved there and now it's going to take us a few years to get it back. But because of automation, we're going to be able to make these parts here again in the U.S.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Some people say that some of industries -- furniture, bicycles -- are gone. That we've lost so much infrastructure we can't bring them back. Is that true?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: I disagree with that. It depends on what you mean by manufacture. We can certainly assemble the bikes here. We can put all the pieces together here. We already do it to a degree in our assembly facility in California.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But you say with automation. So it's going to be machines doing that work, not people. It's not going to lead to a lot of new jobs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Reading my mind.</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Yes. But -- there will be a higher skilled level of people that need to operate these machines. I've been to the Tesla factory. Those cars come in in sheet aluminum and they go out the other end in production and there's a lot of people involved in that.</p><p>Yes, they've got lots of equipment but there is a lot of people involved and those are much higher paying jobs than the people just on the assembly line putting a screw or --</p><p>PEEK: And you're creating value.</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Exactly.</p><p>PEEK: I mean, you know, the value added now is in the United States.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way -- we're seeing a real mix in terms of retail earnings this morning. We had a big miss on Tiffany and yet you've got others that are beating. So are you seeing the kind of consumer demand that you would expect from an economy where unemployment is as low as it is?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Well, we had a record month last month. We continue -- we break records every single month. There's a big demand for something that's alternative, anything electric is hot today. Electric bikes are certainly a hot item. And people don't buy them -- they buy them for transportation. But they primarily They primarily buy them to have fun.</p><p>HILSENRATH: What does the President need to do to revive American industry and American jobs in manufacturing? He's done the tariffs on China. What else does he need to do to get those plants to start moving to the United States?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: So the tariffs are a perfect step. But we also have other outside people like the Europeans. It's difficult for us to do business in Europe. We have to have restrictions on what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.</p><p>But to bring jobs back here, we need to make it a fair and even playing field. I think the tariffs are the first step.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You're with him on this agenda?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Absolutely.</p><p>PEEK: You're manufacturing in California. A lot of businesses have been leaving California, I believe. Are you intending to stay in the state? The high taxes are not -- are not a problem for your company?</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Well, from a business perspective, I look at it, is it possible and is it practical? And in California, it's certainly possible, the question is, is it practical? It may make more sense for us to do our assembly if we get in full scale assembly to move to Nevada or Texas or some other state that has a more friendly assembly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A smart conversation here, Don. We wish you could be here all day.</p><p>PEEK: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because it's exactly the conversation that we love having. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DICOSTANZO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congrats to you, Don DiCostanzo joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, a hero's journey home, a former Navy SEAL using extreme sports to transition back to civilian life.</p><p>And then the battle of the Toms, Patriots' great Tom Brady's efforts to trademark his nickname getting some resistance this morning. Details after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 4th.

Take a look, Dow Industrials right now up 91 points, a third of a percent. S&amp;P 500 up nine and the NASDAQ up 25 right now, bouncing after a really a tech wreck yesterday.</p><p>Yesterday the major indices were flat with the exception of the NASDAQ because of a tech wreck on Wall Street, hitting the NASDAQ hard. The NASDAQ was down 120 points as you see and this is why. You had Amazon down 4-2/3 percent. Facebook down 7-1/2 percent. The parent company of Google, Alphabet down six percent yesterday. They all got creamed on new regulatory concerns on the major names, pushing the NASDAQ into correction territory by the way, yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are higher. Take a look, across the board gains with the FT-100 up six, CAC Quarante also up six and the DAX Index in Germany up 105.</p><p>In Asia overnight, red across the board.

All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.</p><p>But first, a unique form of therapy for a former Navy SEAL, transitioning back to civilian life. He's using his combat experience to excel in extreme sports. His efforts the inspiration for a new start-up, Kristina Partsinevelos decided to tag along for a therapy session. Kristina, good morning to you.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. You have Brandon Webb who started this company. He was max Navy SEAL and Sniper but I want to get straight to the package so you can hear more of the story instead of me just recapping it for you. Let's listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: For most people, therapy sessions happen on a leather couch. For Brandon Webb, it's his 1985 Socata Epsilon. Webb spent time in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Navy SEAL sniper. And for all too many war veterans, returning home from the military means coping with post-traumatic stress disorder. To help combat that anxiety, Webb found an outlet.</p><p>BRANDON WEBB, CEO AND GEAR CURATOR, CRATE CLUB: For me, flying is very therapeutic. I got a shot of adrenaline but it's kind of like yoga and meditation. Because you're forced -- it force -- you're just forced to concentrate on one thing and you can't think about anything else. So it's kind of mind eraser.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Stunt flying isn't his only escape, Webb also loves heliskiing. Most recently Webb and a group of friends took a helicopter to Chamonix, a dangerous off-trail region in the Alps. Webb is constantly seeking out that next adrenaline high.</p><p>By managing his PTSD, Webb has also found his return to civilian life easier and has utilizes experiences to successfully launch several businesses.</p><p>WEBB: I've been able to like take the stuff that I love and kind of mix it with my past, you know, military background and create this kind of cool content company that we monetize with commerce.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: One of those startups is crate club, a mail order subscription service that's essentially Navy SEAL in a box. Outdoor survival goods approved by combat veterans.</p><p>So, can I get my therapy session with you then?</p><p>WEBB: Of course and I don't charge that much.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Taking to the skies over Manhattan, Webb didn't disappoint with the adrenaline. Doing a 360 loop the loop off the coast of Manhattan, followed by an up-close view of the Statue of Liberty. But Webb understands that this therapy may not be for everybody. He just knows it works for him.</p><p>WEBB: It's my way of getting into entrepreneurship and flying and aviation and then kind of like taking what I learned in the military and just for me it's been a positive way to kind of deal with my own transition.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: There you have it. I was obviously very excited with being up in the air for that therapy session. But overall, it's really important to raise awareness for mental health and how he found solace in a community, the aviation community and then from there he was able to launch a pretty successful company CrateClub.US. Some really cool stuff on there, survival kits and all that. But nonetheless, I had a great time which is selfishly just saying that. It was a lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very cool. Thanks, Kristina.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos there.</p><p>And joining us right now is retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, former congressman and author of the book, Hold Texas, Hold The Nation, Allen West. Colonel, it's great to see you.</p><p>LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.), FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's good to be with you , Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction?</p><p>WEST: Well, you know, one of the reasons why I wear this ring is because on average 20-22 veterans still today are lo -- taking their lives in the United States of America. And this is called the #22killring. And we have to look after these veterans.</p><p>Later on this month, we'll go down to the Cayman Islands and we take a bunch of veterans who on adaptive training, diving, they have lost limbs, they have spinal cord injuries. And those are the types of things that we need to look to do. So the organization called Dive Pirates and I'm just thrilled to be affiliated with it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump really was focused on the suicide rates among veterans and the state of the V.A., particularly when he was running. What has he done in terms of improving the way that our veterans are treated in the medical system, but also in terms of trying to combat the number of suicides?</p><p>WEST: Well, I think the important thing was the accountability because that was lacking in the V.A. system. Because now you can actually fire people for their lack of good treatment of our veterans. But it's the accessibility also. No veteran should be told that you must go and travel 150 or 200 miles to get to a V.A. medical center or clinic. They should be able to have access to quality healthcare wherever they are, that's an important thing.</p><p>PEEK: And is that possible now that they can go to a private doctor or whatever? I mean, there was some controversy about that approach. Is that working now?</p><p>WEST: It's getting better. It's not perfect. But at least we are -- you know, chipping away at the block. The V.A. is a -- is a behemoth. There's no doubt about it. And so I think that -- and it's funny, because the other side does not want to talk about the V.A. because that's really their model of healthcare they'd like to have in the United States of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have so many issues to talk to you about but we want to go to the border crisis. A federal judge is handing the Trump administration a win this morning, rejecting a lawsuit from the House challenging border wall funding. The judge is ruling that Congress lacks the authority to sue in this case.</p><p>Meanwhile, lanes are back open at the San Sedro border crossing in San Diego that's after Customs and Border Patrol agents were involved in a shooting last night. A driver attempting to enter the U.S. failed to stop for an inspection.</p><p>Colonel, your thoughts on what's taking place at the border today. We were at the border about a month ago in El Paso. And it was actually quite stunning to see the children there, being put in the positions that they are in.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely. And I've been down to the McAllen sector as well which has seen an incredible increase. And what the -- a lot of the drug cartels and people are doing, they're using these children because they know that we are accepting people as family units and after 20 days, you know, they're released into the United States society.</p><p>So, they're actually recycling kids to come across the border with certain family, quote, unquote, units and then they get them back across and then they get with another group. So this has been an incredible stress that we put to on the border patrol.</p><p>Now we even seen TSA agents had to be pulled over airports to go down the hill. But as we're looking here at these crossing zones, what's happening out in these other areas where we are pulling away resources to be focused on these crosses zones.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So Colonel, the president is opening a new front in this effort to tighten the border with Mexico and that's by talking about imposing tariffs. Is that the right strategy? Should we be using tariffs to fight an immigration battle?</p><p>PEEK: And what can Mexico do?</p><p>WEST: Well, I mean, I think that Mexico -- you know, there should be a buffer. I mean, when you go down there to the border, you know, these folks are just walking right on up and they're just walking across.</p><p>So you know, from our border back into Mexico five or 10 miles, there should be some type of control that the Mexican government is not exercising. I mean, you can stand there and look right down a path and see people just walking across.</p><p>Now, I'm not going to criticize the president because I don't sit down and have all these classified briefings. Maybe he feels that this is a tactic he has to use. But I think one of the critical things we could do is start taxing remittances that are being sent back to these individuals. And I think that we have to stop having these you know, these carrots that we're giving. Because we tell them, just come across the border and this is what you're going to get, you're going to get these social welfare programs and what have you. So I think that's some of the things we have to start looking at as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But if you have tariffs that weaken an economy in Mexico that was already contracting in the first quarter, Colonel, that you make a situation potentially worse for the United States.</p><p>WEST: Well, sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because if you have a lack of jobs in Mexico and you deprive the nation of resources to stop the illegal immigrants from crossing from Central America into Mexico and into the United States, it puts us in a worse situation, not a better one.</p><p>WEST: Yes, I don't know if the president is saying that this is one of those tough stances I've got to start off with and get people to walk back down. But we've got to get Mexico's attention because there's no reason why they should just be opening up and allowing people to transit through their country to come into the United States illegally.</p><p>PEEK: Does it seem possible that we could actually have sort of centralized locations, two or three in Mexico, where asylum seekers would go?</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>PEEK: American run but Mexican protected in a sense compounds where people could go apply for asylum and stay there instead of staying in the United States. Because that seems like a reasonable outcome than seeing them --</p><p>WEST: And again, that was one of the things that exist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you're seeking asylum, you know, you're supposed to seek asylum in the first country that you reach.</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Mexico, but they're bypassing that because they're obviously looking for economic opportunities. Which is all good -- well and good but the fact is, is they're getting -- they're jumping the line. There are other people waiting for those economic opportunities in the legal way.</p><p>WEST: There's a right way to do it.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Would people actually stop at these centers or go straight to the border?</p><p>WEST: Well, that's where you got to work with Mexico to tell them, you send them to the border. Remember there was an activist judge who said that the Trump administration could not have Mexico do that.</p><p>PEEK: Right, so I presume we're appealing that or that the government is appealing that decision.</p><p>WEST: Well, I just think that's none of that judge's business.</p><p>PEEK: And that's it, there's that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very fascinating stuff. Colonel, please come back soon.</p><p>WEST: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not with us enough. So we appreciate you joining us this morning.</p><p>WEST: Thank you so much, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Colonel Allen West there.</p><p>We have breaking news right now, FiatChrysler and the French government reportedly resolving key differences on a Renault merger deal. FiatChrysler shares are rising this morning on the idea that it will be merging, partnering with Renault. Fiat now up 3-3/4 percent.</p><p>We are awaiting comments from President Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May, they will hold a bilateral meeting right now inside of 10 Downing Street. We will bring you their joint news conference in about an hour from now. Stay with us on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook shareholders are pushing back. Cheryl Casone with headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Pushing back hard, Maria. Good morning again. Shareholders overwhelmingly backing two proposals to weaken CEO Mark Zuckerberg's power. This happened during last week's annual meeting. According to an SEC filing, 68 percent of outside shareholders voted to remove Zuckerberg as chairman in favor of an independent chair. Shareholders are angry about Zuckerberg's handling of Facebook's privacy scandals. The votes are basically symbolic. Zuckerberg has 60 percent of the voting power at the company, but still a headline to mention. The stock is slightly higher in the premarket right now.</p><p>Tesla making at least $1.7 billion selling tax credits to other car companies. General Motors and FiatChrysler just closing the stated dollar worth. They purchased the credits from Tesla to make up for shortfalls in their own zero emissions vehicle sales. This is the first time that automakers are acknowledging that they're turning to Tesla for help to comply with these intensifying environmental regulations. Take a look at shares of Tesla. As you can see, higher by 1-1/4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Well, Mercedes-Benz expanding its vehicle subscription service to a third U.S. city. Welcome to the fold, Atlanta. Joining national in Philadelphia in the pilot program. This lets users choose among 50 models for a monthly fee. Other luxury car companies offering similar subscription programs have had, well, some mixed results. But Atlanta is the U.S. headquarters of Mercedes-Benz.</p><p>OK, IHOP is drifting out of their breakfast lane, sort of. They're going to rename their burgers, pancakes in honor of the brand-new menu offerings. IHOP's been trying to pop up the burgers for a year now. Last year, of course you remember this, they briefly changed their name to IHOB with a B. Costumers weren't happy. They told the chain to stick to breakfast. So, they decided to create a burger. Maria, it's got a pancake in the middle of it. So there's that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pancakes and burgers, come on.</p><p>CASONE: All together in one big old stack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we are talking about them, so there you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There is -- what's really the difference between chicken, fried chicken and waffles? Again, this is burgers and pancakes all in one.</p><p>HILSENRATH: They tried to rename themselves. Now they're renaming their burgers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, it's all marketing.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Sounds like these guys have an identity crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree.</p><p>Coming up, Tom versus Tom, Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady trying to trademark Tom terrific. One sports franchise is pushing back on that, though. That's next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New York Mets fans throwing a penalty flag toward Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady. Jared Max with sports now, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. For some New Yorkers it's a terrific reason to like the New England quarterback even less. Tom Brady trying to steal a Mets legend nickname. 10 years before, Tom Brady was born, Tom Seaver was the 1967 National League Rookie of the Year. When as a New York Met, he earned the nickname Tom Terrific, a name synonymous with Seaver for more than half a century.</p><p>But this did not stop the sixth time Super Bowl champ Tom Brady last week for filing for trademark protection for the name Tom terrific. So he can use it to self-clothing, trading cards and such. New Yorkers say why don't you just try to trademark Brady Bunch while you're at it.</p><p>Today in New York City, there's going to be a rally, 05:00 eastern time. And folks are encouraged to trash their Tom Brady gear. But they call it the Boston T.V. Party, T.P. 12 is that a brand maybe wasn't enough.</p><p>Speaking of branding, Toronto Raptors Kawhi Leonard has filed suit against Nike. Kawhi claims that Nike went behind his back and copyrighted his personal logo, the Klaw logo. Kawhi claims he designed this over a number of years and agreed to let Nike tweak it and sell it on merchandize but not for them to claim ownership which was granted by the copyright office in May 2017. Kawhi who ended his endorsement with Nike over this wants his logo back.</p><p>Never before have fans of St. Louis gotten to see their St. Louis Blues win a Stanley Cup final game in St. Louis until last night. Game number four, Blues hosting the Bruins third period tied to two until Ryan O'Reilly creates mayhem for Boston, his second goal of the night. The Blues had an empty netter. They win 4-2 and the series is tied at two.</p><p>Boston also lost a defenseman Zdeno Chara, headed to the dentist chair. Chara had to get stitched up after he caught a puck in the mouth last night and had to leave the game, ouch.</p><p>Quarter finals, the French Open today. If Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer win, they will meet in the semifinals. Nadal trying to win his 12th French Open playing Kei Nishikori today. Roger Federer going for the 21st Grand Slam title takes on StanWawrinka.</p><p>Oh, and Sloane Stephens, one of three American women in the quarter finals today, she will playing Johanna Konta.</p><p>Maria, you know, just for the record, Tom terrific actually was a cartoon that was part of the \"Captain Kangaroo\" show that started in the late 50s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what Liz said. Yes, people are not happy about this, Jared.</p><p>MAX: Obviously, I'm a Tom Brady fan, always have been. This one rubs me the wrong way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks Jared. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Sirius Radio XM 115.</p><p>Still ahead, my interview with the CEO of Wal-Mart, Doug McMillon is with us this morning, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019060402cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8F-5PB1-JB20-G0YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

One of the things I learned when writing this report with Baroness Kidron is how the systems are designed to make it so hard to tear children away from their screens.

The president of the Royal College of psychologists has a headline that it today talking about the fact that what we need to make sure is that not only are we thinking about how this is impacting children but putting it into context that we know that rates of depression are rising, particularly in teenage girls and young adults. We not only need more psychiatrists to address that, but we need legislation so that websites supporting anorexia can be firmly addressed. Shirley, do you recognise this as a public health issue? Yes, a very serious one. We were -- we published a report last year, Status Of Mind, looking at mental health around social media. Nine in ten girls are worried about their body and their body image. We found out that depression and anxiety has increased over the past 25 years by 70% and the young people we survey said very specifically what the negative impacts were around mental health, and cyber bullying, fear of missing out, all of these things are having a detrimental effect. We need to regulate and think of ways to mitigate the negative effects of social media and really enhance the very positive effects. We are not there yet and this report today, I think, is a very important step. We are asking the actual companies themselves, you have a responsibility in this area. Is one of the challenges that parents do not necessarily understand all of the different platforms that children are on? I think so. That is a really good point. Even in the question there is a problem. What do they understand? They understand content. As a parent it is easy to understand if you think a piece of content is suitable or unsuitable. That is one set of problems. But what they don't understand is the design of services is really leveraging human instincts.

But we want them to be doing intentional, creative things in an environment that respects their rights and their difference. We have lots of rules around childhood and they are being ignored by the big tech companies. Louise, do you think the tech companies are bullying children? I think there is a lot we do not understand and I think the tech companies do things that hugely impact children. In clinic, children are saying to me that if nobody likes my tweet or picture, I feel terrible. It is awful to think their mental state is being affected in that way. We understand the dangers of crossing the road, we do not understand the dangers of not getting likes etc. How do you navigate that as a parent? What should you say if you're young person says that?

Yes, a very serious one. We were -- we published a report last year, Status Of Mind, looking at mental health around social media. Nine in ten girls are worried about their body and their body image. We found out that depression and anxiety has increased over the past 25 years by 70% and the young people we survey said very specifically what the negative impacts were around mental health, and cyber bullying, fear of missing out, all of these things are having a detrimental effect.

Before you talk about the online safety measures, your app was described as Tinder 14 is, why? At the beginning of the app, there was a swiping function, to make friends, like Snapchat, but that was two years ago, and now it is a live streaming app for discovering friends, so not at all the same thing. And the thing is that teenagers today need to make friends, because they feel more and more lonely using social media, and having their reputation based on performance, likes and comments, so they need to connect with people. </p><p>So our mission is to allow teenagers to socialise with other teenagers, open opportunities and break social barriers. So that is what is necessary for teens today, but they need to do it in a safe environment. You said you have ten people in your company, so a small company, despite the popularity of this app - what features are on your app to protect young people? Yeah, we have a great engineering team, and we have developed different algorithms to detect nudity and, like, suggestive content, because we know some teenagers can put themselves at risk. For example, when you are doing a live and there is nakedness in the live, the user receives an alert to put their clothes back on. So for example, if a user, a teenager is in underwear or less, we consider that is a risk for them, and we send them an alert. And the results are really good, 80% of users put their clothes back on after receiving an alert, and that is really interesting, because we know that we can do real-time intervention and change the way that teenagers behave, because sometimes they do not know that they are putting themselves at risk. So that is a thing that technology can really help us filter content and educate users. Lauren, watched you think of that? I think that sounds fab, if a new company can do that, we need to be but expect that at every tech, social media app would be able to get the sort of measures into play, and we needed. We we're not asking - we need this. When I think of Ben's parents speaking, on the live stream it is more natural to open up and save more things that you might not, if you were writing, you might stop yourself, think, I had better not give out that information. But in Breck's case, he felt like he was speaking with a friend, and a lot of the information that he gave away made it harder, because the predator was gathering information against me, to turn Breck against me, to isolate him from me. Anything he would pick up one was in that that should give or take chat, and it all came out. Which is the nature of grooming, isn't it? Andy, Lauren makes the point that if a relatively small company like Marc-Antoine 's company can come up with the safety measures, it should not be beyond the realms of Twitter with Periscope, Facebook, to do the same. That is absolutely right, and what we have seen at the NSPCC for the last decade is that social networks, time and again, don't take the necessary steps to keep children safe. We would like to see the feature that Yubo have invented across all social networks. We would like to see live streaming restricted to a child's friends or contacts, so a child has greater control and knows who it is that they might be talking to or broadcasting to. But the platforms are chosen time and again not to take the steps that they should to protect children on their sites. That is why we are calling for statutory regulation, the Home Secretary has signalled that this is his personal mission, to tackle online abuse. We are really clear the only way that children can meaningfully be protected when they go online is if the Government does introduce this regulation. OK, well, you know, you sort of get the impression that the big tech companies are in last chance saloon, but perhaps they have been for a while now. Marc-Antoine, there is another thing you have done, you have two separate communities on your app, one for those aged 13-17, another for those aged over 18, so what would stop an 18-year-old getting involved in the 13-17 community yeah, we have created different age gates in the gap to protect our users, so that is something inventive. The thing is that we have developed different technologies, and we're working with CEOP and the NSPCC to share knowledge about this. We have developed a lot of techniques and</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-b691605fee8c4f0db5fd5615be77c6c9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TH7-J8T1-DY08-32FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Before you talk about the online safety measures, your app was described as Tinder 14 is, why? At the beginning of the app, there was a swiping function, to make friends, like Snapchat, but that was two years ago, and now it is a live streaming app for discovering friends, so not at all the same thing. And the thing is that teenagers today need to make friends, because they feel more and more lonely using social media, and having their reputation based on performance, likes and comments, so they need to connect with people. </p><p>So our mission is to allow teenagers to socialise with other teenagers, open opportunities and break social barriers. So that is what is necessary for teens today, but they need to do it in a safe environment. You said you have ten people in your company, so a small company, despite the popularity of this app - what features are on your app to protect young people? Yeah, we have a great engineering team, and we have developed different algorithms to detect nudity and, like, suggestive content, because we know some teenagers can put themselves at risk. For example, when you are doing a live and there is nakedness in the live, the user receives an alert to put their clothes back on. So for example, if a user, a teenager is in underwear or less, we consider that is a risk for them, and we send them an alert. And the results are really good, 80% of users put their clothes back on after receiving an alert, and that is really interesting, because we know that we can do real-time intervention and change the way that teenagers behave, because sometimes they do not know that they are putting themselves at risk. So that is a thing that technology can really help us filter content and educate users. Lauren, watched you think of that? I think that sounds fab, if a new company can do that, we need to be but expect that at every tech, social media app would be able to get the sort of measures into play, and we needed. We we're not asking - we need this. When I think of Ben's parents speaking, on the live stream it is more natural to open up and save more things that you might not, if you were writing, you might stop yourself, think, I had better not give out that information. But in Breck's case, he felt like he was speaking with a friend, and a lot of the information that he gave away made it harder, because the predator was gathering information against me, to turn Breck against me, to isolate him from me. Anything he would pick up one was in that that should give or take chat, and it all came out. Which is the nature of grooming, isn't it? Andy, Lauren makes the point that if a relatively small company like Marc-Antoine 's company can come up with the safety measures, it should not be beyond the realms of Twitter with Periscope, Facebook, to do the same. That is absolutely right, and what we have seen at the NSPCC for the last decade is that social networks, time and again, don't take the necessary steps to keep children safe. We would like to see the feature that Yubo have invented across all social networks. We would like to see live streaming restricted to a child's friends or contacts, so a child has greater control and knows who it is that they might be talking to or broadcasting to. But the platforms are chosen time and again not to take the steps that they should to protect children on their sites. That is why we are calling for statutory regulation, the Home Secretary has signalled that this is his personal mission, to tackle online abuse. We are really clear the only way that children can meaningfully be protected when they go online is if the Government does introduce this regulation. OK, well, you know, you sort of get the impression that the big tech companies are in last chance saloon, but perhaps they have been for a while now. Marc-Antoine, there is another thing you have done, you have two separate communities on your app, one for those aged 13-17, another for those aged over 18, so what would stop an 18-year-old getting involved in the 13-17 community yeah, we have created different age gates in the gap to protect our users, so that is</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC2WA-64caec77aa664c269937996c2208742d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC2WA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TH7-J8T1-DY08-32C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

It is not something that big tech companies from the United States or where there can and should do on their own. They spent made headlines for all the wrong reasons when 14-year-old Molly Russell took her own life.

They spent made headlines for all the wrong reasons when 14-year-old Molly Russell took her own life. Earlier this year there was a huge outpouring of public solidarity with the father of Molly Russell, Ian. This is because, it is covered extensively on this programme, where one reason she took her own life. It is a complicated area. Allowing some people to express themselves and sharing images of self-harm can be a way of alerting authorities about what is going on. Nick Clegg said Facebook had to change their position but for complex reasons. We try and well in academic experts and others to make sure that a platform like Instagram can also be a forceful bid, to save lives and say people from doing damage to themselves. Over the last year or so 3500 people who were in a state of immense distress and on the point of taking their own lives where reached by emergency services because of signals detected on social media. I hope over time we can get that balance right and learn from these awful, tragic events and be a tool for saving lives. What did he say about claims that Russia has interfered with various elections, including the EU referendum? He was remarkably emphatic about it. What is striking, there is concrete evidence that Russia didn't appear when it came to the election with Donald Trump. Russia tried to cede quite hard-line thoughts into public conversation and used Facebook to do it. With Brexit it has been a lot less clear. Nick Clegg was asked, is there a conspiracy? He said really clearly, no, there is not. There are some shades of grey. How do you define influence on a social media platform? There is one thing to say there is a troll farm in parts of Russia that it could also be that Russia and its state propaganda forces are hoping to grow conversation. Clegg was emphatic and said there is no interference. Depending on how you define interference, Russia did play a role. I accept we need to act but there is no evidence it happened in the Brexit referendum. The man two full analyses and all the data we had in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 US presidential election. We share all of this information with a select committee in Westminster and elsewhere and found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. There was an interesting question about when Sir Nick Clegg went over to Facebook. Was he cannot have any influence? Was he going to change things? When we first started talking about the issues, face that has come a long way on regulation. They are saying they want to be regulated. He is talking about hate speech, use of data. The company has gone a long way. Cynics and sceptics would argue that they are saying this because they want to get in and get ahead of regulation before people say, as lots of American presidential contenders are saying, that the company should be broken up. Thank you. We are going to bring you exclusive access to a care home that has built a replica high Street, together with a tearoom. Robert Harvey House created Sensory Street, which also includes a host of animals, to help stimulate memories and the senses. More than half of the residents at the home are living with dementia. Catrin Nye has been to visit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-42424a5d6f184082957bee5f159ca84c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-87K1-JBH6-C337-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.
