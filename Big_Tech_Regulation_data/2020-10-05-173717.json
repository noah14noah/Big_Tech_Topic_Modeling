The public adored the companies' new devices, educators embraced their tools and politicians extolled their contributions to the economy. Even traditionally powerful voices, like media and telecom businesses, found little success in criticizing the technology industr y.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now, as lawmakers look into how Russia used Google, Facebook and Twitter to influence the 2016 presidential election, many critics see a rare opening - and ar e lining up to take their shots.</p><p>The reviews site Yelp, which has long complained about the size and power of Google, has filed a new federal antitrust complaint against the search giant.</p><p>Media organizations are arguing, to a more receptive Capitol Hill, that internet businesses should have the same advertising disclosure rules that print and television companies do.</p><p>And the support behind a sex-trafficking bill, which tech companies argue could make them the unfair target of lawsuits, reads like a Who's Who list of companies that have long complained about tech's sway in Washington, including the Walt Disney Co., Oracle and 21st Century Fox. \"We've had low points, when we were out of energy and felt like we weren't heard,\" said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive of Yelp. \"Bu t we feel we have a clean slate n ow .\"</p><p>The action is nascent, but gaining momentum fast.</p><p>Lawmakers are pushing for regulations for technology companies for the first time in years, encouraged along by big tech's broad assortment of rivals. For several weeks, a group of companies including smaller tech companies and entertainment and retail businesses has informally begun regular meetings and conference calls to compare notes about Google, Facebook and Amazon and to find a way to join in a stronger opposition f o rc e.</p><p>\"Before, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school,\" said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \"But now the halo is a bit off these compan i e s.\"</p><p>Internet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill. House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending - a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.</p><p>The technology companies go to lawmakers to talk about how their businesses are creating jobs and providing free or lower-priced services for consumers.

with the firm having failed to assuage concerns it will not abuse data gathered by the smart city.</p><p>This backlash has now been bolstered by criticism from prominent US venture capitalist Roger McNamee, who was an early investor in Google and Facebook and a co-founder of Silver Lake Partners, one of the largest tech investors in the world.</p><p>Despite his background, Mr McNamee has grown critical of large tech firms like Google, particularly over their handling of data and related privacy concerns.</p><p>'The smart city project on the Toronto waterfront is the most highly evolved version to date of [...] surveillance capitalism', he wrote in a letter to the Toronto city council.</p><p>'No matter what Google is offering, the value to Toronto cannot possibly approach the value your city is giving up,' he added. </p><p>Declaring the Quayside project a 'dystopian vision' with 'no place in a democratic society', Mr McNamee pleaded with Toronto officials to abandon the development. </p><p>He is concerned, he wrote, that Google will use 'algorithms to nudge human behaviour' within the district as to \"favour its business\". </p><p>Sidewalk Labs, however, have dismissed Mr McNamee's allegations.</p><p>'[He] does not seem very familiar with what Sidewalk Labs is actually proposing,' Sidewalk Labs spokesperson Keerthana Rang told the Guardian in a statement.</p><p>She also rejected the suggestion that facial recognition technology would feature in the project.</p><p>'As we have made clear, we believe that data collected in public space must be overseen and closely controlled by an independent and publicly accountable Data Trust, not Sidewalk Labs, Google, or any private company,' she added.</p><p>The Toronto city council met to discuss Mr McNamee's letter and the wider issue of the the Quayside project on June 6, 2019.</p><p>Ana Bail\u00e3o, Toronto's Deputy Mayor, told the Guardian that she viewed data and privacy as being among 'the most significant challenges facing our society today.'</p><p>Mr McNamee is not the only businessman to come out against the development.</p><p>In 2018, Jim Balsille, co-founder of BlackBerry Ltd, expressed similar sentiments, call the project 'a colonising experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues.'</p><p>Sidewalk Labs won a bin to be part of the development of Toronto's waterside Port Lands area back in late 2017. </p><p>Quayside would harbour all kinds of futuristic conveniences, according to plans, with self-driving taxis, automated waste collection, traffic lights that track pedestrian movements and pavements that automatically melt away snowfall.</p><p>Extensive monitoring would feed back information on various aspects of city life - from air quality to the frequency of park bench usage - in order to further develop the neighbourhood and make it more liveable.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and officials from Sidewalk Labs gathered 18 months ago to announce the project, amid much fanfare.</p><p>'I don't think they look so happy now,' Paula Fletcher, a Toronto City Council member, told the Washington Post.</p><p>'This big idea isn't going exactly the way it was planned.'</p><p>A campaign to #BlockSidewalk began in February, after the Toronto Star revealed that Sidewalk Labs were contemplating financing infrastructure and transit developments on a larger part of the waterfront than previously announced.</p><p>Leaked documents suggested that, in return, the firm would seek to receive part of the profits generated by Quayside from development fees, property taxes and rising land values.</p><p>These profits had been estimated at $6 billion CAD (\u00a33.4 billion GBP/$4.5 billion USD) over a 30 year period. </p><p>A spokesperson from Sidewalk Labs said that the proposal had not been publicly announced because it was still under debate - but the revelations have failed to paint the company's commitment to transparency in a good light.</p><p>'It's our job to remind everybody that \"no\" is an option and that consent is important,' said Bianca Wylie, a leader of the #BlockSidewalk movement. </p><p>'The way this process has been set up was not a question of whether we should do stuff like this, but how.'</p><p>In addition, Wylie said that cities are granting too much power to big tech companies like the Alphabet-subsidiary, even as regulators struggle to rein them in. </p><p>A spokesperson for Sidewalk Labs, Micah Lasher, acknowledged that missteps may have been made and that providing more information on Quayside's business model and planned data-handling policies may have helped to allay concerns. </p><p>Trying to downplay the firm's corporate links to Google, Sidewalk Labs have said that they will not be trying to monetise the smart city's data collection - and have proposed that such activities be managed by a data trust to prevent misuse.</p><p>However, Mr Lasher noted, the company has definitely struggled to find the best time to unveil such plans. </p><p>'If you share them too early, they seem half-baked and you might move away from them later,' he said.</p><p>'If you share them too late, you are subject to criticism for not being transparent.' </p><p>Waterfront Toronto advisory panel member and University of Toronto information scientist Andrew Clement said that Sidewalk labs have left many questions about the proposed data trust unanswered.</p><p>Instead of fully addressing these concerns, he added, the firm have been distracting the public with new technological concepts that the city might feature.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs had agreed to spend $50 million CAD (\u00a328 million GBP/$37 million USD) on a year-long process of public consultations to inform their development proposal.</p><p>Plans would need to be submitted to Waterfront Toronto, the corporation that is overseeing the development of the Port Lands area on behalf of the government.</p><p>Any such proposal needs the approval of both Waterfront Toronto and several government bodies in order to go ahead.</p><p>However, plans are already months behind schedule, with Sidewalk Labs having originally been expected to present their designs in June 2018. </p><p>Alongside delays and public backlash, privacy concerns have also encouraged the Canadian Civil Liberties Association to sue the city, federal and provincial governments to shut down the Quayside project. </p><p>Association executive director Michael Bryant said that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had been 'seduced by the honey pot of Google's sparkling brand and promises of political and economic glory.' </p><p>The Port Lands development scheme - and Quayside in particular - have already faced a number of embarrassments over the project's transparency.</p><p>In October 2018, former Ontario privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian resigned from a consulting position at Sidewalk over concerns that the smart city would not be able to gain consent from everyone on whom it gathered data.</p><p>'I imagined us creating a Smart City of Privacy, as opposed to a Smart City of Surveillance,' she wrote in her resignation letter. </p><p>In the same month, entrepreneur Saadia Muzaffar similarly resigned from the Quayside project advisory panel.</p><p>He criticised Waterfront Toronto for its lack of transparency and reporting that the organisation exhibited 'apathy and a lack of leadership regarding shaky public trust'. </p><p>This was followed in December by the revelation from the Ontario auditor general that Waterfront Toronto had given preferential treatment to Sidewalk in its selection of the Alphabet-owned firm as its partner.</p><p>The auditor general had called at the time for an increase in government oversight of the development project.</p><p>The groundswell of both public and political resistance to the project bears similarities to the pushback against Amazon's plans to construct a secondary headquarters in New York's Long Island City.</p><p>The unanticipated criticism of the development came from activists, union leader and lawyers, who objected to proposals that the wealthy retail firm might be granted in excess of a billion dollars in government subsidies if the plans went ahead.</p><p>Concerns were also raised over the impact that the corporate headquarters would have on New York's already rising rents and overcrowded mass transit system. </p><p>This opposition eventually forced Amazon to withdraw its plans, reportedly over fears that the backlash was tarnishing its wider reputation.</p><p>In Toronto, concerns have been raised that any similar situation that could cause the Alphabet subsidiary to withdraw or be forced to abandon the Quayside project would blemish Canada's growing tech-friendly image.</p><p>'We believe that tearing up this process midstream poses reputational risks, trade risks and legal risks,' said Brian Kelcey, Toronto Region Board of Trade vice president of public affairs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-53480627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8Y-T8M1-JCJY-G3RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1762\"/><timeReceived>11:42 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

That kind of activity, particularly the manipulation of behaviour, is \"repugnant,\" he said.</p><p>Mcnamee pointed to sri lanka, which banned social media sites in the wake of a series of co-ordinated terrorist attacks, as an example. That ban lasted nine days and was an attempt to stop people from spreading misinformation, confusion and inciting violence in the days after the attacks.</p><p>Mcnamee's proposal was just one of the ideas pitched at the International grand Committee on Big data, Privacy and democracy held in Ottawa on Tuesday. The committee is part of a worldwide effort to bring massive companies like google and Facebook to heel on such issues as privacy, hate speech and disinformation.</p><p>With Facebook CeO Mark Zuckerberg's absence illustrated by an empty committee chair - a piece of Westminster theatre that also played out at the first meeting of the grand committee in the United Kingdom last fall - politicians considered the possibility of subjecting the social media magnate to personal liability for corporate decisions, a measure recommended by research in Motion founder Jim Balsillie.</p><p>\"I guarantee you that sobers the mind and introduces a kind of prudence and conservatism into their behaviour,\" said Balsillie, who came to the hearing bearing an arsenal of ideas, including banning targeted advertising during the election campaign altogether.</p><p>\"during elections we have a lot of things you're not allowed to do for six or eight weeks. Just add that to the package,\" said Balsillie.</p><p>The discussion about the ban came the heels of google's announcement that it can't comply with the government's new election advertising rules and will therefore not be running political ads in the 2019 election.</p><p>Balsillie's proposal would effectively legislate what google has chosen to do for technical reasons, although the company was castigated at a committee hearing about the decision.</p><p>\"The one observation I would make is there are stringent expectations on commercial companies for data protection. What we've heard recurring from this committee and others over the years is that there should be similar obligations on parties,\" said Colin Mc-Kay, google's head of public policy in Canada, referring to the fact that Canada's political parties are not subject to any privacy rules. One of Balsillie's six proposals was to bring political parties under some kind of privacy regime.</p><p>Balsillie said that if the big tech companies pull out of various jurisdictions due to regulation, as google has done on election advertising, \"that's the best news possible.\"</p><p>Politicians who use the platforms to reach out to voters were split on the issue.</p><p>\"Personally I don't have a problem if it's banned on these platforms,\" said new democratic Party MP Charlie angus, who is vice-chair of the privacy committee. angus warned that any rules would have to extend to third-party groups, like Ontario Proud, a conservative Facebook page that has nearly half a million subscribers. liberal MP nathaniel erskine-smith, who is also a vice-chair of the House privacy committee, said broad, issue-based targeting for political parties can be a good thing.</p><p>\"If I know you care about climate change and I want you to know about my climate-change policy, then a targeted ad seems useful and important,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook's representative in Canada agreed that ads can be an important part of the democratic conversation.</p><p>\"The parliament of Canada has been very clear that the right thing to do for regulating election advertisements online is to maximize transparency,\" said Kevin Chan, the head of public policy for Facebook. \"In many respects it would be easier, but digital advertising has been an incredibly democratizing force for businesses and campaigners.\"</p><p>Facebook has pledged to comply with the government's election advertising rules, but much of the committee revolved around Zuckerberg's absence.</p><p>British MP Ian lucas referred to his no-show as an \"act of recidivism\" and expressed frustration that he wasn't present to answer questions about the Cambridge analytica controversy.</p><p>\"I've never seen a situation where a corporate head ignores a legal summons,\" said angus. The committee passed a motion allowing Zuckerberg and sandberg to be formally issued a summons whenever they visit Canada \"for any reason.\"</p><p>If they come here \"for a tech conference or to go fishing\" they will be issued a summons, said angus. If that summons is refused, the executives could be held in contempt.</p><p>National Post <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sxthomson@postmedia.com\">sxthomson@postmedia.com</email> Twitter.com/stuartxthomson !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Just add that to the package,\" said Balsillie. the discussion about the ban came the heels of google's announcement that it can't comply with the government's new election advertising rules and will therefore not be running political ads in the 2019 election.</p><p>Balsillie's proposal would effectively legislate what google has chosen to do for technical reasons, although the company was castigated at a committee hearing about the decision.</p><p>\"The one observation i would make is there are stringent expectations on commercial companies for data protection. What we've heard recurring from this committee and others over the years is that there should be similar obligations on parties,\" said Colin Mc-Kay, google's head of public policy in Canada, referring to the fact that Canada's political parties are not subject to any privacy rules. one of Balsillie's six proposals was to bring political parties under some kind of privacy regime.</p><p>Balsillie said that if the big tech companies pull out of various jurisdictions due to regulation, as google has done on election advertising, \"that's the best news possible.\"</p><p>Politicians who use the platforms to reach out to voters were split on the issue.</p><p>\"Personally i don't have a problem if it's banned on these platforms,\" said new democratic Party MP Charlie angus, who is vice-chair of the privacy committee. angus warned that any rules would have to extend to third-party groups, like ontario Proud, a conservative Facebook page that has nearly half a million subscribers.</p><p>Liberal MP nathaniel erskine-smith, who is also a vice-chair of the House privacy committee, said broad, issue-based targeting for political parties can be a good thing.</p><p>\"If i know you care about climate change and i want you to know about my climate-change policy, then a targeted ad seems useful and important,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook's representative in Canada agreed that ads can be an important part of the democratic conversation.</p><p>\"The parliament of Canada has been very clear that the right thing to do for regulating election advertisements online is to maximize transparency,\" said Kevin Chan, the head of public policy for Facebook. \"in many respects it would be easier, but digital advertising has been an incredibly democratizing force for businesses and campaigners.\"</p><p>Facebook has pledged to comply with the government's election advertising rules, but much of the committee revolved around Zuckerberg's absence.</p><p>British MP ian Lucas referred to his no-show as an \"act of recidivism\" and expressed frustration that he wasn't present to answer questions about the Cambridge analytica controversy.</p><p>\"I've never seen a situation where a corporate head ignores a legal summons,\" said angus. the committee passed a motion allowing Zuckerberg and sandberg to be formally issued a summons whenever they visit Canada \"for any reason.\" if they come here \"for a tech conference or to go fishing\" they will be issued a summons, said angus. if that summons is refused, the executives could be held in contempt.</p><p>National Post <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sxthomson@postmedia.com\">sxthomson@postmedia.com</email> Twitter.com/stuartxthomson !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

This is an edited version of his prepared remarks. \"Disinformation and fake news are just two of the many negative outcomes from unregulated attention-based business models. They cannot be addressed in isolation. To agonize over social media's role in proliferation of online hate, conspiracy theories, politically motivated misinformation and harassment is to miss the root and scale of the problem. \"Second, social media's toxicity is not a bug - it's a feature. Technology works exactly as designed.</p><p>Technology products, services and networks are not built in a vacuum. Usage patterns drive product development decisions. Behavioural scientists involved with today's platforms helped design user experiences that capitalize on negative reactions because they produce far more engagement than positive reactions. \"Third, among the many valuable insights provided by whistleblowers inside the tech industry is this quote: 'The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.'Democracy and markets work when people can make choices aligned with their interests. The online advertisement-driven business model subverts choice and represents a foundational threat to markets, election integrity and democracy itself. \"Fourth, technology gets its power through control of data.</p><p>Data at the micro-personal level gives technology unprecedented power to influence. Data is not the new oil - it's the new plutonium. Amazingly powerful, dangerous when it spreads, difficult to clean up and with serious consequences when improperly used. Data deployed through next generation 5G networks is transforming passive infrastructure into veritable digital nervous systems. \"With these observations in mind, here are my six recommendations for your consideration:</p><p>- Eliminate tax deductibility of specified categories of online ads. - Ban personalized online advertising for elections. - Implement strict data governance regulations for political parties. - Provide effective whistleblower protections. - Add explicit personal liability alongside corporate responsibility to affect CEO and board of director decision-making. - Create a new institution for like-minded nations to address digital cooperation and stability. \"Technology is disrupting governance and if left unchecked could render liberal democracy obsolete.

Just add that to the package,\" said Balsillie. the discussion about the ban came the heels of Google's announcement that it can't comply with the government's new election advertising rules and will therefore not be running political ads in the 2019 election.</p><p>Balsillie's proposal would effectively legislate what Google has chosen to do for technical reasons, although the company was castigated at a committee hearing about the decision.</p><p>\"the one observation I would make is there are stringent expectations on commercial companies for data protection. What we've heard recurring from this committee and others over the years is that there should be similar obligations on parties,\" said Colin mc-Kay, Google's head of public policy in Canada, referring to the fact that Canada's political parties are not subject to any privacy rules. one of Balsillie's six proposals was to bring political parties under some kind of privacy regime.</p><p>Balsillie said that if the big tech companies pull out of various jurisdictions due to regulation, as Google has done on election advertising, \"that's the best news possible.\"</p><p>Politicians who use the platforms to reach out to voters were split on the issue.</p><p>\"Personally I don't have a problem if it's banned on these platforms,\" said new democratic Party mP Charlie angus, who is vice-chair of the privacy committee. angus warned that any rules would have to extend to third-party groups, like ontario Proud, a conservative Facebook page that has nearly half a million subscribers. liberal mP nathaniel Erskine-smith, who is also a vice-chair of the House privacy committee, said broad, issue-based targeting for political parties can be a good thing.</p><p>\"If I know you care about climate change and I want you to know about my climate-change policy, then a targeted ad seems useful and important,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook's representative in Canada agreed that ads can be an important part of the democratic conversation.</p><p>\"the parliament of Canada has been very clear that the right thing to do for regulating election advertisements online is to maximize transparency,\" said Kevin Chan, the head of public policy for Facebook. \"In many respects it would be easier, but digital advertising has been an incredibly democratizing force for businesses and campaigners.\"</p><p>Facebook has pledged to comply with the government's election advertising rules, but much of the committee revolved around Zuckerberg's absence.</p><p>British mP Ian lucas referred to his no-show as an \"act of recidivism\" and expressed frustration that he wasn't present to answer questions about the Cambridge analytica controversy.</p><p>\"I've never seen a situation where a corporate head ignores a legal summons,\" said angus. the committee passed a motion allowing Zuckerberg and sandberg to be formally issued a summons whenever they visit Canada \"for any reason.\"</p><p>If they come here \"for a tech conference or to go fishing\" they will be issued a summons, said angus. If that summons is refused, the executives could be held in contempt.</p><p>National Post <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sxthomson@postmedia.com\">sxthomson@postmedia.com</email> Twitter.com/stuartxthomson '</p><p>SOCIAL MEDIA'S TOXICITY IS a feature' Jim Balsillie, retired co-CEO of Research In Motion, testified Tuesday at the hearings of the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy in Ottawa. This is an edited version of his prepared remarks. \"Disinformation and fake news are just two of the many negative outcomes from unregulated attention-based business models.</p><p>They cannot be addressed in isolation. To agonize over social media's role in proliferation of online hate, conspiracy theories, politically motivated misinformation and harassment is to miss the root and scale of the problem. \"Second, social media's toxicity is not a bug - it's a feature. Technology works exactly as designed. Technology products, services and networks are not built in a vacuum. Usage patterns drive product development decisions. Behavioural scientists involved with today's platforms helped design user experiences that capitalize on negative reactions because they produce far more engagement than positive reactions. \"Third, among the many valuable insights provided by whistleblowers inside the tech industry is this quote:</p><p>'The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.'Democracy and markets work when people can make choices aligned with their interests. The online advertisement-driven business model subverts choice and represents a foundational threat to markets, election integrity and democracy itself. \"Fourth, technology gets its power through control of data. Data at the micro-personal level gives technology unprecedented power to influence.</p><p>Data is not the new oil - it's the new plutonium. Amazingly powerful, dangerous when it spreads, difficult to clean up and with serious consequences when improperly used. Data deployed through next generation 5G networks is transforming passive infrastructure into veritable digital nervous systems. \"With these observations in mind, here are my six recommendations for your consideration:</p><p>- Eliminate tax deductibility of specified categories of online ads. - Ban personalized online advertising for elections. - Implement strict data governance regulations for political parties. - Provide effective whistleblower protections. - Add explicit personal liability alongside corporate responsibility to affect CEO and board of director decision-making. - Create a new institution for like-minded nations to address digital cooperation and stability. \"Technology is disrupting governance and if left unchecked could render liberal democracy obsolete. By displacing the print and broadcast media in influencing public opinion, technology is becoming the new Fourth Estate.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

That kind of activity, particularly the manipulation of behaviour, is \"repugnant,\" he said.</p><p>McNamee pointed to Sri Lanka, which banned social media sites in the wake of a series of co-ordinated terrorist attacks, as an example. That ban lasted nine days and was an attempt to stop people from spreading misinformation, confusion and inciting violence in the days after the attacks.</p><p>McNamee's proposal was just one of the ideas pitched at the International Grand Committee on Big data, Privacy and democracy held in Ottawa on Tuesday. The committee is part of a worldwide effort to bring massive companies like Google and Facebook to heel on such issues as privacy, hate speech and disinformation.</p><p>With Facebook CeO Mark Zuckerberg's absence illustrated by an empty committee chair - a piece of Westminster theatre that also played out at the first meeting of the grand committee in the United Kingdom last fall - politicians considered the possibility of subjecting the social media magnate to personal liability for corporate decisions, a measure recommended by Research in Motion founder Jim Balsillie.</p><p>\"I guarantee you that sobers the mind and introduces a kind of prudence and conservatism into their behaviour,\" said Balsillie, who came to the hearing bearing an arsenal of ideas, including banning targeted advertising during the election campaign altogether.</p><p>\"during elections we have a lot of things you're not allowed to do for six or eight weeks. Just add that to the package,\" said Balsillie.</p><p>The discussion about the ban came the heels of Google's announcement that it can't comply with the government's new election advertising rules and will therefore not be running political ads in the 2019 election.</p><p>Balsillie's proposal would effectively legislate what Google has chosen to do for technical reasons, although the company was castigated at a committee hearing about the decision.</p><p>\"The one observation I would make is there are stringent expectations on commercial companies for data protection. What we've heard recurring from this committee and others over the years is that there should be similar obligations on parties,\" said Colin McKay, Google's head of public policy in Canada, referring to the fact Canada's political parties are not subject to privacy rules. One of Balsillie's six proposals was to bring political parties under some kind of privacy regime.</p><p>Balsillie said that if the big tech companies pull out of various jurisdictions due to regulation, as Google has done on election advertising, \"that's the best news possible.\"</p><p>Politicians who use the platforms to reach out to voters were split on the issue.</p><p>\"Personally I don't have a problem if it's banned on these platforms,\" said New democratic Party MP Charlie Angus, who is vice-chair of the privacy committee. Angus warned that any rules would have to extend to third-party groups, like Ontario Proud, a conservative Facebook page that has nearly half a million subscribers.</p><p>Liberal MP Nathaniel erskine-Smith, who is also a vicechair of the House privacy committee, said broad, issuebased targeting for political parties can be a good thing.</p><p>\"If I know you care about climate change and I want you to know about my climate-change policy, then a targeted ad seems useful and important,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook's representative in Canada agreed that ads can be an important part of the democratic conversation.</p><p>\"The parliament of Canada has been very clear that the right thing to do for regulating election advertisements online is to maximize transparency,\" said Kevin Chan, the head of public policy for Facebook. \"In many respects it would be easier, but digital advertising has been an incredibly democratizing force for businesses and campaigners.\"</p><p>Facebook has pledged to comply with the government's election advertising rules, but much of the committee revolved around Zuckerberg's absence.</p><p>British MP Ian Lucas referred to his no-show as an \"act of recidivism\" and expressed frustration that he wasn't present to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica controversy.</p><p>\"I've never seen a situation where a corporate head ignores a legal summons,\" said Angus. The committee passed a motion allowing Zuckerberg and Sandberg to be formally issued a summons whenever they visit Canada \"for any reason.\"</p><p>If they come here \"for a tech conference or to go fishing\" they will be issued a summons, said Angus. If that summons is refused, the executives could be held in contempt.</p><p>National Post <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sxthomson@postmedia.com\">sxthomson@postmedia.com</email> Twitter.com/stuartxthomson !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

The committee is part of a worldwide effort to bring massive companies like Google and Facebook to heel on such issues as privacy, hate speech and disinformation.</p><p>With Facebook ceo Mark Zuckerberg's absence illustrated by an empty committee chair - a piece of Westminster theatre that also played out at the first meeting of the grand committee in the united Kingdom last fall - politicians considered the possibility of subjecting the social media magnate to personal liability for corporate decisions, a measure recommended by research in Motion founder Jim Balsillie.</p><p>\"I guarantee you that sobers the mind and introduces a kind of prudence and conservatism into their behaviour,\" said Balsillie, who came to the hearing bearing an arsenal of ideas, including banning targeted advertising during the election campaign altogether.</p><p>\"during elections we have a lot of things you're not allowed to do for six or eight weeks. Just add that to the package,\" said Balsillie.</p><p>The discussion about the ban came the heels of Google's announcement that it can't comply with the government's new election advertising rules and will therefore not be running political ads in the 2019 election.</p><p>Balsillie's proposal would effectively legislate what Google has chosen to do for technical reasons, although the company was castigated at a committee hearing about the decision.</p><p>\"The one observation I would make is there are stringent expectations on commercial companies for data protection. What we've heard recurring from this committee and others over the years is that there should be similar obligations on parties,\" said colin Mc-Kay, Google's head of public policy in canada, referring to the fact that canada's political parties are not subject to any privacy rules. one of Balsillie's six proposals was to bring political parties under some kind of privacy regime.</p><p>Balsillie said that if the big tech companies pull out of various jurisdictions due to regulation, as Google has done on election advertising, \"that's the best news possible.\"</p><p>Politicians who use the platforms to reach out to voters were split on the issue.</p><p>\"Personally I don't have a problem if it's banned on these platforms,\" said new democratic Party MP charlie angus, who is vice-chair of the privacy committee. angus warned that any rules would have to extend to third-party groups, like ontario Proud, a conservative Facebook page that has nearly half a million subscribers.</p><p>Liberal MP nathaniel erskine-Smith, who is also a vice-chair of the House privacy committee, said broad, issue-based targeting for political parties can be a good thing.</p><p>\"If I know you care about climate change and I want you to know about my climate-change policy, then a targeted ad seems useful and important,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook's representative in canada agreed that ads can be an important part of the democratic conversation.</p><p>\"The parliament of canada has been very clear that the right thing to do for regulating election advertisements online is to maximize transparency,\" said Kevin chan, the head of public policy for Facebook. \"In many respects it would be easier, but digital advertising has been an incredibly democratizing force for businesses and campaigners.\"</p><p>Facebook has pledged to comply with the government's election advertising rules, but much of the committee revolved around Zuckerberg's absence.</p><p>British MP Ian Lucas referred to his no-show as an \"act of recidivism\" and expressed frustration that he wasn't present to answer questions about the cambridge analytica controversy.</p><p>\"I've never seen a situation where a corporate head ignores a legal summons,\" said angus. The committee passed a motion allowing Zuckerberg and Sandberg to be formally issued a summons whenever they visit canada \"for any reason.\"</p><p>If they come here \"for a tech conference or to go fishing\" they will be issued a summons, said angus. If that summons is refused, the executives could be held in contempt.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sxthomson@postmedia.com\">sxthomson@postmedia.com</email> Twitter.com/stuartxthomson !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Central banks have purchased <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd2c6e2f-1a56-4ad5-9645-d260bbb91dec\"> trillions</url> of dollars of assets, banks have provided billions of dollars of loans and internet shopping has soared. Technology, we have discovered, has advanced at bewildering speed.</p><p>But despite these technological advances it can still take as long as 10 days to transfer money to different jurisdictions. And that transaction can cost up to 10 per cent of the value of the transfer. A payment from the UK to some countries has to go through four currencies and as many as five banks. </p><p>Cross-border payment systems still use message formats developed 100 years ago for the telex machine. For decades, they have been the forgotten corner of the global financial plumbing.\u00a0</p><p>The G20 has tasked the Basel-based Financial Stability Board (FSB) with co-ordinating the development of a road map to tackle the system\u2019s various problems. The FSB\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fsb.org/2020/04/fsb-reports-on-its-work-to-develop-a-roadmap-to-enhance-global-cross-border-payments/\"> first report</url>, which assessed existing cross-border payment arrangements and challenges, was issued in April.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d193.htm\"> second report</url> on ways to enhance the system was published on Monday by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) of the Bank for International Settlements, a hub for central banks and other financial regulatory and supervisory authorities.</p><p>Fixing the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/10/30/1572443857000/BIS--Moving-fast-and-stablising-things/\"> plumbing</url> matters. Global financial transfers were well over $20tn in 2019 and are expected to hit $30tn by 2022. Improving the cost, speed and reliability of payments would remove frictions that prevent many small businesses reaching out to customers beyond their borders. Six out of 10 cross-border business-to-business payments require some kind of manual intervention, each taking at least 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p>Better systems would make a real difference to many of the poorest and most vulnerable who disproportionately bear the cost of the frictions and shortcomings of the current systems. Remittances from workers back to their home countries are now worth more than three times global development aid. It is perhaps no surprise that many seeking to send money home turn to alternative solutions that are less secure.</p><p>These shortcomings have rightly been identified by proponents of frontier technology payment systems such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c5c4012-9100-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2\">Facebook\u2019s Libra</url>. Such \u201cbig tech\u201d initiatives have thrust payment systems into the limelight and on to the political agenda. But as the CPMI report makes clear, this is much more than a technological problem and it is not clear that frontier technologies are necessary or sufficient for the improvements we need.</p><p>The CPMI report identifies five key areas in which we need to act. These include a commitment to a joint public and private sector vision. They cover better global co-ordination of regulation, supervision and oversight arrangements. They include much needed improvements to existing payment systems, such as extending operating hours, expanding access and using liquidity more efficiently. They aim to ensure that different payment systems are able to talk to each other seamlessly. </p><p>The report also suggests exploring the feasibility of incorporating more innovative developments such as central bank digital currencies and global \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56db1f62-104b-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\"> stablecoins</url>,\u201d backed by some reserve asset.</p><p>Improving the system is a multi-dimensional challenge that needs to be tackled as a whole. Better, harmonised data standards will allow more information to be sent with each payment. But unless compliance authorities agree standards for the information they require, repeated compliance checking at each stage of the chain will continue to add delay and cost. </p><p>Similarly, the benefits of making it easier to transfer liquidity between two central bank systems can be achieved only if operating hours are made to overlap.</p><p>The CPMI and its member central banks have a crucial role to play. The pandemic and resulting strain on economic activity around the world have confirmed the importance of central banks in payments. Yet, while central banks sit at the centre of the payment system, securing major improvement in cross-border payments is a formidable challenge that goes beyond individual jurisdictions and their central infrastructures. It will require support from a range of public authorities and private sector actors on domestic, regional and global levels.</p><p>There is no magic bullet to achieve this. But the CPMI report shows how it can be done with sustained commitment and action by public and private sectors.

In the insurance article, \"AI and Insurance: What's in That Black Box?\" Laura Foggan, chair of the firm's Insurance/Reinsurance Group, explores how AI leverages big data to find correlations, inferences and predictions, and warns in-house counsel that cutting-edge technology could be a double-edged sword.</p><p>Additional articles in the Forecast include:</p><p>*Administrative Law -- The Supreme Court and the President Rein In the 'Administrative State'</p><p>*Advertising -- Social Media Platforms Face Charges of Political Bias</p><p>*Corporate -- Blockchain's Awareness Problem -- and How to Solve It</p><p>*Environment &amp; Natural Resources -- Now Is the Time to Prepare for PFAS Regulation</p><p>*Government Contracts -- A Secure Supply Chain Is a Competitive Advantage</p><p>*Health Care -- Will Health Care Be Healthier in 2020?</p><p>*Insurance -- AI and Insurance: What's in That Black Box?</p><p>*Tax -- IRS Draft Regs: OIRA Review Offers Fresh Opportunity</p><p>*International Trade -- Caught in the Crossfire</p><p>*Transportation -- The March to Digital Mobility</p><p>*Government Affairs -- A Surprisingly Open Door for Legislation</p><p>\"Not only is there no rest for those watching the regulatory front, but, driven by uncertainty, that front is larger and perhaps more active than ever,\" said Dan W.

When he does watch scripted television, it might be the CBC comedy Kim's Convenience or perhaps the occasional Murdoch Mysteries drama.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I actually don't watch a ton of programming outside news and sports,\" says the genial former telecom executive in an interview with the Star.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What Scott watches may not be consequential, but his thoughts on what Canadians watch matter. As the influential chair of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), he is responsible for setting and enforcing the rules in Canada's broadcast and telecommunications industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That guidance is needed now more than ever in a digital age where television choice has never been more prolific - with foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu competing for eyeballs with legacy broadcasters, those mainstream domestic brands that were kings of the analog universe, including CTV, Global, Citytv and the CBC.</p><p>\"We need new tools, we need a new approach,\" Scott says about the current state of broadcasting regulations. \"We have to come up with a model so that everyone who is deriving a benefit from the system contributes.\"</p><p>Canada's domestic television market has been upended by well-funded foreign digital broadcasters that are outspending it on content, production and scale.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Netflix says it would pay federal sales taxes. But nobody's asked it to</p><p>Canada must 'think big' when pondering the future of broadcasting laws, panel chair says</p><p>Apple's 'showtime': Netflix killer or just another drip in the stream?</p><p>Television viewers have never had it so good in the new platinum age of television, where A-list movie stars now gravitate toward the small screen.</p><p>But domestic broadcasters say they can't compete, especially with outmoded legislation that creates an unlevel playing field. They are appealing to regulators like Scott to fix the problem. At stake, they say, is the ability to produce Canadian content and culture - allowing Canadians to tell stories to each other and the world.</p><p>Broadcasters have long argued, for example, that online platforms such as Netflix don't pay into the Canadian Media Fund (CMF), which goes toward Canadian programming. They are also not required to collect federal sales taxes, which critics say is unfair to domestic programmers who do.</p><p>Scott agrees with broadcasters who say online platforms should contribute to creating Canadian content. Cable companies now pay 5 per cent of their revenue into the CMF. The European Union, in sweeping legislation on the digital economy, is also requiring online platforms to put a portion of their revenues into domestic programming.</p><p>\"If you are deriving revenue from the country, you should be making a contribution,\" Scott says.</p><p>But he is also quick to say that \"Netflix is not the enemy.\"</p><p>The problem, he says, is that the current broadcast system is \"based on a walled garden. If you want a licence, it comes with obligations. That doesn't work in a world where a significant amount of product is being delivered by the internet.\"</p><p>Scott argues that simply requiring the foreign online platforms to contribute in the same way as legacy broadcasters is not the way to go.</p><p>\"How that number is determined should vary by platform,\" he says. Requiring platforms to pay into the media fund may not be the answer. It could be a different percentage, or it could be based on other contributions, he says.</p><p>\"What we're saying is that it should be equitable. Not identical. You can say, well, why doesn't Netflix pay 5 per cent. But is that equitable? Can you apply that to YouTube or Snapchat? We need a new set of tools to be able to look at the industry, at different business models and how they can make a contribution.\"</p><p>What those tools will look like still has to be worked out. He gives the examples that Netflix and Amazon are making significant investments in Canadian production, so that could be seen as a contribution. Legacy broadcasters such as Quebecor's Vid&amp;#233;otron produces significant French-language programming. And the English networks have reliable, trusted news programming.</p><p>\"They all offer something. But they don't all have to be the same. What should be the same is that they be subjected to the same regulatory process,\" Scott says.</p><p>Netflix, meanwhile, has already said it would be unfair for Ottawa to force it to contribute to the fund.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" they argued in a submission to a federal panel looking at overhauling the Broadcasting Act.</p><p>Scott's ideas are also part of a submission to the panel, chaired by former Telus executive Janet Yale, that will make final recommendations in January. But arguably, he is the single most influential voice.</p><p>Yale urged an audience at the Canadian Telecom Summit this month to \"think big\" when it comes to revising broadcasting laws.</p><p>\"We must think not about what will serve Canada and Canadians well for the next few years, but for the next full generation at least.\"</p><p>What will be decided will have an impact on Canadian culture and the ability to tell our own stories. The CRTC has a mandate to ensure that Canadians continue to produce Canadian content. Funding those productions has become more difficult as cable operators have seen decreased revenue from cord cutting and the rise of online platforms. The less revenue cable operators make, the less goes into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian culture.</p><p>For this, Scott has something of a radical solution: Why not require that internet service providers who are profiting from the increased use of online video put 1 per cent of their revenue in the CMF?</p><p>\"People ask what's the connection. Why broadband? Because 60 per cent of the traffic is video. Why wouldn't they make a contribution. They're certainly benefiting. This is where the traffic is being carried and it makes perfect sense.\"</p><p>Insisting that the new fee \"isn't a tax,\" Scott has already met with pushback from the cable industry and it is doubtful that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government will want to add another perceived tax onto broadband.</p><p>Ottawa has already been reluctant to institute a \"Netflix tax\" requiring online platforms to collect federal sales taxes like other domestic networks. However, Quebec and Saskatchewan have been collecting provincial sales taxes since the beginning of the year.</p><p>A report released Fridayby U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. estimates that Canada is the fifth-most important market in the world for Netflix, with 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenues annually. The GST alone on that one company would be $47 million based on those figures, not including the various provincial sales taxes.</p><p>According to the Canadian auditor general, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue in 2017 because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes, a figure that would almost certainly be higher today because of the move by consumers to digital services.</p><p>But Scott says the decision to impose HST requirements on online platforms is ultimately up to the Department of Finance, and is not under his mandate.</p><p>\"What we need is a new tool kit and certainly the funds to do it,\" Scott says. \"Having online platforms is a two-way street. It does provide a conduit for Canadian stories to reach the world. On the other hand, there is advertising revenue coming out of the system because of cord cutting and less money going to support Canadian content. None of this will happen without funding. And we're suggesting a different way. But whatever way we go, it has to be different from what we're doing now.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

When he does watch scripted television, it might be the CBC comedy Kim's Convenience or perhaps the occasional Murdoch Mysteries drama.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I actually don't watch a ton of programming outside news and sports,\" says the genial former telecom executive in an interview with the Star.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What Scott watches may not be consequential, but his thoughts on what Canadians watch matter. As the influential chair of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), he is responsible for setting and enforcing the rules in Canada's broadcast and telecommunications industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That guidance is needed now more than ever in a digital age where television choice has never been more prolific - with foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu competing for eyeballs with legacy broadcasters, those mainstream domestic brands that were kings of the analog universe, including CTV, Global, Citytv and the CBC.</p><p>\"We need new tools, we need a new approach,\" Scott says about the current state of broadcasting regulations. \"We have to come up with a model so that everyone who is deriving a benefit from the system contributes.\"</p><p>Canada's domestic television market has been upended by well-funded foreign digital broadcasters that are outspending it on content, production and scale.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Netflix says it would pay federal sales taxes. But nobody's asked it to</p><p>Canada must 'think big' when pondering the future of broadcasting laws, panel chair says</p><p>Apple's 'showtime': Netflix killer or just another drip in the stream?</p><p>Television viewers have never had it so good in the new platinum age of television, where A-list movie stars now gravitate toward the small screen.</p><p>But domestic broadcasters say they can't compete, especially with outmoded legislation that creates an unlevel playing field. They are appealing to regulators like Scott to fix the problem. At stake, they say, is the ability to produce Canadian content and culture - allowing Canadians to tell stories to each other and the world.</p><p>Broadcasters have long argued, for example, that online platforms such as Netflix don't pay into the Canadian Media Fund (CMF), which goes toward Canadian programming. They are also not required to collect federal sales taxes, which critics say is unfair to domestic programmers who do.</p><p>Scott agrees with broadcasters who say online platforms should contribute to creating Canadian content. Cable companies now pay 5 per cent of their revenue into the CMF. The European Union, in sweeping legislation on the digital economy, is also requiring online platforms to put a portion of their revenues into domestic programming.</p><p>\"If you are deriving revenue from the country, you should be making a contribution,\" Scott says.</p><p>But he is also quick to say that \"Netflix is not the enemy.\"</p><p>The problem, he says, is that the current broadcast system is \"based on a walled garden. If you want a licence, it comes with obligations. That doesn't work in a world where a significant amount of product is being delivered by the internet.\"</p><p>Scott argues that simply requiring the foreign online platforms to contribute in the same way as legacy broadcasters is not the way to go.</p><p>\"How that number is determined should vary by platform,\" he says. Requiring platforms to pay into the media fund may not be the answer. It could be a different percentage, or it could be based on other contributions, he says.</p><p>\"What we're saying is that it should be equitable. Not identical. You can say, well, why doesn't Netflix pay 5 per cent. But is that equitable? Can you apply that to YouTube or Snapchat? We need a new set of tools to be able to look at the industry, at different business models and how they can make a contribution.\"</p><p>What those tools will look like still has to be worked out. He gives the examples that Netflix and Amazon are making significant investments in Canadian production, so that could be seen as a contribution. Legacy broadcasters such as Quebecor's Vid&amp;#233;otron produces significant French-language programming. And the English networks have reliable, trusted news programming.</p><p>\"They all offer something. But they don't all have to be the same. What should be the same is that they be subjected to the same regulatory process,\" Scott says.</p><p>Netflix, meanwhile, has already said it would be unfair for Ottawa to force it to contribute to the fund.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" they argued in a submission to a federal panel looking at overhauling the Broadcasting Act.</p><p>Scott's ideas are also part of a submission to the panel, chaired by former Telus executive Janet Yale, that will make final recommendations in January. But arguably, he is the single most influential voice.</p><p>Yale urged an audience at the Canadian Telecom Summit this month to \"think big\" when it comes to revising broadcasting laws.</p><p>\"We must think not about what will serve Canada and Canadians well for the next few years, but for the next full generation at least.\"</p><p>What will be decided will have an impact on Canadian culture and the ability to tell our own stories. The CRTC has a mandate to ensure that Canadians continue to produce Canadian content. Funding those productions has become more difficult as cable operators have seen decreased revenue from cord cutting and the rise of online platforms. The less revenue cable operators make, the less goes into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian culture.</p><p>For this, Scott has something of a radical solution: Why not require that internet service providers who are profiting from the increased use of online video put 1 per cent of their revenue in the CMF?</p><p>\"People ask what's the connection. Why broadband? Because 60 per cent of the traffic is video. Why wouldn't they make a contribution. They're certainly benefiting. This is where the traffic is being carried and it makes perfect sense.\"</p><p>Insisting that the new fee \"isn't a tax,\" Scott has already met with pushback from the cable industry and it is doubtful that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government will want to add another perceived tax onto broadband.</p><p>Ottawa has already been reluctant to institute a \"Netflix tax\" requiring online platforms to collect federal sales taxes like other domestic networks. However, Quebec and Saskatchewan have been collecting provincial sales taxes since the beginning of the year.</p><p>A report released Fridayby U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. estimates that Canada is the fifth-most important market in the world for Netflix, with 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenues annually. The GST alone on that one company would be $47 million based on those figures, not including the various provincial sales taxes.</p><p>According to the Canadian auditor general, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue in 2017 because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes, a figure that would almost certainly be higher today because of the move by consumers to digital services.</p><p>But Scott says the decision to impose HST requirements on online platforms is ultimately up to the Department of Finance, and is not under his mandate.</p><p>\"What we need is a new tool kit and certainly the funds to do it,\" Scott says. \"Having online platforms is a two-way street. It does provide a conduit for Canadian stories to reach the world. On the other hand, there is advertising revenue coming out of the system because of cord cutting and less money going to support Canadian content. None of this will happen without funding. And we're suggesting a different way. But whatever way we go, it has to be different from what we're doing now.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Requiring platforms to pay into the media fund may not be the answer. It could be a different percentage, or it could be based on other contributions, he says.</p><p>\"What we're saying is that it should be equitable. Not identical. You can say, well, why doesn't Netflix pay 5 per cent. But is that equitable? Can you apply that to YouTube or Snapchat? We need a new set of tools to be able to look at the industry, at different business models and how they can make a contribution.\"</p><p>What those tools will look like still has to be worked out. He gives the examples that Netflix and Amazon are making significant investments in Canadian production, so that could be seen as a contribution. Legacy broadcasters such as Quebecor's Vid\u00e9otron produces significant French-language programming. And the English networks have reliable, trusted news programming.</p><p>\"They all offer something. But they don't all have to be the same. What should be the same is that they be subjected to the same regulatory process,\" Scott says.</p><p>Netflix, meanwhile, has already said it would be unfair for Ottawa to force it to contribute to the fund.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" they argued in a submission to a federal panel looking at overhauling the Broadcasting Act.</p><p>Scott's ideas are also part of a submission to the panel, chaired by former Telus executive Janet Yale, that will make final recommendations in January. But arguably, he is the single most influential voice.</p><p>Yale urged an audience at the Canadian Telecom Summit this month to \"think big\" when it comes to revising broadcasting laws.</p><p>\"We must think not about what will serve Canada and Canadians well for the next few years, but for the next full generation at least.\"</p><p>What will be decided will have an impact on Canadian culture and the ability to tell our own stories. The CRTC has a mandate to ensure that Canadians continue to produce Canadian content. Funding those productions has become more difficult as cable operators have seen decreased revenue from cord cutting and the rise of online platforms. The less revenue cable operators make, the less goes into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian culture.</p><p>For this, Scott has something of a radical solution: Why not require that internet service providers who are profiting from the increased use of online video put 1 per cent of their revenue in the CMF?</p><p>\"People ask what's the connection. Why broadband? Because 60 per cent of the traffic is video. Why wouldn't they make a contribution. They're certainly benefiting. This is where the traffic is being carried and it makes perfect sense.\"</p><p>Insisting that the new fee \"isn't a tax,\" Scott has already met with pushback from the cable industry and it is doubtful that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government will want to add another perceived tax onto broadband.</p><p>Ottawa has already been reluctant to institute a \"Netflix tax\" requiring online platforms to collect federal sales taxes like other domestic networks. However, Quebec and Saskatchewan have been collecting provincial sales taxes since the beginning of the year.</p><p>A report released Fridayby U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. estimates that Canada is the fifth-most important market in the world for Netflix, with 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenues annually. The GST alone on that one company would be $47 million based on those figures, not including the various provincial sales taxes.</p><p>According to the Canadian auditor general, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue in 2017 because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes, a figure that would almost certainly be higher today because of the move by consumers to digital services.</p><p>But Scott says the decision to impose HST requirements on online platforms is ultimately up to the Department of Finance, and is not under his mandate.</p><p>\"What we need is a new tool kit and certainly the funds to do it,\" Scott says. \"Having online platforms is a two-way street. It does provide a conduit for Canadian stories to reach the world. On the other hand, there is advertising revenue coming out of the system because of cord cutting and less money going to support Canadian content. None of this will happen without funding. And we're suggesting a different way. But whatever way we go, it has to be different from what we're doing now.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

The question is, what does this ruling mean for you?</p><p>To explain it, we go live to London, Ontario, and technology analyst Carmi Levy.</p><p>Carmi, first off, what does this mean for the average person at home who is now on the Web watching Canada AM? Is their Canada AM going to cost more?</p><p>LEVY: The good news is: no, it won't. It's not going to change a whole lot in the short term, Scott. But what it does is it keeps the playing field more competitive, it keeps these smaller players in the game. It lets them offer things like unlimited plans, it lets them offer different kinds of rate plans. Whereas, if the decision had gone the other way, they would have been more constrained. And, quite possibly they might have disappeared from the landscape.</p><p>So, it's going to keep things more competitive. In the longer term it is going to keep a bit of a lid on prices. They are not going to go up to the same degree they might have.</p><p>LAURIE: What were the big telecom companies looking for?</p><p>LEVY: What they were looking for was a little bit more control over what they could charge these smaller operators for gaining access to their networks. If you're a smaller company -- for example, in southern Ontario we have TekSavvy or Execulink -- you don't own the networks. So, what you do is you buy access wholesale from the large providers.</p><p>So, what Bell was really asking for was, they said, okay, look, among their customers some of them are using a lot of bandwidth, they're downloading a lot of video and they're playing a lot of games and doing a lot of voice-over IP phones. And as a result, they are sucking up all of the availability on our network. We have to charge them more.</p><p>And the CRTC said, look, we recognize that you need to make a profit. But at the same time we don't want you to charge so much for it that you limit what Canadians can do online.</p><p>So, what the CRTC has done is they've compromised. They've said, okay, you can charge a fair rate, you can charge more for faster access, but you've got to keep it in line. Otherwise, we're going to come back at you.</p><p>LAURIE: Bell, Rogers and Telus have -- or Shaw -- have a lot of subscribers. How many people is this going to affect?</p><p>LEVY: Realistically, in terms of numbers across the country, not a whole lot. Because only 6 percent of Canadians are in fact buying their Internet service from these small providers. But that number is a little bit deceptive because in some areas -- for example, maybe outside of major urban areas or in certain pockets -- those smaller providers are very highly represented. They have a very significant impact on some smaller communities. And so, you know, basically it's a disproportionate impact. But if you are one of their subscribers, this is big for you.</p><p>LAURIE: Is this a victory for those small providers, or a compromise?</p><p>LEVY: It's a victory. In this day and age, any compromise must be considered a victory because in the past the CRTC tended not to listen to what smaller players said. It tended not to listen to consumers.</p><p>Whereas here when usage-based billing became a possibility, consumers rose up, half a million of them went online and they protested it to the CRTC. They signed petitions. They were very, very active on Twitter, Facebook and blogs over the last number of months. And so, it's a huge victory because here the CRTC essentially said: We got it wrong. We heard you. We're changing our policy.</p><p>This hasn't happened in Canada's regulatory world pretty much ever.</p><p>LAURIE: Does usage-based Internet surfing, is that completely off the agenda now?</p><p>LEVY: For now it is, but that doesn't mean that it's not going to be introduced at some point. This is a battle that will probably never reach an end. You're always going to have providers who are saying they want to change the rules by which they can make money. And you'll have smaller providers and consumers saying: Make money, but not so much off of our backs.</p><p>So, the struggle continues. But it's tilted a little bit more in favour of consumers and the smaller players this time.</p><p>LAURIE: Carmi Levy in London, thanks a lot for joining us.</p><p>LEVY: Thanks, Scott.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:548F-CY31-DYX2-9002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 CTV Televisions, Inc.

That's why executives at cruise operator Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. were surprised in 1998 when growing numbers of guests lugged laptops aboard and asked to check e-mail.  \"Lifestyles are changing. We never thought passengers wanted high-speed data feeds in their cabins,\" said Perry Sandberg, Royal Caribbean's associate vice president of product services.  The unexpected turn in passenger habits caused the entire cruise industry to change course.  This year, almost a dozen big cruise lines have Internet cafes on some, if not all, of their ships. That's up from zero in 1997. The upshot is that thousands of passengers on scores of ships are surfing the Web via onboard satellite links.  Sending Photos Back Home Most passengers use the Net to send and receive e-mail or check stock quotes. Another favorite is sending digital photos to friends and family ashore.  The money spent in equipping seagoing Internet cafes isn't large. Most Internet cafes on cruise ships have 10-20 PCs wired to a satellite antenna. Some ships have more than one cafe. The cost per cafe is some $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 when items like PCs and satellite links are factored in.  A less-known point is that Internet access for passengers also opens the door to other online technology aboard these giant ships. Once a cruise line wires a ship to give online access, the trend is to put other ship operations online.</p><p>It's this aspect of the cruise industry's thirst for Internet technology that can mean profits for big companies. IBM Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., for example, got entree to the industry by selling cruise companies PCs, flat screens and other devices used in Internet cafes.  But big tech players like this are also selling other online technology that goes into a ship's communications, safety and entertainment systems. \"Cruise lines are a very important market for IBM. We're actively involved with a lot of the IT infrastructure side of these ships, which is really our strong suit,\" said IBM spokeswoman Linda Hanson.  Other big tech firms like AT&amp;T Corp., Oracle Corp. and Unisys Corp. are taking advantage of this niche market. AT&amp;T supplies wireless systems on cruise ships. Oracle supplies software that runs online systems.  Smaller firms like Maritime Telecommunications Network also are carving out niches by providing the hardware and software that go into Internet cafes.  Nobody's sure about the size of the market for online technology on cruise ships. Cruise lines are based in different nations, and there are no industrywide reporting standards on such spending.  But most analysts reckon the total figure is in the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.  The demand for Internet-related technology is expected to surge as these ships, some of which are as long as Navy carriers, serve more passengers and get more complex.  Cruise lines with Internet services for passengers include Carnival Corp., Norwegian Cruise Lines Ltd., P&amp;O Princess Cruises and Radisson Seven Seas Cruises.  Royal Caribbean, for example, carries an average 52,000 passengers aboard ship weekly. All of its ships have Internet cafes.  Profit-Sharing Deal Maritime Telecommunications made its mark five years ago by becoming the first to outfit cruise ships with fully equipped Internet cafes. The company operates its cafes as onboard concessions, sharing its profit with cruise operators.  Miramar, Fla.-based MTN is a unit of business communications firm Verestar Inc. Verestar is owned by American Tower Corp., a provider of wireless and broadcast tech.  MTN's Senior Vice President Brad Briggs says cruise ships are beginning to resemble floating online cities. \"They're running full online networks aboard,\" Briggs said.  The systems include multiple voice and data lines and PBX switches that regulate telecom traffic to and from the ship. Wireless technology also is becoming common.  Since Royal Caribbean opened its first Internet kiosk on its Voyager flagship in 1999, all 21 ships in its fleet are linked to onshore data centers via satellite Internet links.  This wide area network, or WAN, is similar to satellite-based communications on Navy ships. The network was built with IBM's help.  Reports come from data centers at Royal Caribbean's Miami headquarters. Online feeds reach the ship through the same satellite antennas passengers use to access the Net.  \"It's basically a 24-7 satellite hookup between our ships and shore sites where staff can access weather and other key reports,\" Sandberg said.  \"Lifestyles are changing. We never thought passengers wanted high-speed data feeds in their cabins.\" Perry Sandberg, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:45FC-DW10-003M-X3VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>March 26, 2002, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>\u00a0AT&amp;T INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>\u00a0INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0HEWLETT-PACKARD CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>\u00a0UNISYS CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>RCL (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>\u00a0T (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0ORCL (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>\u00a0IBM (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>\u00a0IBM (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0HPQ (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>\u00a0USY (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>\u00a0UIS (SWX)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>\u00a0UIS (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>\u00a0AT&amp;T INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>\u00a0INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>\u00a0HEWLETT-PACKARD CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>\u00a0UNISYS CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fixed Satellite Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkE2NjYyOUIzRTJFNDcwNjhCMDE1RkM3MDU1RTg1NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDAxNTAwQTRFOTc5NDVFQTlBNTdBOUNGMTdENDNBMjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Management Analysis &amp;

Bush. Schumer has announced that he has no intention of voting for Kavanaugh, so why does he need to see the documents if his mind is already made up? Presumably, Mr. Schumer announced that he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination before he read the judge's 307 written opinions and the many other opinions he joined. Certainly, it was before he reviewed the more than 17,000 pages Judge Kavanaugh provided to the committee in response to our bipartisan questionnaire and an estimated one million pages of documents the committee has requested from the Bush White House, where Judge Kavanaugh once worked.It stands to reason that Senator Schumer wasn't too concerned about Judge Kavanaugh's record before he announced his opposition. Why is it so important to Senator Schumer now?</p><p>Democratic leaders are demanding access to every page from every email and every paper record from every one of the hundreds of White House aides who came and went during the entire eight years of President Bush's time in office. This includes records that merely mention Judge Kavanaugh's name and records he's never seen. That is not reasonable. As I have made clear, I will not put taxpayers on the hook for a fishing expedition.These documents include those from Judge Kavanaugh's time as White House staff secretary, a post that manages the paper flow into and out of the Oval Office. They are both the least relevant documents to the nomination and the most sensitive to the executive branch, two considerations that have guided previous review processes. They're extremely sensitive because they contain policy advice that went directly to President Bush, and the policy directives that came directly from him, on the full range of presidential responsibilities, including national security.The staff secretary is an important position, but it's decidedly less revealing of Judge Kavanaugh's legal thinking than his 12 years as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and his legal service in the White House Counsel's Office and the Office of Independent Counsel\u2014roles in which he acted as a lawyer. The staff secretary documents consist largely of materials Judge Kavanaugh didn't write. They were prepared by policy advisers across the executive branch. The materials are also saturated with irrelevant documents\u2014including miscellaneous news clippings, the daily schedule, and even the White House lunch menu....So recent complaints from Mr. Schumer and other Democrats about the scope of records requests ring hollow, especially coming from senators who have already declared their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh and initially refused even to meet with him....The next time you hear complaints about the Senate Judiciary Committee's vetting process\u2014the most extensive and transparent in history\u2014remember Mr. Schumer's pledge to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with everything he's got. How much more do Democratic leaders need to know when they're already voting no?Exactly. I'm glad that Grassley is signaling that he's not going to fall for these stalling tactics. David French writes in the NYT [2]about the banning of Alex Jones by Apple, Facebook and YouTube. As French and anyone with a moral sense acknowledges, Alex Jones is a loathsome person. But there is another method for tackling his disgusting statements - slander and libel laws rather than having private companies deciding suddenly that his language is too objectionable for their platforms. Let me start by making a few things abundantly clear. First, Alex Jones is a loathsome conspiracy theorist who generates loathsome content. Second, there is no First Amendment violation when a private company chooses to boot anyone off a private platform. Third, it seems reasonably clear that Mr. Jones's content isn't just morally repugnant, it's also legally problematic. He makes wild, false claims that may well cross the line into libel and slander.Right now, Mr. Jones is defending lawsuits filed by multiple Sandy Hook Elementary families accusing him of making intentionally false factual statements. Most appallingly, he has insisted that these grieving families were faking their pain: 'I've looked at it and undoubtedly there's a cover-up, there's actors, they're manipulating, they've been caught lying and they were preplanning before it and rolled out with it.'So on Monday, when Apple, Facebook and YouTube acted \u2014 in seemingly coordinated fashion \u2014 to remove the vast bulk of Mr. Jones's content from their sites, there's no cause for worry, right? After all, this was an act of necessary public hygiene. A terrible human being who has no regard for truth or decency is finally getting what he deserves.The problem is the subjectivity of the sites' decisions. Rather than applying objective standards that resonate with American law and American traditions of respect for free speech and the marketplace of ideas, the companies applied subjective standards that are subject to considerable abuse. Apple said it 'does not tolerate hate speech.' Facebook accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against 'glorifying violence' or using 'dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.' YouTube accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against 'hate speech and harassment.'These policies sound good on first reading, but they are extraordinarily vague. We live in times when the slightest deviation from the latest and ever-changing social justice style guide is deemed bigoted and, yes, 'dehumanizing.' We live in a world where the Southern Poverty Law Center, a formerly respected civil-rights organization, abuses its past trust to label a host of mainstream organizations (including my former employer, the Alliance Defending Freedom) and individuals as 'hate groups,' 'white nationalists' or 'anti-Muslim extremists,' based sometimes on disagreements about theology or sexual morality or sometimes on outright misreadings and misrepresentations of an individual's beliefs and views.Exhibit A of how wrong the center has been: In June, it paid Maajid Nawaz $3.375 million for labeling him an 'anti-Muslim extremist.' This is rich, considered Mr. Nawaz is a former Islamist turned Muslim reformer.Yet Big Tech still listens to the Southern Poverty Law Center and takes action to punish its targets. Amazon recently booted Alliance Defending Freedom from its AmazonSmile charity program because of the center's designation....One doesn't even have to look to Big Tech to see the almost infinite malleability of the 'hate speech' label. In the name of stopping hate speech, university mobs have turned their ire not just against alt-right figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer, but also against the most mainstream of conservative voices, like Ben Shapiro and Heather Mac Donald.Dissenting progressives aren't spared, either. Just ask Evergreen State College's Bret Weinstein, who was hounded out of a job after refusing to participate in a 'day of absence' protest in which white students and faculty members were supposed to leave campus for the day to give students and faculty members of color exclusive access to the college.Rather than having these private companies decide on their own what is objectionable to them with vague definitions of hate speech, it would be better, French argues to make their decisions based on the legal definitions of libel and slander.To be sure, this would tie their hands more: Unlike 'hate speech,' libel and slander have legal meanings. There is a long history of using libel and slander laws to protect especially private figures from false claims. It's properly more difficult to use those laws to punish allegations directed at public figures, but even then there are limits on intentionally false factual claims.It's a high bar. But it's a bar that respects the marketplace of ideas, avoids the politically charged battle over ever-shifting norms in language and culture and provides protection for aggrieved parties. Nor do tech companies have to wait for sometimes yearslong legal processes to work themselves out. They can use their greater degree of freedom to conduct their own investigations. Those investigations would rightly be based on concrete legal standards, not wholly subjective measures of offensiveness.Private corporations can ban whoever they like. But if companies like Facebook are eager to navigate speech controversies in good faith, they would do well to learn from the centuries of legal developments in American law. When creating a true marketplace of ideas, why not let the First Amendment be your guide?Sounds like a much more reasonable standard than something as amorphous and subjective as \"hate speech.\"Ben Shapiro, who has been a target of personal attacks from Jones and thinks Jones is a vile person, also criticizes the decision by these companies to ban him. But, as Shapiro argues, the Left won't stop with Alex Jones.But I'm far more concerned with social-media arbiters suddenly deciding that vague 'hate speech' standards ought to govern our common spaces than I am with the daily dose of detritus distributed by this delirious dunce. Social-media giants had a choice here. If they wanted Jones gone, they could simply have defined a standard limit on the number of debunked conspiracy theories one could peddle on the site before being banned, or they could have created a standard prohibiting public threats.Instead, they chose the most politically correct way of booting Jones: They claimed he'd violated undefined standards regarding 'hate.' That's why so many on the right are rushing to Jones's defense \u2014 not because they like Jones or anything he stands for, but because the Left is happy to apply double standards under the rubric of 'anti-hate measures.'To see how, we only need to examine the last week of news. Sarah Jeong, the newest member of the New York Times editorial board, has tweeted dozens of times, in racist fashion, about white people. The Left defended Jeong, not on the grounds that the New York Times ought to ignore social-media mobbing, but on the grounds that people of color can't be racist. Were Jeong white, the Left dutifully explained, she would justifiably be fired; but since she is an Asian-American graduate of Berkeley and Harvard Law School, she's a victim of the white patriarchy, and thus fully entitled to use racist slurs to target those with less melanin in their skin. 'Hate speech,' it seems, only runs one way.And it only applies to particular viewpoints, too. Suggest that Caitlyn Jenner is a man, and you might be violating crucial social-media 'hate speech' taboos; suggest that the Jews are bloodsucking demons, as Louis Farrakhan does, and the leaders of the Women's March will still hobnob with you.Is it any wonder, then, that conservatives don't trust social-media hall monitors to apply their alleged rules with equal vigilance? It's demonstrative of the echo chamber that is Silicon Valley that rather than going after Jones on some semblance of an objective standard, they went directly for the buzzwords that will be most popular among those who love Sarah Jeong.Unfortunately, the informal implementation of left-wing 'hate speech' standards will likely be only a precursor to far more devastating culture wars to come. That's because the Left does not operate in good faith. People of rational mind agree that Jones is a never-ending font of silly garbage. But the Left won't leave it at Jones, which is why the social-media giants didn't craft an objective standard to apply.Robby Soave also weighs in[3] to argue that the issue isn't free speech, - after all, these are private companies - but the \"incoherence of 'hate speech.'\" Facebook doesn't actually need a reason to ban people from its platform. It can take virtually any action it thinks will improve the user experience. It could ban all conservatives tomorrow if it so desired.Facebook did give a reason for banning Jones, though, and it's a fairly weak and ill-defined one. \"As a result of reports we received, last week, we removed four videos on four Facebook Pages for violating our hate speech and bullying policies,\" the company explained. The problem was not that Jones was lying, or engaged in libel, or spreading fake news. The problem was hate speech. But we don't know which statements he made were deemed hateful, or why. We don't know if Jones is being singled out, or if anyone who said the things he said would be banned. We don't know if a statement has to be targeted at a particular person to count as bullying, or whether generic trutherism could fit the bill.I'm saying this for a third time so that I'm not misunderstood: Facebook can define hate speech however it wants. I am criticizing the lack of clarity in its definition, not because I think the government should intervene, but because I am a user of Facebook who worries that a stronger anti-bullying policy will be difficult to apply evenly.Jones has been engaged in the same shtick for years. I can't imagine that no one had ever complained about him before. So why now? What is so hateful or bullying about his speech that wasn't apparent last week? What prompted the clearly coordinated campaign to remove him from so many major publishing platforms?Soave quotes what he wrote in response[4] to Zuckerberg's comments that Holocaust deniers should not be banned from Facebook.In our modern political discourse, Facebook plays a role very much akin to the public square: a massive one, involving the entire world. The arguments for letting nearly all voices\u2014even deeply evil ones, provided they do not organize direct violence or harassment\u2014be heard on this platform are the same arguments for not taking the European route on hate speech: Policing hate on a very large scale is quite difficult given the frequently subjective nature of offense; we risk de-platforming legitimate viewpoints that are unpopular but deserve to be heard; and ultimately, silencing hate is not the same thing as squelching it.The story of what has happened with Alex Jones is a good trial of whether or not people believe anymore in the famous quote that Voltaire, apparently, never said[5], \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" Such an attitude has long been the classical liberal attitude toward freedom of speech. Sadly, it no longer is. Just about everyone can agree that Alex Jones is truly loathsome. Let him rant his ugliness. Let the courts proceed with the suit by the Sandy Hook parents. At least, if they're going to ban him, don't do it because of some ill-defined \"hate speech.\" Do it because he has made reckless statements about the killings at Sandy Hook that have led to harassment of grieving parents by his rabid viewers. What is more important is the precedent that has been set and where it goes from here.  For an example of how those on the Left will band together to try to ban speech of which they disapprove, witness the recent story about how journalists pressured the Newseum, the museum devoted to freedom of the press, to stop selling T-shirts that say \"Fake News.\" Their objection was that this was legitimizing Trump's attacks on the press. As Tunku Varadarajan points out[6], they were missing the history of the phrase which first arose by Trump's opponents to characterize how Trump and his supporters manipulated the news. Several months later Trump started using the phrase and was able to turn the tables on those criticizing him. But the media critics of Trump ignored that history and pressured the Newseum to stop selling the shirts.This sweeping mea culpa leads one to wonder how well the folks at the Newseum know their history. 'Fake news' isn't Mr. Trump's own coinage. He first tweeted the phrase on Dec. 10, 2016, several months after his media detractors had used it as a barb against him. The modern paternity of the phrase, in other words, lies with the people who wanted to kill off the T-shirt.But its first recorded use predates the Trump presidency by some distance. On June 7, 1890, the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune headlined a story thus: 'Secretary Brunnel declares that fake news about his people is being telegraphed over the country.'That said, the main objection to the Newseum's decision isn't pedantic. It has misunderstood completely the semiotics of the T-shirt. Who takes a T-shirt's text literally? Wearers put them on for all sorts of reasons, frequently in pursuit of irony. Donning a T-shirt that blares 'Fake News' on its front can just as easily be a subversion of the idea\u2014a slap at Mr. Trump\u2014as an endorsement of it.You'd think the guardians of journalism would get that\u2014even as they strong-arm a museum dedicated to free speech to pull a T-shirt whose message they dislike.Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono has decided[7] to ask judicial nominees about their sexual history.At the time, she claimed such questions were relevant because at least one judge had been accused of sexual harassment. The judge in question was Alex Kozinski - on the 9th Circuit - while the first judge Hirono asked these questions to was nominated to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Not that the difference matters, but it's basically like someone from Facebook asking if you ever embezzled money because someone from Twitter was accused of doing so. Same industry, different companies, and using one incident to justify asking inappropriate questions....Hirono in January asked Judge Kurt Engelhardt two questions about his sexual history designed to look like perjury if someone in the future accused him. Engelhardt was confirmed to the 5th Circuit despite Hirono's questions, and has thus far not been accused of sexual misconduct.During his senate hearing, Hirono asked Engelhardt the following:Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature? As Woehrle and attorney Scott Greenfield have pointed out, this is an incredibly leading question that has two unrelated parts.'This question deliberately lumps together two very different things,' Woehrle wrote. 'A request to your spouse for sexual favors is not illegal, even if your spouse says he doesn't want sex; by contrast, assault of a sexual nature certainly is illegal, and should preclude anyone who commits it from ever being a judge.'But as anyone with commonsense would know, there is no way to know something is unwanted until you ask.'Defenders of Senator Hirono's questions say they are appropriate because she is asking about unwelcome sexual advances, and sexual harassment involves unwelcome sexual advances,' Woehrle wrote. 'But that is as illogical as saying that because Aristotle is a man, all men are Aristotle. To be sexual harassment, sexual advances or other behavior must be 'unwelcome.' But that does not mean that all, or even most, unwelcome behavior is sexual harassment.'Woehrle points out that courts have up held that to be sexual harassment in the legal sense, the unwelcome conduct 'must be 'severe or pervasive' enough to create a hostile environment for a 'reasonable person,' based on their sex, and be 'objectively offensive,' not just subjectively unwelcome.'Kamala Harris, who is all set to run for president in 2020, is fully embracing identity politics. She just doesn't want to call it that. [8] But she's happy to advocate that Democrats should be choosing more women of color. And, by happy coincidence, she is a woman of color. Isn't that a wonderful coincidence?'I have a problem, guys, with that phrase, 'identity politics,'' Harris told the audience. 'Because let's be clear, when people say that, it's a pejorative. That phrase is used to divide, and it is used to distract. Its purpose is to minimize and marginalize issues that impact all of us. It is used to try and shut us up.'The left have become experts at flipping reality on its head, blaming others for the very behavior they project.Harris launched into the discussion on identity politics after noting the Democrats 'shouldn't just be thanking women of color for electing progressive leaders in 2018, we should be electing women of color as those leaders.'The California lawmaker declared Democrats 'won't be shut up, and we won't be silenced' on issues like playing the race card, abortion and advocating for illegal immigrants.'And let's be clear these issues that they're trying to diminish and demean are the very issues that will define our identity as Americans,' she concluded.Who knew that our identity as Americans meant supporting abortion and illegal immigration? One member of the Santa Cruz City Council has made a political gaffe[9] by actually saying what he really believes.A Santa Barbara city councilman inadvertently let slip the primary purpose of progressivism in 21st century America.The city recently criminalized the use of plastic straws. Speaking to that issue, Councilman Jesse Dominguez said, 'Unfortunately, common sense is just not common. We have to regulate every aspect of people's lives.'Got that? \"We\" are smarter than you and know what's best for you better than you do.That isn't a conservative using hyperbole to characterize the progressive agenda - that's a politician stating what he believes the real goal is. Now he's apologizing for saying what he really thinks.[10]The comment sparked an immediate backlash from people who read the quote in Noozhawk and other local media, wondering 'did he really say that?' Yes, he did, and on Tuesday, Dominguez apologized for the comment. 'I just wanted to apologize,' Dominguez said at the beginning of the meeting. 'A few weeks ago I made a string of words in a rhetorical fashion about regulation and they were not taken as rhetorical and that's my fault so I want to apologize.' Steven Hayward comments, [11]Now, we do have to admit that the good councilman has a point about Santa Barbara citizens lacking common sense. He's on the city council, after all. Sort of an inversion of the great rhetorical question both Thomas Jefferson and Ronald Reagan liked to ask: 'Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?'But 'string of words'? I know of a new editorial board member at the New York Times who will buy that, but otherwise I think everyone can understand exactly what the councilman believes. That 'string of words' combines into a noose for individual liberty. And common sense. Here's to hoping the voters of Santa Barbara recover their common sense and pull the string on Dominguez (and his 'words') at the next election, along with the other five knuckleheads who voted for the plastic straw ban.Maybe he can address exactly which aspects of our lives he doesn't believe the government should regulate. Tamara Berens explains [12]how anti-Semitism is a chosen strategy of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party's leadership. It's been clear for a while now that Corbyn has a history of hanging with anti-Semites and participating in anti-Israel activities. But Corbyn isn't apologizing or resigning as most politicians would have to do if even half of what has been made public about Corbyn's history had come to light. And other leaders of Labour with similarly ugly histories are remaining in leadership. It's clear that this is now a choice and that says a lot about the state of British politics.erate action to sow discord with both the Jewish community and moderate Labour MPs. The Labour National Executive chose not to fully adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism used by the British government, Metropolitan Police, and many other institutions around the globe. They opted instead to omit examples of antisemitism relating to Israel from their definition, including guidance that calling the creation of Israel a racist endeavor is an antisemitic claim. After reacting to the Jewish community's longstanding pleas for change with empty promises, the adoption of the IHRA definition in full was a prime opportunity for the Labour party to achieve an easy win. The choice to reject it should be seen as nothing less than a deliberate snub of British Jewry.As well as snubbing the Jewish community, Jeremy Corbyn appears to be actively seeking the silencing of his internal political opponents. Margaret Hodge, a veteran Jewish Labour MP, recently publicly confronted Corbyn about his attitude towards antisemitism, accusing him of being a 'racist and anti-Semite.' Ian Austin MP, supporter of the parliamentary Labour Friends of Israel group, also stood up for his values and made his disagreement with Corbyn's rejection of the IHRA definition known. They are now both under formal investigations by the party and were sent letters threatening \"disciplinary action.\"These investigations seem to be moving suspiciously more swiftly than those initiated by the party against Corbyn allies Ken Livingstone and Naz Shah.Finally, an old video recently resurfaced of Jeremy Corbyn linking a terror attack in Egypt to 'the hand of Israel.' The 2012 interview on Iranian-owned Press TV saw him pedal anti-Israel conspiracy theories in a discussion of a bombing where 16 Egyptian policemen were killed in the Sinai desert. His comments from 2012 were defended last week by a Labour party spokesperson, who asserted that his 'speculation' had been factually based on previous Israeli actions in Egypt.So why would he be doing all this? It could be that he's just an unreconstructed anti-Semite but it seems more like he's chosen this as a political strategy that he thinks will help Labour. It's also clear that Corbyn likes hanging with the sort of company that anti-Semitism puts him into. Anti-Zionism\u2014and by extension, giving credence to antisemites\u2014is fundamental to the worldview Corbyn has cultivated on his journey to political stardom. For most of his political career, Corbyn was a fringe socialist politician and supporter of the USSR, Syria's Assad, the Iranian Ayatollahs and Maduro's Venezuela. After becoming Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn toned down some of this support for radical anti-Western groups. Nonetheless, he has consistently maintained his support for anti-Zionist causes. What's undoubtable is that throughout his career, his ultimate goal has remained the same; rejecting Western values and embracing the alliance between radical socialists and Islamists in a strategic bid to normalize and implement socialism in the UK.Politically, Corbyn's strategy is working: According to a recent YouGov poll, 61 percent of the party believes Corbyn is handling accusations of antisemitism well. And 80 percent of the party deems him a good leader overall. The events of the past few weeks indicate that the Labour leadership has been able to build on their apparent success to formally distance themselves from the overwhelmingly Zionist British-Jewish community. This perhaps became most apparent last Friday, when Jeremy Corbyn published another article in The Guardian disregarding his part in normalizing antisemitism in the party. The piece came out at 5pm, when the majority of Jews in the country were busy preparing for the Sabbath.The reality is that support from the Jewish community is no longer an indispensable part of the Labour party. In fact, Corbyn's foreign policy\u2014a large aspect of his political differences to Blair's Labour\u2014rests on weakening UK-Israel relations. Corbyn has constructed a successful strategy for claiming the Labour party as his own socialist vehicle for disruption of the Western liberal order. Labeling recent events a 'scandal' greatly underestimates the strategic nature of his leadership. If you live in Washington D.C., as my daughters do, and already hate the Metro, now there is an additional reason to be contemptuous of how the Metro is being run[13].All of the new 7000 Series rail cars on Washington D.C.'s Metrorail subway system must undergo repairs to replace the cars' wiring, a new report says.According to a review conducted by Metro's Quality Assurance, Internal Compliance ...ersight office, the wire crimping on the cars was not correctly completed. The flawed wiring has and has been a factor in issues with the rail cars and can lead to major delays.As a result, all of the 548 new rail cars currently in service must undergo repairs that are likely to take a full year to complete. The review determined that Metro did not demand Kawasaki, who was manufacturing the rail cars, to conduct relevant quality checks.More delays - oh, joy. How can the leaders of Metro not demand quality checks?I lived in D.C. when the Metro system was built and first opened. At the time, I was so very impressed at its design and how it operated. It was so clean compared to other cities' older systems. It's still clean, but it seems to have slow-downs and gets shut down on some routes way too often.

About a decade ago, that is. The fellow of London think tank Demos grew increasingly worried about what was happening under Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the rest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally he confessed to a mild panic about the industry and opened his most recent book with these words: \"In the coming few years either tech will destroy democracy and the social order as we know it, or politics will stamp its authority over the digital world.\"</p><p>Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in what famously was his start-up's motto: \"Move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Because the tech firms haven't just had an unbounded Wild West opportunity to roam and raid unregulated territory.</p><p>Twenty-three years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so that the tech industry could have unique advantages. It was Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act that cast a magical protective spell to give the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms. Other countries, afraid of seeming uncool and anti-innovation, generally followed America's lead.</p><p>So the tech firms moved fast and broke a lot of things and now the governments of the world have had enough. They're no longer quirky, fun, garage start-ups. They are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet. Do they really need special legislative immunity from the consequences of their businesses any longer? Consequences like the propaganda and recruitment successes of the terrorist army Islamic State. Or the Russian government's subversion of US elections and democracy everywhere. Consequences like the exponential proliferation of child abuse images.</p><p>And the US Congress didn't actually grant them immunity from paying tax on their earnings - that's a little extra liberty the tech firms granted themselves.</p><p>After 23 years, the reckoning has arrived. The Australian government is at the forefront. It started four years ago with the Office of the e-Safety Commissioner, a world first designed to protect kids from cyberbullying and other web-borne harms. Now it also removes revenge porn from the web. It's been a success, which is why other nations are studying it and the tech companies are lobbying to curb it.</p><p>Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman-Grant, started her tech involvement with Microsoft when the tech industry could do no wrong: \"Fast forward two decades and the policy pendulum is definitely swinging the other way, with calls in the US for section 230 to be repealed and governments across the world seriously contemplating whether the internet industry should be more closely regulated,\" she told the National Press Club in Canberra last year.</p><p>Three examples of Australia leading the way on regulation tech firms. First. After an Australian man walked into two Christchurch mosques in March and murdered 51 people in a hate crime partially livecast on Facebook, Scott Morrison joined his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, to get a G-20 agreement to work towards the elimination of terrorist and violent extremist content online. The G-7 summit in France next month will develop the theme.</p><p>Second. The Australian Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan, had a gutful of big multinational firms dodging their Australian taxes. He went after the big mining firms too, but the tech companies were the main target. In four years, armed with new laws and a hand-picked taskforce, he's got the multinationals booking an extra $7 billion of revenue a year in Australia. And paying tax on it in Australia. Third. Last week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission delivered its final report into digital platforms.</p><p>Its chair, Rod Sims, spoke of \"many adverse effects\" that flow from the market dominance wielded by Google and Facebook in particular. In neat symmetry, the commission delivered 23 recommendations for action to protect Australia from some of those effects, one for each year of the era of untrammelled techxploitation.</p><p>The Morrison government immediately agreed to one of the 23 - for the ACCC to create a special branch to protect online privacy and prevent abuse of market power - and is considering the other 22.</p><p>There are two big caveats. First is that while Australia's government can be proud that it is leading in the much-needed regulation of Big Tech, it should also be working to allow Australian business to lead in innovation as well.</p><p>Second is that all these initiatives are positive, but they are piecemeal and partial. For instance, none of the Australian measures address Jamie Bartlett's larger worry - the \"manipulation, endless distraction and the slow diminishing of free choice and autonomy\" that Big Tech delivers.</p><p>Is Bartlett's mild panic giving way to paranoia perhaps? Read what Google's then boss, Eric Schmidt, said in 2010 and make up your own mind: \"You give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our services. We don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about.\"</p><p>That's not creepy at all.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is international editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc76fh4uo02xstvj6cbix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP2-0K61-F0J6-J48C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Too much.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just a little appetiser before the main course - a clear-eyed tour of financial regulation - as the banker-economist taps his years of experience as a director in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), from which he went on to helm StanChart as group chairman in late 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And top of his mind is greater regulation for fintech and other online companies that are growing their line of banking products. Mr Vinals thinks they have gotten a sweeter deal than they should have, and that the treats should have been rolled back some time ago.</p><p>\"These are companies which are paying, compared to banks, less taxes. These are companies which are less subject to regulatory norms. These are companies which are subject to lower data protection standards. These are companies which are subject to lower competition standards, in terms of antitrust, than banks. So I think it will be very important to restore a level playing field,\" he says.</p><p>Today, Alibaba runs the world's largest money-market fund. Big Tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have also advanced into financial services, giving banks a run for their money.</p><p>\"If you have a bank and non-bank that is carrying out similar activities which entail similar risks, it should be regulated similarly,\" says Mr Vinals. \"I don't think that it's too early to regulate. If anything, it may be too late. Data protection, and being subject to competition laws or arbitration laws - all of those things are very important, and I think (regulation) should happen and I think it should be done thoroughly.\"</p><p>Big Tech and regulations</p><p>Mr Vinals further points out that failing to regulate fintech or Big Tech is not unlike ignoring shadow banking activities, as relevant a topic as any particularly when 2018 marks the 10th anniversary of the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>\"I don't think there is any value in waiting to put in place regulations which may be relevant to the supply of banking or quasi-banking products, especially when it entails maturity transformation or leverage,\" says Mr Vinals, who holds a doctorate in economics from Harvard University.</p><p>\"Those are the two criteria that were applied for shadow banking activities. If you have leverage and maturity transformation, then that's something that banks do, then it should be regulated, because these are activities done by banks. If you're an online company and you build that leverage or that maturity transformation, that is also something that should be regulated like banks, in holding them accountable in terms of consumer protection, like banks are regarding sale of products to consumers.\"</p><p>But the challenge may be unifying global regulations, which gives rise to opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, especially for Big Tech companies that have services ubiquitous across the world.</p><p>\"Amazon has a global reach. Alibaba has a global reach. Apple has a global reach. No matter where they are located. So I think something which is very important is that we have global regulations, or regulations which are coordinated globally, consistent across countries. Because otherwise, you're going to have the opportunities for arbitrage. And that is something that we know is not good. It distorts competition, and can lead to the accumulation of risk in certain jurisdictions,\" he says.</p><p>\"That is the next big thing on the regulatory reform agenda, which is how to deal with the new technological front on the financial system, this new frontier, which I think is so important from the point of view of financial innovation, and which provides so many great products to consumers, but which need to get properly regulated as well.\"</p><p>Despite the Herculean task of coordinating global regulation, Mr Vinals is optimistic that the requisite cross-border cooperation can materialise. \"As with everything in life, it's complicated. But in the past 10 years, you have seen a tremendous regulatory reform drive, which has been coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, and the mandate of the G-20. I think the G-20 governments understand that it is important to have certain laws of the land for the new financial tech frontier, and that requires coordination.</p><p>\" The good thing is there are established regulatory bodies, which have been meeting for many years, which make very professional assessments of the risks, and which come up with very professional recommendations and norms, which are not obligatory for countries, but it constitutes a minimum standard,\" he says.</p><p>\"I think it will happen. I cannot tell you at what speed. But I think it will happen because the track record for other regulations is there, and the bodies for coordinating international regulations are there, and there are also the incentives for countries to play ball because I think global challenges require global solutions.\"</p><p>What Mr Vinals is now fairly certain about is that, 10 years after the crisis, the financial sector is overall more resilient than before the crisis. He observes as well that the non-banking part of the financial system is overall safer, with perhaps one exception: the exchanges. \"There, they need to have enough loss absorption, but also be subject to recovery and resolution standards, which provide some guarantee that if there are problems, they would not be 'too big to fail',\" he says.</p><p>\"I think there's been a significant change after the crisis, first because banks understood that the way they managed risk before the crisis could not continue; otherwise they would again get them into trouble. And second, because regulations have been put in place or strengthened, so that banks now have to have more capital, more liquidity, and better risk management frameworks. Banks are also more resolvable, so that if they ever get into trouble, they are not 'too big to fail', and they do not cause big, big troubles to the rest of the economy.\"</p><p>Taking up his appointment at StanChart, Mr Vinals was surprised by the lack of surprises for himself as he moved from the public sector to the private sector. \"Something that helped me was that at the IMF, I had been dealing a lot with emerging markets, and had helped to develop economies which coincide very much with the footprint of Standard Chartered,\" he says.</p><p>\"Perhaps, the only thing (different) is that the markets impose a time pressure. That time pressure is very visible; this is why there is a culture of performance that is very important that we have been strengthening over the last few years, so that the bank delivers on its corporate objectives.\"</p><p>At its heart, StanChart - while operating in 68 markets around the world - is a \"plain-vanilla bank\" that does things very much rooted in the real economy, he says, noting that the bank finances a healthy 6 per cent of global trade flows.</p><p>\"The bank has improved dramatically since Bill (Winters; Group CEO) came in 2015. But I would say the bank has improved significantly since I first arrived, not because I arrived, but what I'm saying is that the pace of progress has continued. I have seen the risk management framework of the bank improve very substantially, becoming much more developed, much more mature, and therefore, improving the resilience of the organisation,\" says Mr Vinals.</p><p>\"To be resilient is more important, because the more resilient you are, the bigger the ability you have to grow your business. Now we have a more holistic approach to risk management, a more developed and granular risk appetite, and much better capacity to run stress testing.\"</p><p>Given his vast experience in unspooling risks in emerging markets, Mr Vinals points to two risks ahead. The first is to do with normalising monetary policy, particularly in the US. \"The central scenario of gradual increases of rates would be favourable for our business in general. But if that pace of increase in interest rates were to happen more rapidly than is now expected, and were to be accompanied also by a stronger dollar, that would be a more challenging environment for many economies, including the emerging markets.\"</p><p>The second, which has gripped markets worldwide, is the escalating trade war between the United States and China, which is leading economies towards a new reality of trade protectionism, says Mr Vinals.</p><p>\"It is very important that we don't do anything to undermine the multilateral global trade system that has served the world economy so well and has allowed integration of more and more countries into this global trade system, and has allowed countries to benefit, including and particularly emerging markets in Asia,\" he adds. \"We should not undermine that source of strength.\"</p><p>Benefits of globalisation</p><p>He adds that China's rise in the global economy and as a key player in the global trading system, has had a very beneficial impact on other countries, particularly in Asia. \"I'm a big believer in win-win. Trade is a win-win situation, it's not a zero-sum game. China has gotten bigger and bigger in economic terms, but I think that that's a natural development. And the Chinese growth has been a source of strength, contributing to sustained global demand at a time when advanced economies were not doing quite well during the global financial crisis. Now the US and China, as the two largest economies in the world, need to find a mode to collaborate, to cooperate, so that we can perfect that globalisation, because I think that globalisation, in spite of the critics, has to be perfected but not destroyed,\" he says.</p><p>\"Sometimes, globalisation gets blamed for side effects for other things. For example, rapid technological change. Technological change is something that we all know is good, is a factor behind increased productivity. And productivity is behind growth, and growth is key for countries and people. But yes, there are distributional effects, where technology displaces jobs from certain occupations, and displaces jobs from certain countries. That is natural. But that should not lead to the conclusion that you should prohibit technology or invention. Rather, you have to address the negative side effects through appropriate social policies at the national level.</p><p>\"The same thing happens with globalisation. Globalisation has been, overall, favourable to countries, but not everyone has benefited equally from globalisation. That doesn't mean that globalisation needs to be abandoned. It means that you need to accompany globalisation with policies, which allow for a better distribution of the profits or the benefits of globalisation, so that it filters through society in general, not just certain segments.\"</p><p>Still, there remain concerns that China's mounting debt poses real threats to the stability of the global economy today, he notes. There are also fears that China's One Belt One Road strategy is one-way in terms of investment flow, creating concentration risks.</p><p>This, Mr Vinals points out, is precisely where commercial entities should step in, to ensure the soundness of projects along this new Silk Road. These commercial firms naturally include banks. For StanChart, One Belt One Road is a strategic objective; the bank hopes to identify and mitigate risks in projects. It instils governance and discipline into trillions of dollars in projects, he says.</p><p>\"I think that initiatives that tend to foster connectivity across countries, and that are conductive to more trade and more investment, are good for growth and development. Yes, this is China's initiative, but we would welcome it as much as if it is a Japanese initiative, or if it is an Indian initiative, or a US initiative. It doesn't really matter where good ideas come from, as long as good ideas are put in place.</p><p>\"Having said that, I think that while the One Belt One Road has important opportunities to be a win-win for all the countries involved - for China and all the countries present on the One Belt One Road - it is very important that the projects that are going to come associated with the One Belt One Road are projects which are planned, signed, and executed according to a logic that ensures and preserves their commercial viability, so that these projects can be really useful for countries' growth. So the issue of good governance of the projects on the One Belt One Road, I think, is very important to yield the private and social benefits that we are all expecting from it,\" he says.</p><p>\"These projects along the One Belt One Road are financed to a significant extent by debt, which is incurred by the recipient country. So it is in the best interest also of the recipient country, and of China, that these projects are well-designed, because the recipient country needs to have viable projects, so that these projects can generate the revenue that helps them repay the debt to China, or to whomever has helped to provide the funding.\"</p><p>If done right, StanChart would be tapping into a bright future overall for Asia as a region. \"The developed markets have reached a steady stage. But that steady stage is going to be perturbed and disturbed by what we're seeing in Asia. When we come here, what we get is a glimpse of the future.

Google's search engine is accused of stealing content with the goal of keeping users glued to its site, instead of directing them to other sources on the web. It promotes its own products on its platform instead of those of its rivals, even if the latter provide better service. An analysis of 15,000 search results by The Markup has found that 41% of the first page of Google search results is dominated by Google-run products.</p><p>Amazon, some allege, uses the data of products on its e-commerce platform to decide what to sell under its own brand. Facebook is accused of using its money muscle to simply buy competitors out.</p><p>How far they can allegedly go in scuttling competition is captured in the statement of Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who led the probe by the US Congress's antitrust panel of the House Judiciary Committee (the probe started in June 2019 and concluded with the testimony of CEOs of these giants on July 29, 2020). Cicilline said \"these companies as they exist today have monopoly power\" and added \"some need to be broken up, all need to be heavily regulated.\"</p><p>In the US, an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department is already underway (as also probe by states across the country on Facebook and Google). Soon, one may see action against the tech majors. Other countries have also swung in action. For instance, Australia has made it mandatory for Google and Facebook to pay news companies for the content. In France, Google has been asked to negotiate with publishers to pay for reusing snippets of content in its news aggregator and in Google Search. Where does India stand?</p><p>One out of three Indians has a smartphone and uses it to access information and interact with friends and relatives, a demand promptly met by Google and Facebook, respectively. Both get tens of millions of visits every day. As a result, many advertisements that were earlier going to content-providers viz. newspaper, magazines, publishers, etc, are now going to Google/Facebook. Likewise, searches which should have gone to service-providers such as MakeMyTrip.com or Yatra.com etc are cornered by Google.</p><p>In its February 8, 2018, ruling, the CCI said, \"Google was leveraging its dominance in the market for online general web search, to strengthen its position in the market for online syndicate search services\" and imposed a penalty of $21 million. It directed Google \"to not enforce any restrictive clauses on third-party websites for hosting Google search bars and ads\". The order (not a unanimous decision, but 4:2) came after several years of investigation. It was a typical case of 'too little, too late'.</p><p>The Indian online retail space is dominated by Amazon and Flipkart/Walmart. They entered as 'marketplace' operators; under the existing policy on FDI (Press note 3, 2016), a foreign investor is not allowed to sell directly to consumers. Yet, they are now operating as direct sellers. The policy was meant for the benefit of millions of small vendors, but Amazon et al are now dominant sellers.</p><p>The All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA), an umbrella organisation of small traders, petitioned the CCI alleging abuse of market dominance against Flipkart India Pvt Ltd, which is into wholesale trading/distribution of books, mobiles, computers and related accessories, and the e-commerce marketplace Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd. But, CCI saw nothing wrong in this practice.</p><p>It ruled that, looking at the present market-construct and structure of online marketplace platforms in India, \"it does not appear that any one player in the market is commanding any dominant position at this stage of evolution of market\". This was bizarre. That a few players-that too connected to the owners of marketplaces-are dominating the platform is visible to all! The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) rightly quashed the CCI order and ordered a probe.</p><p>In another complaint-filed on January 13, 2020, by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM)-alleging anti-competitive behaviour by Amazon Seller Services and Flipkart Internet, the CCI had ordered a probe. But, the investigation has been stayed by the High Court of Karnataka.</p><p>The regulator itself refuses to see that competition is being crushed, and even when it sees, its ruling is stayed by appellate authorities-thus, the increasing dominance of digital giants is inevitable. They also have monopoly over data which can be put to 'unfair' commercial use. Look at the partnership between Facebook and Jio Platforms Limited (JPL), under the latter's e-commerce platform, JioMart. With JioMart, the duo intend to connect 30 million kirana stores to every customer in their neighbourhood, wherein the over-400-million-strong Indian database of WhatsApp-a 100% subsidiary of Facebook-will come in handy.</p><p>In the absence of a law on data protection and regulation (a Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 introduced in the winter session was referred to a joint select committee for scrutiny), Amazon/Facebook/Flipkart will only increase their dominance in India's online retail.</p><p>India's regulatory wherewithal is far from being able to deal with the rising tide of global tech giants. When will it fulfil its role of creating a level playing field? One can only wait and watch.</p><p>The author is Policy analyst</p><p> Views are personal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THFIEX-0054248251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THFIEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P1-Y131-JB5M-W36M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365020</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000CNSR</classCode><className>MAKEMYTRIP LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ted Cruz (RTexas) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) want the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate how major tech companies curate content, and make public what the agency finds that's in the public interest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enor- mous influence on speech. The vast majority of Internet traffic flows through just a handful of these companies,\" the senators said in a letter to all five FTC commissioners on July 15.</p><p>\"They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely non-transparent,\" Cruz and Hawley wrote. \"Never before in this country have so few people controlled so much speech.\"</p><p>Cruz and Hawley said the FTC doesn't require a law enforcement purpose to begin such an investigation because it already has the authority to review the Big Tech firms' \"conduct\" and \"practices.\"</p><p>\"The possibilities for abuse in this area are alarming and endless. Apart from more salient examples of censorship like account suspensions, nobody knows who or what these companies censor or amplify,\" the senators told the FTC commissioners.</p><p>\"Most content curation occurs in ways impossible for outsiders to detect. Some content is downgraded: The content appears in fewer recommendations, lower on search pages, and less often in news feeds. Other content is amplified through the same means,\" the senators wrote.</p><p>Cruz and Hawley worry that such unaccountable power to shape what most Americans read and hear on the internet makes firms such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook \"powerful enough to at the very least sway elections. And we're told we have to be satisfied simply with trusting them not to abuse this immense power.\"</p><p>In addition, the senators said that \"companies that are this big and that have the potential to threaten democracy this much should not be allowed to curate content entirely without any transparency.</p><p>\"These companies can greatly influence democratic outcomes, yet they have no accountability to voters. They are not even accountable to their own customers because nobody knows how these companies curate content.\"</p><p>The senators' letter comes at a time when public concern is growing about the censorship powers of Big Tech. Conservative commentator Deneen Borelli's highly successful \"Here's The Deal\" show on Facebook was canceled when its viewership suddenly and inexplicably plummeted.</p><p>\"Because of Facebook's anti-conservative bias, this will be my last episode for BlazeTV,\" Borelli told viewers July 9.</p><p>Borelli's final episode received more than 17,000 likes and comments from 4,800 individuals. She said the decline in audience began shortly after she spoke in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).</p><p>\"It's obvious Facebook is a liberal platform and my first thought was that it was the company that was trying to silence my speech,\" Borelli told the Daily Caller News Foundation on July 15.</p><p>\"I am a prominent, female, black conservative. The left does not want my message to get out and resonate, especially with black voters who may be open-minded to hearing what I have to say, or women who may be open to what I have to say.\" Borelli said.</p><p>President Donald Trump convened a \"Social Media Summit\" meeting at the White House on July 11, attended by dozens of conservative journalists, bloggers, and tech entrepreneurs who claim to have been victims of Big Tech censorship.</p><p>Trump told the summit attendees that he has directed all federal agencies to examine \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Hawley especially has made going after Big Tech censorship and other abuses a signature issue for his first term in the Senate. Prior to being elected to the Senate in 2018, Hawley was Missouri's attorney general.</p><p>Since coming to Washington, Hawley has also introduced legislation to force Big Tech firms to make public how they monetize data about their users.</p><p>Another Hawley bill introduced earlier this year ends the digital giants' immunity to publishing liability unless they submit proof their algorithms and content-removal policies are politically neutral.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2262046354</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP2-DRV1-JC85-J2N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 491</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ted Cruz threatened social media companies Wednesday with regulation, echoing repeated charges from President Donald Trump and other top GOP officials that Facebook, Google and Twitter target the political speech of right-leaning users to limit their online reach.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At issue is the opaque process with which these companies make decisions on what's allowed and not allowed on their platforms.</p><p>\"What makes the threat of political censorship so problematic is the lack of transparency, the invisibility, the ability for a handful of giant tech companies to decide if a particular speaker is disfavored,\" Cruz said in his opening remarks during Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on \"Stifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse.\"</p><p>Cruz said he'd consider charging \"big tech\" with antitrust violations or fraud or could remove the protection from liability provided by a decades-old federal law.</p><p>Conservatives have offered no evidence of systematic efforts to suppress political speech. The Silicon Valley tech companies say they strike a balance between users' rights to freely express themselves and keeping hate, abuse and misinformation off their platforms. They deny censorship of conservative voices but acknowledge they've made missteps in moderating content. They also concede that their staffers tend to be liberal.</p><p>Democrats have dismissed allegations of anti-conservative bias as a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" Liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for Americareleased a study this week that it says shows that right-leaning pages have roughly the same amount of engagement as left-leaning pages on Facebook.</p><p>Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said Wednesday that Congress should increase oversight of the major tech companies but not over allegations of anti-conservative bias, \"which have been disproven time and time again.\"</p><p>Last month, Trump accused all three companies of liberal bias in how they police their online platforms, saying they harbor hatred \"for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election\" and threatened regulation in response.</p><p>\"Something is happening with those groups of folks that are running Facebook and Google and Twitter, and I do think we have to get to the bottom of it,\" Trump said.</p><p>Allegations of anti-conservative bias have become a rallying cry in recent years and have been raised in multiple sessions on Capitol Hill.</p><p>White House ally Rep. Devin Nunes, a Republican from California, recently filed a lawsuit against Twitter and some of its users for defamation seeking $250 million in damages. Facebook took fire last month for temporarily blocking the account of Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, after mistaking it for an automated account.</p><p>\"It's time for tech companies like Google and Facebook to start embracing the spirit of the First Amendment. Not just for their own employees, but for all of the Americans who use their platforms,\" Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said during Wednesday's hearing.</p><p>Neil Potts, public policy director at Facebook, told lawmakers that the company had spoken with dozens of members of Congress and conservative groups to assess whether it's \"unintentionally biased\" against conservative viewpoints in an inquiry into allegations of bias led by former Sen. Jon Kyl of Nebraska and a team at the Washington-based law firm Covington &amp; Burling.</p><p>\"Sen. Kyl and his team are now reviewing our external and internal policies. While conducting this review, Sen. Kyl and his team have also been engaged in reviewing and providing insights into future policy changes under consideration,\" Potts said at Wednesday's hearing.</p><p>Facebook has been a punching bag for conservatives for years. In 2016, reports that its moderators suppressed conservative voices prompted an inquiry by the Senate Commerce Committee. Facebook said its internal investigation found no evidence of bias but held a meeting with big names from conservative political and media circles.</p><p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied Facebook's policies are a product of its liberal cocoon in Silicon Valley but conceded that Facebook doesn't always make the right call when removing conservative content.</p><p>Testifying for Twitter, Carlos Monje, the company's director of public policy and philanthropy, described Twitter as an \"impartial\" platform.</p><p>\"Twitter does not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions,\" he told lawmakers Wednesday.</p><p>Missing at the hearing was Google. The Republican-controlled committee rejected the witness the search giant offered because he did not have \"comparable seniority\" to the other witnesses, Cruz said.

Google didn't provide a witness with seniority comparable to representatives sent by Facebook and Twitter, Cruz said. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., rejected a Google witness for the same reason in 2018 (see 1809050057).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook and Twitter witnesses conceded content takedown mistakes but denied their platforms are guilty of any politically motivated bias, as suggested by Cruz and other Republicans. There are isolated mistakes, but employees check political leanings \"at the door,\" Facebook Public Policy Director Neil Potts said. Facebook wants a platform with as broad as possible of viewpoints and free expression of ideas, he said.</p><p>Twitter Public Policy and Philanthropy Director Carlos Monje apologized to Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for the platform's removing a 2017 Blackburn campaign ad deemed \"inflammatory\" that included a pro-life message. \"We made the wrong call,\" Monje said. Still, Monje insisted the platform doesn't use political judgment to make any decisions about content or platform policies. The notion that Twitter would silence any voice is antithetical to its commitment to a diverse set of views, he said.</p><p>Monje acknowledged an issue in which Twitter's auto suggestions weren't populating with Republicans last year. The issue surfaced when the platform made an attempt to combat false information by down-ranking profiles with followers who had a history of bad behavior, Monje said.</p><p>Many areas of the tech industry need better oversight, but anti-conservative bias isn't one of them, said ranking member Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. Russian manipulation and harmful content deserve attention, she said. Anti-conservative bias claims have been disproven repeatedly, Hirono said, arguing Republicans like to bash traditionally liberal media. Hirono was the only Democrat present until Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., arrived about two hours into the hearing.</p><p>Big tech has the power to silence voices it disagrees with, Cruz said. Industry can create feeds that only comport with users' political agendas, he said, calling it troubling because of the amount of people who get news from social media. Nobody wants the federal government to regulate speech, Cruz said, suggesting three potential remedies: adjusting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, antitrust enforcement and principles of fraud. Cruz called Section 230 a federal subsidy that major media outlets like The New York Times don't enjoy. It's a town square with no mayor or body to oversee how the conversation is censored online, Blackburn said.</p><p>Potts conceded a possibility for unconscious bias, given Silicon Valley is traditionally liberal. Throughout the hearing, he repeatedly cited the company's work with ex-Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and ex-American Civil Liberties Union Director-Washington Office Laura Murphy on reviews (see 1812180050) to ensure there's no bias against conservatives, minorities or other groups. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said it's \"fantastic\" Facebook is talking to Kyl, but nothing is going to change unless the corporate culture does first.</p><p>Blumenthal suggested Facebook publicize the reviews from Kyl and Murphy, and Cruz agreed with that. Potts declined to commit to publicizing the report. Earlier in the conversation, Potts also wouldn't commit to saying Facebook is a neutral company, saying instead it's a technology company first.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVM-K3F1-JC8G-82NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He wanted Australia to be the world's \"model\" country. \"I want Australia to be in the leadership pack, if not even at the front of that pack, when it comes to our success,\" he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I want us to be the model jurisdiction in the world.\" This is an admirable sentiment, the sort of ambition and leadership Australians want from their national leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he was talking about only one particular field - the digital economy. It's a vital field, and a commendable aim. He announced a series of policy steps to tame the Big Tech buccaneers and protect Australia's national interests. Among those interests were the privacy of citizens. And, he said, he was also advancing \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these digital technologies\".</p><p>\"We want our cake and we want to eat it when it comes to digital in Australia,\" Morrison said. \"We want the benefits for the public and our economy.\" Absolutely.</p><p>His government is pioneering in bringing these rampaging multinational corporations into the realm of civilised behaviour. Morrison, with New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern, led the world in demanding Facebook and other sites prevent the live-streaming of atrocities after the Christchurch terrorist attack.</p><p>And now he's moving to the broader agenda. Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in his company's old motto: \"Move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Because 23 years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so the tech industry could have unique advantages, section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act. This gave the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms.</p><p>That is the root of the problem. No one noticed when they were quirky, fun, garage start-ups. But now they are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet, governments everywhere are waking up.</p><p>With the Big Tech firms blithely enabling child abuse, criminal fraud, rampant misinformation and foreign undermining of democratic elections while making vast profits from it all, Morrison stated: \"We are not going to put up with this.\"</p><p>So why stop there? On the same day, in the same press conference, he addressed the bushfires, drought, and climate change. Why not declare his ambition for Australia to lead the world in firefighting best practice and innovation, drought management and climate change?</p><p>But no. Suddenly the emphasis was on the limitations of Australia's powers, not the breadth of its ambitions. He didn't squarely address the problems but stressed that existing government policy was adequate.</p><p>\"The Commonwealth, the federal government, is responding to all of the needs that have been presented to us by our state and territory authorities,\" he assured. \"We have over 200,000 registered firefighters in this country. That is an enormous, an enormous national resource, which we value greatly. They are supported for their equipment and needs by our state and territory governments. And that is where that support is provided. And they deal with the Commonwealth for broader nationally co-ordinated efforts.\"</p><p>Good to know, Prime Minister, but hardly leadership. Decoded: \"It's someone else's problem, but we help when we're asked.\"</p><p>He made the case for Australian activism on the digital economy, but argued for complacency on the urgent crisis preoccupying his people.</p><p>If anything, he sought to minimise the current demands for help and leadership as being merely youthful hysteria at a bit of smoke haze: \"I'm a Sydneysider and I know how unusual it is to see that haze across my city. And I know how distressing that has been, particularly for young people who wouldn't have seen that before.\"</p><p>Apart from the condescension, there's the implicit assurance that it's all just business as usual. The former NSW commissioner of fire and rescue, Greg Mullins, says repeatedly that climate change has introduced a \"step change\" in the nature of drought and fire in Australia.</p><p>But Morrison knows better, evidently: \"I do remember Sydney being ringed by fire in my lifetime. I remember as a young fellow being down at the beach and seeing smoke all around as I looked back out from the surf across the sand and I've seen it before.\" What would an internationally recognised firefighting expert know?</p><p>With masses of evidence of the physical harm to Australia's people, the mental illnesses building up across a frightened community under stress, the practical problems of firefighter exhaustion, pressures on small business who have freed their employees to battle blazes and so on, the country is crying out for leadership. Instead it got excuses.</p><p>He didn't urge Australia to be calm about the misconduct of Big Tech, but he urged the country to be calm about the fires and the choking smoke haze that repeatedly descends on some of Australia's main cities.</p><p>Perhaps the saddest of all was hearing the Prime Minister regurgitate the hoary excuse for inaction on climate change - that Australia accounts for only 1.3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>This is what the former High Court judge and banking royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne has described as \"learned helplessness\" on emissions.</p><p>You could make the same excuse on regulating the tech titans. Australia this year accounts for 1.1 per cent of global retail e-commerce, according to Statista. Did Morrison cite this in announcing his plan to assert sovereignty over the digital economy? Did he say, \"anything Australia does will not make a difference\"? Of course not.</p><p>If Australia surrendered to this self-declared helplessness, it would never contribute to solving any shared problem. We certainly would not have fought for the defeat of fascism in World War II, for example, or taken part in the Montreal Protocol that successfully saved the Earth's ozone layer.</p><p>Morrison sees the whole complex of problems - fire, drought, water shortage and climate - as a political risk for himself and his government. After years of Coalition civil war over climate change, Morrison does not want to upset the delicate ceasefire. And it has worked for him. So far.</p><p>But the balance of risk is changing. The raging fires, the drought, the water shortages, not caused by climate change but intensified by it, are changing attitudes in Australia. Rather than play a grudging catch-up later, Morrison has the opportunity to lead. Not by rushing to take selfies with Greta Thunberg and announcing a target of zero emissions by Monday.</p><p>The big opportunity is to smash the whole paradigm that has held Australia in paralysis for a decade. Renewable energy is a multi-trillion-dollar growth industry. Australia already is participating, but largely in spite of federal government policy, not because of it. With an immobilised federal government sitting in the middle of the landscape, Australia is working around it. Households are installing huge acreage of solar panels, companies are investing tens of billions in new power generating capacity, state governments are setting their own renewable energy targets.</p><p>Imagine how Australia's economy could be energised, in every sense of the word, by a nationally co-ordinated drive to be the world leader in this enormous growth industry. Australia has the opportunity to be the lowest-cost electricity supplier on the planet.</p><p>This is exactly the scenario explained in Ross Garnaut's new book Superpower. This would be a competitive advantage for Australian industry and the entire economy.</p><p>Morrison has the opportunity to transform Australia's politics as well as its economy and climate policy. Champion an economic opportunity for Australia to lead in one of the biggest growth sectors of the early 21st century.</p><p>Rather than persisting with the dead-end dichotomy of \"cheap electricity versus climate action\", he can take the lead in enlarging an existing investment boom, creating a strong economy, with the cheapest electricity, and dramatically cutting carbon output as a result. He would be able to pledge \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these renewable technologies\".</p><p>If he were to move early, he could secure economic and climate advantage for Australia and shut out Labor, depriving it of one of its major campaign strengths. The politics of complacency can succeed against the realities of intensifying fires, drought, water shortages and climate change for a while. But not forever.</p><p>Fire season began in winter this year. This is not business as usual.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is political editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc78dtqhpsq9u10c0kabkt</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR7-V5D1-F0J6-J40K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

However, the next year and indeed the next decade is likely to bring many more ups and downs for the young industry, as well as for any investors that are considering dipping their toe in. A US$100,000 Bitcoin?</p><p> One of the more outlandish predictions for 2020 circulating among some crypto traders is that the price of Bitcoin could reach as high as US$100,000 by the end of the year. The sector's traders see Bitcoin's current boom and bust cycles, where its price rises and then plunges rapidly, as 'over exaggerated due to the scarcity of the asset and the sheer rate of adoption', says George McDonaugh, managing director of blockchain investment firm KR1 PLC (LON:KR1). 'They're saying that with the previous cycles we've seen in the asset class the next 'top' would be in the US$100,000 region if Bitcoin continues at the current adoption rate.' While the idea that Bitcoin could hit US$100,000 seems unlikely on the face of it given the currency is currently trading at around US$6,634, McDonaugh says there is some method to the madness. 'The [Bitcoin processing power] charts, new bitcoin addresses charts and transactions charts are all showing healthy recovery from the 2018 bear market', he says. Traditional sectors get in on the act Going into 2020, blockchain technology is expected to begin spreading beyond its original tech-focused borders and into other, more traditional industries, while what remains behind is expected to continue innovating new uses for blockchain technology. Health technology and associated uses of blockchain will become 'a big area of interest in the next two to three years', says Wayne Chen, chief executive of Interlapse Technologies Corp (TSXV:INLA), which provides platforms to buy and sell cryptocurrency. According to a 2016 report from Deloitte, blockchain technology has the potential to increase the 'security, privacy, and interoperability of health data' due to its decentralised nature, as well as providing a new model to exchange health information, making electronic medical records 'more efficient, disintermediated, and secure'. Chen says health joins other sectors, such as natural resources, precious metals and mining, that have also been gaining attention in the last couple of months as getting in on the blockchain act. Decentralised finance Other innovations worth keeping an eye on are in the growing area of development in the world of 'decentralised finance' (defi), a new monetary system built using blockchain systems. Defi is the idea that a decentralised blockchain network of borrowers and lenders can effectively operate a financial system with the need for middlemen such as banks, avoiding fees associated with traditional banking as well as allowing those without bank accounts to access loans and other forms of credit. Defi networks can also promote 'staking', says McDonaugh, referring to the practice where investors holding tokens in a blockchain network can commit those tokens to help validate transactions on the network in return for a fee, earning them passive income. The advent of decentralised finance is also attracting mainstream attention in the form of 'stablecoins', cryptocurrency which has a value that is pegged at a set value to a stable asset or basket of assets, frequently the US dollar. One such stablecoin is Facebook's Libra, where the social media giant plans to peg its value to a collection of stable assets including national currencies and bonds. However, defi and stablecoins have attracted criticism from various government policymakers and central bankers, mostly due to the lack of a clear regulatory framework and their potential for use in money laundering and the stability of the global economy. Key things to watch out for The coming year is expected to be one of rapid change for the crypto and blockchain industry, particularly as regulators in major markets such as the US and China rush to grapple with the technology and enforce new rules against it. Chen highlights 'a significant framework' of regulations that are due to come into force in Canada next year which will make many crypto companiesfall in line or face censure. Another potential regulatory flashpoint will be cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which instead of tracking stocks or other assets will instead track the performance of various digital currencies and be tradable on stock exchanges. These ETFs have the potential to remove barriers for mainstream investors to invest in crypto, as well as the potential risks of doing so. Despite these potential hurdles, Chen is optimistic that the coming year will see 'institutions from around the world acknowledge and embrace cryptocurrency' and wider use of digital currencies as a payment method. However, the development of blockchain technology, he says, will be less clear cut as 'more practically needs to be exercised for it to be actually useful'. McDonaugh, meanwhile, is expecting 'continued major growth of defi adoption' and the implantation of advanced privacy technology such as mixnets, a method of encryption that makes communications harder to trace, in the age of mass surveillance. Other areas to keep an eye on will be the public launch of Libra, expected in the first half of next year, which will expose most of Facebook's 2bn user base to cryptocurrency for the first time. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-PAIN113537157778678338375776100053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PAIN-113537</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW3-5991-JCMN-Y1BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><timeReceived>10:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Proactive Investors</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 31, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

WasickThe New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) announced early this week that it approved a virtual currency license for Seed Digital Commodities Market LLC (SCXM), and a virtual currency license and a money transmitter license for Zero Hash LLC. Both companies are subsidiaries of Seed CX Ltd. SCXM will serve as a matching engine and platform for cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. Zero Hash will function as the money transmitter for SCXM's trading activity. </p><p>In the announcement, DFS noted it has now approved more than 20 virtual currency businesses. In Europe, Prasos Ltd., a Finland-based cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange firm, was granted a Payment Institution License, enabling it to offer specific fiat currency payment services and to have a customer fund account from a Finnish credit institution. Prasos is only the third cryptocurrency firm in Europe to receive this license.The Japanese government has reportedly taken major steps to establish an international network for cryptocurrency payments, similar to the SWIFT network used by banks. A person purportedly familiar with the plan stated that it has already been proposed by Japan's Ministry of Finance and its national regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), and was approved for oversight by the Financial Action Task Force. In related news, the FSA recently announced that 110 cryptocurrency exchanges are in various stages of registration with the Japanese government. This marks a significant change - in 2018, the FSA approved zero such exchanges, and in 2017, approved only 16.According to a recent report, as of mid-July, the Bitcoin network is moving over $3 billion daily on average - a 210% rise since April. The spike in volume is significantly higher as compared with other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (which saw a 77% increase over the same time period) and XRP (up 61%).For more information, please refer to the following links:Corporations Continue New Blockchain Pilots, New Market Projections ReleasedBy: Diana J. SternName-brand food and telecommunications conglomerates recently announced that they have joined a pilot program to test whether blockchain technology can provide end-to-end supply chain transparency for digital ad spend. The Joint Industry Committee for Web Standards (JICWEBS), a British United digital ad trading standards body, developed the pilot that was first announced in May.Late last week, the fifth-largest oil and gas company in the world invested in New York blockchain startup LO3. LO3's Ethereum-based platform, Exergy, aims to facilitate markets for locally produced energy, like windmills or solar panels, where individuals can verify the energy they purchased came from those sources. According to reports, the platform will require tokens; and while LO3's ICO plans are on hold, the oil and gas investor has the option to convert its investment into tokens when Exergy is launched.According to a crypto media outlet, a major global technology company has increased its blockchain-related patents by more than 300% this year, with 108 active patent families. In other news, a multinational automation company is reportedly investigating enterprise use cases for blockchain technology, particularly permissioned blockchains, in areas including mobility, supply chain and manufacturing.A new research report revealed that while blockchain and the self-sovereign identity movement are experiencing an average yearly growth of 35%, less than 10% of dedicated identity apps are expected to use blockchain by 2023. Another recent report projects that the global blockchain and healthcare market will reach more than $1.7 billion in value by 2026.For more information, please refer to the following links:Libra Faces Skepticism, Virtual Commodity Organization Launches, French Law Set to Take EffectBy: Robert A. Musiala Jr.This week, David Marcus, the blockchain lead of the social media giant that intends to launch its own cryptocurrency, Libra, testified in two separate hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. The day before the first hearing, the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee circulated draft legislation, titled 'Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act,' that would prevent large technology firms from acting as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies. Also, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a press conference on the day before the first hearing, where he discussed money laundering and terrorist financing risks related to cryptocurrencies. Later in the week the president of the G7 group of advanced economies held a press conference, where he cited 'serious regulatory and systemic concerns' related to Libra.Late last week, a group of four major cryptocurrency exchanges - Gemini, bitFlyer, Bittrex and Bitstamp - announced the formation of the Virtual Commodity Association, a new self-regulatory organization for the cryptocurrency exchange industry. And in France, the country's Financial Markets Authority recently took steps toward approving the first group of companies that will operate under a new legal framework, set to take effect at the end of July, that is intended to attract cryptocurrency and blockchain-related businesses to France by simplifying and clarifying applicable regulations.For more information, please refer to the following links:Exchange Hacked, Analysts Warn on Sanctions, Miners Targeted in Iran and ChinaBy: Simone O. OtenaikeAccording to a recent report, late last week Japanese crypto-exchange Bitpoint lost $32 million in a hack involving XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies. After news of the incident, Bitpoint's parent firm reportedly shed 19% of its shares. In related news, a recent analysis by Coinfirm illustrates the movement of bitcoin stolen from the recent Binance hack into exchanges and potentially into other cryptocurrencies. The Binance hackers have reportedly been able to liquidate at least 1.8087 BTC (21,000.00 USD) on several exchanges.In a recent report on blockchain technology and economic sanctions, analysts predict that cryptocurrencies may reduce the effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions, which depend on traditional banks to monitor compliance. Currently, U.S. sanctions can still reach businesses in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space because many blockchain ventures still depend on fiat currency and conventional bank accounts; but the analysts warn that blockchain technology may eventually enable U.S. adversaries to operate entire economies outside of the traditional financial system if regulators cannot harmonize the technology with the traditional financial sector.According to a recent report, the Iranian government is taking steps to prevent individuals from moving their money from the rial into other currencies, including bitcoin. Iranian government officials are also reportedly concerned that bitcoin miners are abusing Iran's system of subsidized electricity to earn bitcoin by mining at significantly lower electricity costs. In China, late last week Chinese authorities arrested 22 people and seized roughly 4,000 computers used for bitcoin mining after a local power company reported abnormal electricity usage. The suspects allegedly used theft devices to dodge the power bill and stole power worth nearly 20 million yuan for their bitcoin mining enterprise.To read more about the topics covered in this week's post, see the following: </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111563811857954251762100042</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMK-3DW1-JCMN-Y34Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1294\"/><timeReceived>4:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 22, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN32</classCode><className>BLOCKCHAIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000436</classCode><className>CURRENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp;

Canada is already a hotbed for blockchain innovation. We can harness this technology to reinvent the financial services industry for the better.</p><p>This new asset class includes some familiar elements: cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin - blockchain's first killer app - and platform tokens such as Ethereum. But there are other asset types to watch:</p><p>Utility tokens are programmable blockchain assets with utility in an application. For example, Golem aims to aggregate the power of the world's smartphones into a decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use in exchange for Golem tokens.</p><p>Cryptocollectibles allow for the tracking and trading of both tangible (diamonds, fine art) and intangible (virtual pets, such as Cryptokitties) goods.</p><p>Security tokens are native digital bonds, equities and other securities that trade peer to peer. The Canadian Securities Exchange intends to get into this market. Canadian startup Polymath has made progress in this area, as has Toronto-based Extreme Blockchain Labs, which is repurposing its crowdfunding platform, CrowdMatrix, as a securities token foundry.</p><p>Natural asset tokens represent such tangible goods as gold, oil or carbon in peer-to-peer markets with real-time settlement. For example, the Royal Mint partnered with the Chicago Mercantile exchange to create Royal Mint Gold, a token backed by gold bullion in the Royal Mint's vaults. The entire commodities market is up for grabs, as is mass-market carbon trading, real estate and other hard assets.</p><p>Digital fiat money is cryptocurrency issued and governed by central banks. A year ago, Venezuela announced its launch of the \"Petro,\" a cryptocurrency backed by the country's oil reserves but not widely used. Implemented properly, these cryptocurrencies could make markets more efficient, transparent and inclusive and central bank policy more responsive to crises and shocks.</p><p>Stablecoins are native digital assets pegged to dollar reserves. While they make moving and storing value frictionless, they still require a trusted backer holding funds on deposit, not unlike a traditional bank. Still, they have gained popularity and must be taken seriously.</p><p>This Cambrian explosion of cryptoassets may precipitate one of the greatest reorganizations of wealth and transformations of the global economy in our history. Securities markets, central banks, carbon markets, loyalty points, commodities and virtually all other assets are about to go digital. We will see deep changes in our institutions, especially governments and banks.</p><p>Questions about these cryptoassets remain: how and whether blockchain will reach its potential, how the technology will scale and how incumbents will react. We view these as implementation challenges to be overcome. Canada has a head start, with its critical mass of talent, capital and a thriving startup ecosystem. With the right support of our institutions - banks, governments, incubators, academia and corporate leadership - Canada could be the proving ground for the future of financial services and reap the benefits for decades to come.

In early 2018, cryptoasset investors had overly optimistic expectations of adoption and utility. When projects failed to deliver, there was little to support their lofty valuations. We have seen this story before: people tend to overestimate the potential for technology short term and underestimate it long term.</p><p>Second, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which would have given more retail and institutional investors access to cryptoassets, failed to materialize as expected.</p><p>Third, many companies that raised funds in the underlying cryptocurrencies themselves converted to fiat currencies for cash to fund their operations, adding to the selling pressure.</p><p>A dispute in the lesser known \"bitcoin cash\" community also heightened the spectre of volatility and uncertainty. As did the poor performance of many cryptoasset investment funds, which has sparked demands among investors for redemptions of whatever was left. Finally, as we approach yearend, investors are looking to harvest tax-losses.</p><p>But this is not a time for animal spirits to go into hibernation. This is a venture market, and like all venture markets, it requires a long-term outlook.</p><p>The fundamentals for the industry are sound. Many compelling projects are launching soon; top talent continues to move from Wall Street and Big Tech to crypto ventures; and developers around the world continue to improve the code, build applications and dream up exciting new projects.</p><p>Ethereum, a made-in-Canada project, has 200,000 developers building in its native computing language, Solidity. Large companies such as Fidelity and VanEck are investing more in cryptocurrency projects than ever before. And beyond bitcoin, big enterprises such as Delta Airlines and FedEx are looking to blockchain to transform many aspects of their businesses. Facebook now has a number of blockchain job postings.</p><p>Some perspective is helpful, too: only two years ago, the cryptoasset market had a combined value of US$13 billion. Had it been a public company, it would barely have cracked the S&amp;;P 500 index, based on its market capitalization. Today's market is worth US$100 billion.</p><p>Furthermore, cryptoassets are one facet of the financial services revolution - and their price is only one indicator of innovation. Asset classes with notional values of trillions of dollars - stocks, bonds, collectibles and currencies, to name a few - could be transformed from analog to digital and, in the process, force companies, governments, investors and citizens to confront a brave new world. Canada is already a hotbed for blockchain innovation. We can harness this technology to reinvent the financial services industry for the better.</p><p>This new asset class includes some familiar elements: cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin - blockchain's first killer app - and platform tokens such as Ethereum. But there are other asset types to watch:</p><p>Utility tokens are programmable blockchain assets with utility in an application. For example, Golem aims to aggregate the power of the world's smartphones into a decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use in exchange for Golem tokens.</p><p>Cryptocollectibles allow for the tracking and trading of both tangible (diamonds, fine art) and intangible (virtual pets, such as Cryptokitties) goods.</p><p>Security tokens are native digital bonds, equities and other securities that trade peer to peer. The Canadian Securities Exchange intends to get into this market. Canadian startup Polymath has made progress in this area, as has Toronto-based Extreme Blockchain Labs, which is repurposing its crowdfunding platform, CrowdMatrix, as a securities token foundry.</p><p>Natural asset tokens represent such tangible goods as gold, oil or carbon in peer-to-peer markets with real-time settlement. For example, the Royal Mint partnered with the Chicago Mercantile exchange to create Royal Mint Gold, a token backed by gold bullion in the Royal Mint's vaults. The entire commodities market is up for grabs, as is mass-market carbon trading, real estate and other hard assets.</p><p>Digital fiat money is cryptocurrency issued and governed by central banks. A year ago, Venezuela announced its launch of the \"Petro,\" a cryptocurrency backed by the country's oil reserves but not widely used. Implemented properly, these cryptocurrencies could make markets more efficient, transparent and inclusive and central bank policy more responsive to crises and shocks.</p><p>Stablecoins are native digital assets pegged to dollar reserves. While they make moving and storing value frictionless, they still require a trusted backer holding funds on deposit, not unlike a traditional bank. Still, they have gained popularity and must be taken seriously.</p><p>This Cambrian explosion of cryptoassets may precipitate one of the greatest reorganizations of wealth and transformations of the global economy in our history. Securities markets, central banks, carbon markets, loyalty points, commodities and virtually all other assets are about to go digital. We will see deep changes in our institutions, especially governments and banks.</p><p>Questions about these cryptoassets remain: how and whether blockchain will reach its potential, how the technology will scale and how incumbents will react. We view these as implementation challenges to be overcome. Canada has a head start, with its critical mass of talent, capital and a thriving startup ecosystem. With the right support of our institutions - banks, governments, incubators, academia and corporate leadership - Canada could be the proving ground for the future of financial services and reap the benefits for decades to come.

Large multinational companies have jumped out to a headstart in the race to succeed, and Canada runs the risk of falling behind. At stake is nothing less than our prosperity and economic well-being.

In early 2018, cryptoasset investors had overly optimistic expectations of adoption and utility. When projects failed to deliver, there was little to support their lofty valuations. We have seen this story before: people tend to overestimate the potential for technology short term and underestimate it long term.</p><p>Second, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which would have given more retail and institutional investors access to cryptoassets, failed to materialize as expected.</p><p>Third, many companies that raised funds in the underlying cryptocurrencies themselves converted to fiat currencies for cash to fund their operations, adding to the selling pressure.</p><p>A dispute in the lesser known \"bitcoin cash\" community also heightened the spectre of volatility and uncertainty. As did the poor performance of many cryptoasset investment funds, which has sparked demands among investors for redemptions of whatever was left. Finally, as we approach yearend, investors are looking to harvest tax-losses.</p><p>But this is not a time for animal spirits to go into hibernation. This is a venture market, and like all venture markets, it requires a long-term outlook.</p><p>The fundamentals for the industry are sound. Many compelling projects are launching soon; top talent continues to move from Wall Street and Big Tech to crypto ventures; and developers around the world continue to improve the code, build applications and dream up exciting new projects.</p><p>Ethereum, a made-in-Canada project, has 200,000 developers building in its native computing language, Solidity. Large companies such as Fidelity and VanEck are investing more in cryptocurrency projects than ever before. And beyond bitcoin, big enterprises such as Delta Airlines and FedEx are looking to blockchain to transform many aspects of their businesses. Facebook now has a number of blockchain job postings.</p><p>Some perspective is helpful, too: only two years ago, the cryptoasset market had a combined value of US$13 billion. Had it been a public company, it would barely have cracked the S&amp;;P 500 index, based on its market capitalization. Today's market is worth US$100 billion.</p><p>Furthermore, cryptoassets are one facet of the financial services revolution - and their price is only one indicator of innovation. Asset classes with notional values of trillions of dollars - stocks, bonds, collectibles and currencies, to name a few - could be transformed from analog to digital and, in the process, force companies, governments, investors and citizens to confront a brave new world. Canada is already a hotbed for blockchain innovation. We can harness this technology to reinvent the financial services industry for the better.</p><p>This new asset class includes some familiar elements: cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin - blockchain's first killer app - and platform tokens such as Ethereum. But there are other asset types to watch:</p><p>Utility tokens are programmable blockchain assets with utility in an application. For example, Golem aims to aggregate the power of the world's smartphones into a decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use in exchange for Golem tokens.</p><p>Cryptocollectibles allow for the tracking and trading of both tangible (diamonds, fine art) and intangible (virtual pets, such as Cryptokitties) goods.</p><p>Security tokens are native digital bonds, equities and other securities that trade peer to peer. The Canadian Securities Exchange intends to get into this market. Canadian startup Polymath has made progress in this area, as has Toronto-based Extreme Blockchain Labs, which is repurposing its crowdfunding platform, CrowdMatrix, as a securities token foundry.</p><p>Natural asset tokens represent such tangible goods as gold, oil or carbon in peer-to-peer markets with real-time settlement. For example, the Royal Mint partnered with the Chicago Mercantile exchange to create Royal Mint Gold, a token backed by gold bullion in the Royal Mint's vaults. The entire commodities market is up for grabs, as is mass-market carbon trading, real estate and other hard assets.</p><p>Digital fiat money is cryptocurrency issued and governed by central banks. A year ago, Venezuela announced its launch of the \"Petro,\" a cryptocurrency backed by the country's oil reserves but not widely used. Implemented properly, these cryptocurrencies could make markets more efficient, transparent and inclusive and central bank policy more responsive to crises and shocks.</p><p>Stablecoins are native digital assets pegged to dollar reserves. While they make moving and storing value frictionless, they still require a trusted backer holding funds on deposit, not unlike a traditional bank. Still, they have gained popularity and must be taken seriously.</p><p>This Cambrian explosion of cryptoassets may precipitate one of the greatest reorganizations of wealth and transformations of the global economy in our history. Securities markets, central banks, carbon markets, loyalty points, commodities and virtually all other assets are about to go digital. We will see deep changes in our institutions, especially governments and banks.</p><p>Questions about these cryptoassets remain: how and whether blockchain will reach its potential, how the technology will scale and how incumbents will react. We view these as implementation challenges to be overcome. Canada has a head start, with its critical mass of talent, capital and a thriving startup ecosystem. With the right support of our institutions - banks, governments, incubators, academia and corporate leadership - Canada could be the proving ground for the future of financial services and reap the benefits for decades to come. Or not.</p><p>. Alex Tapscott is co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute and co-author of Blockchain Revolution, now translated into 15 languages.

Digital coin Tether[3], whose market cap is 30 times smaller than Bitcoin, has a daily trading volume around $21 billion per day, exceeding Bitcoin in April. This compares to Bitcoin, at roughly $17 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. </p><p>This trend has resulted in growing concern from regulators. Regulatory Concern  Tether's monthly trading volume is about 18% higher compared to that of Bitcoin. So while Bitcoin may be the most well-known cryptocurrency, Tether's trading volumes make it an integral piece of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, per Bloomberg. It also explains why regulators have approached the digital coin space with such caution, given their distrust of Tether.Tether is currently being sued by New York for allegedly commingling funds including reserves. Meanwhile, regulators have shot down attempts to market crypto ETFS, citing fraud, market manipulation, scandals, and other issues still facing the crypto world.According to Lex Sokolin, global financial technology co-head at blockchain[4] technology firm ConsenSys, without Tether, 'some of the concerning potential patters of trading in the market may start to fall away.' 'Stablecoin'  Tether is one of the world's most popular stablecoins, meaning that it is designed to hedge against wide price swings with pegs or reserves. The digital coin is the preferred coin for active investors, and those in countries that ban crypto trading. For example, in China, investors can pay cash for Tethers without many questions asked, and trade them for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, per Bloomberg.Thaddeus Dryja, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that many people aren't even aware that they are trading Tether. Since many crypto exchanges still lack access to traditional financial services, they often don't have bank accounts where they can hold dollars on behalf of their customers. Instead, they use Tether coins.'I don't think people actually trust Tether -- I think people use Tether without realizing that they are using it, and instead think they have actual dollars in a bank account somewhere,' said Dryja. He added that many exchanges intentionally mislead their customers, leading them to believe that they are holding dollars instead of Tether.There remain other murky conditions surrounding Tether. For one, it is managed and governed by a private company based in Hong Kong, which also owns the Bitfinex crypto exchange. While many tout the transparency and lack of central ownership with Bitcoin, much about Tether remains unknown.Some are skeptical over the mechanism to which Tether's supply is increased and decreased, and how much is covered by fiat reserves. While previously, Tether said that 100% of Tethers were covered by cash and short-term securities, it disclosed in April that just 74% of Tethers were. The fact that Tether is not independently audited is also a cause of concern. What's Next?  'Being controlled by centralized parties defeats the entire original purpose of blockchain and decentralized cryptocurrencies,' stated Griffin. 'By avoiding government powers, stablecoins place trust instead in the hands of big tech companies, who have mixed accountability. So while the idea is great in theory, in practice it is risky, open to abuse, and plagued by similar problems to traditional fiat currencies.'According to the Blockchain Transparency Institute, 64% of all Tether trading activity was used for fake trading and to deliberately sway crypto markets, per Bitcoinist[5].

That is an increase of about $26 billion. Bitcoin (BTC[8]) peaked with a trading price of around $11,200 on Sunday, setting a new record high for the year and is currently trading for $10,900 - up about $1,000 from the beginning of the weekend. Bitcoin still dominates the market with a market cap of $193 billion. Ether (ETH[9]) and XRP[10] lead altcoins with market caps of $33 billion and $20 billion, respectively. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) released its annual report[11] for 2019, in which it examines the risks and benefits of big tech companies entering the payments space. This includes Facebook's (NasdaqGS:FB[12]) Libra cryptocurrency project. On the benefits of tech giants entering finance, the report notes: ...given their size and customer reach, big techs' entry into finance has the potential to spark rapid change in the industry. It offers many potential benefits. Big techs' low-cost structure business can easily be scaled up to provide basic financial services, especially in places where a large part of the population remains unbanked. Using big data and analysis of the network structure in their established platforms, big techs can assess the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the need for collateral to assure repayment. As such, big techs stand to enhance the efficiency of financial services provision, promote financial inclusion and allow associated gains in economic activity. In balancing these potential benefits, the report notes that: \"Regulators need to ensure a level playing field between big techs and banks, taking into account big techs' wide customer base, access to information and broad-ranging business models.\" An article on Quartz[13] from Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin criticizes Facebook's Libra project as a \"centralized wolf in a decentralized sheep's clothing\". Lubin argues that Libra's reliance on its basket of currencies, government regulators and initial backers make it antithetical to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. Perhaps most importantly, it requires our trust that Libra will eventually transition to a more \"permissionless,\" decentralized system, whereby anyone can validate the network, rather than the restrictive member evaluation criteria keeping control in the hands of the initial 28 firms.

That is an increase of about $26 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) peaked with a trading price of around $11,200 on Sunday, setting a new record high for the year and is currently trading for $10,900 - up about $1,000 from the beginning of the weekend. Bitcoin still dominates the market with a market cap of $193 billion. Ether ( ETH ) andXRPlead altcoins with market caps of $33 billion and $20 billion, respectively.The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) released its annualreportfor 2019, in which it examines the risks and benefits of big tech companies entering the payments space. This includes Facebook's ( NasdaqGS:FB ) Libra cryptocurrency project. On the benefits of tech giants entering finance, the report notes:...given their size and customer reach, big techs' entry into finance has the potential to spark rapid change in the industry. It offers many potential benefits. Big techs' low-cost structure business can easily be scaled up to provide basic financial services, especially in places where a large part of the population remains unbanked. Using big data and analysis of the network structure in their established platforms, big techs can assess the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the need for collateral to assure repayment. As such, big techs stand to enhance the efficiency of financial services provision, promote financial inclusion and allow associated gains in economic activity.In balancing these potential benefits, the report notes that:\"Regulators need to ensure a level playing field between big techs and banks, taking into account big techs' wide customer base, access to information and broad-ranging business models.\"An article onQuartzfrom Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin criticizes Facebook's Libra project as a \"centralized wolf in a decentralized sheep's clothing\". Lubin argues that Libra's reliance on its basket of currencies, government regulators and initial backers make it antithetical to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.Perhaps most importantly, it requires our trust that Libra will eventually transition to a more \"permissionless,\" decentralized system, whereby anyone can validate the network, rather than the restrictive member evaluation criteria keeping control in the hands of the initial 28 firms.Sam Mowers, Investorideas<br/>Read other editions of theCrypto Corner Get the Crypto Corner News by emailGet Crypto Corner News<br/>Crypto Corner Sponsors:<br/><br/>Flip\u2122 is the creation of Fit Pay, Inc., a leading provider of cutting edge payment technology and a subsidiary of NXT-ID ( NASDAQ: NXTD ).

The firm is domiciled in Gibraltar and filed a draft F-1[7] with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) on Monday. This will be the first security token sale registered with the SEC. An excerpt from the Prospectus Summary outlines the company's aims: Our vision is to establish two trading platforms and a security token that provide regulatory clarity to the blockchain asset industry. We plan to achieve this by: (1) differentiating between security and non-security blockchain asset classes and providing trading opportunities for each class; (2) obtaining appropriate regulatory licenses and approvals, including money transmitter licenses, a U.S. broker-dealer license and subsequent registration as an ATS; (3) issuing our security token, the INX Token, and maintaining the INX Registry, which reflects a real time list of INX Token holders; (4) requiring that all INX Token holders comply with KYC/AML procedures; and (5) granting certain rights and benefits to the holders of INX Tokens. When fully operational, we expect to offer professional traders and institutional investors trading platforms with established practices common in other regulated financial services markets, such as customary trading, clearing, and settlement procedures, regulatory compliance, capital and liquidity reserves and operational transparency. CNN Business[8] reports that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of crypto exchange Gemini, have been in talks with Facebook (NasdaqGS:FB[9]) to join the Libra Association. This may come as a surprise, considering the twins' widely-reported[10] legal battle with Facebook creator and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Cameron Winklevoss opined that crypto will be unavoidable in the future and that big tech firms are most likely considering its implementation in some capacity: \"I think there is a day in the future where we can't live without crypto, or imagine a world before crypto.\" \"I think that internet companies have to have a crypto strategy, and I think a lot of them are thinking about their own coin projects. They're probably watching Libra and Facebook to see how that fares as they develop it.\" According to a state-owned English-language outlet[11], the People's Republic of China is nearing a launch for its central bank digital currency (CBDC). Yang Dong, director of the Research Center of Finance Technology and Cyber Security at Renmin University of China, told the outlet that the CBDC was influenced by Facebook's Libra project. An excerpt reads: \"It sparked discussions among Chinese financial regulators, driving the designer to rethink various models which can involve more non-governmental institutions in the CBDC development and issuance process.\" Amaten, Japan's largest gift card exchange platform, is partnering with blockchain network provider aelf to transform \"gift cards into digital assets that can be managed and exchanged on the blockchain\", according to a report from Verdict[12]. Amaten chairman Tom Kanazawa commented: \"The current system and technology used for gift card is completely obsolete and dates all the way back to the mid 90s. It has never evolved to match today's digital world; it still suffers from basic fundamental shortcomings and is very inconvenient. I believe that the gift card industry can be a perfect use case for blockchain. The two are a completely natural fit.\" Sam Mowers, Investorideas Read other editions of the Crypto Corner[13] Get the Crypto Corner News by email Get Crypto Corner News[14] Crypto Corner Sponsors:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.FliptoPay.com\">http://www.FliptoPay.com</url> Flip is the creation of Fit Pay, Inc., a leading provider of cutting edge payment technology and a subsidiary of NXT-ID (NASDAQ: NXTD[15]).

The firm is domiciled in Gibraltar and filed adraft F-1with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) on Monday. This will be the first security token sale registered with the SEC. An excerpt from the Prospectus Summary outlines the company's aims:Our vision is to establish two trading platforms and a security token that provide regulatory clarity to the blockchain asset industry. We plan to achieve this by: (1) differentiating between security and non-security blockchain asset classes and providing trading opportunities for each class; (2) obtaining appropriate regulatory licenses and approvals, including money transmitter licenses, a U.S. broker-dealer license and subsequent registration as an ATS; (3) issuing our security token, the INX Token, and maintaining the INX Registry, which reflects a real time list of INX Token holders; (4) requiring that all INX Token holders comply with KYC/AML procedures; and (5) granting certain rights and benefits to the holders of INX Tokens.When fully operational, we expect to offer professional traders and institutional investors trading platforms with established practices common in other regulated financial services markets, such as customary trading, clearing, and settlement procedures, regulatory compliance, capital and liquidity reserves and operational transparency. CNN Businessreports that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of crypto exchange Gemini, have been in talks with Facebook ( NasdaqGS:FB ) to join the Libra Association. This may come as a surprise, considering the twins'widely-reportedlegal battle with Facebook creator and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Cameron Winklevoss opined that crypto will be unavoidable in the future and that big tech firms are most likely considering its implementation in some capacity:\"I think there is a day in the future where we can't live without crypto, or imagine a world before crypto.\"\"I think that internet companies have to have a crypto strategy, and I think a lot of them are thinking about their own coin projects. They're probably watching Libra and Facebook to see how that fares as they develop it.\"According to astate-owned English-language outlet , the People's Republic of China is nearing a launch for its central bank digital currency (CBDC). Yang Dong, director of the Research Center of Finance Technology and Cyber Security at Renmin University of China, told the outlet that the CBDC was influenced by Facebook's Libra project. An excerpt reads:\"It sparked discussions among Chinese financial regulators, driving the designer to rethink various models which can involve more non-governmental institutions in the CBDC development and issuance process.\"Amaten, Japan's largest gift card exchange platform, is partnering with blockchain network provider aelf to transform \"gift cards into digital assets that can be managed and exchanged on the blockchain\", according to a report fromVerdict .

He also said that the Trump administration was \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with Facebook\u2019s plans to begin a digital payment system, called Libra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The warnings come after similar comments by President Trump, who said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192\">series of Twitter posts</url> last week that he was \u201cnot a fan\u201d of cryptocurrencies and that their value was volatile and \u201cbased on thin air.\u201d Mr. Trump warned Facebook that it must seek a banking charter and follow all bank regulations if it wants to be in the digital currency business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Trump administration has said little about cryptocurrencies in the past two years, despite their growing popularity. Mr. Mnuchin has largely described the new technology for creating, moving and storing money as a potential consumer protection issue rather than a threat to the financial system. Regulators have long focused on how to minimize crime in the cryptocurrency industry, but it has tended to be a wonky issue that has not attracted much public attention.</p><p>But Facebook\u2019s announcement of Libra has spurred Washington\u2019s interest in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192\">said last week</url> that the central bank had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Libra and had been in contact with Facebook regarding its project.</p><p>This week, the House and Senate will hold hearings to examine Libra, and lawmakers plan to grill David Marcus, the Facebook executive who is overseeing the project. Facebook was asked to cease work on the project until it addresses lawmakers\u2019 concerns.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s crypto foray has renewed attention on the thousands of cryptocurrencies that flourished after the original digital currency, Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 and envisioned as a new kind of money that would not be controlled by any government or central authority.</p><p>Bitcoin was presented by its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a largely political project, aimed at challenging central banks and governments.</p><p>But from the early days, Bitcoin gained traction among people looking to make illegal transactions online. The Silk Road, an online market for illegal drugs, was started in 2011 and became a booming business, with every payment sent in Bitcoin.</p><p>In recent years, there have been many legitimate businesses set up around cryptocurrencies. Most of these businesses are focused on using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investment products, similar to gold.</p><p>Several large financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and Fidelity, have begun to offer products related to Bitcoin to their customers.</p><p>This mainstream validation has helped give Bitcoin a sheen of legitimacy and pushed up the price of the digital token. But it has also led to increased volatility in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The price of a single Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 in early 2018. Since then, it crashed to $3,000, but has risen swiftly again in recent months to around $12,000.</p><p>Bitcoin has also become the standard currency for ransomware operations in which victims lose control of their computer to remote hackers. Victims are able to get back their files only if they send a Bitcoin payment. Many cities have lost control of their computer networks in these kinds of attacks.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Mnuchin cited the use of Bitcoin in terrorist financing, tax evasion and human trafficking, though so far, law enforcement officials have brought few cases in those areas.</p><p>\u201cThe Treasury Department has expressed very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe will not tolerate the use of the cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities.\u201d</p><p>Facebook does not intend to release the currency until next year, but the company has big ambitions for the project, which it hopes will become a new global currency and the foundation for an alternative global financial system.</p><p>Those ambitions \u2014 and Facebook\u2019s broader reputational problems \u2014 have made the project such a lightning rod for controversy.</p><p>\u201cWe know we need to take the time to get this right,\u201d Mr. Marcus, the Facebook executive, said in testimony released ahead of the Senate Banking Committee hearing. \u201cAnd I want to be clear: Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.\u201d</p><p>Facebook has designed Libra so that it will be run by a Swiss association governed by at least a hundred companies and other partners, rather than just Facebook itself.</p><p>When Facebook announced Libra, it said it already had 27 partners, including big players like Uber, Mastercard, Visa and Spotify. But so far those partners have largely remained silent and Facebook has borne the brunt of the scrutiny facing Libra.</p><p>It is clear that Facebook will be facing a raft of new regulations and public scrutiny as it proceeds.</p><p>Mr. Mnuchin said that cryptocurrencies must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. They must also meet the same anti-money laundering and counterfeiting standards as traditional financial firms.</p><p>The Treasury secretary also expressed concerns about the speculative nature of Bitcoin and about Facebook\u2019s problems protecting the privacy of its users.</p><p>\u201cOur overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.</p><p>The Trump administration\u2019s concerns about Libra appear to be bound up in the president\u2019s broader distrust of the social networking giant. Mr. Trump tweeted about Libra soon after a <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192\">social media summit meeting</url> in which he criticized Facebook and other big tech companies, accusing them of silencing conservative voices, including his.</p><p>Mr. Mnuchin insisted the administration was not trying to retaliate against Facebook. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to target any one entity,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is playing by the same rules.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Powell, the Fed chair, expressed similar concerns about Libra last week, telling lawmakers it could not go forward \u201cwithout their being broad satisfaction with the way the company has addressed money laundering, all those things.\u201d He also raised data privacy and consumer protection concerns, saying, \u201cAll of those things will need to be addressed very thoroughly, and carefully, in a deliberate process that will not be a sprint to implementation.\u201d</p><p>Skepticism about Libra, and cryptocurrencies more broadly, represent a rare issue where the Trump administration and some Democrats are united. Last week, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, called on the Fed to protect consumers from Facebook\u2019s \u201cMonopoly money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe largest banks and the largest tech companies do not act in the interest of working Americans, but in the interest of themselves and their investors,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThe Fed must take a proactive role to ensure that the payments system remains accountable to the public.\u201d</p><p>However, Republicans have tended to be more sympathetic to the cryptocurrency industry, and have positioned it as something that the government should be working to protect as a check against government and corporate power.</p><p>Just this week, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192\">argued in a New York Times op-ed article</url> that cryptocurrencies and the networks they create could provide an answer to the privacy scandals facing the internet giants.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has been a <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192\">vocal advocate</url> of Bitcoin in the past.</p><p>Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Nathaniel Popper from San Francisco.

You've gone from something that used to be any criminality you're trying to do it for profit right, so everybody wants to make some money. That's what's going on.</p><p>When you add a layer that is encrypted, that is anonymous or pseudo anonymous then it makes it very difficult for investigators to counter that challenge and also it really makes it easier for the bad guys to do what they do and that create risks especially for children.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: Now they've been attempts recently at setting some global rules, non-binding rules, that might break up some of that secrecy in some circumstances. What effect do you think that might have?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: So we're still waiting to see how that plays out. There is a global regulator, if you will, who sets these rules called the Financial Action Task Force.</p><p>They've come up with some recommendations but very much thanks actually to the good people of Australia that helped to fund the work that my staff and I do, we've brought together those policymakers, lawyers, those cryptocurrency experts to try and look what policy might look like in this space because when we look at some of the really high risk crime where we see kids, I'm talking babies, very, very young six months old and younger, who are in pay-per-view live online child sexual abuse streaming websites and that that's getting paid for by cryptocurrencies, we need to have some sort of option.</p><p>We need to know how we try and challenge that threat and reduce the risks for kids and reduce the opportunities for criminals to get involved and it's going to take lots of different brains.</p><p>It's going to take technologists, policymakers, philosophers, the whole nine yards.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: But what the incentives for the operators of cryptocurrency to abandon secrecy even in some circumstances, if not all? I mean the model, the business model is secrecy.</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Yeah, you're right and I think the way to look at this is if you or I go into a bank today or we want to exchange, I was coming to Australia yesterday and I go to get some Australian dollars in the airport, I've got a show ID to get that so that we know who's got cash and who's moving amounts and value across the border.</p><p>When you try to apply that business model to cryptocurrencies, it is much, much harder because it's designed, as you say, to try and be anonymous or pseudo anonymous in the first place.</p><p>And it seems to us that the place to do that and to try and put some investigative capability or due diligence in check is with those people who we call exchanges. Kind of like a foreign exchange but those where you can go and buy cryptocurrency or change a bitcoin into a different type of cryptocurrency and then you know who it is and who's moving that value because there isn't really a large amount of risk around declaring who you are and that you have an interest in moving value and we have to be doing this to keep the most vulnerable in our society safe.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: So you've got this layer at the same time as you're dealing with matters like, for example, as we saw in a recent leaked UN report, North Korea having made a cool two billion dollars from some 35 cyberattacks so it can fund its weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>You've got terror groups al Qaeda, Islamic State, obviously working in these kind of criminal ways in the cyberspace. What's the key to doing better, to stopping these things because obviously national police forces, for example, stop at the borders?</p><p>I mean how do you make this work?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: So big, big business areas that you talking about there, everything from nuclear proliferation to terrorism to organised crime and like I said earlier, all of this is done for profit.</p><p>I was a cop for 15 years before joining the UN and it's when you take that profit out of criminality and the ability to stop that flow of profit, you really have an impact on the bad guys that are doing it.</p><p>So I think that's when we all turn it on its head is we want to have a safe world where everybody can get economic prosperity, where we can be safe going about our day-to-day lives and I think it's allowing security to be in place where it ought to be challenging that where it creates risk especially for the most vulnerable parts of our society.</p><p>But I think it is the hardest thing now Linda, is when you see things like cryptocurrencies developing that for our policymakers to understand that and how it impacts on day-to-day can be pretty challenging and that's where people like my staff come into it.</p><p>I've got 70-odd staff around the world. We help cops and prosecutors and judges to develop the capability to investigate this sort of stuff with the ultimate aim of keeping kids safe.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: Yeah and look, just to focus on that child exploitation issue a little more, it is the most depraved and cruel stuff that we're talking about.</p><p>I mean how do you expect to counter that given that on the one hand you're looking at trying to stop these activities via, if you like, technological policing means but really you're dealing with humans who tend to this behaviour.</p><p>I mean do you see a chance of really stopping it?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: So I think we have to accept that the scale of online child sexual abuse is much bigger than most people would realize and even having a true sense of that scale is difficult.</p><p>Australia is one of the leaders in this field in countering it. In fact today Queensland Police are wrapping up their annual Youth, Technology and Virtual Communities conference which brings together some of the most well thought through investigators and policy makers in countering child abuse.</p><p>When you get that scale in place, you can help cops to do their job better but like anything when it with policing it's already too late. You've got to be able to prevent it and a lot of the work that we do now, certainly within the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime is on the prevention side.</p><p>So we get in front of kids, hundreds of thousands of kids per year, in school, in social clubs, in faith-based communities to explain what online risk is like and I've got four kids. They are nine, seven, five and two and the way that I try and keep them safe is that we talk about things openly and honestly in a way that's not scary for them but the way that we see working is that children understand their own bodies, what adults are allowed to do, what they're not allowed to do and to make them feel empowered about managing their own lives, their own bodies and how to seek help if something happens.</p><p>Child abusers are successful when they can create secrecy, when things become a risk to a child saying if you tell someone you're going to get in trouble, no one will believe you.</p><p>So we need to get rid of that, that our children always have someone that they can go to for help.</p><p>It mightn't be mum or dad, it mightn't be a relative but by having those conversations, creating that safe space then we can get into the prevention bit much, much better.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And can I ask you a couple of other sort of, more I guess, retail questions in a sense and I don't know how much this is in your realm but here in Australia there's been considerable interest recently in casinos and alleged or potential money laundering.</p><p>What's your understanding of whether Australia is a problematic country in terms of that globalized sort of criminal gambling, if you like?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: So I'll be honest, my knowledge of Australia and the casino scene is zero but in my previous life as an investigator and I was based at an organisation called Europol which is the EU's law enforcement agency, and it has Australian liaison on it as well, we saw lots of opportunities for the organised laundering of the proceeds of crime.</p><p>So there are organised crime groups who specialise in moving money and things like casinos are a way of doing that because you have a large throughput of cash, you have casinos now that will accept cryptocurrencies or accept gold or any other commodity and all of this is about looking at how do we allow people to go about their days in a normal day-to-day life but managing some of that risk around that.</p><p>If you start to see casinos popping up in places that don't make sense or where you have a casino arriving in a country where perhaps, I don't know, you don't have an enormous amount of tourism or that regular activity, then I think that's probably pause for thought for policy makers as to why that's happening and to look a little bit deeper into it.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And what do you think when you see all the personal information that people share online and I guess, children you know, are in that realm aren't they, very much?</p><p>Are we adding, how much are we adding to the burden of risk and should we stop living online?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: I really couldn't phrase that any more perfectly than you've done, Linda, because the amount of detail that people put online is phenomenal now and we have to, let's say I speak to someone who says well I've got nothing to hide, I've got nothing to hide by being out there, then actually those are perfect targets for cybercriminals, that if you don't look after your passwords, you don't keep things up-to-date, you don't update your software, you're the ideal person for a cybercriminal to target and to try and replicate you or your account or your login details and that just creates methods for them committing their criminality.</p><p>And we have to, I think we have to get into a better space where we don't emulate success by the number of views or likes that exist on a certain platform and we also have to help again, but not just kids, but adults as well with better critical thinking.</p><p>Just because you have an account followed by a 100 million followers with 500 million likes on something, doesn't make it true.</p><p>We have to keep asking ourselves and critically thinking our way through what we see online and being able to make a judgment at the end of that and not be afraid to ask questions and not be afraid to challenge what's out there in social media.</p><p>Twenty years ago, the most sellable commodity was probably oil. Now it's personal data.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: The big companies behind the popular platforms though have a lot to answer for, don't they?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Yeah, I agree with that entirely. They do have a lot to answer for.</p><p>They have to get much more involved in this space and because, I think we've gone past the part of saying well we're simply providing a platform, it's up to the people who are on it.</p><p>If you have a service, whatever your service is and you've got a certain percentage of the world using it on a daily basis, you have to be part of that solution.</p><p>Tech is part of the problem but it can be part of the solution.</p><p>We've seen that work exceptionally well encountering child sexual abuse by getting those big platforms on board but I think now, as society grows and technology grows and changes, you've got many more companies need to get involved in operating in this space; that we all recognize the threat and we see where the tech companies can bring a real part to that policy making and that solution.</p><p>The solution is not with policing or government. It will be the tech companies that are a major part of it.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And so they are cooperating with you and your office and the work you do in that area of child exploitation and beyond that?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Yes, certainly on the child sexual abuse side. We have a very good cooperation with the with the big tech companies. And we've had some real success with that, where I can think back a couple of years, we were delivering some training to police and judges in a Central American country and that led to a predatory paedophile being identified and brought to justice; and he had raped over 35 children in his community and was violating over 50 others around the world.</p><p>The work that we do now with Australian counterparts in South East Asia and the Pacific has brought some really high-risk individuals to justice.</p><p>We've brought governments and cops together around this part of the world to help make better policy and stop our kids being abused online.</p><p>Are we on top of it? No, but are we in the right direction? Yes, I think we are.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And do you see the possibility of a sort of peak moment for cybercrime, whatever form it takes, the possibility that we'll conquer it a little bit like technology has crimped car theft for example?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Of all the questions I've had and I've never had that one before, it's a great question.</p><p>Is there a peak moment? I think it's exceptionally difficult to predict because the technology moves at such a pace where the ability of tech to move forward, for mass amounts of data to move forward.</p><p>We see cybercriminals changing their methodology, how they do things on a yearly basis, on a monthly basis and previously they might be looking at trying to intercept data in transmission but now it is more profitable for them if they can get into the supply chain of equipment or software because that way you're not having to intercept stuff or decrypt it, you're already in the background when things are made.</p><p>So if you're a cybercriminal trying to work out where that profitability is going to come from, how the whole dynamic is going to change, then I think they're very, very responsive to that and the challenge for us in government, in the UN, in policing is to try and keep up with that but it's the sort of work that people like you do that help in get this out to the public, that we all play a part in keeping ourselves safe, has never been more important.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: Neil Walsh, thank you so much for speaking with PM.</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Thanks Linda.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: The UN's chief of the cybercrime and anti-money launder section, Neil Walsh.</p><p>And we also discussed the risks of living your life online, among other things. You can hear more of that on the PM webpage.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: A top UN official says cryptocurrencies have made efforts to fight cybercrime, terror financing and money laundering much harder, by adding a new layer of secrecy that favours the criminals and that includes global child sexual exploitation networks.</p><p>Neil Walsh, is the chief of the Cybercrime and Anti-Money Laundering section of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime.</p><p>He's visiting Australia, which provides significant funding for his team's work, supporting and training police and judges around the world and sensitizing the public to new threats.</p><p>When he joined me from Canberra, I asked him first about cryptocurrency.</p><p>NEIL WALSH: It's what makes it really hard for a cops investigators to manage some really big risks because in the past when we looked at some of those really big high threat areas like kids getting abused online, it had to be paid for and now with the use of cryptocurrencies it's exceptionally difficult for investigators to track that and to try and manage that risk down.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: So it's added a whole new layer to the existing nightmares that you are dealing with?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Perfect, yeah.

There is a global regulator, if you will, who sets these rules called the Financial Action Task Force.</p><p>They've come up with some recommendations but very much thanks actually to the good people of Australia that helped to fund the work that my staff and I do, we've brought together those policymakers, lawyers, those cryptocurrency experts to try and look what policy might look like in this space because when we look at some of the really high risk crime where we see kids, I'm talking babies, very, very young six months old and younger, who are in pay-per-view live online child sexual abuse streaming websites and that that's getting paid for by cryptocurrencies, we need to have some sort of option.</p><p>We need to know how we try and challenge that threat and reduce the risks for kids and reduce the opportunities for criminals to get involved and it's going to take lots of different brains.</p><p>It's going to take technologists, policymakers, philosophers, the whole nine yards.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: But what the incentives for the operators of cryptocurrency to abandon secrecy even in some circumstances, if not all?

They are nine, seven, five and two and the way that I try and keep them safe is that we talk about things openly and honestly in a way that's not scary for them but the way that we see working is that children understand their own bodies, what adults are allowed to do, what they're not allowed to do and to make them feel empowered about managing their own lives, their own bodies and how to seek help if something happens.</p><p>Child abusers are successful when they can create secrecy, when things become a risk to a child saying if you tell someone you're going to get in trouble, no one will believe you.</p><p>So we need to get rid of that, that our children always have someone that they can go to for help.</p><p>It mightn't be mum or dad, it mightn't be a relative but by having those conversations, creating that safe space then we can get into the prevention bit much, much better.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And can I ask you a couple of other sort of, more I guess, retail questions in a sense and I don't know how much this is in your realm but here in Australia there's been considerable interest recently in casinos and alleged or potential money laundering.</p><p>What's your understanding of whether Australia is a problematic country in terms of that globalized sort of criminal gambling, if you like?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: So I'll be honest, my knowledge of Australia and the casino scene is zero but in my previous life as an investigator and I was based at an organisation called Europol which is the EU's law enforcement agency, and it has Australian liaison on it as well, we saw lots of opportunities for the organised laundering of the proceeds of crime.</p><p>So there are organised crime groups who specialise in moving money and things like casinos are a way of doing that because you have a large throughput of cash, you have casinos now that will accept cryptocurrencies or accept gold or any other commodity and all of this is about looking at how do we allow people to go about their days in a normal day-to-day life but managing some of that risk around that.</p><p>If you start to see casinos popping up in places that don't make sense or where you have a casino arriving in a country where perhaps, I don't know, you don't have an enormous amount of tourism or that regular activity, then I think that's probably pause for thought for policy makers as to why that's happening and to look a little bit deeper into it.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And what do you think when you see all the personal information that people share online and I guess, children you know, are in that realm aren't they, very much?</p><p>Are we adding, how much are we adding to the burden of risk and should we stop living online?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: I really couldn't phrase that any more perfectly than you've done, Linda, because the amount of detail that people put online is phenomenal now and we have to, let's say I speak to someone who says well I've got nothing to hide, I've got nothing to hide by being out there, then actually those are perfect targets for cybercriminals, that if you don't look after your passwords, you don't keep things up-to-date, you don't update your software, you're the ideal person for a cybercriminal to target and to try and replicate you or your account or your login details and that just creates methods for them committing their criminality.</p><p>And we have to, I think we have to get into a better space where we don't emulate success by the number of views or likes that exist on a certain platform and we also have to help again, but not just kids, but adults as well with better critical thinking.</p><p>Just because you have an account followed by a 100 million followers with 500 million likes on something, doesn't make it true.</p><p>We have to keep asking ourselves and critically thinking our way through what we see online and being able to make a judgment at the end of that and not be afraid to ask questions and not be afraid to challenge what's out there in social media.</p><p>Twenty years ago, the most sellable commodity was probably oil. Now it's personal data.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: The big companies behind the popular platforms though have a lot to answer for, don't they?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Yeah, I agree with that entirely. They do have a lot to answer for.</p><p>They have to get much more involved in this space and because, I think we've gone past the part of saying well we're simply providing a platform, it's up to the people who are on it.</p><p>If you have a service, whatever your service is and you've got a certain percentage of the world using it on a daily basis, you have to be part of that solution.</p><p>Tech is part of the problem but it can be part of the solution.</p><p>We've seen that work exceptionally well encountering child sexual abuse by getting those big platforms on board but I think now, as society grows and technology grows and changes, you've got many more companies need to get involved in operating in this space; that we all recognize the threat and we see where the tech companies can bring a real part to that policy making and that solution.</p><p>The solution is not with policing or government. It will be the tech companies that are a major part of it.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And so they are cooperating with you and your office and the work you do in that area of child exploitation and beyond that?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Yes, certainly on the child sexual abuse side. We have a very good cooperation with the with the big tech companies. And we've had some real success with that, where I can think back a couple of years, we were delivering some training to police and judges in a Central American country and that led to a predatory paedophile being identified and brought to justice; and he had raped over 35 children in his community and was violating over 50 others around the world.</p><p>The work that we do now with Australian counterparts in South East Asia and the Pacific has brought some really high-risk individuals to justice.</p><p>We've brought governments and cops together around this part of the world to help make better policy and stop our kids being abused online.</p><p>Are we on top of it? No, but are we in the right direction? Yes, I think we are.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: And do you see the possibility of a sort of peak moment for cybercrime, whatever form it takes, the possibility that we'll conquer it a little bit like technology has crimped car theft for example?</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Of all the questions I've had and I've never had that one before, it's a great question.</p><p>Is there a peak moment? I think it's exceptionally difficult to predict because the technology moves at such a pace where the ability of tech to move forward, for mass amounts of data to move forward.</p><p>We see cybercriminals changing their methodology, how they do things on a yearly basis, on a monthly basis and previously they might be looking at trying to intercept data in transmission but now it is more profitable for them if they can get into the supply chain of equipment or software because that way you're not having to intercept stuff or decrypt it, you're already in the background when things are made.</p><p>So if you're a cybercriminal trying to work out where that profitability is going to come from, how the whole dynamic is going to change, then I think they're very, very responsive to that and the challenge for us in government, in the UN, in policing is to try and keep up with that but it's the sort of work that people like you do that help in get this out to the public, that we all play a part in keeping ourselves safe, has never been more important.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: Neil Walsh, thank you so much for speaking with PM.</p><p>NEIL WALSH: Thanks Linda.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: The UN's chief of the cybercrime and anti-money launder section, Neil Walsh.</p><p>And we also discussed the risks of living your life online, among other things. You can hear more of that on the PM webpage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-11462410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXN-9TC1-JCM0-64CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4995\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 29, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Defence and National Security:Security Intelligence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, Economics and Finance/Markets/Currency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law, Crime and Justice/Fraud and Corporate Crime</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Nothing at all. There was a time, before so much technological progress had been made, that if a soldier was out late at night in some forsaken piece of wilderness, and a bright light such as a flare suddenly turned night into day, the soldier would drop to the ground to remain unseen, while quickly covering one eye to retain at least some measure of God-given night vision. This was so when the flare burnt out, the soldier would not be momentarily blind upon the return of what is known as \"pitch black.\"</p><p><br/> To this day, as I turn on all of my machines as I prepare to write Market Recon at 0300 and change every morning, I often do so with one eye closed, as an instinctual precaution, while my computer screens turn night into day.<br/>White Paper <br/> So it is that Facebook  is expected to release a White Paper discussing the use of a potential cryptocurrency-using block-chain technology going forward. There are many reasons that I see this to be more than just some wild idea. First, one has to consider Facebook's 2.4 billion monthly active users, a somewhat captive audience that is still growing across the various social media platforms operated by the parent company. This likely results in what is a mass group of consumers on which there is already developed intelligence regarding tastes and preferences that could be used as an aid in targeted marketing.  <br/> Even more interesting than the nicely set table would be the ability of Facebook to attract investment in this plan. Investment that has come from the likes of Visa  , Mastercard  , PayPal  , Uber  , Booking Holdings  , MercadoLibre  , and Spotify  , among others according to various sources. Apparently, companies interested in operating a \"node\" have to contribute as much as $10 million to be able to validate transactions.<br/>Trick Or Treat <br/> The trick, and it's important, will be to separate control of this new digital currency from Facebook. The company intends to do this by ceding power to an independent foundation in Switzerland. This is key as the firm has often been criticized for its practices in the past regarding user privacy, and is now reportedly under open regulatory scrutiny along with several other big tech names such as Alphabet  , Amazon  , and Apple  regarding the bounds of anti-trust laws. The possibility exists that one of more of these firms could ultimately be broken into smaller pieces.<br/> This paper will also reach publication as Bitcoin  has regained much lost ground in dollar-terms this year as nations with less than stable currencies leave citizens with a need for a vehicle to assist with their own capital flight. Bitcoin, as with almost all other cyrptocurrencies, has never caught on as a medium of exchange, however, even if in some bizarre way, it has served as a store of value, volatile as it is.<br/>The Future <br/><br/></p><p>Who is to say for sure, but this really could be just what the doctor ordered for the otherwise under-valued firm with the large user base and sizable advertising revenue, but a questionable reputation with investors. I have never been a fan of Facebook management. Folks who read me often know that. This does, however, seem well-thought out, as the coin will be pegged to a basket of existing government-backed currencies to tamp down on volatility, while preliminary reports are that there will be some kind of multi-national launch in early 2020.</p><p>The troubling question for me is why would companies already in the processed-payment game want to invest here, unless they either want a piece, or simply intelligence. Either way, I do believe that with Facebook trading 4% higher this morning, that today might not be the day, but I can see a reason to start buying the name again, on dips, and while I am no fortune teller, I think that we end up seeing some of those as we move forward. Everything hedged.</p><p><br/><br/>The Chart <br/></p><p><br/> The obvious boost that this news provided is the \"giddy up\" experience by the shares as they zipped past the 50-day simple moving average this morning. The idea, I think, to reduce risk would be to see if there is a re-test of that line in coming days, and grab a few there if possible. The next test will come as FB approaches the peak of the right side of the orange cup at 198. That spot will either serve as resistance, or as catapult. A cautious trader could still sell $182.50 puts expiring this Friday for $1.11.

Singapore's regulator said last year during the Singapore Fintech Festival that it would experiment on cross-border payments using blockchain technology.</p><p>\"When you send a wire transfer, it's a little like putting an envelope with a stamp on it, into the mailbox. You know your friend got the birthday card when she calls you,\" said Mr Garlinghouse.</p><p>Ripple offers blockchain technology to banks looking to speed up cross-border payments from days to seconds. The process of sending cross-border payments has been described as a black hole, as banks for years before have been unable to efficiently track transactions and their fees that are typically passed on to both corporate and retail customers.</p><p>It was only in 2017 that Swift - the dominant payment network service used by global banks - went live with a service so banks can speed up and more efficiently track cross-border payments to one another.</p><p>But this comes as the use of Ripple technology is gaining traction. Ripple said last year that Swedish bank SEB had processed more than US$180 million in payments for a large corporate customer between Sweden and the US using Ripple's technology.</p><p>Standard Chartered and India's Axis Bank in November launched a real-time cross-border payment service for corporates using Ripple's technology. The technology will be used to send Sing-dollar corporate payments from clients of StanChart in Singapore to accounts in Axis Bank, India's third largest private sector bank, so the banks can track any delays of payments, and fees.</p><p>To be clear, banks such as StanChart and Axis Bank are using Ripple's technology to process transactions fully in fiat money, that is, without Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP.</p><p>But Ripple is also trying to sell its cryptocurrency XRP as a means of settlement when a bank wants to move money into a country but does not have a local-currency account held in a local bank there. As Mr Garlinghouse explained, Ripple aims to have XRP used for such cross-border payments, so that a bank can sell, for example, the greenback, into XRP in seconds, and convert XRP into another currency, say Sing-dollars, quickly.</p><p>Despite it being premature days for XRP's mainstream use, the cryptocurrency was the best performer of the lot last year, gaining by more than 300 times. It surged in the last days of 2017 after three Japanese credit card firms said they would use Ripple's technology. A group of Japanese and South Korean banks are also experimenting in using its technology to remit funds between the two countries.</p><p>What's worth noting is that banks with existing local-currency accounts in key markets are likely watching the viability of using XRP, because if regulators accommodate the proliferation of the use of XRP, this could eliminate the current need to pre-fund local-currency accounts and open up new markets for banks in a cost efficient way.</p><p>Banks hold capital and collateral against settlement risks, so a reduction in settlement time would translate to huge savings in the trillions, said Mr Garlinghouse.</p><p>The buying fever for XRP comes as well as people no longer see bitcoin as the panacea for all transaction problems, said Mr Garlinghouse. He noted that the transaction time for bitcoin is an average of four hours, while the transaction costs remain high.</p><p>\"The transaction cost (for bitcoin) can be as much as $5 per transaction. If you used bitcoin to buy a coffee, the transaction would double the price.\"</p><p>XRP, according to Mr Garlinghouse, can do over 1,500 transactions per second at \"a fraction of a penny\". Ripple has said XRP can scale to handle the same throughput as payments giant Visa.</p><p>Started in 2012, Ripple has attracted investments from financial institutions such as Standard Chartered, Japan's SBI Group, Spain's Santander, and Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank.</p><p>It counts more than ten of the world's top banks as customers, and plans to double its 100-strong network by the end of this year, said Mr Garlinghouse, adding that Ripple should appeal to banks who are fretting over Big Tech competition.</p><p>\"If you are a traditional bank, and Alipay is entering your market - or it could be Google, Facebook, WeChat, you pick - you can compete on a level playing field with digital-first technology. That gives you a fair fight,\" said Mr Garlinghouse. \"If Google or Amazon launches some of these services, it's not going to take them three days to settle between the US dollar and the Singapore dollar.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Banks hold capital and collateral against settlement risks, so a reduction in settlement time would translate to huge savings in the trillions, says Mr Garlinghouse.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-187261</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCG-7291-DYX4-00YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 10, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0006XE2</classCode><className>AXIS BANK LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002MFZ</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>AXISBANK (NSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>AXB (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>STAN (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>2888 (HKSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Bank Creations &amp;

They've crept into every corner of contemporary life; they possess outsized amounts of power and exercise imperial control over the digital landscape \u2014 and it looks like taking over the future of finance is their next fait accompli. I've worked closely with a number of crypto startups \u2014 I've even founded one myself \u2014 and witnessed the tense relationship they have with big tech, specifically the leaders in cloud computing.Cryptocurrency[1]requires easy access to bountiful amounts of computing power. </p><p>Only a few companies can supply it at commercial scale, giving those companies disproportionate control over crypto markets as a whole. Consider what would happen if Amazon suddenly elected to shut out everycryptocurrency[2]currently in its cloud. Multiple exchanges would crash, and thousands of individual funds would be frozen. Markets would inevitably stumble and likely fall \u2014 all because of the whims of one company operating autonomously. It's a threat that's inconceivable in other areas of finance, but it casts a long shadow over the independence and distributed nature cryptocurrency. Those fears may sound unfounded, but there's already cause for alarm. Amazon Web Services does not support the Bitcoin elliptic curve, secp256k1, which is crucial for generating Bitcoin private keys. It doesn't matter if the hardware and firmware support the curve \u2014 AWS explicitly does not. Worse, Amazon's motives for doing so are totally opaque. All we really know is that Amazon is actively and intentionallycreating roadblocks for crypto[3]. I fully expect this tension to intensify, owing largely to the deep philosophical differences between big tech and crypto markets. Big tech, throughout its history, has been committed to top-down control and centralized management, but the mindset of crypto is just the opposite. Its acolytes view accessibility, equality, and decentralization as the guiding principles. One industry is totally dependent on the other, yet their missions are in direct opposition. It's an arrangement that makes friction unavoidable. The question that begs to be asked is what would compel a company like Google to obstruct an upstart industry like cryptocurrency? One explanation we must acknowledge is that crypto has not always been its own best advocate. A wave of shady coins and dubious claims led companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter toban all ads for ICOs[4]. That move was warranted and probably even necessary, given the way unsavory promoters were using them. However, it only partially explains the animus. The more likely cause is that big tech companies are fundamentally and necessarily aligned with other powerful entities. Those include world governments, multinational corporations, and titans of the 21st century. Cryptocurrency doesn't just challenge those power structures; it openly aims to disrupt them \u2014 first by making cryptocurrency a reality, next by making its ideals a certainty. We have already seen how threatening crypto looks to those at the top. As those anxieties increase, who do you think Microsoft and others will side with: crypto startups or their fellow elites? There's no evidence to suggest the gatekeepers of the cloud have excluded or expelled any cryptocurrency. But they certainly have the means and motive to do so, creating an existential risk for crypto investors and developers alike. Cryptocurrency is approaching a literal crossroads, where it will have to choose its relationship with big tech moving forward. The first option is to negotiate a truce similar to net neutrality. Crypto continues to rely on big tech. In exchange, cloud providers agree to treat all crypto companies equally and pledge to never throttle service or speeds. This option is appealing because, quite frankly, the resources of something like AWS are difficult to replace. The hard part is getting buy-in from big tech and regulators alike. The other option is to double down on crypto's spirit of decentralization and work to bypass or minimize the influence of big tech. Rather than rely on just one provider, companies can prioritize redundancy and distribution to reduce the risk of critical infrastructure components going offline. My own company stores keys and maintains critical infrastructure on different providers and utilizes another for backup. There are also challengers to the cloud monopoly that offer comparable computing power within a less restrictive framework. One day, it may be possible for intrepid crypto entrepreneurs to avoid Google or Amazon entirely. Right now, crypto markets feel like a wild frontier. But in reality, it's the illusion of freedom inside the world's biggest cage. The increasing centralization is unsustainable in its current form, but that doesn't meanblockchain entrepreneurs[5]need to feel contrite. Rather, we must continue to be diligent and thoughtful when building the foundations of our nascent industry.

Facebook's head of blockchain, David Marcus, is no exception. He released a statement announcing that he expects the new coin to be governed by Swiss law.Why did Libra choose to headquarter in Switzerland?</p><p> What are the main differences between Switzerland's crypto laws and the United States?One of the main differences is in attitude. While the United States is lurching forward with resistance, caution and occasional acceptance, Switzerland's crypto stance is safe, but welcoming and open. In March, the Federal Assembly, the legislative branch of the Swiss government, voted in favor of a motion to receive instruction on how to apply current laws toward crypto.The blockchain community views Switzerland as an embassy of sorts. The iconic town of Zug birthed the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. With over 700 blockchain-related companies having a presence there, the town of 30,000 people has been dubbed 'Crypto Valley.' As the U.S. looks to stall the development of Facebook's Libra and House Democrats look to keep big tech out of finance, it makes perfect sense that these companies will simply go where they're wanted.Leaders in Switzerland have taken a different approach. Swiss Federal President Ueli Maurer recently attended the CV Crypto Valley Summit, where he said the government 'is constantly looking for ways to stay two steps ahead,' in blockchain regulation. He added that 'our doors are always open' for any companies looking to approach the state. Like the U.S., Switzerland has decided to regulate digital currencies within the framework of their existing financial laws. By design, the Swiss government does not have consistent laws related to ICOs and cryptos. Rather, they choose to maintain flexibility to govern different types of currencies in different ways, on a case-by-case basis.Crypto-friendly Switzerland Outclasses U.S. as Facebook Libra's Regulator, CCN, Jul 21MENAFN2107201901560000ID1098784026</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098784026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMG-9381-JCNX-3482-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 21, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CP1K</classCode><className>CRYPTO AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the two members of the \"PayPal Mafia\" provided some sparks and insights into the political problems that Silicon Valley tech leaders have been grappling with since the 2016 national elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thiel and Hoffman spoke to a crowd of several hundred Stanford students, faculty and staff in the inaugural session of Cardinal Conversations. Their debate was moderated by historian Niall Ferguson, who is a fellow at the Hoover Institution, which is host to the new series.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock Partners venture capitalist Hoffman acknowledged Valley tech leaders badly misjudged the election.</p><p>\"We were shocked that there was a movement that wants to enshrine the past and that there was a lot of pain being felt by people who weren't convinced that the future Silicon Valley saw was going to be good for them,\" he said.</p><p>Too many big tech players were unaware that they were being viewed with mistrust by much of the country. They were too busy focusing on their businesses to see that, Hoffman suggested.</p><p>\"We need to get to Spider-Man ethics,\" he said. \"With great power comes responsibility. We need to figure out what society wants as part of the conversation about the future.\"</p><p>Thiel, on the other hand, said the election was a clash between three opposing views in American politics. \u00a0</p><p>\"The official Silicon Valley-Google propaganda is that Silicon Valley is accelerating, science is great and we are progressing at an incredible pace,\" he said. \"Then there is the centrist view that there is an inequality issue but we can take steps to become more equal.\"</p><p>Trump won because a significant part of the American population didn't see any progress in either view of the future, Thiel said.</p><p>\"'Make America Great Again' is offensive to Silicon Valley because you're telling it that the country is not progressing,\" he argued.</p><p>\"There is something to all three views,\" Thiel added. \"But the stagnation issue is one we don't think about enough in Silicon Valley. We tend to have this debate between inequality and innovation.\"</p><p>You don't have to go far to see the stagnation that fueled Trump's election, either, Thiel argued.</p><p>\"It's amazing that we have this amazing tech thing going on in Silicon Valley but if you go just East across the Bay Bridge or the Dumbarton Bridge you are in this failing state,\" he argued. \"In the next recession, California will probably go broke.\"</p><p>Hoffman said the growing distrust and rejection of tech reminds him of a Monty Python sketch from the movie, \"Life of Brian.\"</p><p>\"They ask the Romans, 'What have you ever done for us?\" and the answer is aqueducts, sanitation, roads...and they say but what have you done for us lately?\" he said. Tech has produced, search, maps and lots of entertainment, but is increasingly seen as the enemy.</p><p>Thiel said a big reason for that is that Silicon Valley has been been almost uniformly dominated by liberal politics and a blind belief in the tech establishment's vision of future progress.</p><p>Hoffman worried that if Republicans start targeting Silicon Valley tech companies with new regulations, it could backfire. \"The 'America First' people could produce an 'America Last' policy if that happens,\" he warned.</p><p>Thiel acknowledged that there is danger that Trump and his loyalists in the GOP could go too far.</p><p>\"There are a lot of ways that the Trump administration could get things wrong,\" he said. \"There's a lot that is very broken in Washington, D.C., generally. But I would say that there are some very real problems that Trump has pointed to that need to be taken more seriously.\"</p><p>Hoffman argued that technology can't be rolled back and must continue to move forward.</p><p>\"Some people say the solution to the problem is that we should roll back to a time when the tech and Internet wasn't so powerful,\" he said. \"I think we should roll forward and figure out what to do about the problem. When we got PayPal to a certain size we had to start thinking about how there were now criminals using it and we had to figure out how to build against that.\"</p><p>Thiel countered by saying that there are new technologies that may overtake that view, like cryptocurrencies, which are very decentralized. A lot of the ideas being floated to improve detection of fake news, identity theft and other ills of tech involve artificial intelligence, which is highly centralized, he said.</p><p>\"Crypto is libertarian. AI is communist,\" Thiel, whose Founders Fund has invested in cryptocurrencies, quipped. \"AI is about Big Data and big governments controlling all the data and knowing more about you than you know about yourself. The Chinese communist party loves AI and hates crypto, so the analogy fits pretty closely on that level.\"</p><p>Both Thiel and Hoffman agreed that China's centralized approach to technology, favoring a few monopolies and making it hard for innovators from other countries to compete, has created potential major rivals to Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"I think Alibaba and Tencent, in particular, will try to expand outside of China in a very aggressive way and Silicon Valley has been fairly myopic about that,\" Thiel warned.</p><p>The question of when the Chinese economy might overtake the United States was big between 2005 and 2007 but has receded since, he said.</p><p>\"On a purchasing power basis, China has already overtaken us,\" Thiel said. \"On gross domestic product, it will probably happen by 2030. If you average purchasing power vs. GDP, which I think is a better measure, it will happen by 2020, just a few years away.\"</p><p>Hoffman, however, said that Silicon Valley isn't blind to China's rising power as a tech rival.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley is quite aware that in the technological future, the rival that is most significant is China,\" he said. \"Tech leaders worry about not being able to play in China and companies there getting more support from the government than we do here. There is a city in China that is graduating a million engineers every year, which is why the Valley is an advocate of high-level immigration.'</p><p>\"If you go to every medium to large tech company in Silicon Valley, they are thinking about what the possibilities of doing business in China are and what competition with China would look like,\" he said. \"We now have startups here that are copies of things being done in China.\"</p><p>Thiel and Hoffman have been debating tech, politics and many other topics for decades, going back to their days as classmates at Stanford and members of the management team when PayPal was founded. But they remain good friends.</p><p>That prompted one of the most interesting questions of the evening: If they hadn't met at Stanford in the 1980s, would they have become friends in today's polarized political world?</p><p>The longtime sparring partners seemed to think they might have, although Thiel called it an \"insane counterfactual question.\"</p><p>\"There is a tendency for us to reduce the other side to a caricature of itself. We make a straw man and pick at the weakest point,\" Thiel said earlier in the night. \"We should find ways to \"steel man\" the arguments. We should take the arguments of our opponents and make the strongest construction possible in order to understand them as well as we possibly can.\"</p><p>He even allowed that the populism of Trump may be a passing political movement.</p><p>\"The left will be able to win again at some point but it has to be from a steel man approach,\" he said. \"It needs to understand what it is that makes 'Make America Great Again' a powerful argument for people facing stagnation. It has to have more arguments than just telling Trump voters to hurry up and die.\"</p><p>Hoffman disagreed, accusing his old friend in that last assertion of making the same sort of straw man argument he is critical of. He said there needs to be more friendly debates like he and Thiel have been having for about 30 years.</p><p>\"Broadening your thinking is very important,\"\u00a0Hoffman said. \"What are the ways to try to get to the better version of ourselves, what is the way that we can evolve our humanity, is essentially a lot of the arguments we had.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Sending cryptocurrency to other people often involves scanning QR codes or entering long digital wallet addresses.</p><p>Argent's app strips this out and instead lets consumers send digital coins quickly like a regular bank transfer. Co-founder Itamar Lesuisse said the company was also looking at cryptocurrency savings products.</p><p>It will do this by linking its app to other cryptocurrency companies using so-called decentralised applications, which are using blockchain technology.</p><p>A blockchain is distributed ledger technology, effectively a record of all transactions that is held independently of Argent. \"The logic is on Ethereum.

It risks undermining competition and U.S. business interests in Europe's giant digital market; Europe's business-to-consumer e-commerce sales alone are climbing past $850 billion this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital business models such as social media platforms, ridesharing apps, and e-commerce marketplaces that enable millions of individuals and firms to interact with each other have given rise to arguments that platforms become \"winner-take-all\" businesses that create network effects that entice more and more users to join a single service that then gobbles up potential competitors before they turn into threats.</p><p>Several European Commission officials have for years espoused these views, and also acted on them, to the detriment of European consumers and businesses as well as those in the United States. For example, in July 2018, the European Union fined Google $5 billion for equipping Android smartphones with Google products even if Google did not prevent European consumers from deleting these products or downloading their favorite apps on their phones. The Commission has pursued a number of billion dollar cases against U.S. companies like Amazon and Google for such supposed \"self-preferencing\" even if it expands consumer choice; in June 2020, the Commission opened an investigation into whether Apple treated rivals like Europe's music streaming service Spotify unfairly in its app store.</p><p>The Commission's antitrust hawks have time and again investigated U.S. companies' M&amp;A activity. Even though it has approved such high-profile acquisitions like Facebook and WhatsApp and Instagram, Microsoft and LinkedIn, and Apple and the song-recognition app Shazam, there is concern, including in Europe, that the Commission may be overreaching and thereby undermining European companies' ability to attain the kind of scale that would level the playing field with Chinese firms. In 2019, for example, the Commission blocked a merger between Siemens and Alstom that would have helped Europe compete more successfully against the state-owned CRRC.</p><p>Now Europe's antitrust policymaking is heating up further, especially for big tech. In June, Margarethe Vestager, executive vice president for the European Commission's \"A Europe Fit for the Digital Age\" initiative and the commissioner who has led antitrust enforcement, signaled she is seeking broader antitrust powers to address \"structural competition problems\" within industries rather than individual cases against a single company. The Commission is also seeking regulations to tackle potentially anticompetitive practices by dominant digital platforms prior to the anticompetitive impact coming into sight (ex-ante), arguing ex-post investigations come too late, allowing big tech to grow bigger while investigations drag on.</p><p>Behind these maneuvers are France and Germany and their allies Italy, Austria, Poland, and Spain, the leading advocates of tougher competition policy enforcement on big tech. In 2018, German experts drew up Competition Law 4.0 that calls for \"contestability of positions of power in the digital economy.\" German authorities are also considering enabling regulators to pause certain business practices at the tech companies during an antitrust investigation. Benelux competition authorities have also lobbied for ex-ante remedies, and even the United Kingdom, Europe's tech power, now that it is leaving the European Union, is rethinking competition policy and has drawn up a law to force Facebook to interoperate better with rival social networks. At the same time, disappointed by the Commission's Alstom decision, Germany and France drew up a joint manifesto outlining industrial policies and merger rules to produce \"European Champions.\" In other words, it seems big is fine if big is European. This protectionist-sounding maneuvering is raising concerns among the more liberal Digital 9 (D9) coalition of Northern European, digitally advanced nations like Sweden and Estonia about the politicization of competition policy enforcement in Europe.</p><p>Europe's actions are in part continuation of a long history of cases where enforcers and courts applied an array of arguments and benchmarks positing that certain specified behavior is anticompetitive. Europe, just like the United States, fears unbridled expansion of Chinese state-sponsored businesses and penetration of critical infrastructures like 5G networks, and its measures are also a defensive reaction. But Europe has also failed to seize on the various technology waves that brought us smartphones, cloud computing, search, and social media, and it sorely lacks the kind of market-leading platforms the United States and China have produced, such as Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Alibaba, and WeChat. The only comparable, albeit smaller, tech firms in Europe are Germany's SAP, the Netherlands' Adyen, and Sweden's Spotify that have barely 3 percent of the market cap of major tech platforms, compared to 68 percent held by U.S. companies. Europe's digital regulations and antitrust policies do nothing to close this gap.</p><p>The Commission's interventionist approach, industry fairly contends, penalizes success in the marketplace and contrasts with U.S. courts and antitrust enforcers who have largely accepted market leadership and consumer loyalty earned through hard competition and risky investments. For U.S. enforcers, protecting consumer welfare and innovation rather than protecting potential competitors has been the North Star.</p><p>In both Europe and the United States, academic communities are split into the \"big-is-beautiful\" camp, which thinks big companies create efficiency gains that enhance consumer welfare, and the more populist \"deconcentrationist\" camp that inherently eyes big tech with suspicion. A third way seems elusive--especially as both camps like to think their position is one that maximizes yet another desirable of antitrust policy: innovation. Decades of academic literature on the question conclude \"it depends\" on how innovation and competition are defined--but that typically innovation is maximized somewhere between the extremes of fierce competition among small firm and a monopoly. While hugely popular, the notion that digital businesses are monopoly-in-waiting \"winner-take-alls\" with durable networks and deep moats enabled by proprietary data is suspect and contested in academic literature.</p><p>For U.S. businesses, the problem of Europe's hardening stance on antitrust has hard and immediate impacts. The fines are significant, and the barrage of investigations, even if resulting in a favorable outcome, are time-consuming and costly and cause reputational damage and uncertainties that deter new investments. Being under European antitrust chiefs' microscopes risks making some of the boldest and most innovative companies on the planet tiptoe. How should U.S. policymakers respond to Europe's proposals, what should be the objective of our policy, and how do we best attain it? The next blog will discuss.</p><p>[Category: Political]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7229618 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7229618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TF-MFB1-DYG2-R48H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1240\"/><timeReceived>7:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

So it may seem surprising that Rice never had a chief information officer until Klara Jelinkova signed on in 2015. A native of the Czech Republic - at the time of her girlhood known as Czechoslovakia - she learned programming on computers her mother smuggled into the country. She's worked most of her adult life at various U.S. universities, including a stint as the CIO at the University of Chicago, from which she was recruited by Rice President David Leebron to come to Houston. At Rice, Jelinkova faces the daunting task of managing a diverse and complex technological ecosystem populated by many different types of users. Making sure those networks are safe and running well is a massive job, and one that's at the forefront of today's biggest computing challenges. </p><p>Jelinkova sat down with Texas Inc. to talk about her inspiration, her career and the challenges of serving multiple constituencies when it comes to security, privacy and identity. Q: How did you initially get into technology and come to where you are now? A: I got into technology when I was quite young. My mom was one of the tech pioneers in the Czech Republic. Back then it was Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. You're talking about late '60s, early '70s, so this is before computer science was really even taught. My mom has a Ph.D. in math and physics, and a post-doc as well. When I was little, my mom really believed that women have to go into science and technology, so as a little kid I learned how to program with my mom. And in order to do that, my mom smuggled a Commodore 64 from West Germany into the Czech Republic, so that was quite an achievement. Q: How was your mother a pioneer? A: For the longest time, she was basically the only woman in her area. She worked on some of the first Russian mainframes, similar to the IBM mainframes. She really worked more in COBOL. You know, it's kind of funny, my mother retired, but for a while, in her 60s and 70s, she was still writing little COBOL programs for a company as a gig. I think for her, and I think for me too, technology is just kind of a creative endeavor. And I think that's what I inherited from her - the passion for it. Q: How did you get to the U.S.? A: I went to school at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I first worked for private companies and then I went back to work Wisconsin Madison in the IT department and I have been at universities ever since. Q: The private company was pretty famous for its time, Harvard Graphics. What did you do? A: I was the support specialist for Harvard Graphics just as it was going out of business, so it wasn't a very good role. But I have to tell you, I think it's a great when, early in your career, you work for a company that went out of business. It teaches you a lot. In your 20s, you are pretty naive - everybody else is reading the tea leaves and you're not. And through that experience you get better at reading the tea leaves. Q: Your title at Rice includes \"vice president for international operations and IT.\" What does the \"international operations\" part entail? A: When you're thinking about technology, it really enables people to go global, without necessarily a physical presence. That's one of the fundamental parts of the internet: You can be global even though you are based in a certain country. In the international operation side I primarily worry about more operational issues like General Data Protection Regulation (a European Union privacy law), compliance questions, security questions, those types of things. Q: Why is one person doing those two jobs? A: Rice is committed to spending as much money as we can on instruction and research, and administrative overhead is really secondary. So, if you have someone who can do two jobs, why not have them do it? It's actually part of the reason why I was interested in coming here because you get to do a lot of different things. Q: How did you end up at Rice? A: I'm on the board of a nonprofit called Internet2 . David Leebron was also on the board, and when Rice opened this role and decided that instead of having technology report to different people, they wanted one CIO. He asked me to apply for the position. And you know I really came here to follow David. Q: You're the first CIO at Rice. When you came in you essentially had to build your job. How did that work? A: One of the things to figure out when you're building your job is that Job One is to find an assistant! Up until this point, I have always followed somebody (who had the job before me). So you come into a job and you kind of get on a conveyor belt, and all of your meetings are set even before you get there. What really attracted me to this job was being able to chart your own path, which was something that Rice was very clear on. And it wanted technology to have a seat at the table. Q: What are some of the biggest challenges that you face on a campus this big, this diverse? What are some of the biggest challenges you see? A: By nature we have multiple generations at Rice. We have a faculty with some in their 80s. We have people that are coming in that are 17 and 18 years old. We need to have technology solutions that meet both of their needs. You have an environment where people move at different speeds, have really different expectations as far as engagement on social media and reading email. There's this whole thing where students don't read email anymore and yet here we send an email, because it's not right to text someone their financial information. Q: What about security challenges? A: Yes. I struggle with this question a lot. We have very permeable border, being open by design, and academia can be used as a vector (for cyberattacks). But I don't know that it's necessarily that much worse than, say, what the financial industry faces, or what the federal government faces, or what the defense industry faces. You just don't hear about it as frequently. I think in some ways we are all in this together. We have people who come here because they want to hear a concert at Shepherd School. Then we have students who actually come here to school and live here and then we have faculty and staff who are employees. They have different level of affiliation and we can dictate things to them to a lesser (or greater) extent. So you secure that space through the segmentation of the network - keeping people in different places and using firewalls. That's been part of our life for a long time. The criticism recently has been that we have been too lenient, too understanding. So we're still kind of working through that. Q: Do you agree with that? A: We are in the business of creation and preservation of knowledge and the dissemination of knowledge. Locking everything down and not letting information out is kind of antithetical to that, so there needs to be some level of a happy medium between those two approaches that we need to find. The FBI has been very helpful, and having that dialogue is actually helpful. Q: In an article for CIO Review, you wrote some interesting things about privacy and identity on campus, including this: \"Over time CIOs will need to become as knowledgeable about this complex topic as they currently are about the security topic.\" Can you expand on that? A: I was talking about privacy before GDPR, and before (the data scandals at) Facebook. My point was that we were so focused on securing the data that we were not really paying attention to how we were approaching privacy. This was three or four years ago. There's a fundamental shift we are going through right now. If you think five years ago, we thought of data as institutional data. Right now we are thinking about the data being about me or about you. You have some level of right to it and what happens to it. And that was the core piece of GDPR: You have the right to know how the data is used. That privacy concept is shifting our approach to security. We are no longer just putting a wall or a moat around the data. We need to be able to actually tell you how we used it. That's a very different construct. Q: So you were prescient. A: When I wrote it, you could see that something like that was going to happen, right? The whole idea that people are going to willingly give up information about them, you know maybe to get access to Facebook, maybe to get access to Google, that was not going to fly for terribly long. At some point governments are going to get involved. You have states in the United States that are actually enacting legislation. So let me flip that into how that relates to identity. Any time you go to college somewhere or you start working somewhere, they issue you an ID and you are born anew. There's no digital identity that you carry from place to place, so when somebody graduates from Rice they essentially leave our system. But then there's a completely different digital identity that their work creates for them and so, as we live more of our life in the digital space, you can see a situation where you may want to create a persistent digital identity that shows certain events in your life. Right now it's maybe a LinkedIn profile, but you can see this could potentially be an application for blockchain or another type of persistent credential. Q: There's a growing desire on the part of elected officials to either regulate tech or rein it in, or in some cases even break up big tech. Where do you stand on that, and how would it affect your job? A: Regulation of the tech companies is a very interesting topic because the whole set of lawsuits around Microsoft in the '90s. I don't know that antitrust, let's say, is really the way to regulate it, by breaking it up. I guess, in some ways technology is ultimately about consolidation. It's just going to re-form in some other way. So I am skeptical of that approach. But I think that when you have a natural monopoly, and I would argue that Google would be a natural monopoly, you really think about how to regulate how the natural monopoly operates until there is a real reason to break it up. The example usually that comes to mind is AT&amp;T. To make sure these natural monopolies are not abusing that to impede competition, which is a difficult case probably to make in the case of Google. Or that it's being abusive toward consumers and I think that's partly why you are seeing some of these privacy laws starting to come in. It's more about consumer protection than it is about necessarily being able to artificially introduce competition into something that lends itself to a natural monopoly. Q: So tech wants to scale, and there's benefit to that scale, and if you break it up you lose the scale and you lose the benefit? A: Yes, I think you do. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dwight.silverman@chron.com\">dwight.silverman@chron.com</email> twitter.com/dsilverman houstonchronicle.com/techburger</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN66606387</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0T-6RG1-DYRV-40G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.
